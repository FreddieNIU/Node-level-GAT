""What is very clear is the consumer is slowing and Disney (DIS) is exposed to that,"" Kirby tells Yahoo Finance Live. Kirby also points to the decline in the linear television business and the cash burn of Disney's streaming business as reasons to not own the stock. Kirby is also cautious on buy now, pay later business due to concerns about the low-end consumer.Kirby is more bullish on BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) and Charles Schwab (SCHW), a company he says can be ""resilient even as the economy slows.""Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: We are closing out a big week for the market and the economy, and we've seen data showing inflation is cooling. We kicked off second quarter earnings with some upbeat results from PepsiCo, Delta, and some of the big banks, but there's still a lot of uncertainty about whether the US is going to fall into a recession and the impact that could have on companies' future earnings. Well, here to help us navigate some of this uncertainty, some of his picks, and also some stocks to stay away from, we want to bring in Ben Kirby, Thornburg Investment Management co-head of investments.Ben, it's good to see you here. So let's start with one of your picks, and it goes along the theme with bank earnings today, but you're looking at a name, Charles Schwab, one of the banks that was caught up in the regional crisis that we saw play out earlier this year. Why are you seeing a buying opportunity?BEN KIRBY: Yeah, well, thanks. Great for having me on the show. So, look, I think the economy is slowing. So let's try to find some investments that can be resilient even as the economy slows, and we think we think Schwab is one of those. So Schwab is a very high quality, large cap blue chip company. Its compounded earnings at 15% a year for the last decade, but the stock is down 30% this year while the market is up 17%.Story continuesSo Schwab used to trade at a 20% premium to the market. Today it's a 20% discount to the market. We think that valuation will close over time. Schwab is not facing liquidity challenges, they're not facing solvency challenges, they have a near-term earnings headwind from higher rates. They're going to work through that and we think the premium will come back over time.SEANA SMITH: But what about the crisis of confidence, though? Because we know so much of what happened in what played out with the regional banks and even the larger names was because consumers didn't know what to think. They didn't know how confident they should be in their banks. Is there still some lingering risk from that line of thinking?BEN KIRBY: There's still lingering concern, and I think that's the opportunity. Schwab is in a totally different bucket than some of the banks that were really challenged. Schwab is continuing to get net new money inflows over this time period. We think that the bank is really not in any stress. They have liquidity, they're going to work their way through this, come out the other side a stronger company we think still with a very attractive growth profile.SEANA SMITH: And their executives, of course, have been extremely vocal just about their positioning amid all of that fear. All right, Ben, let's move on to your next pick and that is BioMarin Pharmaceutical, one of the mid-cap biotech companies. What's the bull case here?BEN KIRBY: It's another name that's been left behind in the year where, again, S&amp;P up 17, this name is down 17%. They just got approved for a really important drug called Roctavian, which is for hemophilia A, and it's going to significantly improve patients' quality of life. Instead of having to go to a treatment center on a regular basis, you can take Roctavian and you won't have to go there for four years. So it's going to significantly improve patients' quality of life.We think that peak sales for this drug are probably $1.1 billion or higher, and the stock's trading at about $85. We think that just on pure fundamentals alone, it's probably worth $120, maybe $130, and we think it's an attractive M&amp;A target, and in an M&amp;A scenario, it goes to $200. So we think maybe $10 of downside in the price, and more than $100 in upside if things play out over the next 6 to 12 months.SEANA SMITH: All right, Ben, let's flip over to stocks that you're saying to avoid, and your first pick is a name that has certainly generated a number of headlines over the last couple of days, and that's Disney. We know CEO Bob Iger is going to stay on two more year-- two years longer than initially he committed to. He also made some comments just about the strategy for Disney here going forward. Why aren't you too confident that he's going to right the ship quickly?BEN KIRBY: You know, Bob Iger is a great CEO, and the fact is Disney has great content, they have great brands. It's a great company. The problem is they have a lot of challenges facing them right now and it's just going to take a while to turn it around. I mean, what's very clear again is the consumer is slowing, and Disney is exposed to that. We see parks visitation is down significantly in the current year. We've seen the reporting on that. So a cyclical component.They're also facing structural pressures from the decline of linear TV that's impacting even ESPN as well as some of their other assets, and the direct to consumer business, the streaming business, is burning cash, and we think that they can maybe make-- break even in a year or two, but the fact is it's not a great business. It's burning a lot of cash.So we just kind of put it all together. Strengths aside, there are social pressures, there are secular pressures. We think there's going to be better places to invest and kind of sidestep the slowing economy that Disney is going to get hit by.SEANA SMITH: Ben, speaking of the slowing economy, your next player that you're saying to avoid, or really a sector here at this point or a group of stocks I should say is the buy now, pay later space. How much weakness, how much more weakness are you expecting to see from the consumer?BEN KIRBY: Especially the low end consumer I think is most at risk. So high end consumers, if you look at excess savings and sort of net wealth accumulation from home prices going up, from the stock market going up, from bond yields falling a little bit, all of those indicate that the high end consumer is still in a pretty decent position.The low end consumer though, look, student loan payments are going to be coming back, stimulus is gone, and they've worked through all their excess savings, and they've had a lot of tailwinds in the last few years that are going to be reversing. So a strong job market has led to rising wages. That's going to be reversing, and so we think that as we slow, you're going to see layoffs, you're going to see wage growth slow, and that should lead to in a traditional cycle, and we think in this one as well, higher default rates among some of those lower income consumers. So it's a cycle, and we think that we're entering the slowdown phase, so stay away from those parts of the economy and those parts of the market that are going to be most exposed to it.SEANA SMITH: All right, Ben Kirby, great to get your picks. Two names to buy, two names to avoid here as we look ahead to the remaining of the year. Ben, thanks so much.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of innovative stocks and their need in today's world, and go directly to read 5 Best Innovative Stocks that Pay Dividends. Innovative stocks refer to companies that are at the forefront of technological advancements and disruptive innovations in their respective industries. These companies often introduce new products, services, or business models that have the potential to significantly impact the market and drive growth. According to a report by McKinsey &amp; Company, companies that effectively utilize innovation as a core component of their business strategy gain a significant competitive advantage compared to their counterparts. Research has shown that these companies not only outperform others but also generate economic profits that are 2.4 times higher. In other words, by mastering the art of innovation, companies can achieve greater financial success and outshine their competitors.In a rapidly evolving global landscape, countries and economies need to stay at the forefront of innovation to remain competitive. Through the development of new products, services, and technologies, innovative companies create jobs, stimulate investment, and contribute to overall economic progress. The US  is widely recognized for its remarkable ability to innovate and its entrepreneurial spirit. This commitment to innovation has been a key driver of America's economic dominance. Economists estimate that roughly half of the annual GDP growth in the United States can be attributed to advancements and increases in innovation, as reported by the US Chamber of Commerce Foundation.Also read: Most Innovative Companies in the WorldAs mentioned above, successful innovation drives significant growth in a business. One of the main aspects of innovation is research &amp; development (R&amp;D), which involves systematic and scientific exploration to develop new products, technologies, or processes. By investing in R&amp;D, companies can enhance their capabilities, explore new ideas, and uncover innovative solutions to meet customer needs. Over the years, global R&amp;D investments have grown across different sectors. McKinsey reported that in various industries, such as high-tech, automotive, and consumer goods, companies are allocating more than 20 percent of their earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) towards research focused on innovation.Story continuesResearch from National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) showed that R&amp;D activities conducted in the US amounted to a total of $717 billion in 2020. The report further mentioned that the growth of total R&amp;D in the US, when adjusted for inflation, averaged 4.1% per year from 2010 to 2020. In contrast, during the previous decade, the average annual growth of U.S. total R&amp;D was lower at 2.1%. Major companies like Apple Inc.

Bank of America (BAC), which has a big Wall Street operation, also reports Tuesday. All are expected to show drops in investment banking and trading from the first quarter.What Friday’s results showed is that big banks like JPMorgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) that have sprawling consumer franchises are performing well because they are able to charge more for their loans and benefit from a surge in credit-card borrowing by Americans who still have extra money.""The consumer is in good shape,"" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts. “They are spending down their excess cash.”But Friday also revealed that corporate clients are not providing as much of a lift, which is hurting the banks that rely more heavily on them.CEOs remain cautious about everything from the direction of interest rates to relations with China to the larger US economy, dampening the optimism needed to buy other companies, go public or take on more debt.Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)""Corporates are pretty cautious,"" Fraser told analysts Friday, citing the prospect of another Federal Reserve interest rate hike, tensions with China and concerns about limited economic growth.""I think clients have been trying to understand and get their arms around both the macro and the market outlook for a while. I think they now seem to accept the current environment is the new normal and are beginning to position themselves globally.""Story continuesThis caution was most evident in the performance of Citigroup’s corporate and investment banking unit, which helped push overall profits at the bank down 36%. Investment banking revenue fell by 24% in the second quarter, to $612 million.It wasn’t just Citigroup, though. Even JPMorgan, which churned out massive profits in its consumer business, saw investment banking fees fall by 6% from a year ago, to $1.5 billion.Trading, which was stronger earlier in the year, also turned weaker. Citigroup’s revenue from that business fell 13%. JPMorgan’s revenue associated with trading equities and fixed income also dropped.“Most of the investors stayed on the sidelines” during the second quarter, Fraser said.Solomon under scrutinyThese results do not bode well for Goldman or Morgan Stanley, which rely heavily on deal making and trading for their revenue.Goldman is expected to show an investment banking revenue decline of 32% from a year ago and a trading decline of 17%, according to analyst estimates.That could intensify the scrutiny of CEO David Solomon, who is wrestling with partner unrest and concerns about strategy as he tries to put a consumer-banking experiment behind the company.David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs. (Photo by Patrick T. FALLON / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images)Goldman is ""indicating that the second quarter might be ‘throw the kitchen sink in’ with larger write offs of some of these non-core businesses,"" Ken Leon, CFRA research director of equity research, told Yahoo Finance Friday.Thus there will be a focus on Solomon and ""whether he can show the strategy they have is going to work,"" Leon said. ""It is going to be a tough issue"" for the CEO.Morgan Stanley is also expected by analysts to show a decline in some of its core businesses, with a 4% drop in investment banking and a 19% decline in trading.'We will see'The global slowdown in dealmaking began last year, following a boom in 2021, causing firms across Wall Street to slash bonuses and staff. Worldwide investment banking revenues for the second quarter fell 52% from a year ago, according to Dealogic.Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Goldman and other firms with big investment banking and trading units have made or announced cuts of roughly 12,000 jobs since the end of 2022.Some observers are still predicting “green shoots” ahead, citing an improvement during the latter half of the second quarter.JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum said investment banking was better than expected in June, but cautioned analysts on Friday that it was “too early” to label it a trend.“We will see,” he said. For overall capital markets ""July should be a good indicator for the remainder of the year.""Smaller banks in the weeks ahead could also show new challenges posed by the behavior of corporate clients.That's what happened Friday to State Street (STT), which serves a lot of institutional clients and was the nation's 12th largest bank as of March 31. It disclosed Friday that its net interest income, which measures the difference between what it earns from loans and pays out in deposits, fell 10% when compared to the first quarter.That's largely because of rising deposit rates and a rotation by State Street customers out of non-interest bearing deposits as they seek higher yields. The bank now expects net interest income to drop 12% to 18% in the coming quarter.Its stock dropped 12% Friday.""What we found is that our larger clients, and we primarily have large, sophisticated clients, are quite active in thinking about their alternatives,” said Eric Aboaf, State Street CFO. “That has been accelerated by the swiftness of this cycle and the place that we've come to and the speed.”Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Now let me turn it over to Ron.Story continuesRonald Philip O’HanleyThank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we released our second quarter financial results. Relative to the significant volatility experienced by investors in the first quarter, market conditions in 2Q were more subdued, and global financial market performance was varied. Global equities generated positive returns for the third consecutive quarter as investors saw continued strength in developed equity markets but weakness in emerging markets. Fixed income markets fell as investors had to contend with still elevated levels of inflation and further Central Bank rate hikes including the Federal Reserve raising interest rates above 5% for the first time since 2007. The second quarter was also characterized by falling currency market volatility, which created headwinds for our foreign exchange business. Turning to Slide 3 of our investor presentation. I will review our second quarter highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail. Beginning with our financial performance. Second quarter ROE was 13% and pretax margin expanded by 1.2 percentage points year-over-year to 29.5%. Relative to the year ago period, 2Q EPS increased by 14% to $2.17 supported by our common share repurchases, significantly higher NII, strong front office software and data revenue growth and an increase in securities finance revenue. Our results also benefited from the release of an allowance related to the support of a financial -- U.S. financial institution as well as an accounting adoption. Taken together, these factors more than offset headwinds in some of our other fee-based businesses and the impact of higher-than-desired year-over-year expense growth. Turning to our business momentum. In Q1, I highlighted that by strengthening our implementation capabilities, we had line of sight into a meaningful amount of client onboarding this year. We began to realize the benefits of this plan and onboarded $1.2 trillion of AUC/A during the second quarter, primarily driven by State Street Alpha, underscoring the power of the alpha value proposition to our investment services strategy and long-term growth. As a result, our AUC/A installation backlog declined to $2.4 trillion while total AUC/A increased by 5% quarter-over-quarter to $39.6 trillion, both at quarter end, in part as a result of this new business. We also recorded over $140 billion of asset servicing wins in the second quarter, largely driven by strong sales in the desirable Asset Owner, Official Institutions and Alternatives client segments. Our sales pipeline grew and we expect substantial onboardings in the coming quarters. We continue to advance and broaden our enterprise outsourced solutions strategy across our clients' front, middle and back office activities, as demonstrated by the expansion of Alpha's capabilities to ETFs which we announced in 2Q. For the past 30 years, State Street has continuously innovated to support what has become a $10 trillion ETF market. Today, State Street is the largest ETF administrator in the world, with more than 2,700 ETF serviced in 13 countries. That long cycle of innovation continues as State Street Alpha now supports the entire ETF life cycle.By integrating CRD's front office products with State Street's industry-leading ETF servicing capabilities, Alpha now provides a centralized platform for ETF issuers across the entire ETF life cycle, including portfolio management, trading and compliance to enable a growth across a variety of ETF strategies and increased speed to market. Turning to front office software and data business. Our overall CRD pipeline is strong. In the second quarter, we converted a meaningful number of on-prem CRD clients to recurring SaaS revenue, which when coupled with new SaaS client implementations, increased annual recurring revenue by 12% relative to the year ago period. In addition, Charles River Wealth Management solution continues to resonate with clients and drove a significant increase in on-prem revenues this quarter. Year-to-date, CRD's wealth-driven revenue has more than doubled as compared to the first half of 2022, and we remain on track to grow CRD's wealth revenue this year. The State Street Global Advisors quarter-end assets under management totaled $3.8 trillion, supported by higher period end market levels and $38 billion of net inflows from all 3 business lines: ETF, Cash and Institutional. Our SPDR ETF business gathered $27 billion of net inflows in the second quarter, including $20 billion of net inflows into SPY, the industry's largest ETF. We also delivered a solid performance in our U.S. low-cost ETF segment, which gathered $7 billion of net inflows in the quarter, continuing to gain market share. Our cash business gathered a solid $10 billion of net inflows in the second quarter as our U.S. government money market funds benefited from the attractiveness of the cash asset class in the higher rate environment. Turning to our financial condition. State Street's balance sheet, liquidity and capital positions remain strong. Our CET1 ratio was a strong 11.8% at quarter end, well above our regulatory minimum. The ongoing capital generation of our business, coupled with effective balance sheet management and our strong capital position has enabled us to deliver against our goal of returning significant capital to our shareholders. In 2Q, we returned approximately $1.3 billion of capital, buying back more than $1 billion of our common shares and declaring over $200 million of common stock dividends. This means that cumulatively over the last 3 quarters to the end of June, we have returned approximately $4.4 billion of capital to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and common stock dividends. The strength of our balance sheet was also highlighted with the release of the Federal Reserve's annual CCAR stress test results in June, following which we announced our intention for the third year in a row, to increase State Street's common stock dividend by 10% in the third quarter, subject to consideration and approval by our Board of Directors. It remains our intention to continue common share repurchases under our existing authorization, for up to $4.5 billion in 2023, subject to market conditions and other factors. To conclude, financial market conditions in the second quarter were mixed. Although global equities recorded another sequential quarter of growth, there was weakness in emerging markets, and we witnessed the negative impact of persistent inflation and further Central Bank rate hikes on fixed income markets. Meanwhile, both equity and currency volatility continued to decline. Despite this varied backdrop, we achieved a number of positive outcomes in the second quarter, including meaningfully reducing our asset servicing backlog and further developing our Alpha capabilities, continuing to record new asset servicing wins, driving strong growth in front office software and data revenue and gathering solid net inflows to Global Advisors. And while we reached double-digit year-over-year EPS growth supported by our capital management and the higher interest rate environment, our results were below our potential. First, while we achieved sequential fee revenue growth in areas of our business this quarter, we need to demonstrate the fee growth every quarter, especially as NII. We need to demonstrate that fee growth every quarter, especially as NII is no longer a tailwind. And second, we are highly focused on controlling our expense base. We have a well-established track record of reengineering our processes and transforming our operations in order to improve our efficiency and realize productivity growth. We plan to utilize additional tactical expense levers at our disposal in addition to our ongoing structural productivity efforts in order to support our financial performance for the benefit of our shareholders. Now let me hand the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail.Eric Walter AboafThank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my review of our second quarter results on Slide 4. We reported EPS of $2.17 for the quarter, an increase of 14% relative to the second quarter a year ago. As you can see on the left panel of the slide, revenue grew by 5% year-on-year, driven by the expansion in our front office solutions area, where we are an industry leader, continued momentum in the securities finance business as well as strong growth in net interest income. This growth enabled us to offset some of the headwinds we saw in other fee areas given the relatively mixed macroeconomic backdrop. We also had the benefit of an accounting change for tax credit investments, which simplifies our reporting going forward. While our overall year-on-year fee growth was less than we would have liked to deliver, we did see sequential quarter revenue momentum and a step-up in the sales pipeline, which we expect to build upon in the coming quarters and which I'll discuss later in today's presentation. As we drive growth, we continue to prudently invest in the business while remaining focused on managing costs given the current operating environment, and we stand ready to further intervene on expenses should the softness in the global environment persists. Turning now to Slide 5. We saw period-end AUC/A increased by 4% on a year-on-year basis and 5% sequentially. Year-on-year, the increase in AUC/A was largely driven by higher period end equity market levels and client net inflows. Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A increased as a result of the significant trillion-dollar Alpha installation and a higher period end market levels. At Global Advisors, we saw similar positive dynamics play out in the quarter. Period-end AUM increased 9% year-on-year and 5% sequentially. The year-on-year increase in AUM was largely driven by higher period end market levels. Quarter-on-quarter, the increase in AUM was also due to higher period end market levels as well as strong sequential net inflows. Turning to Slide 6. On the left side of the page, you'll see second quarter total servicing fees down 3% year-on-year as net new business in the quarter was more than offset by lower client activity and adjustments largely due to lower custody and transaction volume and better than usual pricing headwinds. Positive year-on-year equity markets were offset by the negative impact of fixed income markets. Sequentially, total servicing fees were up 3%, primarily as a result of higher average market levels and net new business, slightly offset by better-than-usual pricing headwinds this quarter. We had a more constructive market environment relative to the first quarter as well as a significant onboarding of $1.2 trillion of AUC/A related to an Alpha client in the Asset Manager Client segment which comes at a modest fee rate, but with services that are expected to be added in the coming years. Within the servicing fees, back-office servicing fees were generally consistent with total servicing fees and largely driven by the factors I just described. Middle office services performance was meaningfully more positive for the quarter. On a year-on-year basis, fees were up 3%, primarily reflecting net new business and up 10% sequentially, largely driven by the installation that I just mentioned. On the bottom panel of this page, we've again included some sales performance indicators which highlight the business momentum we saw in the quarter. While total AUC/A wins in the second quarter were not as robust in volume terms, client engagement remained healthy and we saw wins across strategic segments, including Mandates and Asset Owners, Official Institutions and Alternatives, which are key growth areas for us as we've previously mentioned. The wins, including those in the alternative segment, which are more complex to service come with above average fee rates. We have also seen a healthy uptick in our pipeline this quarter. Turning to Slide 7. Second quarter management fees were $461 million, down 6% year-on-year, primarily reflecting the impact of net outflows from prior periods, a shift of certain management fees into NII as previously described, and some pricing headwinds, partially offset by higher average market levels. Quarter-on-quarter, management fees were up 1% as a result of higher market levels and cash net inflows. As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, our investment management franchise remains well positioned with very strong and broad-based business momentum across each of our 3 lines of business. In ETFs, we saw very strong net inflows of $27 billion into SPY in our sector suite of ETFs as well as our SPDR portfolio low-cost suite. In our institutional business, we saw net inflows with continued momentum in our well-established index fixed income and defined contribution franchises. Across our cash franchise, we continue to see strong demand for our Money Market funds. We recorded net inflows of $10 billion. Turning to Slide 8. Relative to the period a year ago, second quarter FX trading services revenue was down 8% year-on-year and 11% sequentially, primarily reflecting lower client FX volumes and lower industry FX volatility. Relative to the period a year ago, both volumes and volatility were more muted as the start of war in Europe last year caused unusually high FX trading activity in the first half of 2022. Many clients were also risk off during the debt ceiling discussions in April and May with a rebound in June in client volumes following its resolution. Altogether, 2Q is muted, we are optimistic about 3Q, but it's hard to predict. Securities finance performed well in the second quarter with revenues up 9% year-on-year, driven by higher agency spreads. Sequentially, revenues were up 7%, again mainly driven by higher agency spreads as well as higher prime services or enhanced custody revenues from deeper client engagement and special activity, partially offset by lower balances. Moving on to software and processing fees. Second quarter software and processing fees were up 18% year-on-year and 34% sequentially, primarily driven by higher front office software and data revenue associated with CRD, which I will turn to shortly. Lending fees for the quarter were down 5% year-on-year, primarily due to changes in product mix, but up 5% sequentially, mainly driven by strong client demand for line to credit. Finally, other fee revenue increased $101 million year-on-year, primarily due to a tax credit investment accounting change and the absence of negative market-related adjustments. This includes the impact of the new accounting adoption.Moving to Slide 9. You'll see on the left panel that front office software and data revenue increased 29% year-on-year primarily as a result of higher on-premise renewals and continued growth in our more durable software-enabled and professional services revenue as we continue to convert and implement more clients over to our SaaS environment. About 60% of our clients are now on our SaaS platform. Sequentially, front office software and data revenue was up nearly 50%. About 2/3 of this uptick was driven by wealth management mandates that are becoming an increasingly important growth segment for us. Our sales pipeline continues to grow and remains strong for our Charles River Development front office solutions products. Turning to some of the other Alpha business metrics in the right panel, we were pleased we had 3 more Alpha mandates go live, which brings our total live Alpha clients to 15 and as I previously mentioned, we installed a significant portion of assets related to Alpha this quarter. We expect to provide more services related to these assets in the future, helping us increase the share of our clients' wallet. Now turning to Slide 10. Second quarter NII increased 18% year-on-year but declined 10% sequentially to $691 million. The year-on-year increase was largely due to higher short-term rates, an increase in long-term rates and proactive balance sheet positioning, partially offset by lower average deposits. Sequentially, the decline in NII performance was primarily driven by our continued rotation of noninterest-bearing deposit balances and rate pressure in the U.S. back book, partially offset by higher short-term market rates from international Central Bank hikes. On the right side of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the second quarter. Average deposits declined 2% quarter-on-quarter, in line with industry total deposit trends, which also fell by 2% in the second quarter and reflect client preferences to shift some cash to other products during periods of rising rates. Our operational deposits as a percentage of total deposits remained consistent at approximately 75%. Our global floating rate loan book provides upside at this stage in the cycle, and our investment portfolio positioning provides a tailwind as long rates roll through. We now also have the opportunity to selectively add some duration across the curve as we see good entry points which could enhance NII over time. Sequentially, U.S. dollar client deposit betas were 100% during the second quarter, leading again to some sequential NII compression. We are now at the point in the U.S. rate cycle where we expect to adjust back book pricing to accommodate our larger clients, but to do so in a disciplined manner and usually as part of a broader relationship discussion of balance and trade for fee opportunities. Foreign currency deposit betas for the quarter continued to be much lower in the 45% to 50% range. We've also included a new slide in the appendix Page 16 that shows our NII trends over the past few rate cycles. I think it will be -- it will put the larger NII increases and decreases in context, which are driven by many factors, including changes in interest rates, the pacing of hikes, deposit levels and mix, Fed balance sheet changes as well as equity markets. You can see from that page that our recent quarters have come with a much higher than usual level of NII, and we are now normalizing to a more typical level of NII that is inherent in our business activities.Turning to Slide 11. Second quarter expenses, excluding notable items, increased 6% year-on-year. Sequentially, excluding seasonal expenses, second quarter expenses increased just over 1% as we actively manage expenses and continued our productivity and optimization savings efforts, all while carefully investing in strategic elements of the company including Alpha, private markets, technology and operations, automation. On a line-by-line basis, year-on-year, compensation employee benefits increased 7%, primarily driven by salary increases associated with wage inflation and higher headcount attributable primarily to operational staff for growth areas, technology staff, insourcing and some lower attrition -- lower-than-expected attrition rates. Sequentially, however, we have managed headcount to be flat. Information Systems and Communications expenses increased 3%, mainly due to higher technology and infrastructure investments partially offset by benefits from ongoing optimization efforts, insourcing and credits related to vendor savings initiatives. Transaction processing decreased 2%, mainly reflecting lower sub-custody costs from vendor credits. Occupancy increased 7% as we relocated our headquarters building, temporarily resulting in overlapping costs and other expenses were up 7%, mainly reflecting higher professional fees. Moving to Slide 12. On the left side of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios followed by our capital trends on the right side of the slide. As you can see, we continue to navigate our operating environment with very strong capital levels, which remain well above both our internal targets and the regulatory minimums. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 11.8% was down 30 basis points quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by the continuation of our share repurchases and modestly higher RWA, partially offset by retained earnings.Our LCR for State Street Corporation was flat quarter-on-quarter at 108% and decreased 4 percentage points quarter-on-quarter, but still quite high at 120% for State Street Bank and Trust. We're also very happy with our performance in this year's CCAR with a calculated risk capital buffer well above the 2.5% minimum, resulting in a continued preliminary SCB at the floor. This demonstrates we have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. In keeping with our results, in June, we announced a planned 10% increase for our 3Q '23 quarterly common stock dividend, subject to Board approval, and it remains our intention to continue common share repurchases under a current authorization of up to a total of $4.5 billion in 2023, subject to market conditions and other factors. We plan another $1 billion buyback in third quarter. Lastly, we are quite pleased to return roughly $1.3 billion to shareholders in the second quarter of '23, consisting of just over $1 billion of common share repurchases and over $200 million in common stock dividends.Turning to Slide 13, which provides a summary of our second quarter results. While there is certainly still work to do, we are pleased with the durability of our business this quarter against a mix and divergent backdrop. Robust expansion in our front office solutions area and continued momentum in securities finance as well as strong growth in net interest income enabled us to offset some of the headwinds we saw in the other fee areas, highlighting the resiliency of the franchise. Next, I'd like to provide our current thinking regarding our third quarter. At a macro level, while we know that rate expectations have been moving, our rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forwards, which suggests that the Fed, the ECB and the BOE will all continue to hike in 3Q to varying degrees.In terms of average equity markets, we currently expect U.S. equity markets to be up about 5% quarter-on-quarter as we are expecting equity markets to remain flat from now to quarter end and we expect international equity markets to be flattish on average.Regarding fee revenue in 3Q on a sequential quarter basis, we expect overall fee revenue to be down approximately 1% to 1.5% with servicing fees down 1% to 2% as the below average fee repricing headwinds we saw this past quarter is expected to normalize in 3Q. This will also include a revenue headwind from the previously disclosed client exit. We expect management fees to be up around 0.5% to 1.5%. We expect front office software and data quarter-on-quarter to be down 7%, as we do not expect the level of on-premise renewals in 3Q that we saw this quarter. We expect the other fee revenue line to come in around $30 million to $35 million in 3Q, which is higher than prior years, but down post the accounting change impact in 2Q. Regarding NII, after 3 double-digit sequential increases in NII last year, we now expect NII to decrease 12% to 18% on a sequential quarter basis, driven by lower deposit levels and continued rotation as rate hikes continue into 3Q. Our outlook assumes that average noninterest-bearing deposits declined by approximately $5 billion from 2Q to 3Q. As we look forward to 4Q, we do expect to see some moderation to the amount of deposit rotation as we work through most of our back book and most Central Banks begin to pause. With that context, we expect that 4Q NII decline to be much less, somewhere in the range of down 2% to 6% versus 3Q. And we expect NII to then stabilize around those levels, but it will depend on market conditions. And our expectation is that 4Q declines in noninterest-bearing deposits [will be smaller] as well, likely in the down $2 billion to $3 billion range versus 3Q.Turning to expenses, we remain focused on controlling costs in this environment, and we expect to take action in 3Q to bend the cost curve. As such, we expect that expenses will be down 0.5% to 1% on a sequential quarter basis and intend to continue to actively manage expenses. As always, this is on an ex notables basis, and we are keeping an eye on the FDIC assessment, which could be a 3Q notable item. And as I noted previously, given the accounting changes we adopted this quarter, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 21% and 22% for the third quarter. With that, let me hand the call back to Ron.Ronald Philip O’HanleyThanks, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS.Brennan HawkenEric, I'd like to sort of double click on some of the comments that you made about deposits. So you talked about back book pricing in the U.S. dollar book. Does that mean that we should be thinking about the potential for betas to exceed 100% here when that starts to work through? And what kind of magnitude do you think that could reach? And could you also help me understand the euro? Because when I look in the financial supplement and the breakout by currency, it looks like the euro deposit costs were up about low 40s bps quarter-over-quarter, which seems like a beta that's a good deal higher than the 50% you referenced. I know there's some swap noise. So maybe that's what it is. But could you maybe flesh that out a bit for me?Eric Walter AboafBrennan, sure. Let me start on the betas that we saw in particular in the U.S. book because we are at a period in the interest rate cycle where we've now had multiple 50 basis points moved. It's been a very strong signal to our clients that rates are much, much higher, much more quickly and much more visibly. And at the same time, they now have -- because of the highly inverted yield curve, they have real substitute alternatives that they used to not have in the past, whether it's treasuries, whether it's money market, whether it's repo, there's a range of what they can invest in.And what we found is that our larger clients, and we primarily have large, sophisticated clients, are quite active in thinking about their alternatives and that, that has been accelerated by the swiftness of this cycle and the place that we've come to and the speed. If we think about the U.S. deposit betas, they were in the 80% to 90% range the last couple of quarters. This quarter, we saw 100%. And yes, we expect next quarter we'll be well over 100%. And what's driving that is really a catch-up in the back book. We have clients coming to us as you'd expect, just like it happens with retail -- deposits for retail banks, but we have sophisticated large clients coming back and saying, look, some of our lower transactional rate levels or mid-tier rate levels are something that they'd like us to adjust.And in a way, what I think has played out is that while spreads widen for us on the deposit, but for some period of time, we're now seeing a convergence back to where they would have been. And that's coming through. And so what we have in the cycle is actually a number of quarters of below 100% beta, then we get to 100% beta. And then we are going to have a quarter where betas are well above that 100% level. And it's really a catch-up in the back book, and that's what's playing through. It is -- what is beginning to drive this higher reduction in NII this quarter, the 10% quarter-on-quarter that you saw, you saw in my outlook, we are expecting 12% to 18% production in NII this coming quarter. And if you peel that apart, some of that is the continued rotation out of noninterest-bearing, but some of it and a good part of it is this catch-up in the back book that's playing through.We do think that over time, we've seen the bulk of that and that, that will begin to moderate, and I'm certainly happy to go into that. And some of our perspectives as we drill down deeply into our areas. But that's the context.On your other question on euros, we should probably follow up. I think we see betas quarter-on-quarter of about 50%, but we probably just follow up offline because I think that's deep in the supplement and probably do that with you and the IR team.Brennan HawkenOkay. No problem. And then another question, just quickly on fee revenue. You flagged that the large client migration is going to be part of the outlook. Is the -- how much of that will be impacting the third quarter delta? And then how much will be -- how should we be thinking about the time frame for whatever is left and when that would end up playing out?Eric Walter AboafYes. I think the broader context, as you recall, Brennan, is that we disclosed that large client deconversion was going to happen over multiple years. We announced it well over a year ago. And we described it in our K at about 1.7% of fee revenue. So you can calculate that through. I think in our fourth quarter earnings call in January, I described that we had seen about $20 million on a run rate come out, but I'll -- I can reconfirm that. This -- in the next quarter -- this coming third quarter, we'll see about $20 million come out sequentially. And then in the fourth quarter, there's another piece of about another $15 million that will come out as well. And then after that, it's several more quarters before we see the later and final installments. But that's incorporated into our guide.OperatorYour next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.Alexander BlosteinSo just maybe staying on the deposit question for another minute. Why do you guys think this catch-up happening now sort of late in the cycle? We've obviously been in a higher rate environment for well over a year. So curious if you can provide more color on particular customer segments in the U.S. that's driving that and sort of the discussions around that? And then maybe as you sort of think about the end state for U.S. interest-bearing deposits, I think you're at 3.5 or so today. The cumulative beta on that is, I think, is around 70% relative to the Fed funds rate. Should we think of that approaching, I don't know, 85%, 90% kind of, how do you think about where that deposit price in the U.S. will stabilize?Eric Walter AboafAlex, it's a good question. I mean, we're clearly navigating and living through an interesting environment that we've not seen in 2 decades, right? You've got to go back pre-crisis before you see 5% prevailing rates. I think if you also think about how swiftly we've gotten to where we are, that's why we created -- we put some of this information back on Page 16 in our materials. You see this cycle has moved twice as far in terms of the uptick in rates in half the time of the last cycle. And so what plays out as that happens is that we always have clients that, as rates move up, they begin discussing with us and engaging with us on what would be appropriate, maybe putting in place multiple balance tiers, having discussions about their expectations, we negotiate and so forth. And you can imagine large client discussions occur over 3, 6, sometimes even 9-month periods.And so if you kind of turn back the clock and say, when did some of those discussions occur, some of the early ones may have started second quarter of last year, third quarter of last year, fourth quarter of last year because there was also a perspective among our clients and us for that matter, that rates might continue to 5%, but they might have gone to 4% or 3%, which would have put us and our clients in a different position from a NIM and NII and rate-setting perspective.So I think it's really the speed of this that has played out and on one hand. And on the other, the inverted yield curve gives clients and the prevalence of the money funds and treasuries and so forth, give clients an alternative, right, that's more vivid, I'd say, than in some of the past cycles. And so that's the kind of client behavior. What we have seen is that if you decompose our book, some of this activity is in the noninterest-bearing deposits, which have come down. And some of it is in the interest-bearing back book because some clients with noninterest-bearing deposits come to us and say, ""Look, can you make them now interest-bearing at a certain rate?"" And what we've seen is some real segmentation of that book. As an example, the average account in noninterest-bearing, there's about 30,000 accounts. The average account is barely over $1 million.What you can do in some of the analytic work we've done is separate out the higher balance noninterest-bearing clients and client accounts from lower balance ones. Not surprisingly, the higher balance accounts are down year-over-year in balance terms by 70%, right? The large number of smaller accounts are down by 15%. And so this is where what we're starting to work through with the, what I'll describe as the burn down. How much of the larger deposits and noninterest-bearing have migrated to interest-bearing, right, at what rate. And our perspective is that we are now working through, I'll describe as a catch-up on the back book. Some of that is noninterest-bearing deposits moving to interest-bearing and some of that is interest-bearing being priced up.And as we think about it, we think that the peak of that catch-up will play out in third quarter as we scan the deposit types, the larger, more sophisticated clients versus the smaller clients. And that's why we expect both the catch-up to continue into the third quarter and likely peak in the third quarter and then begin to moderate in the fourth quarter and to burn down.Alexander BlosteinGot it. And then like just the end game in terms of what you ultimately think U.S. deposit cost is going to look like relative to kind of the 3.5 and the Fed funds at 5?Eric Walter AboafI think it's -- I've not calculated it directly on a cost versus rate basis, on a NIM basis, but I guess we could back into it if it'd be helpful to you. As we think about the long range view of NII on our book, I've given some guidance for 3Q NII, for 4Q NII. I think our instinct is that NII will settle in this $550 million to $600 million range per quarter. And if it's helpful, we can try to calculate that back into spread on assets or a spread or a cost of funds on deposits and follow up with you.Alexander BlosteinI got you. That's helpful. And my bigger picture question for you guys and to Ron as well as I think you mentioned productivity efforts in light of the fact that NII has clearly become a bigger headwind over the next several quarters and you guided servicing fees down in the third quarter.So as you think about measuring those productivities, are you solving for overall pretax margin stability? Are you solving for kind of fee margin stability, sort of like Ex-NII? How should we think about sort of measuring the productivity efforts in light of a more challenging revenue backdrop?Ronald Philip O’HanleyYes. Alex, I mean, where we start with is -- I mean, because what you're describing is outcomes of the productivity efforts where we've -- and these are not new, these are ongoing. We really start with how do we create more scale in our business? How do we increase speed, lower error rates, increase client satisfaction, take out manual interventions.So the measures that we're using would be the traditional productivity measures, and this has been underway now for several years. You've been seeing the results in our -- and we've been able to manage costs certainly relative to others.But in terms of how we think about the business going forward, particularly given that NII is no longer a tailwind in terms of an outcome basis, we really think about the operating leverage, I think, is the key outcome we're managing to, if that's the question you're asking.OperatorYour next question comes from Rob Wildhack from Autonomous Research.Robert Henry WildhackJust trying to ask about the asset side and the securities book quickly. Decent uplift in yield again, plus 21 basis points. Can you give some color, some numbers around the front book, back book difference there? And how much repricing can sort of assist NII going forward?Eric Walter AboafRob, it's Eric. There is a good bit of tailwind that comes from the front book, back book. I think this -- on kind of year-on-year basis, long rates were quite constructive from a year-on-year NII standpoint, the long rate tailwind year-on-year was in the $100 million basis. So it's quite substantial.On a quarter-on-quarter, the long rate tailwind is closer to $15 million, $20 million. So it's not insubstantial. And I think as we see some steepness in the curve come back or I guess I'll describe less inversion, we've got some -- we've got abilities to [leg] into duration or curve position or, in some cases, some amount of convexity where we'd find it helpful.From a rate standpoint, like you said, average rates on the investment portfolio in aggregate was 270 basis points or so. The runoff is a good bit below that, kind of in the 180 basis point range, so 90 basis points, 100 basis points south of that. And the roll-on that occurs is well above that 270 basis point, average is closer to 410 basis points or more. So you've got a nice tailwind there that's playing through.We also have a tailwind on short rates for international currencies. So that's helpful. And then we are -- we continue to invest and think about opportunities across currency from a basis standpoint and so forth, and we've got some latitude to do that as well, given our global balance sheet.Robert Henry WildhackAnd then one more just on the operational deposits. If I use the numbers on Page 10, operational -- or excuse me, overall deposits are down -- operational deposits are down as a percentage of the mix. Conceptually, what would be driving that? I guess I'm confused as to why operational deposits would be down year-over-year more than non-operational deposits.Eric Walter AboafYes. I think there's a little bit of -- I look at that data, and I think you've got roughly similar movements in operational and non-operational deposits. I think what's happening in this part of the cycle is as deposits or I'll say, as cash for our clients is more valuable, right? They are selectively thinking about how much cash do I absolutely must keep in the -- in their custodial accounts. And if you think about it, they make that decision in, I think it's more than 100,000 different accounts themselves, right? It's a very large and disparate set of decisions and sub decisions by 100,000-plus fund managers and many, many fund boards.And so they're trying to see, hey, can I edge it down, and that's why at this point in the cycle, you see total deposits drift down, but also operational.What they end up needing to trade off and the reason why it will level off over time is that they need a certain amount of deposits that they don't overdraw. They -- fund managers really hate the overdraw at the end of day. And then there's also a governor where we engage with our clients on intraday and make sure that they have enough cash to cover their transactional flow and throughput, but we're just at the period where in the core custody accounts, you've got there's a drift downwards where they're trying to optimize without going too far, and that's what you're seeing.But this is expected. We expect the operational deposits to stay comfortably in this kind of 75% range. And it's a part of the kind of custodial operations, which is what makes them so sticky, right, because they need to be there for the very significant daily, hourly and minute-by-minute transactional flows that we are processing on their behalf so that they aren't overdrawn.OperatorYour next question comes from Glenn Schorr from Evercore.Glenn Paul SchorrMaybe just a different attempt at the deposit discussion. So I get clients wanting more yield. I bought treasurers too, we all did. But is there any point where the client profitability discussion has [teed]. Like are they able to move 100% of nonoperating deposits if they want, like what discussions you're having with them about doing more with State Street in areas like FX, sec lending, Alpha. But maybe you could update us on what you're doing to try to help impact what seems like you can't impact the deposit side. So is there anything else you can do?Eric Walter AboafYes. Let me start there, Glenn, and I think Ron will weigh in as well because a number of us have these engaging conversations with clients. I think from a burn down standpoint, let me first take it from that angle is if you think about our $200 billion of deposits, we've got deposits at a number of different price tiers and we have kind of very large sophisticated clients and then kind of that large tail of small and midsized clients. Of the $200 billion, we think there's about $50 billion that we've been very focused on and continue to be focused on.So about 1/4 of our total deposits are with these clients that as we've talked about the last couple of questions, there's been a real catch-up on the back book. I described that because of that $50 billion, which is either a very low price or 0 price for our larger and most sophisticated clients, where we have these engaging and balance of trade discussions, right? We've around -- we've got about $25 billion that's behind us, where largely we've repriced those deposits. We've had those discussions and some of those have come with some balance of trade improvements or some commitments on stability on fees, and those are behind us.Included in the outlook that I provide, beyond the $25 billion, there's another $15 billion that's underway right now. That's included in my third quarter outlook, right? So that gets us to $35 billion, almost $40 billion of the $50 billion. And then there's a trail that we'll still have. And so, I think from a client discussion and negotiation standpoint, the third quarter we expect to be the peak.I think what you'll find is that each of these questions on deposits, certainly, rates goes through a pricing committee from a balance sheet management standpoint. But very quickly, those go to the most senior client executives and all the way up to our C-suite because those are large. They're very large, and that's where we engage.And I think what you'll see over time is some of that we'll come back through in FX revenues and sec lending revenues and the absence of fee rate reductions in the future, right, on one hand. And on the other hand, some of what we do here is also work with clients on expanding the range of what we do for them when it comes to managing their cash, right?I think some of the reason you're seeing the uptick in cash with -- in our asset management business because some of those clients say, look, I'd like to be in a cash money market sweep until we've been doing that. You see our repo business continues to do very, very well, is actually an add to -- it's a stabilizer to NII or an add to NII on a year-on-year basis and stabilizing, and it's a stable source of NII income quarter-on-quarter because we've been able to shift some of the client cash to those areas. So there are some offsets as well there. But that's a bit of a start.Ronald Philip O’HanleyYes, Glenn, what I would add to what Eric said is that the -- if you think about over the last 4, 5 years, our focus on pricing has been -- initially was on fee pricing and kind of addressing, if not combating the fee compression and really working that in an institutional way and in a very high skilled way and escalating those -- or elevating those decisions way above where they used to be.Deposits for -- up until this rate cycle really weren't part of that because, I mean, there were times that we would just assume not have had the deposits. We've now integrated that as Eric has implied into that discussion, but also included a full share of wallet analysis. And the part of this is recognizing that these institutions are very large. And when you have a pricing discussion and putting that in air quotes, it really depends on what it is.And what we have worked to avoid is to not have a series of unilateral discussions without understanding and making sure that at the highest levels of our clients, they understand the impact of this. And just reminding them that you have the fee you have because of this assumption on other services that we're going to provide you or some assumption on deposits.And those conversations are actually starting to work well. It's caused a change of process for us, another change of process for us. But more importantly, it's changed in the way how we're engaging and at what level we're engaging with these clients. And so more to go there, but we also think it's a skill but now developed, will help us through various kinds of cycles going forward.OperatorYour next question comes from Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research.Hang LeungThis is actually Sharon Leung filling in for Steven. Just on the deposits, outside of the rotation out of NIB, can you talk about the overall trajectory of total deposits, particularly because it looks like more recent liquidity drawdown has come out of RRP instead of deposits.So, I just wanted to get your thoughts on the expectations for the trajectory on deposits from here in the context of QT treasury issuance, et cetera?Eric Walter AboafYes, it's Eric. It's hard to really gauge the deposit changes outright. I think we're a little more focused on the net interest -- I'm sorry, the noninterest-bearing deposits where we've signaled another $5 billion likely outflow this coming quarter. That's less of an outflow than in the second quarter. So you're starting to see some of the burn down that I've described.In the external environment, I think from the H.8 reports as banks, we've seen about a 2% sequential fall in deposits. For the trust banks, we tend to have more deposits coming in when deposits in the bank system increase, and we have somewhat more coming out when deposits of the bank system come out and partly just the absolute sophistication of our clients.So we're -- we expect a downtick in deposits again next quarter but have just been a little more focused on the noninterest-bearing because that's where it makes a big difference. I think there is always some movement in interest-bearing deposits, especially at the higher rate tier because what we're finding increasingly as we get to a little more of this -- as we expect to get to a time stabilization or at least a little more of a balance with our clients.Now what they're going to do is it's hard for them to move an underlying operating deposit that actually has to cover the hundreds, thousands, in some cases, tens of thousands of transactions that are flowing through their particular account but sometimes they'll move the thin margin deposits to a treasury. And so we might lose 10 basis points on something and they'll pick up 10 basis points on treasury.So there's some of that that's going on. And I think in truth, that's not as dominant as a driver of our NII at this point.Hang LeungAnd then as a follow-up, just on some of the updated capital rules that are coming. I understand you probably won't be able to give much color because we haven't seen a proposal yet. But just in terms of like expected ways you might be able to mitigate some of that impact and which businesses might be more impacted for you guys?Eric Walter AboafYes. I mean there's -- obviously, we're like many waiting to see more from the rules. We've -- the last time we saw Basel III Endgame, draft from either the U.S. or international regulators was several years back. So I think we've -- we expect some higher capital requirements, just hard to tell how much.We do think there'll be effects on different parts of our businesses. So the new rules will come with an operational deposit -- operational capital charge. That probably will be relatively hard to influence because we actually want to build our fee-driven businesses. And so those, I think, will just come with a capital requirement that's -- that will be an add.There'll be some reduction on the lending book, so that will be helpful. And then I think in particular, while the fundamental review of the trading book will affect the universal banks potentially in a negative way. For us, the sec finance business will tend to be a positive, will be in a positive territory where capital requirements will be less. We'll no longer need to hold capital to indemnify treasury. So they'll finally become economically more rational in the safer areas, right, as they should be. They should obviously -- capital needs to be held for the -- for the riskier activities. But we don't traffic in the riskier areas.And I think that, in some ways, that will give us an opportunity to grow those areas that are quite aligned with our client base like sec finance, and actually deploy capital more actively. And so I think there'll be a mix of impacts, we're going to see as it comes through, but I like many were -- we're considering what's to come, and we'll react accordingly as it does.OperatorYour next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank.Brian Bertram BedellRon, I guess I wanted to come back to your comments on the -- basically, the overall revenue per client, if I can sort of summarize it that way. Obviously, there are different components of how clients, the assets servicing clients pay for the business, and there are many different ways aside from the core fees that they can do that. So as you think about that across the client base, I know you have looked at this more holistically across clients over many, many years.But with the deposit beta going up, is that sort of revenue per client going down? Or do you think you're able to actually be able to improve the fee rate given that they aren't paying as much on the compensating balances?Ronald Philip O’HanleyBrian, it's a good question. And what I was referring to and what you're referring to is what I would call how we think about this tactically client by client, but I also want to come back to the strategic elements of this also.In terms of -- there's no one answer for any particular client because if you think about it, in the core back office business, you've got custody fund accounting and there's a pricing element to that along typically with associated deposits. In more and more instances, obviously, we've -- a client might have a middle office assignment with us where we're doing -- we are their back office and obviously, going all the way to Alpha. And then there's the question of are we doing FX and securities finance with them? Obviously, FX is a function of are they -- do they have occasion to use FX? And increasingly, most managers do, securities finances manager, [money managers].So the reason why I'm saying it's tactical, it's -- there's a holistic conversation that needs to occur here. And it's important on both sides, ours included, to lay out for the client that remember all we did for you over the past few years to get you through whatever the challenges they were having, that was predicated on X. And X might be an assumed deposit level, it might be on an assumed FX level, X isn't playing out. We need to have a conversation on this. And that could, in cases, lead to more fees or it could and the more typical outcome is that, well, hey, we're not doing this with you, let's try and do that or even there's a set of funds over here that we've never talked about, whatever Cayman Islands or something, and let's see if we can move those.I mean this deposit situation is a challenge, the conversations at [spurring] are opportunities. And there are real opportunities. The senior people intimately involved in these because we don't get a lot of redos on them. This is the moment to be doing it. So we think it's a way to -- I mean, again, the kind of NII outflow is a significant headwind, but we think it's an opportunity to mitigate some of it.The strategic side of this, Brian, I don't want to lose, right? Because going back to the acquisition of Charles River, the launch of Alpha, all the development we've been doing, we're now seeing onboarding happening there. With the typical onboarding journey tends to be the lower fee complicated kind of middle office stuff starts first. And then there's follow-on services. And it's making sure that we are implementing, addressing and implementing those follow-on services as fast as possible. So when we talked earlier and talked about the onboarding, I talked about that we were able to move a little over $1 trillion in to -- to onboard it.What will follow there is other services and increase kind of the revenue per asset per -- I mean that's the way Alpha works and that's where Alpha is going to play out, which is why notwithstanding the short-term issues that Eric has raised in terms of we've got this client transition. We're actually quite optimistic over the -- what I would call the short to medium term as we look into 2024 about the revenue picture.Brian Bertram BedellThat's great color. And then maybe just on the expense side, Eric, you mentioned the expense levers. Are they more tactical in nature? Or do you see sort of an ability to reengineer -- continue to reengineer the cost base. You've already done a great job in reducing costs structurally over the last several years. I don't know if we're like mostly through that and when you do have the cost saves you reinvest them in growth initiatives? Or is there an ability to sort of reduce the overall cost structure?Ronald Philip O’HanleyBrian, let me address that first, and then Eric will comment. The -- we are definitely not through this. And by that, I mean when we started down this journey a couple of years ago, we obviously addressed, call it what you want the lower-hanging fruit, the kinds of things that we could get out without a lot of technology investment, without a lot of reengineering but there is more to do, and we're making a lot of progress on it.We've got people in place now on both the operations reengineering side and on the technology side that are working this through. The way this has played through in our results, you've seen what our expenses have been, but we've also been able to invest more in the businesses than we otherwise would. And we think that, that journey has more to go, and you'll see that and we'll report on that quarter after quarter.What we also talked about, though, is that there's some tactical things that we can do and should do just given the kind of outlook that we've described to you. And those would be less about reengineering and more about how do we think about short-term things like consensus and those things.Eric Walter AboafAnd just to round that out, we've got to pay for performance. So when we have larger -- we deliver larger sales, we'll pay for that when it's a little lighter. As you saw, we'll rein that in, and that's part of the execution mines that we have.We've also just given some of the evolution on salary increases and that we've all worked through over the last couple of quarters of the last year, we also feel like it's time where we have enough staff, and so we've put in place a hiring freeze because we need to contain our staffing costs. So we need to make sure as we reengineer, we actually redeploy our folks to, say, new business areas or to growth areas and actually pair down others.And the way to do that in a more emphatic way tactically, right, is to be particularly disciplined on hiring and freeze that or just limit it. And so given the short-term performance, we're doing that as well, which gives you a sense for our willingness to bend the cost curve.OperatorThere are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Ron O'Hanley for closing remarks.Ronald Philip O’HanleyWell, thanks, operator, and thanks to all on the call for joining us.OperatorThank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect at this time.]"

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)A warning for smaller banksThere was also a new warning Friday for smaller banks. That came from State Street (STT), which was the nation's 12th largest as of March 31.In its second quarter results, State Street disclosed that its net interest income, which measures the difference between what it earns from loans and pays out in deposits, fell 10% when compared to the first quarter.That's largely because of rising deposit rates and a rotation by customers out of non-interest-bearing deposits as they seek higher yields. The bank now expects net interest income to drop 12% to 18% in the coming quarter.Read more: High-yield savings account vs. CD: Which is right for you?""What we found is that our larger clients, and we primarily have large, sophisticated clients, are quite active in thinking about their alternatives, and... that has been accelerated by the swiftness of this cycle and the place that we've come to and the speed,"" said Eric Aboaf, State Street CFO.Story continuesSome other mid-sized banks that report their results in the coming weeks have already revised down their expectations for how much of this income they can earn, including executives for US Bancorp (USB), Citizens Financial Group (CFG), Comerica (CMA), Huntington (HBAN), KeyCorp (KEY), and Zions (ZION).State Street's stock closed down 12% Friday.Navigating the chaosThe results kicked off a closely watched earnings season where banks of all sizes will be trying to show that they recovered from one of the most tumultuous periods for the industry since the 2008 financial crisis.JPMorgan demonstrated its hold over the rest of the industry during the chaos of the spring by winning a government-run auction to purchase the bulk of operations of First Republic after regulators seized the San Francisco lender.First Republic was one of three sizable regional banks to fail, along with Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Their seizures triggered a panic in the banking system and outflows of depositors from a number of smaller banks.The deal lifted JPMorgan's second quarter numbers. It said First Republic added $2.4 billion to net income. That helped push overall earnings to $14.5 billion, up 67% from the same period a year ago. Wells Fargo's earnings of $4.9 billion were up 57%.Trouble on Wall StreetThe industry is no longer at the same crisis level as it was in the spring, but second quarter results from some of the biggest banks contained reminders that the industry still faces a number of challenges on several fronts.Citigroup, for example, struggled with a recent drought of dealmaking that is making day-to-day life more difficult for all of Wall Street. Its investment banking revenues fell by 24% to $612 million. Trading was another weakness. Revenue from that activity fell 13%.Citigroup and other firms with big investment banking and trading units have made or announced cuts of roughly 12,000 jobs since the end of 2022. Dealmaking is drying up amid a rise in interest rates and economic uncertainty.Even JPMorgan had challenges on this front. Its investment banking fees fell by 6% from a year ago to $1.5 billion. Its trading revenues from equities and fixed income also fell.'Things are better than people would have expected'What JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup had in common Friday is that they set aside more money to cover future loan losses, a sign they expect the economy to slow in the coming quarters.Many other banks are also expected to do the same when they report their second quarter results.Wells Fargo set aside $1.71 billion in provisions for credit losses in the second quarter, compared with $580 million a year ago. That included a $949 million increase primarily for commercial real estate office loans.""I think things are better than people would have expected at this point in the cycle,"" said Wells Fargo CFO Mike Santomassimo. ""We do expect that they'll be more weakness in the [commercial real estate] market and it's going to take a while to play out. It'll be a while before we see you know, the end of end of this.""CEO Charlie Scharf said the US economy ""continues to be resilient.""JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. REUTERS/Brian SnyderJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon also sounded optimistic about the US economy, saying it ""continues to be resilient"" and that ""consumers are spending, albeit a little more slowly.""His CFO, Jeremy Barnum, told reporters the bank does not expect a lot of loan demand except for credit cards and autos.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $5.49 a share, just 12 days from its upcoming earnings release on July 26, 2023.TMO has an Earnings ESP figure of 1.18%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $5.49 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.43.TMO is one of just a large database of Medical stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY).Slated to report earnings on July 27, 2023, Bristol Myers Squibb holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $2.03 a share 13 days from its next quarterly update.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Bristol Myers Squibb is $2.02, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.54%.Story continuesTMO and BMY's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

18,d1e654d2-ff77-397e-b5e5-84b805bfe50c,USB,2023-07-15,Big bank earnings: Key takeaways and what to watch for next week,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/big-bank-earnings-key-takeaways-194458072.html,1689363898,VIDEO,"['JPM', 'BAC', 'GS', 'WFC', 'MS', 'USB', 'USB-PR', 'C']","[On Friday, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Citigroup (C) all reported quarterly results that topped analyst estimates. Whalen Global Advisors Chairman Richard Christopher Whalen tells Yahoo Finance Live there are two key takeaways from the reports. First, Whalen notes that the growth in the costs of deposits slowed down. Second, Whalen says that ""credit is basically flat...because frankly the consumer is still okay.""Whalen also discusses the impact of regulation, something JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned about in his company's earnings release, saying ""material regulatory changes would likely have real world consequences for markets and end users."" Whalen says that additional regulation will likely force some consolidation among smaller and mid-sized banks because ""some banks are going to be better at readjusting their balance sheet than others, and the ones that don't move quickly are going to get sold.""In the interview, Whalen also previews what investors can expect from Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) and how commercial real estate is a ""chopped salad"" for banks.Key video moments00:01:04 Whalen's key takeaways00:03:36 How smaller banks will be impacted by new regulations00:05:05 Impact of commercial real estate woes on banks00:08:00 What to expect from Goldman Sachs and Morgan StanleyVideo Transcript- All right, let's first start off with the big bank earnings. JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, and Citi all beating the Street's expectations. JP Morgan coming out strong in the second quarter. Thanks, in part, to higher interest rates. Profit at the bank jumping 67%. Lifted, in part, by the company's acquisition of the failed first Republic Bank that was back in May.Now, Wells Fargo's profit surged 57%. The bank also raising its annual forecast for net interest income. And Citi beating the Street's expectations. But revenue did fall 1% from a year ago and net income did drop about 36%.So let's break it all down. We want to bring in Chris Whalen, chairman at Whalen Global Advisors. Chris, it's good to see you. So certainly just taking a look at these results from the big banks, specifically Wells Fargo and JP Morgan, very strong numbers here from those two banks. And it's almost like we're just forgetting about some of the crises, some of the strains that we did see within the banking system earlier this year. What's your takeaway from these results and what it signals for the second half?Story continuesRICHARD CHRISTOPHER WHALEN: I think there's two big takeaways. First, the growth in the cost of deposits slowed down. So that's a big positive for the banks. We were worried that we could see deposit rates double this quarter, simply because of the aftershock from the three bank failures in the first quarter.So what you've seen is that slowed down and also credit is basically flat. Most of the banks didn't have to increase their provisions for future losses because frankly, the consumer is still OK. You're not seeing a huge spike. Although you are seeing things like multifamily and commercial obviously above average, if you will.But everybody else is still muted because of the Fed and quantitative easing. It's actually pushed down credit. And I think that's going to be a positive for the banks for the rest of the year. So what it comes down to is can they continue to adjust? Can they find higher yielding assets on the one hand, and somehow get rid of some of the legacy stuff from 2021 that they still own?- Chris, who is best positioned? Is it JP Morgan that's best positioned to make those types of changes, adjust their business, in order to position themselves for growth here in the coming quarters?RICHARD CHRISTOPHER WHALEN: Well, we put out a note a couple of weeks ago, just looking at the first quarter, and JP Morgan came out of that very strong. They have a 10-point advantage in terms of their operating leverage, versus the other three of the top four banks. That's extraordinary.They're down around peer group 1 levels, which is basically small banks, around 50% efficiency. And I really tip my hat to Jamie Dimon for growing the balance sheet on the one hand, but keeping his operating leverage down around the same as small banks. It's quite something.I mean, look at Bank of America, look at Wells, they're giving up 10 points of operating leverage to Jamie Dimon. So second quarter, he hit it out of the park, as you said. And I think you can expect to see them continue to do that because JB is better at managing the business, both in terms of the operations and also versus the Fed. And managing the duration of his balance sheet in a way that's at least not going to hurt him.The other banks haven't been that good at that. And I think you're going to see them tune that up. And I think the regulators, as you know, very focused on this, they're going to force them to tune up their market risk management.- Chris, how are you looking at the coming regulation within the space? The focus that we have seen on the banks. Obviously, when you take a look at the bigger banks, they are better equipped to handle some of the capital allocations, capital rules, that are changing here going ahead. But what is that going to do to some of the smaller banks or mid-sized banks within this sector? Are we going to see further consolidation and how much?RICHARD CHRISTOPHER WHALEN: I think it's going to force some consolidation because some banks are going to be better at readjusting their balance sheet than others. And the ones that don't move quickly are going to get sold. Very simple.I think you're going to see the big bank group, what we call peer group 1, it's 140 banks now, they're above $10 billion in assets. Everybody from Jamie Dimon on down. That's where you see growth in the industry. So I think those 20, 30, $40 billion banks are going to grow in number, as they should. And the big guys, frankly, would like to get smaller, if they could.If you sat down with Jamie and his CFO, he would tell you he'd love to be closer to 2 trillion because he'd make more money. But for now, they're doing fine. I think Wells Fargo is the most improved student in the class. I'm a little disappointed with US Bank because they traditionally have been right next to JB in terms of operating performance.You know, Citi, not a bad quarter. And they didn't have to increase credit provisions, which I think, again, was a big takeaway so far.- Chris, one sign of trouble, maybe we can say that, within Wells Fargo's report was the amount that they put aside for future loan losses. And I know you briefly touched on this before. But they did report $1.7 billion provision for loan losses. A lot of that attributed to some of the losses that we could see on office loans. Just give us a sense of what this tells us just about the current state and the risk that is still ahead, that's looming here, for some of these banks when it comes to the losses in commercial real estate?RICHARD CHRISTOPHER WHALEN: Commercial is chopped salad. Every building is different, every story is different. So you're going to see losses coming out of the Wells commercial book, and they're going to be quite idiosyncratic. They're going to be different sizes. And then you're going to see big recoveries too.So that's going to go on for years. It's a multi-year story. A lot of these commercial assets will be restructured or extended and they'll try and buy some time and see if the market doesn't turn back in their direction. Because does Wells Fargo want to take over a big multifamily building? No. They want that building to be functional and healthy and be able to support the tenants.So that, to me, is going to be the story for most banks going forward in the next year. It's not going to be residential. This is not like 2008. This is a different kind of credit story with multifamily as well as commercial office space, kind of on the block. You can see it in the specialty press if you follow the Real Deal and some of the other media that really focus on the commercial market. It's all over the place.You've got buildings going into bankruptcy being auctioned, you've got other buildings that are financing in good order. You've got cities like San Francisco. You know, no bank wants exposure in San Francisco right now. And I think the Bank regulators have told the banks to be very careful of legacy, B and C class, urban office space. That's been the message for a while.So I think every bank I look at, credit, efficiency, and how well they recover from default, is always one of the first things I assess. And I think the small banks have commercial exposures in the community. And then as you get up into the bigger banks, they're national. They have exposure to all kinds of deals everywhere.You can see fatigue in places like Texas, and some of the other hot markets, they're definitely overbuilt now. Houston, even, believe it or not, Austin, Texas, which has received enormous amounts of inflows of investment over the last few years.- Yeah, certainly a story that really varies--RICHARD CHRISTOPHER WHALEN: New York City.- We have regional--RICHARD CHRISTOPHER WHALEN: There's a lot of mezzanine finance in New York City held by banks. So we'll hear about that.- Yeah. And then there's also, of course, the pockets, like you were saying, that are strong and that are on solid footing within commercial real estate outside of office. Chris, let's look ahead to next week because we're also going to be getting a report here from Goldman Sachs. And we know Goldman obviously more exposed or more reliant, I should say, on trading and deal activity. Are we going to see a different type of report from Goldman.Oh, yeah, you always do. They're much more focused on your investment banking side. I think the guidance has been that side of the House is going to be light. You're going to see credit expenses continue to work themselves out as they shut down markets and get out of that business really.And then the question is cost of funds for the whole enterprise. It's going to be high. They and Morgan Stanley, frankly, have both seen the market side of their business, reprice very quickly. So they're paying market rates today.They both have banks. Morgan Stanley's got a bigger bank than Goldman. And the bank doesn't really support either firm entirely. It's not like Schwab or the bank is kind of a nice thing to have but they don't need it. So I think that-- the way I would put it is I'm looking to see how well the capital markets business is being managed, and see if they can avoid other credit, you know, stumbles, I guess, is the way I would put it.Morgan Stanley is in a different space right now than Goldman. They have bigger AUM. I think a more stable business, frankly.- All right, well, we will see what the results next week tell us about the health of those two banks, Chris Whalen, always great to speak with you, of Whalen Global Advisors.RICHARD CHRISTOPHER WHALEN: Have a great weekend, guys.- Thank you. You too.]"

It has a solid balance sheet and is banking on technology, scale and organizational capabilities to drive growth. However, elevated supply, the lack of rent relief and the high interest rate scenario are concerns.Along with its dominating presence in Boston, New York, Washington, D.C., Seattle, San Francisco and Southern California, Equity Residential is growing its presence in Denver, Atlanta and Austin. It is particularly targeting places where affluent renters prefer to live, work and play. Moreover, given the high cost of homeownership, the transition from renter to homeowner is difficult in its markets, making renting apartment units a viable option. For 2023, we estimate total rental income to grow 4.6% year over year.Equity Residential is also banking on technology and organizational capabilities to drive innovation, rent growth and improve the efficiency of its operating platform. It is expected to provide the company with a competitive edge over others. It anticipates gaining $30-$35 million of net operating income (NOI) through its operating model. We expect the current-year NOI to increase 4.2% year over year.Equity Residential has been making efforts toward repositioning its portfolio by disposing of older properties and acquiring newer properties in submarkets with high numbers of affluent renters and favorable long-term demand drivers. Equity Residential also has an encouraging development pipeline.On the balance sheet front, Equity Residential exited the first quarter of 2023 with $2.5 billion of liquidity and net debt to normalized EBITDAre of 4.17X. Its limited near-term debt maturities and solid credit metrics poise it well to capitalize on growth opportunities.Equity Residential has been consistent in paying dividends to its shareholders, which remains a solid attraction for REIT investors. In March 2023, the residential REIT increased its quarterly cash dividend on its common stock to 66.25 cents from 62.50 cents per share paid out earlier, marking a hike of 6% on its annualized dividend.The company’s dividend rate is expected to be sustainable, given its solid operating platform, our funds from operations (FFO) growth projections of 6.1% for 2023 and better balance-sheet strength than the industry counterparts.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have rallied 11% compared with the industry’s growth of 3.4% in the past three months.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, the struggle to attract renters remains consistent as the supply volumes is expected to remain elevated in a number of its markets. Moreover, the lack of governmental rental assistance in 2023 and rent-control regulations in some of the major markets may weigh on Equity Residential’s revenue growth to a certain extent.Further, high interest rates are likely to increase the company's borrowing costs, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate.Other Stocks to ConsiderA couple of other residential REITs worth considering are AvalonBay Communities AVB and Centerspace CSR, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present.

The upside can be linked primarily to strength in the cyber, industrial, aerospace and connected building end markets, solid operational execution and improving supply chains.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research What’s Aiding Honeywell?Strong commercial aftermarket demand owing to a recovery in commercial flight hours is aiding Honeywell’s Aerospace segment. With improvement in supply chains and strength in order book, the company expects organic sales to increase in low double digits for the Aerospace segment in 2023.Strength in advanced materials business and UOP operations is fueling growth of the Performance Materials and Technologies (PMT) segment. Honeywell expects strength in projects and smart energy businesses to support the segment’s growth in 2023. It expects sales to increase in mid-single digits for the segment in 2023. Within PMT, demand for flooring products is expected to buoy the advanced materials business’ performance. Robust demand for gas processing equipment and sustainable technology solutions is likely to boost the UOP business operations in 2023.Growth in Building Products and Solutions augurs well for the Building Technologies segment. Institutional demand in airports, healthcare and education is expected to drive growth of the segment in 2023. Honeywell expects organic revenues to increase in low single digits for the segment in the current year.Despite cost inflation, pricing actions and cost-control measures are driving Honeywell’s margin performance. For the first quarter of 2023, operating margin expanded 390 basis points (bps) to 19.1%. Segment margin expanded 90 bps in the quarter. For 2023, the company expects a segment margin of 22.3-22.6%, indicating a year-over-year rise of 60-90 bps.Handsome rewards to shareholders also drove Honeywell’s shares higher. In 2022, HON rewarded shareholders with $2.7 billion in dividends and $4.2 billion in share buybacks. The quarterly dividend rate was hiked by 5.1% in September 2022, marking its 13th increment since 2010. In the first quarter of 2023, the company paid dividends of $725 million and repurchased shares worth approximately $800 million. Strong free cash flow generation supports the company’s shareholder-friendly activities. The company expects an operating cash flow of $4.9-$5.3 billion for 2023, while free cash flow is anticipated to be $3.9-$4.3 billion.Story continuesWill the Uptrend in Shares Continue?Persistent weakness in the manufacturing sector, raw material cost inflation and labor market challenges might be a drag on Honeywell’s operations. However, strength across key end markets is likely to help the company stay afloat. Investments in digital transformation, aimed at driving commercial and operational actions, augur well for the company’s growth.HON’s deal to acquire Compressor Controls Corporation holds promise. The acquisition will fortify HON’s expertise in industrial control, automation and process solutions, while simultaneously bolstering its sustainability portfolio with new carbon capture control solutions. The acquired entity will be integrated into HON’s Process Solutions business. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2023.With market conditions remaining strong, Honeywell expects strong sales of $36.5-$37.3 billion in 2023. Previously, the company anticipated sales of $36-$37 billion. The company expects organic sales growth of 3-6% in the year compared with 2-5% estimated earlier.

The company’s revenues are expected to have improved year over year, while its earnings are likely to have declined.Before we analyze the factors that are likely to have impacted second-quarter earnings, let’s look at Huntington’s performance in the last quarter.In the last reported quarter, the bank recorded an earnings surprise of 2.7%. The results benefited from notable increases in net interest income (NII) and non-interest income. However, a rise in expenses and higher provision for credit losses were headwinds.Huntingtonhas an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 4.02%.Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseHuntington Bancshares Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Quote The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HBAN’s second-quarter earnings of 34 cents per share has been revised 2.9% downward over the past month, reflecting the bearish sentiments of analysts. Further, the figure indicates a 5.6% decline from the year-ago reported number.Nonetheless, the consensus estimate for revenues of $1.84 billion suggests a year-over-year increase of 4.8%.Key Factors &amp; Estimates for Q2Loans: Lending activities gradually waned in the second quarter amid a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. Per Federal Reserve’s latest data, the demand for commercial and industrial loans, as well as commercial real estate loans, were soft in April and May.Given HBAN’s significant exposure to commercial loans, the company’s loan growth in the quarter under review is likely to have been affected. This is likely to have negatively influenced the average earning asset balance for the second quarter.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for average earning assets of $171.35 billion  indicates a 1.3% rise from the prior quarter’s reported figure.Story continuesNII: Federal Reserve hiked rates by 25 basis points in the to-be-reported quarter. With this, the policy rate now stands at a 15-year high of 5-5.25%. Such high interest rates are likely to have increased funding costs in the quarter under review.Despite higher rates, rise in deposit costs and muted loan growth are expected to have negatively impacted the bank’s NII and net interest margin in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII is pegged at $1.35 billion, suggesting a sequential rise of 4.5%.Non-Interest Income: The high inflation is expected to have increased card transactions, thereby supporting HBAN’s card and payment processing income in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for card and payment processing income of $97 million implies a sequential increase of 4.3%.In the to-be-reported quarter, mortgage rates continued to rise, with the rate on 30-year fixed mortgage reaching 6.71% in June, up from the 6.32% reported in the prior quarter. Thus, mortgage originations as well as refinancing continued to decline in the quarter.These factors are likely to have weighed on HBAN’s mortgage banking income. Nonetheless, a favorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights is expected to have aided such revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for mortgage banking income is pegged at $31.23 million, suggesting an 20.1% sequential rise.Global deal making continued to shrink in the second quarter, with deal volume and total deal value numbers crashing. Geopolitical tensions, inflation, high-interest rates and fears of a global recession are likely to have acted as headwinds for merger and acquisition deals. Thus, the company’s capital markets fees are likely to have been adversely impacted. Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $62 million, implying a 5.1% rise sequentially.The consensus estimate for service charges on deposit accounts for the second quarter is pegged at $84 million, hinting a rise of 1.2% on a sequential basis.

32,c0664cd2-0234-348d-ae49-25c315db901b,HBAN,2023-07-15,Earnings Preview: Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) Q2 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-huntington-bancshares-hban-140008831.html,1689343208,STORY,"['HBAN', 'SRCE']","[The market expects Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 21. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis regional bank holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.34 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -5.6%.Revenues are expected to be $1.84 billion, up 4.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Huntington Bancshares?For Huntington Bancshares, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.29%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Huntington Bancshares will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Huntington Bancshares would post earnings of $0.37 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.38, delivering a surprise of +2.70%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Huntington Bancshares doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry Player1st Source (SRCE), another stock in the Zacks Banks - Midwest industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.12 for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -5.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $91.2 million, up 5.7% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for 1st Source has been revised 2.6% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, reflecting an equal Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that 1st Source will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

38,6ccbd65f-9bfd-30dc-8f68-7302bc20db02,O,2023-07-15,3 Reasons Big Oil Might Turn Down Biden’s Arctic Bonanza,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-big-oil-might-230000586.html,1689375600,STORY,"['COP', 'CL=F']","[Back in March, the Biden administration issued the green light for ConocoPhillips’ (NYSE:COP) long-disputed $8 billion Willow project in Alaska, much to the consternation and chagrin of environmentalists. ConocoPhillips remains the largest producer in Alaska, with extensive holdings in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A) and Prudhoe.The development was a 180-degree turnaround from Biden’s actions just two years ago when he placed a temporary moratorium on oil and gas activity in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge(ANWR) just hours after ascending into the Oval Office. It was also an admission of the huge role energy and fuel prices play in American politics considering how pro-renewables the current administration is.Although Biden blocked other oil drilling in Alaska, it’s not inconceivable that he might give in again if, for instance, oil supplies fell sharply thus triggering skyrocketing fuel prices. After all, Biden has been pleading with American producers and even OPEC to ramp-up production in a bid to keep oil prices low. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that ANWR, the crown jewel of American wilderness in the northeast corner of Alaska, holds a staggering 12 billion barrels of oil, or 27% of U.S. proven oil reserves of 43.8 billion barrels.That said, there is no guarantee that Big Oil would jump at such an opportunity. After all, virtually no major oil companies bid on ANWR’s more than one million acres after the Trump administration auctioned off drilling rights two years ago in a last-gasp effort to open up the refuge for drilling.But first things first, why so much oil in the world’s biggest deserts and so little or none elsewhere?Tectonic activityPlate tectonics is the best key we have to understanding why deserts and arctic areas hold some of the largest hydrocarbon reserves on earth. Plate tectonics also create the ""pressure cooker"" that slowly matures the organics into oil and gas. However, other important locations of large reserves include river deltas and continental margins offshore.Story continuesOil and gas is created mostly from the rapid burial of dead microorganisms in environments with very low oxygen concentrations that hinder decomposition. Newly developing ocean basins--usually formed by plate tectonics and continental rifting--provide just the right conditions for rapid burial in anoxic waters. Rivers tend to rapidly fill these basins with sediments containing an abundance of organic remains. A good example is the Gulf of California, an ocean basin in real-time development. The Gulf of California formed in as little as 6 million to 10 million years--a lot faster than most of the world’s ocean basins. The Gulf of Mexico is another great example of new oil and gas formation in a restricted circulation environment.The same plate tectonics that provides ideal locations and conditions for anoxic burial are also responsible for processes such as continental drift, subduction and collision with other continents that determine the geological paths that sedimentary basins usually take--currently to the poles and deserts. For instance, Antarctica has extensive coal deposits--and very likely abundant oil and gas--while the Libyan Sahara Desert contains unmistakable glacial scars which establishes that their plates were once at the other ends of the earth. Being much more buoyant than water, these hydrocarbons eventually force their way to the surface, or do so through rifting, collisions between land masses, and other tectonic forces.When it comes to the Middle East, the most widely accepted theory for why the region is so loaded with oil is that it was not always a vast desert. Rather, scientists speculate that 100 million or so years ago, the area was a massive body of water known as the “Tethys Ocean,” fed by nutrient rich rivers. As the land in the modern Middle East region gradually rose due to tectonic activity, the Tethys Ocean receded leaving behind the sandy, dry Middle Eastern desert.Taking a passAs one of his first actions in office, President Joe Biden imposed a “temporary moratorium” on all oil and gas leasing activities in the ANWR, citing the “alleged legal deficiencies underlying the program” as well as the inadequacy of a required environmental review.However, there are several reasons why Big Oil is likely to continue shunning the Arctic even in the event the Biden administration lifts the moratorium.Lack of financial backingHigh drilling costs/Thawing permafrostUnproven reservesOne of the biggest reasons why Big Oil is largely disinterested in Arctic drilling is due to many potential backers backing off. Back in 2019, Goldman Sachs became the first big U.S. bank to rule out financing new oil exploration or drilling in the Arctic, as well as new thermal coal mines anywhere in the world. The bank’s environmental policy declares climate change as one of the “most significant environmental challenges of the 21st century” and has pledged to help its clients manage climate impacts more effectively, including through the sale of weather-related catastrophe bonds. The giant bank also committed to invest $750 billion over the next decade into areas that focus on climate transition.Others soon followed suit: All five major U.S. banks and hundreds of financial  institutions across the globe have pledged to restrict or stop financing Arctic oil exploration.The second big reason why Big Oil does not find the Arctic an attractive proposition is due to high drilling costs. For instance, when former President-Alaska Production at Exxon Darlene Gates showed a chart comparing estimated returns on investment at oil fields such as the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea, the North Slope and Angola, Alaska oil was by far the least profitable due to its high cost of production. It’s a big reason why BP Inc.(NYSE:BP) sold off all of its assets in Alaska, including leases on lands that lie within ANWR, after 60 years in the state. The situation is not helped by the thawing permafrost. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet, turning the permafrost into a land of  sinkholes, lakes and boggy peat in the summer. Three years ago, a giant diesel fuel tank in the Siberian city of Norilsk sank into the tundra and ruptured, spilling 21,000 metric tons (157,500 barrels) of fuel after weeks of record high temperatures that hit over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. That marked the largest spill in modern Russian history and nearly half the amount spilled by the Exxon Valdez tanker off Alaska in 1989.Finally, there’s a lot of speculation regarding how much oil actually resides beneath the ANWR. Results of the only test well ever drilled in the refuge back in the early 1980s remains one of the most tightly guarded secrets in the oil industry. Interestingly, a 2006 National Geographic investigation reported the well was a “dry hole.’’ The fact that  BP executives who knew what was down that hole and were on the cusp of getting the greenlight to develop their leases for the first time in 40 years thanks to the Trump bonanza instead chose to walk away does not inspire a lot of confidence in the refuge's potential. Neither does the fact that the British oil giant sold its Alaskan assets to Houston-based Hilcorp, Inc.,a privately held company specializing in squeezing the last drop out of dying oil fields. Meanwhile, oil companies have been cutting their workforce in Alaska, from 15,000 in 2015 to 6,900 in 2019 well before the pandemic hit, pushing 40,000 more Alaskans out of work.In the final analysis, the triple whammy of high production costs, lack of financial backing and hostile government policies might mean that ANWR continues to be the refuge’s “biological heart” and a breeding ground for polar bears, caribou and more than 200 other species for decades to come.But then again, who knows if Big Oil might reconsider if oil prices hit, say, $200 per barrel?By Alex Kimani for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Hummer EV's Lofty Premiums Begin To ErodeAmerica’s Manufacturing Slowdown Weighs On Steel DemandGold Prices Inch Higher As Fed’s Inflation Battle Draws To A CloseRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

40,ba8de66f-8331-3505-b09e-cada8007f2f7,O,2023-07-15,Russian crude prices have breached the G-7 price cap. Now what?,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russian-crude-prices-breached-g-212429885.html,1689369869,STORY,['CL=F'],"[Ship locations as of Friday of tankers loaded with Russian crude. (Map: MarineTraffic)The price of Russian Urals crude, exported from ports in the Black Sea and Baltic Sea, is now at or above the $60-per-barrel price cap set by the Group of Seven nations and the European Union. If it stays there or rises further, European tanker owners and their U.K. insurers will not be able to legally participate in this lucrative shipping trade.“The breach [of the] price cap could have significant ramifications for Russia-origin oil continuing to be carried on international tonnage,” said ship brokerage Braemar on Friday.The price cap was put in place on Dec. 5. Urals flirted with $60 in April but global prices fell in the following months, pulling Urals back from the brink. This month, oil prices have risen at the same time the discount of Urals to the global benchmark, Brent, has shrunk.Urals has topped $60 by a few cents since Wednesday, the first time it has done so since the cap plan was implemented, according to data from price-reporting agency Argus. (Russian ESPO crude loaded in the Pacific has always been over the cap.)(Chart: FreightWaves based on data from Argus)The question for Western governments is: Will there be sufficient non-Western tanker tonnage available to maintain Russian export flows, preventing a further rise in global oil prices that negatively impacts consumers?The questions for tanker markets: Will an exodus of European tankers from Russian trades weigh freight rates in non-Russian trades by injecting more tonnage? And will new restrictions on Russian trades mean that non-Western tankers — the so-called “shadow tankers” — earn an even higher premium?Shock could be ‘less dramatic’ than expected“If the price persists above $60 per barrel, the players moving Russian crude may have to increasingly rely on the ‘shadow fleet,’” Sheel Bhattacharjee, head of European freight at Argus, told FreightWaves.“This is likely to widen the freight spread between Russian cargoes and the general market. However, the shadow fleet can expand if the incentives are there. So, there may be enough vessels to carry Russian volumes, especially following the recently announced cuts to Russian oil production.”Story continuesAs a result, said Bhattacharjee, “the initial shock could turn out to be less dramatic than some may expect, and the market is likely to rebalance itself again even if the Urals price remains above the cap long-term.”According to data from Kpler, Russian seaborne crude exports averaged 3.4 million barrels per day (b/d) in June, down 12% from May to the lowest monthly volume since December. Seaborne exports in the first half of July have averaged 3.2 million b/d, down 7% from June.Even so, Russian crude export flows are still above pre-invasion levels. Average seaborne exports this June and July are up 4% from those in June-July 2021.(Chart: FreightWaves based on data from Kpler)“Moscow has promised a further 500,000 b/d cut to exports in August,” said the International Energy Agency (IEA) on Thursday. IEA data shows that virtually all Russian crude exports continue to move to just two countries: China and India.Crude tanker owners earning huge premiums in RussiaRussian crude is loaded aboard Aframaxes (tankers that carry 750,000 barrels) or Suezmaxes (1 million-barrel capacity). They sail either directly to India or China, or they do ship-to-ship transfers to very large crude carriers (2 million-barrel capacity) that handle the long-haul leg.If the price of Urals exceeds the cap for an extended period, forcing Western tankers out of the trade, the non-Western tankers that remain could reap higher premiums. Russian freight premiums are already very high. Average freight rates for Aframaxes and Suezmaxes have been declining globally since April. Rates for Aframaxes and Suezmaxes carrying Russian oil have fallen less, increasing the freight spread.Argus launched a new product this year that compares weekly Russian crude export freight rates to a non-Russian baseline. It shows that in the first week of July, an Aframax loading 80,000 tons of Russian Urals in the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk for delivery to western India earned $3.68 per barrel more in freight than a baseline tanker. That’s a premium of 90% — meaning an Aframax is earning almost twice as much in this Russian trade as it could elsewhere.(Chart: FreightWaves based on data from Argus)The cost of transporting 140,000 tons of crude aboard a Suezmax from Novorossiysk to northern China was $3.17 per barrel higher than the baseline, a premium of 76%, according to Argus data.(Chart: FreightWaves based on data from Argus)In the Baltic Sea, the freight cost for a 100,000-ton cargo of Russian Urals loaded on an Aframax in the first week of July at the port of Primorsk for delivery to western India exceeded the non-Russian baseline by $3.89 per barrel or 87%.(Chart: FreightWaves based on data from Argus)Urals-Brent spread cut in half since JanuaryThe breaching of the price cap occurred as global oil prices were rising. Brent just topped $80 per barrel for the first time since late April. Cuts by the OPEC+ producers could put further upward pressure on crude prices. “So far, [OPEC+ cuts] have not led to a steep decline in global supply. That may be about to change,” said the IEA. “Supply should shift toward a lower trajectory in the coming months as Riyadh [Saudi Arabia] implements steeper cuts.”As the price of Brent has risen, the discount of Russian Urals compared to Brent has declined. That is not a positive trend for Western policy: The whole point of Western sanctions is to force Russian exports to sell at a steep discount, reducing revenues to the Kremlin.The narrowing of the Urals-Brent spread is an example of the broader market trend toward a lower discount of medium-sour crudes to light-sweet crudes. (“Medium” and “light” refer to crude gravity; “sweet” and “sour” refer to sulfur content.) Medium-sour crude pricing is rising more than light-sweet pricing. Russian Urals is medium-sour. Brent is light-sweet.David Fyfe, chief economist at Argus, told FreightWaves: “We have real physical tightness in medium-sour crude, in part because of the diversion of Russian crude long-haul into Asia. More crude on the water equates to tighter prompt supply.“In addition to Saudi and Russian supply curbs in July and August, we’ve had disrupted Canadian crude production and several months of shuttered Iraqi Kirkuk exports. So, prices of medium-to-heavy-sour crude have appreciated versus light-sweet benchmarks.”According to Argus data, the discount of Russian Urals compared to Brent skyrocketed from almost nothing to around $40 per barrel in the days following the invasion of Ukraine. After falling in mid-2022, the discount again rose to $40 per barrel in January following the EU ban on Russian crude imports and the G-7 price cap. Since then, the discount has been cut in half, to $20 per barrel.(Chart: FreightWaves based on data from Argus)Click for more articles by Greg MillerRelated articles:How could sooner-than-expected Russian defeat impact shipping?Profiting from sanctions: Shipping premiums surge for Russian oilOne year later: How Ukraine-Russia war reshaped ocean shippingChina-Russia vs. US-EU: How global shipping is slowly splitting in twoPrice cap on Russian crude could soon face its biggest testEuropean tanker owners make a fortune off Russian oil tradeWelcome to the dark side: The rise of tanker shipping’s ‘shadow fleet’Could Russia sanctions work in practice even if they fail on paper?The post Russian crude prices have breached the G-7 price cap.

Falling crude oil and natural gas prices have been among the biggest drags on the sector.Oil prices have fallen 8% in the U.S. and natural gas prices slumped 36%. Prices have been falling as economic growth slows and that could remain the trend this year. The U.S. Energy Information Administration expects weaker energy consumption in 2023 and 2024.That could mean energy companies will continue to struggle with earnings over the next few quarters. Analysts polled by FactSet expect profits to slip by nearly 50% for the sector in the second quarter, followed by a 34% drop in the third quarter and a 27% drop in the fourth quarter.It marks a reversal from 2022, when some of the biggest names in the sector notched record profits amid rising oil and natural gas prices. Exxon Mobil reported $55 billion in profit in 2022, more than double what it earned in 2021. The company recently warned investors that lower gas prices and weaker demand could pinch margins and profits by billions of dollars. Shell has also warned Wall Street about weakened profits during the most recent quarter.Energy companies are expected to notch the biggest profit declines within the S&amp;P 500. The broader S&amp;P 500 is expected to pull out of its profit slump in the latter half of the year.Story continuesThe weak energy market has been bad for investors, but good for consumers, so far. Lower crude oil prices have eased pressure on inflation, which has been cooling for months. Gasoline costs, normally an unavoidable expense for most people, have fallen about 25% from a year ago, according to AAA.The impact from lower gasoline prices goes beyond simply relieving pressure on inflation and could be a bulwark against a recession and benefit economic growth.“In a time when we worry about the ability of consumer spending to drive growth, the less consumers have to spend on energy, the more they can spend on other things,” Young said.]"

Bank of America (BAC), which has a big Wall Street operation, also reports Tuesday. All are expected to show drops in investment banking and trading from the first quarter.What Friday’s results showed is that big banks like JPMorgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) that have sprawling consumer franchises are performing well because they are able to charge more for their loans and benefit from a surge in credit-card borrowing by Americans who still have extra money.""The consumer is in good shape,"" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts. “They are spending down their excess cash.”But Friday also revealed that corporate clients are not providing as much of a lift, which is hurting the banks that rely more heavily on them.CEOs remain cautious about everything from the direction of interest rates to relations with China to the larger US economy, dampening the optimism needed to buy other companies, go public or take on more debt.Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)""Corporates are pretty cautious,"" Fraser told analysts Friday, citing the prospect of another Federal Reserve interest rate hike, tensions with China and concerns about limited economic growth.""I think clients have been trying to understand and get their arms around both the macro and the market outlook for a while. I think they now seem to accept the current environment is the new normal and are beginning to position themselves globally.""Story continuesThis caution was most evident in the performance of Citigroup’s corporate and investment banking unit, which helped push overall profits at the bank down 36%. Investment banking revenue fell by 24% in the second quarter, to $612 million.It wasn’t just Citigroup, though. Even JPMorgan, which churned out massive profits in its consumer business, saw investment banking fees fall by 6% from a year ago, to $1.5 billion.Trading, which was stronger earlier in the year, also turned weaker. Citigroup’s revenue from that business fell 13%. JPMorgan’s revenue associated with trading equities and fixed income also dropped.“Most of the investors stayed on the sidelines” during the second quarter, Fraser said.Solomon under scrutinyThese results do not bode well for Goldman or Morgan Stanley, which rely heavily on deal making and trading for their revenue.Goldman is expected to show an investment banking revenue decline of 32% from a year ago and a trading decline of 17%, according to analyst estimates.That could intensify the scrutiny of CEO David Solomon, who is wrestling with partner unrest and concerns about strategy as he tries to put a consumer-banking experiment behind the company.David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs.

""It is going to be a tough issue"" for the CEO.Morgan Stanley is also expected by analysts to show a decline in some of its core businesses, with a 4% drop in investment banking and a 19% decline in trading.'We will see'The global slowdown in dealmaking began last year, following a boom in 2021, causing firms across Wall Street to slash bonuses and staff. Worldwide investment banking revenues for the second quarter fell 52% from a year ago, according to Dealogic.Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Goldman and other firms with big investment banking and trading units have made or announced cuts of roughly 12,000 jobs since the end of 2022.Some observers are still predicting “green shoots” ahead, citing an improvement during the latter half of the second quarter.JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum said investment banking was better than expected in June, but cautioned analysts on Friday that it was “too early” to label it a trend.“We will see,” he said. For overall capital markets ""July should be a good indicator for the remainder of the year.""Smaller banks in the weeks ahead could also show new challenges posed by the behavior of corporate clients.That's what happened Friday to State Street (STT), which serves a lot of institutional clients and was the nation's 12th largest bank as of March 31. It disclosed Friday that its net interest income, which measures the difference between what it earns from loans and pays out in deposits, fell 10% when compared to the first quarter.That's largely because of rising deposit rates and a rotation by State Street customers out of non-interest bearing deposits as they seek higher yields. The bank now expects net interest income to drop 12% to 18% in the coming quarter.Its stock dropped 12% Friday.""What we found is that our larger clients, and we primarily have large, sophisticated clients, are quite active in thinking about their alternatives,” said Eric Aboaf, State Street CFO. “That has been accelerated by the swiftness of this cycle and the place that we've come to and the speed.”Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Their seizures triggered a panic in the banking system and outflows of depositors from a number of smaller banks.The deal lifted JPMorgan's second quarter numbers. It said First Republic added $2.4 billion to net income. That helped push overall earnings to $14.5 billion, up 67% from the same period a year ago. Wells Fargo's earnings of $4.9 billion were up 57%.Trouble on Wall StreetThe industry is no longer at the same crisis level as it was in the spring, but second quarter results from some of the biggest banks contained reminders that the industry still faces a number of challenges on several fronts.Citigroup, for example, struggled with a recent drought of dealmaking that is making day-to-day life more difficult for all of Wall Street. Its investment banking revenues fell by 24% to $612 million. Trading was another weakness. Revenue from that activity fell 13%.Citigroup and other firms with big investment banking and trading units have made or announced cuts of roughly 12,000 jobs since the end of 2022. Dealmaking is drying up amid a rise in interest rates and economic uncertainty.Even JPMorgan had challenges on this front. Its investment banking fees fell by 6% from a year ago to $1.5 billion. Its trading revenues from equities and fixed income also fell.'Things are better than people would have expected'What JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup had in common Friday is that they set aside more money to cover future loan losses, a sign they expect the economy to slow in the coming quarters.Many other banks are also expected to do the same when they report their second quarter results.Wells Fargo set aside $1.71 billion in provisions for credit losses in the second quarter, compared with $580 million a year ago. That included a $949 million increase primarily for commercial real estate office loans.""I think things are better than people would have expected at this point in the cycle,"" said Wells Fargo CFO Mike Santomassimo.

JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, and Citi all beating the Street's expectations. JP Morgan coming out strong in the second quarter. Thanks, in part, to higher interest rates. Profit at the bank jumping 67%. Lifted, in part, by the company's acquisition of the failed first Republic Bank that was back in May.Now, Wells Fargo's profit surged 57%. The bank also raising its annual forecast for net interest income. And Citi beating the Street's expectations. But revenue did fall 1% from a year ago and net income did drop about 36%.So let's break it all down. We want to bring in Chris Whalen, chairman at Whalen Global Advisors. Chris, it's good to see you. So certainly just taking a look at these results from the big banks, specifically Wells Fargo and JP Morgan, very strong numbers here from those two banks. And it's almost like we're just forgetting about some of the crises, some of the strains that we did see within the banking system earlier this year. What's your takeaway from these results and what it signals for the second half?Story continuesRICHARD CHRISTOPHER WHALEN: I think there's two big takeaways. First, the growth in the cost of deposits slowed down. So that's a big positive for the banks. We were worried that we could see deposit rates double this quarter, simply because of the aftershock from the three bank failures in the first quarter.So what you've seen is that slowed down and also credit is basically flat. Most of the banks didn't have to increase their provisions for future losses because frankly, the consumer is still OK. You're not seeing a huge spike. Although you are seeing things like multifamily and commercial obviously above average, if you will.But everybody else is still muted because of the Fed and quantitative easing. It's actually pushed down credit. And I think that's going to be a positive for the banks for the rest of the year. So what it comes down to is can they continue to adjust? Can they find higher yielding assets on the one hand, and somehow get rid of some of the legacy stuff from 2021 that they still own?- Chris, who is best positioned? Is it JP Morgan that's best positioned to make those types of changes, adjust their business, in order to position themselves for growth here in the coming quarters?RICHARD CHRISTOPHER WHALEN: Well, we put out a note a couple of weeks ago, just looking at the first quarter, and JP Morgan came out of that very strong. They have a 10-point advantage in terms of their operating leverage, versus the other three of the top four banks. That's extraordinary.They're down around peer group 1 levels, which is basically small banks, around 50% efficiency. And I really tip my hat to Jamie Dimon for growing the balance sheet on the one hand, but keeping his operating leverage down around the same as small banks. It's quite something.I mean, look at Bank of America, look at Wells, they're giving up 10 points of operating leverage to Jamie Dimon. So second quarter, he hit it out of the park, as you said. And I think you can expect to see them continue to do that because JB is better at managing the business, both in terms of the operations and also versus the Fed. And managing the duration of his balance sheet in a way that's at least not going to hurt him.The other banks haven't been that good at that. And I think you're going to see them tune that up. And I think the regulators, as you know, very focused on this, they're going to force them to tune up their market risk management.- Chris, how are you looking at the coming regulation within the space? The focus that we have seen on the banks. Obviously, when you take a look at the bigger banks, they are better equipped to handle some of the capital allocations, capital rules, that are changing here going ahead. But what is that going to do to some of the smaller banks or mid-sized banks within this sector? Are we going to see further consolidation and how much?RICHARD CHRISTOPHER WHALEN: I think it's going to force some consolidation because some banks are going to be better at readjusting their balance sheet than others. And the ones that don't move quickly are going to get sold. Very simple.I think you're going to see the big bank group, what we call peer group 1, it's 140 banks now, they're above $10 billion in assets. Everybody from Jamie Dimon on down. That's where you see growth in the industry. So I think those 20, 30, $40 billion banks are going to grow in number, as they should. And the big guys, frankly, would like to get smaller, if they could.If you sat down with Jamie and his CFO, he would tell you he'd love to be closer to 2 trillion because he'd make more money. But for now, they're doing fine. I think Wells Fargo is the most improved student in the class. I'm a little disappointed with US Bank because they traditionally have been right next to JB in terms of operating performance.You know, Citi, not a bad quarter. And they didn't have to increase credit provisions, which I think, again, was a big takeaway so far.- Chris, one sign of trouble, maybe we can say that, within Wells Fargo's report was the amount that they put aside for future loan losses. And I know you briefly touched on this before. But they did report $1.7 billion provision for loan losses. A lot of that attributed to some of the losses that we could see on office loans. Just give us a sense of what this tells us just about the current state and the risk that is still ahead, that's looming here, for some of these banks when it comes to the losses in commercial real estate?RICHARD CHRISTOPHER WHALEN: Commercial is chopped salad. Every building is different, every story is different. So you're going to see losses coming out of the Wells commercial book, and they're going to be quite idiosyncratic. They're going to be different sizes. And then you're going to see big recoveries too.So that's going to go on for years. It's a multi-year story. A lot of these commercial assets will be restructured or extended and they'll try and buy some time and see if the market doesn't turn back in their direction. Because does Wells Fargo want to take over a big multifamily building? No. They want that building to be functional and healthy and be able to support the tenants.So that, to me, is going to be the story for most banks going forward in the next year. It's not going to be residential. This is not like 2008. This is a different kind of credit story with multifamily as well as commercial office space, kind of on the block. You can see it in the specialty press if you follow the Real Deal and some of the other media that really focus on the commercial market. It's all over the place.You've got buildings going into bankruptcy being auctioned, you've got other buildings that are financing in good order. You've got cities like San Francisco. You know, no bank wants exposure in San Francisco right now. And I think the Bank regulators have told the banks to be very careful of legacy, B and C class, urban office space. That's been the message for a while.So I think every bank I look at, credit, efficiency, and how well they recover from default, is always one of the first things I assess. And I think the small banks have commercial exposures in the community. And then as you get up into the bigger banks, they're national. They have exposure to all kinds of deals everywhere.You can see fatigue in places like Texas, and some of the other hot markets, they're definitely overbuilt now. Houston, even, believe it or not, Austin, Texas, which has received enormous amounts of inflows of investment over the last few years.- Yeah, certainly a story that really varies--RICHARD CHRISTOPHER WHALEN: New York City.- We have regional--RICHARD CHRISTOPHER WHALEN: There's a lot of mezzanine finance in New York City held by banks. So we'll hear about that.- Yeah. And then there's also, of course, the pockets, like you were saying, that are strong and that are on solid footing within commercial real estate outside of office. Chris, let's look ahead to next week because we're also going to be getting a report here from Goldman Sachs. And we know Goldman obviously more exposed or more reliant, I should say, on trading and deal activity. Are we going to see a different type of report from Goldman.Oh, yeah, you always do. They're much more focused on your investment banking side. I think the guidance has been that side of the House is going to be light. You're going to see credit expenses continue to work themselves out as they shut down markets and get out of that business really.And then the question is cost of funds for the whole enterprise. It's going to be high. They and Morgan Stanley, frankly, have both seen the market side of their business, reprice very quickly. So they're paying market rates today.They both have banks. Morgan Stanley's got a bigger bank than Goldman. And the bank doesn't really support either firm entirely. It's not like Schwab or the bank is kind of a nice thing to have but they don't need it. So I think that-- the way I would put it is I'm looking to see how well the capital markets business is being managed, and see if they can avoid other credit, you know, stumbles, I guess, is the way I would put it.Morgan Stanley is in a different space right now than Goldman. They have bigger AUM. I think a more stable business, frankly.- All right, well, we will see what the results next week tell us about the health of those two banks, Chris Whalen, always great to speak with you, of Whalen Global Advisors.RICHARD CHRISTOPHER WHALEN: Have a great weekend, guys.- Thank you. You too.]"

Crossmark Global Investments Chief Market Strategist Victoria Fernandez says banks so far are ""off to a pretty decent start for this quarter."" Hennessy Large Cap Financial Fund Manager David Ellison agrees, saying the banks benefitted not just from the rush to safety following the banking crisis, but also from higher rates. Both Fernandez and Ellison joined Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the results and they reveal about the health of the U.S. financial system.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: The results from big banks kicking off a closely watched earnings season. The so-called big six will demonstrate if they recovered from one of the most challenging periods for the industry since the financial crisis. JPMorgan's results show it's still able to make lots of money from its loans and franchises but will smaller rivals hold up? And just how healthy is the financial sector?A lot of big questions there. We're going to bring you in some big guests. David Ellison, Hennessy Large Cap Financial Fund portfolio manager, and Victoria Fernandez who is the Crossmark Global Investments Chief Market Strategist.Thank you both for taking the time here with us this morning. We've got a lot to dig into especially on the back of these bank earnings. What is this tee up for the rest of earnings season from your perspective, Victoria?VICTORIA FERNANDEZ: Well, I think when we're looking at this earning season, we have expectations that they were going to be down around 7%. That's what analysts were saying. And everyone looks at JPMorgan to say, all right, let's kick it off and get a feel for what we're going to get.And if you look at the numbers we've seen so far, Brian was talking about a minute ago, you have Delta, PepsiCo, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, they all did really well. Now we know the bar has been lowered, so the question that a lot of people had is, is just beating the number good enough right now? Well, based on what the stocks are doing, it seems like it is.Story continuesSo does this hold up for the rest of the quarter? We don't know. Margins is something that we want to really pay attention to in regards to the pricing power of companies. When you look at the net interest income that you're seeing on these banks, it's telling you that they're doing well.Loan growth was up at least in the big banks. We know we're going to see some differences when it comes to the regional banks. It's a very different story. Their balance sheets look very different. But for now, to kick it all off, it seems like we're off to a pretty decent start for this quarter.JULIE HYMAN: Hey, David, let's get into the banks a little bit more. Your area of focus here. JPMorgan again just like hitting it out of the park and it just fascinating to me, the consistency. Yes, they got a lift from First Republic. What stands out to you from the quarter?DAVID ELLISON: Well, I think the investment banking was a lot better than I thought it was going to be. But I think, generally, they benefited from the fact that they got covered, in a sense, by the government during the Silicon Valley problem where everybody said, well, they're going to be OK? So everybody rushed to the big banks. And they're benefiting from that and so is Wells Fargo and a little bit of Citigroup as well.But I think, generally, people have been worried about credit since 2008. And Jamie Dimon is my age. I went through 2008 like he did. And I don't think we're going to have a credit problem. We're going to have a normalization of credit. And so the real story in this space is what's happened to the yield curve the last two, three years. And we're starting to see the benefits of higher rates for the banks.And I think, historically, this is a great range for the banks to operate in. If they can make the loans at 6%, 8% and raise money at 3, 4, or 5, that's great for them. And we haven't had this rate structure in almost 20 years. So we're going to start to see that manifest itself in earnings and higher net interest income over the next year or so, maybe two years.JULIE HYMAN: David, how concerned are you about expenses at the banks. That was a big area of focus going into these earnings reports. I see for JPMorgan, there was an 11% increase in non-interest expenses, in part, because of compensation.Wells Fargo, the total there $13 billion. And we saw an increase in expenses over its city of 9% as well. Is that concerning level at all, or is it something that you think that investors need to pay attention to?DAVID ELLISON: Well, certainly, I haven't had the chance to really dig into what's going on there, but I think, generally, they're still battling a lot of regulatory stuff. Obviously the Silicon Valley thing generated a lot of concern about what they were doing.You know, they really haven't benefited from technology like other companies have. They've had a lot of competition, so they've had to keep expenses up meaning their competition from other non-depository. So I think, generally, that's-- to me, that's not the story.Again, I'm going to come back to the fact that the yield curve has been historically ugly for these guys. That's bad for the banking industry. As that unwinds in the next couple of years, you're going to see big increases in earnings. And these big five-- these big seven banks, I think they're going to be great places to be long-term. You throw in a little M&amp;A and you've got a pretty good view forward or a pretty good runway here in the next couple of years.BRAD SMITH: Victoria, it's particularly interesting how the banks talk about the consumer right now and the state of the consumer. You've got JPMorgan basically saying that it's spending-- they're still spending, but a little bit more slowly. And then even if you look through some of the card metrics that these banks have put forward, Citi, they saw double digit cards growth.So I wonder. Even if they're saying that the consumer is healthy right now, at what point does the consumer start to show signs of being unhealthy, especially if they're leaning more into some of the credit services or the card services that banks have, and they're changing the way that they spend even if they're not spending as much as they were before, they're just changing or tapping different areas of spending as their cash buffers run out?Right. And we have seen that all through COVID, the shift in the way that consumers are spending. But we look at credit card debt. I mean, Julie was talking a minute ago. You've got JPMorgan, you've got Citi. These are the two biggest in credit card issuance.You look at Capital One Financial that does a lot of credit card business, they actually came out this week and said they're seeing delinquencies go up some. So think you have to start watching what those delinquency rates look like. Right now, I don't think it's something to be concerned with. The consumer continues to be strong.But here's what I think we need to pay attention to. We talk about the consumer slowing down. But if we see inflation continue to go on a downward trajectory and the wages and the labor market stay strong which is the situation that we're seeing, then real incomes actually are going to go higher. We could actually see more demand come out of consumers.And then where does that spending go? Does it go back to goods? Are we going to see goods inflation start to rise again? It's very much a cycle that we have to work through. And because the labor market is continuing to hold on, you've got a consumer that's continuing to spend.Even though we've seen saving rates come down, right? During COVID, what? Savings rates got up to around 35%. They're down now, back to around more historical averages around 5% or 6%, but still they have the ability to spend. And I think until we see the labor market really have some large cracks in it, until we really see those layoffs come in and people starting to struggle, then you're going to continue to see credit cards do well and the consumer spend.JULIE HYMAN: David, as you look at the banks going into the second half of the year, is there anything that could derail what looks like some good forward momentum here? I mean, we are obviously going to see some fading effect from the First Republic boon that JPMorgan got, for example, is there anything else you're watching that is a risk?DAVID ELLISON: Well, I think the risk is that the yield curve stays very inverted, and we get a big rally in the long end meaning rates fall and the short end doesn't fall because the Fed is not going to let that happen, let's say, for the next six or nine months, and then you're back into a squeeze on margins.So I think-- the credit issue, I obviously think about it, but I'd rather have be making loans at 6%, 7%, 8% and have credit problems than to be making loans at 3% and have no credit problems, because it's a much better model for an active managed portfolio manager like myself, because I can hopefully pick the better managers that are going to make the better loans and be able to take advantage.So I think the risk is still in my mind, the term structure of interest rates. That's been the problem. That was Silicon Valley. That's why JPMorgan got that great-- they made a great purchase, and they're seeing the benefit of that now. That was all the term structure of interest rates.And so if the term structure of interest rates improves, I think the stocks all go up. If it stays where they are and gets worse, the stocks go down.]"

But are positive earnings calls enough to signal banks are in the ""all clear"" after financial shakeups in regional banks earlier this year? Nathan Stovall, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence Director on Financial Institutions Research, and CFRA Research Director of Equity Research Ken Leon join Yahoo Finance Live to review the outlook for other big banks, taking into consideration the health of the U.S. consumer and pushes for tighter capital requirements by regulators.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Well, the results from the big banks kicked off a closely-watched earnings season. JP Morgan coming out strong in the second quarter, thanks in part to higher interest rates. Profit of the bank jumping 67% lifted by, as well, the company's acquisition of the failed First Republic Bank in early May. CEO Jamie Dimon touted the strength of the consumer on the earnings call this morning but warning there are still substantial headwinds.JAMIE DIMON: The consumer's in good shape. They're spending that excess cash. That's it-- that's all tailwinds. Even if we go to recession, we're going with rather good condition with low borrowings and good house price value still, but the headwinds are substantial and somewhat unprecedented.This war in Ukraine, oil, gas, quantitative tightening, unprecedented fiscal needs of governments, QT which we've never experienced before. And I just think people should take a deep breath in that. And though we don't know where those things are going to put us in a soft landing, a mild recession, or a hard recession.JULIE HYMAN: For more on this, let's bring in Nathan Stovall, S&amp;P Global Market director and-- director of Financial Institutions Research and Ken Leon, CFRA Research director of Equity Research. Good to see you guys. Thank you both for being here.Nathan, let's start with you here. As we look at the banks here, it feels like they're navigating-- it's not like this environment right now is unquestionably good for banks. And yet, they seem to be navigating it pretty well here. Is that how you would assess it? And how do you think they're doing so?Story continuesNATHAN STOVALL: I think the prints this morning were really strong. I mean, there were two real big issues we were looking at coming into this around liquidity and specifically around the cost of deposits and the stability of deposits and then credit. And on both fronts, the big banks look pretty good here.But I don't know if we can provide a clear readthrough to the rest of the group. Notwithstanding for the reasons that Jamie mentioned earlier, it's still a little bit early. We-- I agree with a lot of the things that he said. The consumer is strong. We feel like we are headed towards normalization rather than sort of a severe downturn. But the other, I would point out, is that the big banks seem to have benefited from inflows of deposits from smaller institutions, particularly the regional banks.So while these numbers are good, and they've definitely beat expectations on a lot of those metrics, whether it's credit cost or margins and the cost of deposits, I don't know if we can sort of blow an all clear here and provide a readthrough to the rest of the group quite yet.BRAD SMITH: Ken, what do you think? Are we able to call any type of all clear? Or is there still more that needs to be uncovered?KEN LEON: Well, it's great to be here and also with a former colleague, Nathan. So the second quarter is an inflection point. We're not firing on all cylinders. The economy is resilient both for consumer and commercial lending. The spreads between deposit costs and the earnings yields, they're probably going to narrow. But if the economy remains healthy, we will see loan volume growth.We also are at the inflection point, maybe the trough of the investment banking cycle. So for the big six which are diversified banks, we're likely to see a pickup in investment banking phase. Trading is what it is. There's volatility that helps. And I think the intention for next year for analysts is going to focus on two things.One would be is there a decline in net interest income, particularly if rates flatten or go down, and second, the big issue is return of capital off of Michael Barr's speech, the vice-chair of the Fed on a holistic capital structure. It means more regulated capital needed. That's the big deal for investors.JULIE HYMAN: It is a big deal for investors, Nathan. But given, again, the sort of resilience of the banks here, how big of a deal? I mean, particularly for JP Morgan, right? If you see these additional capital requirements coming through, how big of a hit is that really going to be for the bottom line and for the stock price?NATHAN STOVALL: Well, I think Jamie tried to speak to that earlier and basically say that they'll pivot. They'll find ways to adjust to a higher capital regime. And that's what we've heard from most of the banking industry. And there are some institutions that would come up short if you'll get the group that is above $100 billion in assets in terms of capital levels and where they could go. But I do think it is manageable.And then, Ken's point around capital return, that is something that we're waiting for. And I think everybody's kind of in this wait-and-see mode, both from where the regulatory environment is going to go as well as where the credit environment is going to go. And it's a little bit early to say.But I think it is something that they absolutely could adjust to and where these things are being traded right now in price right now, they're not necessarily being priced off of current earnings. I mean, there's still a lot of doubt priced into these stocks, particularly the regional names. So I think that they can adjust to it. And if the results are better than people expect, then I'm not so sure he's had a huge of a story for them.BRAD SMITH: Nathan, what did you make of the way that some of the CEOs and leadership at the banks right now are talking about the consumer and how they're evaluating where balance sheets for households are as well as some of their spending patterns?NATHAN STOVALL: One, if you look at the consumer remains really strong. Unemployment is still really low. Household debt to income is still near a 40-year low, about 1 and 1/2 percentage points below the 40-year average. And while we've seen savings rates come down, and we've seen excess savings that were accumulated during the pandemic come down, we're still sitting on some. We've seen card delinquencies come up, but they're still below pre-pandemic levels.So we're still seeing lots of health in the consumer. And I happen to agree with them right now that it doesn't necessarily match some of the fears in the marketplace. Now it's still early. We're only a year plus into this higher-rate regime. You could really even say six months into, really, a land of higher rates. And it takes a while for that to be processed. So I think the jury is a little bit still out. But the consumer does remain strong and is showing quite a bit of resilience here.JULIE HYMAN: And we're still also really, really early in the earnings season, right? Yes, we've gotten these three big banks today, but there are a lot more to come. So Ken, when you look at what we have heard, what can you extrapolate to the rest of the banks, particularly, say, the regionals? And are there any that you're specifically worried about?KEN LEON: Yeah, so as we go downstream in size, there's the super regionals which were still very positive like PNC. But then as you get into mid-sized banks, below $100 billion, areas that matter is just the traditional lending and whether they're able to drive still higher net-interest income.Commercial real estate picks up as a risk as you go to the smaller banks as well simply because they're not diversified. They also don't have the ability to generate the excess funds that the largest banks can do who are gaining market share out there in consumer banking and perhaps middle markets and small business. So it's tough game for small banks they need to consolidate.JULIE HYMAN: And then, in a different kind of bank, I want to bring up Goldman Sachs with you, Ken, because you just downgraded it from strong buy to neutral, I believe.KEN LEON: Sure.JULIE HYMAN: So what's the deal there? Goldman-- there's been a lot of noise around Goldman lately.KEN LEON: That's right. So we actually-- during the bank crisis, if you will, in March-- upgraded it from hold to strong buy. A little bit too early on this inflection point of the investment banking cycle. But Goldman has other issues as well. And they're also indicating that the second quarter might be throw the kitchen sink in with large write-offs of some of these non-core businesses.It's also body language from David Solomon, whether he can show that the strategy they have is going to work. They will gain wallet share in the core business. There's no question about that. But they missed valuable time in the last few years as other competitors have really gained a size and spend market share in investment and wealth management. So it's going to be a tough issue for David Solomon and the financial media. And investors are all over that next Wednesday.JULIE HYMAN: Yes, we will be. Thanks so much, guys. Good to see you. Nathan Stovall, S&amp;P Global Market director of Financial Institutions Research, and Ken Leon, CFRA Research director of Equity Research. Thanks to you both.]"

Among them are Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Omnicom Group (OMC) which are both scheduled to report next Tuesday, July 18.Here’s a look at what’s in store for Lockheed Martin and Omnicom''s Q2 reports and why now may be a good time to buy.Lockheed Martin (LMT)Lockheed Martin’s stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) going into its second-quarter earnings report next week.As the largest defense contractor in the world, Lockheed Martin’s stock remains attractive with the company already securing lucrative contracts so far this year.Last quarter CEO Jim Taiclet stated that Lockheed Martin has secured a contract for the United States sea-based hypersonic missile program, Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS), delivering the first F-16 fighter aircraft out of its new Greenville, South Carolina factory while also being selected to provide 88 F-35 fifth-generation fighter aircraft to Canada.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ2 Preview: Lockheed Martin’s Q2 earnings are expected to soar 223% at $6.43 per share compared to EPS of $1.99 in the prior-year quarter. Sales for the quarter are forecasted to be up 2% to $15.86 billion. Notably, Lockheed Martin has surpassed earnings expectations for nine consecutive quarters.Annual earnings are now forecasted to be roughly flat in fiscal 2023 but rise 4% in FY24 at $28.13 per share. Total sales are also expected to be virtually flat this year but rise 3% in FY24 to $67.79 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchP/E Valuation: What is most intriguing about Lockheed Martin’s stock is that at $464 a share, it currently trades at 17.2X forward earnings which is nicely beneath the S&amp;P 500’s 21.2X. Furthermore, Lockheed Martin is the clear-cut leader in its space and trades at a nice discount to the Aerospace-Defense Industry average of 28.8X while also trading 32% below its decade-long high of 25.3X and roughly on par with the median of 17X.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOmnicom Group (OMC)Also sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Omnicom is one of the world's largest advertising, marketing, and corporate communications companies and is certainly worthy of investors’ attention going into its Q2 report.With operations in most major global markets, Omnicom is starting to see stronger organic revenue growth following the pandemic and this should continue as global inflationary headwinds subside.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ2 Preview: Omnicom’s Q2 earnings are expected to rise 7% from a year ago at $1.80 per share with sales forecasted to be up 1% to $3.62 billion. Even better, Omnicom has surpassed earnings expectations for an astonishing 29 consecutive quarters dating back to April of 2016.Fiscal 2023 earnings are now projected to rise 7% and edge up another 4% in FY24 at $7.72 per share. On the top line, sales are expected to be up 3% this year and rise another 3% in FY24 to $15.23 billion. More importantly, FY23 and FY24 sales projections would eclipse pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $14.95 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchP/E valuation: With Omnicom stock trading at $96 a share its P/E valuation is also attractive at 12.9X forward earnings and well below the benchmark. Plus, Omnicom trades close to the industry average of 11.1X while trading 32% below its decade high of 19.1X and at a modest discount to the median of 13.5X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineLockheed Martin and Omnicom are two giants in their respective industries that offer dividends yeilds over 2% and well above the S&amp;P 500's 1.41% average.Now appears to be a good time to buy as their stocks are starting to stand out in terms of price-to-earnings valuation and both companies are expected to post strong quarterly results next week.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

NWSA, World Wrestling Entertainment WWE, Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF.A) and IMAX Corp. IMAX.Industry: EntertainmentLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2120503/4-stocks-to-watch-from-a-prospering-entertainment-industryThe Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry is benefiting from a spike in demand for digital entertainment, fueled by limited capacity and operational limitations in movie theaters, theme parks and cruise lines. Increased consumption of media, music and news over the web, triggered by the work-and-learn-at-home wave, has been a key catalyst for industry participants like News Corp., World Wrestling Entertainment, Lions Gate Entertainment and IMAX Corp.Companies have been focusing on a superior product strategy and prudent capital investments. Steady recovery in the advertising spending environment and resumption of production pipelines bode well for film and television production companies.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry comprises companies involved in film and TV production, distribution and exhibition. The main activities of the industry participants include the production and distribution of entertainment content to theaters, TV networks, video-on-demand platforms, streaming services and other exhibitors. Imax offers entertainment technology and specializes in motion picture technologies and presentations.Industry participants produce and distribute motion pictures for theatrical and straight-to-video releases besides TV programming. These players are heavily dependent on the box-office performance of their films, both domestically and internationally, the number of film releases, and the ratings of TV shows.3 Film and Television Production Industry Trends in FocusOver-the-Top Services Gaining Prominence: Companies involved in content creation are looking to distribute content through over-the-top services to leverage the popularity of their franchises. With this, they are looking to provide exclusive content and a differentiated experience. However, streaming companies are increasingly producing original and award-winning feeds to reduce licensing costs and excessive dependence on third-party content providers. This is likely to hurt industry participants' content distribution strategy.Story continuesBinge-Watching Driving Consumption: Factors such as binge-watching, deepening Internet penetration, and advancement in mobile, video, and wireless technologies have got viewers glued to small screens. In order to keep pace with new consumption patterns, industry participants are turning to digital content distribution. The emergence of digital capabilities is making consumer data easily available to companies.With the use of AI tools, production houses are gaining a better understanding of user preferences. This helps them produce content that strikes a chord with viewers. However, increasing spending on content and sales &amp; marketing is hurting profitability due to stiff competition from streaming players.Technological Advancement Aids Prospects: Exhibitors are turning to highly efficient and cost-effective technologies like laser-based projection systems to enhance image quality and the entire movie experience. Additionally, the use of technologies like motion seating, immersive audio systems and interactive movies among others is expected to enhance the viewing experience.The increasing adoption of AR and VR technologies bodes well for industry participants. However, the evolution of alternative motion picture distribution channels such as home video, pay-per-view, streaming services, video-on-demand, Internet and syndicated and broadcast television is hurting exhibitors.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector.

The FTC was seeking an injunction to prevent Microsoft from moving to close the deal as early as this weekend.The FTC declined to comment on the ruling.U.S. District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley's earlier ruling, published Tuesday, said the FTC hadn't shown that the deal would cause substantial harm. She focused, in part, on Microsoft's promises and economic incentive to keep Call of Duty available on rivals to its own Xbox gaming system, such as Sony's PlayStation and Nintendo's Switch.In its appeal, the FTC argued Corley made “fundamental errors.”“This case is about more than a single video game and the console hardware to play it,” the FTC said. “It is about the future of the gaming industry. At stake is how future gamers will play and whether the emerging subscription and cloud markets will calcify into concentrated, walled gardens or evolve into open, competitive landscapes.”Story continuesThe case has been a difficult test for the FTC's stepped-up scrutiny of the tech industry's business practices under its chairperson, Lina Khan, appointed in 2021 by President Joe Biden. Standing legal doctrine has favored mergers between companies that don't directly compete with one another.Khan came under fire from Republicans at a hearing Thursday in the House of Representatives for the agency’s enforcement record, with one California lawmaker questioning whether the FTC was picking losing fights against mergers on purpose to pressure Congress to update its antitrust laws.“Absolutely not,” Khan replied, while acknowledging that “unfortunately, things don’t always go our way.”The FTC's appeal said Corley, herself a Biden nominee, applied the wrong legal standard by effectively requiring its attorneys to prove their full case now rather than in a trial due to start in August before the FTC’s in-house judge.It was the FTC, however, that had asked Corley for an urgent hearing on its request to block Microsoft and Activision Blizzard from rushing to close the deal. The agency's argument was that if the deal closed now, it would be harder to reverse the merger if it was later found to violate antitrust laws.In its response to the appeal, Microsoft countered that it could “readily divest” Activision Blizzard later if it had to. It has long defended the deal as good for gaming.The deal still faces an obstacle in the United Kingdom, though one it now appears closer to surmounting.British antitrust regulators on Friday extended their deadline to issue a final order on the proposed merger, allowing them to consider Microsoft's “detailed and complex submission” pleading its case.The Competition and Markets Authority had rejected the deal over fears it would stifle competition for popular game titles in the fast-growing cloud gaming market.But the U.K. watchdog appears to have softened its position after Corley thwarted U.S. regulators’ efforts to block the deal.The authority says it has pushed its original deadline back six weeks to Aug. 29 so it could go through Microsoft’s response, which details “material changes in circumstance and special reasons” why regulators shouldn’t issue an order to reject the deal.___AP Technology Writer Michael Liedtke contributed to this story.]"

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Paychex PAYX, CME Group CME and Adobe ADBE.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:""Software is Eating the World""In a 2011 Wall Street Journal Article, famous founder, technologist, and venture capital legend Marc Andreessen once wrote that ""Software is eating the world."" The quote was in response to the fact that, at the time, many Wall Street analysts were arguing that tech companies had valuations that were too high.However, in a brilliant act of foresight, Andreessen correctly predicted the wave of software into the economy by saying, ""My own theory is that we are in the middle of a dramatic and broad technological and economic shift in which software companies are poised to take over large swathes of the economy."" While the article dates back to 2011, the meteoric shift that Andreesen predicted is still taking place today, and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock Shopify is at the forefront.Company OverviewShopify provides a cloud-based commerce platform for small and medium-sized businesses. In simple terms, people use the Shopify platform to help create and manage their online businesses. Shopify empowers online businesses with website setup, product showcases, payment processing, and shipping.With Shopify, users can choose from various templates to design and customize their store to fit their brand and brand goals. From its IPO in 2014, the stock was a market leader from a fundamental and technical perspective. Shares rose from single digits to more than $140 per share.Strong Earnings Growth AnticipatedThough the stock finally corrected at the end of 2020, it remains the dominant player in its space. While the stock fell during and in the aftermath of COVID-19, the fall was likely not company-specific but rather due to profit-taking and the macro environment. Ironically, the COVID-19 pandemic became a massive catalyst because it sped up e-commerce adoption and, thus, SHOP.Story continuesAnalysts agree. Analysts who cover Shopify foresee robust earnings over the coming quarters.A Positive Earnings ESP Score The company also beat earnings by 125% last quarter and sports a positive Earnings ESP score which suggests that it is likely to beat earnings when it reports in early August.Technical Breakout Finally, the price chart is shaping up. Earlier this year, the 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day moving average to form a bullish golden cross. Yesterday, SHOP broke out of a multi-week base structure on massive volume turnover.ValuationThough Shopify has grown its earnings dramatically since its IPO in 2015, its price-to-sales ratio is hovering near all-time lows. Furthermore, analysts predict record earnings within the next two years. Meanwhile, the stock is well off its all-time high of over $160.Industry StrengthThe old saying that ""birds of a feather tend to flock together"" applies in the stock market. That's good news for Shopify investors. Other software names, such Unity Software and Salesforce broke out this week – lending more credibility to the move in Shopify.ConclusionShopify stands out from all angles. The software leader has top-tier fundamentals, a historically low valuation, strong analyst estimates, and an attractive chart pattern. Expect Shopify shares to be much higher into 2024.Bear of the Day:Founded in 1931 and headquartered in Northbrook, IL, The Allstate Corporation is the third-largest property-casualty (P&amp;C) insurer and the largest publicly-held personal lines carrier in the U.S. Beyond property insurance, the company also provides a range of life insurance and investment products to its diverse customer base.HeadwindsCatastrophic Loss RiskThe risk of losses due to catastrophic losses is unavoidable for companies like Allstate that are in the property insurance business. Though Allstate's management can do its best to reduce such losses through its catastrophe management strategy and reinsurance programs, it cannot control the weather. Weather-related losses over the years have put a strain on the company and have increased dramatically since 2019.For example, in 2022, the company incurred roughly $3.1 billion in catastrophic losses. Meanwhile, in 2023, losses from weather-related damages are expected to more than double year-over-year.Ballooning DebtThe catastrophic losses incurred by the company have led to exploding levels of debt. Since 2020, Allstate's debt-to-equity ratio has more than doubled. Remember, the more debt a company incurs, the more interest it will pay.Lack of Growth and High ValuationThe two main investor baskets that exist are growth and value – or a combination of the two (Growth at a Reasonable Price, or GARP). Unfortunately for Allstate's stock, the company is unattractive from both perspectives. Last quarter, the company posted a loss of $1.30 per share in EPS. Meanwhile, abysmal single-digit sales growth is expected until the end of 2024.Conversely, despite the lack of growth and expected growth moving forward, Allstate remains overvalued. ALL's price-to-book ratio of 1.84 is much higher than its peer groups price to book of 1.62.Relative WeaknessAllstate is a relatively stable, slow-growth, old economy type company. In the current risk-on market environment, stocks like Allstate are lagging, while growthy, tech-oriented stocks outperform.TakeawayUnpredictability, a high valuation, and rising debt are reasons to avoid Allstate shares. Furthermore, the stock is in a poor environment, and the chart indicates relative weakness.Additional content:3 Incredible Stocks Trading at Historical DiscountsWhen great stocks go on sale investors must act decisively.Rarely do the best companies trade down to deep discounts, but when they do finally get below their historic averages, it can be a powerful signal for strong forward returns.Today I will share three extremely high-quality businesses, with long histories of successful execution, winning business models, and high Zacks Ranks.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to 10 Highest-Paying Summer Jobs for Teens.As reported by the Department of Labor in April 2023, with 9.8 million job openings and 5.7 million unemployed Americans, the labor scarcity has caused wages to rise, particularly for teenagers. In fact, teens have experienced a 7% increase in their median weekly summer pay between 2019 and 2022 and surpassed the other age groups.Interestingly, there has been also a shift in priorities among teenagers. In May, the percentage of US teens who were either employed or actively seeking employment stood at 36.8%, which is higher than the pre-pandemic low of 32.5% in 2014. However, it is still lower than the consistent 50% or more observed before 2001. Economists often attribute this decline to changes in priorities, such as a greater focus on education, unpaid internships, and participation in extracurricular activities.Teens Are Making a Comeback in SummersOne job area where these trends become particularly evident is at pools and beaches, where a shortage of lifeguards had resulted in limited job opportunities. For instance, the city of Seattle has been facing severe staffing shortages which led them to increase the starting wage for lifeguards to $21 per hour or higher. It's worth noting that different states have varied rates of teen employment during summer. In 2022, Nebraska had the highest teen employment rate of 65.9%, while Hawaii had the lowest, at 23.7%.In fact, according to Gusto, a payroll process for small businesses, teenagers is expected to account for nearly 1 in 5 summer hires this year. While many adults in the U.S. who were affected by the pandemic have returned to their jobs, teenagers have been quick to re-enter the job market, specifically for summer jobs. Experts attribute this trend to the attractively higher wages and a desire to break free from the routine of remote classes and other constraints they may have experienced due to Covid-19.Story continuesWhere Can Teens Work?Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) provides an exceptional opportunity for teen jobs with its inclusive policies and commitment to education.

PM is likely to register top-line growth when it reports second-quarter 2023 earnings on Jul 20. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $8,688 million, suggesting growth of 10.9% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line has declined by a penny in the past seven days to $1.47 per share. The projection indicates a decrease of 0.7% from the figure reported in the year-ago period quarter. Philip Morris has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 10.4%, on average.Factors to ConsiderPhilip Morris has been benefiting from its strong pricing power, which has aided its revenues and adjusted operating income. Though higher pricing might lead to a possible decline in cigarette consumption, it is seen that smokers tend to absorb price increases due to the addictive quality of cigarettes.Philip Morris International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePhilip Morris International Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Philip Morris International Inc. QuoteHigher pricing variance was an upside to the company’s performance (mainly due to increased combustible tobacco pricing) in the first quarter of 2023. The continuation of this trend is likely to aid results in the second quarter.With reduced-risk products (RRPs) gaining popularity, Philip Morris is also benefiting from its business transformation, with smoke-free products generating 34.9% of the company’s net revenues in the first quarter of 2023. PM is well-placed toward becoming a majority smoke-free company by 2025. To this end, the company’s IQOS, a heat-not-burn device, counts among one of the leading RRPs in the industry.Total IQOS users at the end of the first quarter were estimated at roughly 25.8 million (of which nearly 18.5 million had switched to IQOS and stopped smoking). For 2023, management expects heated tobacco unit (HTU) shipment volumes of 125-130 billion units. These factors bode well for the quarter to be reported.However, cigarette volumes, in general, have been affected by consumers’ rising health consciousness and a shift to low-risk tobacco alternatives. In 2023, the total international industry volume is estimated to decline by 1-2%, excluding China and the United States.  Total cigarette and HTU shipment volume growth is likely to come in the range of around flat to an increase of 1%.Apart from this, the company has been battling cost-related headwinds for a while now. In the first quarter of 2023, the adjusted operating income tumbled 10.7% on an organic basis due to elevated marketing, administration and research costs, an adverse volume/mix and escalated manufacturing costs, partly compensated by favorable pricing variance. Management expects certain margin pressures in the first half of 2023.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Philip Morris this time.

This company, which is in the Zacks Aerospace - Defense Equipment industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This aircraft components maker has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7.89%.For the most recent quarter, TransDigm was expected to post earnings of $5.46 per share, but it reported $5.98 per share instead, representing a surprise of 9.52%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $4.31 per share, while it actually produced $4.58 per share, a surprise of 6.26%.For TransDigm, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.TransDigm has an Earnings ESP of +1.53% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about HCA Healthcare (HCA).HCA currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.38, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 21 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.38 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 21 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 76.2% and 9.5% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for HCABroker Rating Breakdown Chart for HCACheck price target &amp; stock forecast for HCA here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying HCA, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is HCA a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for HCA, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0% over the past month to $18.10.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for HCA. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for HCA may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

82,c135cd30-d6d8-30d4-8ba6-3031cc7fd72c,PPG,2023-07-15,3 Stocks Expected to Beat Earnings Next Week,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-expected-beat-earnings-211400184.html,1689369240,STORY,"['NFLX', 'TSLA', 'PPG']","[Next week will begin Q2 earnings season in earnest, and as always, those reports will play a critical role in determining the state of the economy, and path of the stock market.Among the litany of analytics tools at Zacks, the Earnings Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) might be the coolest. The Earnings ESP looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.According to the ESP, Tesla TSLA, Netflix NFLX, and PPG Industries PPG are all set to beat analyst estimates at their scheduled earnings announcements next week. Additionally, all three have very strong long-term expectations with Tesla and Netflix projecting earnings growth greater than 20% annually over the next 3-5 years and PPG Industries set to grow at 18%.While beating estimates may not always guarantee a stock trade higher, on average it plays favorably so long as there isn’t particularly bad news following the beat. Thus, these three stocks are definitely worth keeping an eye on next week.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTeslaTesla is having a tremendous year so far, up 127% YTD, and growing sales even faster than most anticipated. That, along with the news of its charger network set to be standardized for broad adoption in the US, Tesla continues to lead the EV transition.TSLA’s Earnings ESP is forecasting a 2.41% beat at next weeks quarterly earnings report. Tesla is scheduled to announce its results Wednesday, July 19 after the market close.Story continuesAlthough Telsa has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, it has begun to see its earnings estimates rise over the last couple of months. Current quarterly earnings have been revised higher by 3.75% and are expected to climb 9.2% YoY.Also worth noting, sales are projected to grow a whopping 47% YoY to $25 billion. The automaker is riding on the robust demand for Models 3 and Y, which form a major chunk of its total deliveries. Deliveries of Model 3/Y witnessed a CAGR of more than 100% over the last 3 years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNetflixNetflix has staged an incredible comeback so far this year. After collapsing -76% in 2022 the stock has more than doubled off its lows.Even in the uber-competitive streaming landscape Netflix dominates with 232 million global subscribers, and plenty of room to grow, especially in developing markets.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewAccording to the Earnings ESP, Netflix is slated to beat earnings by 2.9%. Current quarter earnings are projected to see a -12.2% decline YoY so if the streaming service manages to beat these subdued estimates it could continue its campaign higher.Furthermore, while near-term earnings are expected to decline, looking further out they are set to see considerable growth. FY24 earnings are expected to grow 31%, along with 13% sales growth, so we can expect the streaming service to continue its expansion, even with the competition nipping at its heels.Netflix is also trading at a historically discounted valuation. At 40x one year forward earnings it is below the industry average of 51x, and below its five-year median of 60.5x.Netflix is scheduled to report earnings Wednesday, July 19 after the market closes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPPG IndustriesPPG industries, the global supplier of paints, coatings, chemicals, specialty materials, glass, and fiber glass boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating strongly upward trending earnings revisions. Current quarter earnings estimates have been revised higher by 0.5% and are expected to climb 18.2% YoY.The Zacks Earnings ESP also expects PPG to exceed earnings estimates by 2.6% at the coming announcement. PPG reports earnings Thursday July 20, after the market closes.Always sweetening the deal, PPG also offers a dividend yield of 1.6%. The company has a long history of raising dividend payments and has done so for 51 consecutive years making it one of the few Dividend Kings. The company has increased the payment by an average of 6.5% annually over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThe Earnings ESP is just one of many tools investors can use to analyze and pick stocks at Zacks.

This agreement marks a milestone for Johnson Matthey as it expands its footprint in the three major hydrogen markets of the United States, Europe and China.The agreement outlines plans to construct a state-of-the-art catalyst coated membrane (CCM) production facility. This facility will be dedicated to producing CCMs for multiple proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell applications and PEM electrolysers. With an initial capacity of up to 5GW, the facility will be located in Shanghai's Jiading district, a designated Hydrogen industrial zone, and is expected to commence operations in 2025.

The airport will begin with a fleet of five hydrogen fuel cell vehicles for employee usage, with ambitions to grow the fleet to as many as 100 cars to act as an airport taxi service. The vehicles' fueling will begin next week. Air Products has direct operational experience with more than 250 hydrogen filling station projects in 20 countries.

Furthermore, the station will contain two fuelling stations for light-duty hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The hydrogen refueling station is partially funded by Natural Resources Canada's Zero Emission Vehicle Infrastructure Program.Air Products' efficient mobile fuelers will contribute to the use of hydrogen as an emissions-free transportation fuel as permanent hydrogen infrastructure is established in Western Canada.

Bank of America (BAC), which has a big Wall Street operation, also reports Tuesday. All are expected to show drops in investment banking and trading from the first quarter.What Friday’s results showed is that big banks like JPMorgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) that have sprawling consumer franchises are performing well because they are able to charge more for their loans and benefit from a surge in credit-card borrowing by Americans who still have extra money.""The consumer is in good shape,"" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts. “They are spending down their excess cash.”But Friday also revealed that corporate clients are not providing as much of a lift, which is hurting the banks that rely more heavily on them.CEOs remain cautious about everything from the direction of interest rates to relations with China to the larger US economy, dampening the optimism needed to buy other companies, go public or take on more debt.Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)""Corporates are pretty cautious,"" Fraser told analysts Friday, citing the prospect of another Federal Reserve interest rate hike, tensions with China and concerns about limited economic growth.""I think clients have been trying to understand and get their arms around both the macro and the market outlook for a while. I think they now seem to accept the current environment is the new normal and are beginning to position themselves globally.""Story continuesThis caution was most evident in the performance of Citigroup’s corporate and investment banking unit, which helped push overall profits at the bank down 36%. Investment banking revenue fell by 24% in the second quarter, to $612 million.It wasn’t just Citigroup, though. Even JPMorgan, which churned out massive profits in its consumer business, saw investment banking fees fall by 6% from a year ago, to $1.5 billion.Trading, which was stronger earlier in the year, also turned weaker. Citigroup’s revenue from that business fell 13%. JPMorgan’s revenue associated with trading equities and fixed income also dropped.“Most of the investors stayed on the sidelines” during the second quarter, Fraser said.Solomon under scrutinyThese results do not bode well for Goldman or Morgan Stanley, which rely heavily on deal making and trading for their revenue.Goldman is expected to show an investment banking revenue decline of 32% from a year ago and a trading decline of 17%, according to analyst estimates.That could intensify the scrutiny of CEO David Solomon, who is wrestling with partner unrest and concerns about strategy as he tries to put a consumer-banking experiment behind the company.David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs. (Photo by Patrick T. FALLON / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images) (PATRICK T. FALLON via Getty Images)Goldman is ""indicating that the second quarter might be ‘throw the kitchen sink in’ with larger write offs of some of these non-core businesses,"" Ken Leon, CFRA research director of equity research, told Yahoo Finance Friday.Thus there will be a focus on Solomon and ""whether he can show the strategy they have is going to work,"" Leon said. ""It is going to be a tough issue"" for the CEO.Morgan Stanley is also expected by analysts to show a decline in some of its core businesses, with a 4% drop in investment banking and a 19% decline in trading.'We will see'The global slowdown in dealmaking began last year, following a boom in 2021, causing firms across Wall Street to slash bonuses and staff. Worldwide investment banking revenues for the second quarter fell 52% from a year ago, according to Dealogic.Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Goldman and other firms with big investment banking and trading units have made or announced cuts of roughly 12,000 jobs since the end of 2022.Some observers are still predicting “green shoots” ahead, citing an improvement during the latter half of the second quarter.JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum said investment banking was better than expected in June, but cautioned analysts on Friday that it was “too early” to label it a trend.“We will see,” he said. For overall capital markets ""July should be a good indicator for the remainder of the year.""Smaller banks in the weeks ahead could also show new challenges posed by the behavior of corporate clients.That's what happened Friday to State Street (STT), which serves a lot of institutional clients and was the nation's 12th largest bank as of March 31. It disclosed Friday that its net interest income, which measures the difference between what it earns from loans and pays out in deposits, fell 10% when compared to the first quarter.That's largely because of rising deposit rates and a rotation by State Street customers out of non-interest bearing deposits as they seek higher yields. The bank now expects net interest income to drop 12% to 18% in the coming quarter.Its stock dropped 12% Friday.""What we found is that our larger clients, and we primarily have large, sophisticated clients, are quite active in thinking about their alternatives,” said Eric Aboaf, State Street CFO. “That has been accelerated by the swiftness of this cycle and the place that we've come to and the speed.”Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)A warning for smaller banksThere was also a new warning Friday for smaller banks. That came from State Street (STT), which was the nation's 12th largest as of March 31.In its second quarter results, State Street disclosed that its net interest income, which measures the difference between what it earns from loans and pays out in deposits, fell 10% when compared to the first quarter.That's largely because of rising deposit rates and a rotation by customers out of non-interest-bearing deposits as they seek higher yields. The bank now expects net interest income to drop 12% to 18% in the coming quarter.Read more: High-yield savings account vs. CD: Which is right for you?""What we found is that our larger clients, and we primarily have large, sophisticated clients, are quite active in thinking about their alternatives, and... that has been accelerated by the swiftness of this cycle and the place that we've come to and the speed,"" said Eric Aboaf, State Street CFO.Story continuesSome other mid-sized banks that report their results in the coming weeks have already revised down their expectations for how much of this income they can earn, including executives for US Bancorp (USB), Citizens Financial Group (CFG), Comerica (CMA), Huntington (HBAN), KeyCorp (KEY), and Zions (ZION).State Street's stock closed down 12% Friday.Navigating the chaosThe results kicked off a closely watched earnings season where banks of all sizes will be trying to show that they recovered from one of the most tumultuous periods for the industry since the 2008 financial crisis.JPMorgan demonstrated its hold over the rest of the industry during the chaos of the spring by winning a government-run auction to purchase the bulk of operations of First Republic after regulators seized the San Francisco lender.First Republic was one of three sizable regional banks to fail, along with Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Their seizures triggered a panic in the banking system and outflows of depositors from a number of smaller banks.The deal lifted JPMorgan's second quarter numbers. It said First Republic added $2.4 billion to net income. That helped push overall earnings to $14.5 billion, up 67% from the same period a year ago. Wells Fargo's earnings of $4.9 billion were up 57%.Trouble on Wall StreetThe industry is no longer at the same crisis level as it was in the spring, but second quarter results from some of the biggest banks contained reminders that the industry still faces a number of challenges on several fronts.Citigroup, for example, struggled with a recent drought of dealmaking that is making day-to-day life more difficult for all of Wall Street. Its investment banking revenues fell by 24% to $612 million. Trading was another weakness. Revenue from that activity fell 13%.Citigroup and other firms with big investment banking and trading units have made or announced cuts of roughly 12,000 jobs since the end of 2022. Dealmaking is drying up amid a rise in interest rates and economic uncertainty.Even JPMorgan had challenges on this front. Its investment banking fees fell by 6% from a year ago to $1.5 billion. Its trading revenues from equities and fixed income also fell.'Things are better than people would have expected'What JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup had in common Friday is that they set aside more money to cover future loan losses, a sign they expect the economy to slow in the coming quarters.Many other banks are also expected to do the same when they report their second quarter results.Wells Fargo set aside $1.71 billion in provisions for credit losses in the second quarter, compared with $580 million a year ago. That included a $949 million increase primarily for commercial real estate office loans.""I think things are better than people would have expected at this point in the cycle,"" said Wells Fargo CFO Mike Santomassimo. ""We do expect that they'll be more weakness in the [commercial real estate] market and it's going to take a while to play out.

Second, Whalen says that ""credit is basically flat...because frankly the consumer is still okay.""Whalen also discusses the impact of regulation, something JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned about in his company's earnings release, saying ""material regulatory changes would likely have real world consequences for markets and end users.""

JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, and Citi all beating the Street's expectations. JP Morgan coming out strong in the second quarter. Thanks, in part, to higher interest rates. Profit at the bank jumping 67%. Lifted, in part, by the company's acquisition of the failed first Republic Bank that was back in May.Now, Wells Fargo's profit surged 57%. The bank also raising its annual forecast for net interest income. And Citi beating the Street's expectations. But revenue did fall 1% from a year ago and net income did drop about 36%.So let's break it all down. We want to bring in Chris Whalen, chairman at Whalen Global Advisors. Chris, it's good to see you. So certainly just taking a look at these results from the big banks, specifically Wells Fargo and JP Morgan, very strong numbers here from those two banks. And it's almost like we're just forgetting about some of the crises, some of the strains that we did see within the banking system earlier this year. What's your takeaway from these results and what it signals for the second half?Story continuesRICHARD CHRISTOPHER WHALEN: I think there's two big takeaways. First, the growth in the cost of deposits slowed down. So that's a big positive for the banks. We were worried that we could see deposit rates double this quarter, simply because of the aftershock from the three bank failures in the first quarter.So what you've seen is that slowed down and also credit is basically flat. Most of the banks didn't have to increase their provisions for future losses because frankly, the consumer is still OK. You're not seeing a huge spike. Although you are seeing things like multifamily and commercial obviously above average, if you will.But everybody else is still muted because of the Fed and quantitative easing. It's actually pushed down credit. And I think that's going to be a positive for the banks for the rest of the year. So what it comes down to is can they continue to adjust? Can they find higher yielding assets on the one hand, and somehow get rid of some of the legacy stuff from 2021 that they still own?- Chris, who is best positioned? Is it JP Morgan that's best positioned to make those types of changes, adjust their business, in order to position themselves for growth here in the coming quarters?RICHARD CHRISTOPHER WHALEN: Well, we put out a note a couple of weeks ago, just looking at the first quarter, and JP Morgan came out of that very strong. They have a 10-point advantage in terms of their operating leverage, versus the other three of the top four banks. That's extraordinary.They're down around peer group 1 levels, which is basically small banks, around 50% efficiency. And I really tip my hat to Jamie Dimon for growing the balance sheet on the one hand, but keeping his operating leverage down around the same as small banks. It's quite something.I mean, look at Bank of America, look at Wells, they're giving up 10 points of operating leverage to Jamie Dimon. So second quarter, he hit it out of the park, as you said. And I think you can expect to see them continue to do that because JB is better at managing the business, both in terms of the operations and also versus the Fed. And managing the duration of his balance sheet in a way that's at least not going to hurt him.The other banks haven't been that good at that. And I think you're going to see them tune that up. And I think the regulators, as you know, very focused on this, they're going to force them to tune up their market risk management.- Chris, how are you looking at the coming regulation within the space? The focus that we have seen on the banks. Obviously, when you take a look at the bigger banks, they are better equipped to handle some of the capital allocations, capital rules, that are changing here going ahead. But what is that going to do to some of the smaller banks or mid-sized banks within this sector? Are we going to see further consolidation and how much?RICHARD CHRISTOPHER WHALEN: I think it's going to force some consolidation because some banks are going to be better at readjusting their balance sheet than others. And the ones that don't move quickly are going to get sold. Very simple.I think you're going to see the big bank group, what we call peer group 1, it's 140 banks now, they're above $10 billion in assets. Everybody from Jamie Dimon on down. That's where you see growth in the industry. So I think those 20, 30, $40 billion banks are going to grow in number, as they should. And the big guys, frankly, would like to get smaller, if they could.If you sat down with Jamie and his CFO, he would tell you he'd love to be closer to 2 trillion because he'd make more money. But for now, they're doing fine. I think Wells Fargo is the most improved student in the class. I'm a little disappointed with US Bank because they traditionally have been right next to JB in terms of operating performance.You know, Citi, not a bad quarter. And they didn't have to increase credit provisions, which I think, again, was a big takeaway so far.- Chris, one sign of trouble, maybe we can say that, within Wells Fargo's report was the amount that they put aside for future loan losses. And I know you briefly touched on this before. But they did report $1.7 billion provision for loan losses. A lot of that attributed to some of the losses that we could see on office loans. Just give us a sense of what this tells us just about the current state and the risk that is still ahead, that's looming here, for some of these banks when it comes to the losses in commercial real estate?RICHARD CHRISTOPHER WHALEN: Commercial is chopped salad. Every building is different, every story is different. So you're going to see losses coming out of the Wells commercial book, and they're going to be quite idiosyncratic. They're going to be different sizes. And then you're going to see big recoveries too.So that's going to go on for years. It's a multi-year story. A lot of these commercial assets will be restructured or extended and they'll try and buy some time and see if the market doesn't turn back in their direction. Because does Wells Fargo want to take over a big multifamily building? No. They want that building to be functional and healthy and be able to support the tenants.So that, to me, is going to be the story for most banks going forward in the next year. It's not going to be residential. This is not like 2008. This is a different kind of credit story with multifamily as well as commercial office space, kind of on the block. You can see it in the specialty press if you follow the Real Deal and some of the other media that really focus on the commercial market. It's all over the place.You've got buildings going into bankruptcy being auctioned, you've got other buildings that are financing in good order. You've got cities like San Francisco. You know, no bank wants exposure in San Francisco right now. And I think the Bank regulators have told the banks to be very careful of legacy, B and C class, urban office space. That's been the message for a while.So I think every bank I look at, credit, efficiency, and how well they recover from default, is always one of the first things I assess. And I think the small banks have commercial exposures in the community. And then as you get up into the bigger banks, they're national. They have exposure to all kinds of deals everywhere.You can see fatigue in places like Texas, and some of the other hot markets, they're definitely overbuilt now. Houston, even, believe it or not, Austin, Texas, which has received enormous amounts of inflows of investment over the last few years.- Yeah, certainly a story that really varies--RICHARD CHRISTOPHER WHALEN: New York City.- We have regional--RICHARD CHRISTOPHER WHALEN: There's a lot of mezzanine finance in New York City held by banks. So we'll hear about that.- Yeah. And then there's also, of course, the pockets, like you were saying, that are strong and that are on solid footing within commercial real estate outside of office. Chris, let's look ahead to next week because we're also going to be getting a report here from Goldman Sachs. And we know Goldman obviously more exposed or more reliant, I should say, on trading and deal activity. Are we going to see a different type of report from Goldman.Oh, yeah, you always do. They're much more focused on your investment banking side. I think the guidance has been that side of the House is going to be light. You're going to see credit expenses continue to work themselves out as they shut down markets and get out of that business really.And then the question is cost of funds for the whole enterprise. It's going to be high. They and Morgan Stanley, frankly, have both seen the market side of their business, reprice very quickly. So they're paying market rates today.They both have banks. Morgan Stanley's got a bigger bank than Goldman. And the bank doesn't really support either firm entirely. It's not like Schwab or the bank is kind of a nice thing to have but they don't need it. So I think that-- the way I would put it is I'm looking to see how well the capital markets business is being managed, and see if they can avoid other credit, you know, stumbles, I guess, is the way I would put it.Morgan Stanley is in a different space right now than Goldman. They have bigger AUM. I think a more stable business, frankly.- All right, well, we will see what the results next week tell us about the health of those two banks, Chris Whalen, always great to speak with you, of Whalen Global Advisors.RICHARD CHRISTOPHER WHALEN: Have a great weekend, guys.- Thank you. You too.]"

The so-called big six will demonstrate if they recovered from one of the most challenging periods for the industry since the financial crisis. JPMorgan's results show it's still able to make lots of money from its loans and franchises but will smaller rivals hold up? And just how healthy is the financial sector?A lot of big questions there. We're going to bring you in some big guests. David Ellison, Hennessy Large Cap Financial Fund portfolio manager, and Victoria Fernandez who is the Crossmark Global Investments Chief Market Strategist.Thank you both for taking the time here with us this morning. We've got a lot to dig into especially on the back of these bank earnings. What is this tee up for the rest of earnings season from your perspective, Victoria?VICTORIA FERNANDEZ: Well, I think when we're looking at this earning season, we have expectations that they were going to be down around 7%. That's what analysts were saying. And everyone looks at JPMorgan to say, all right, let's kick it off and get a feel for what we're going to get.And if you look at the numbers we've seen so far, Brian was talking about a minute ago, you have Delta, PepsiCo, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, they all did really well. Now we know the bar has been lowered, so the question that a lot of people had is, is just beating the number good enough right now? Well, based on what the stocks are doing, it seems like it is.Story continuesSo does this hold up for the rest of the quarter? We don't know. Margins is something that we want to really pay attention to in regards to the pricing power of companies. When you look at the net interest income that you're seeing on these banks, it's telling you that they're doing well.Loan growth was up at least in the big banks. We know we're going to see some differences when it comes to the regional banks. It's a very different story. Their balance sheets look very different. But for now, to kick it all off, it seems like we're off to a pretty decent start for this quarter.JULIE HYMAN: Hey, David, let's get into the banks a little bit more. Your area of focus here. JPMorgan again just like hitting it out of the park and it just fascinating to me, the consistency. Yes, they got a lift from First Republic. What stands out to you from the quarter?DAVID ELLISON: Well, I think the investment banking was a lot better than I thought it was going to be. But I think, generally, they benefited from the fact that they got covered, in a sense, by the government during the Silicon Valley problem where everybody said, well, they're going to be OK? So everybody rushed to the big banks. And they're benefiting from that and so is Wells Fargo and a little bit of Citigroup as well.But I think, generally, people have been worried about credit since 2008. And Jamie Dimon is my age. I went through 2008 like he did. And I don't think we're going to have a credit problem. We're going to have a normalization of credit. And so the real story in this space is what's happened to the yield curve the last two, three years. And we're starting to see the benefits of higher rates for the banks.And I think, historically, this is a great range for the banks to operate in. If they can make the loans at 6%, 8% and raise money at 3, 4, or 5, that's great for them. And we haven't had this rate structure in almost 20 years. So we're going to start to see that manifest itself in earnings and higher net interest income over the next year or so, maybe two years.JULIE HYMAN: David, how concerned are you about expenses at the banks. That was a big area of focus going into these earnings reports. I see for JPMorgan, there was an 11% increase in non-interest expenses, in part, because of compensation.Wells Fargo, the total there $13 billion. And we saw an increase in expenses over its city of 9% as well. Is that concerning level at all, or is it something that you think that investors need to pay attention to?DAVID ELLISON: Well, certainly, I haven't had the chance to really dig into what's going on there, but I think, generally, they're still battling a lot of regulatory stuff. Obviously the Silicon Valley thing generated a lot of concern about what they were doing.You know, they really haven't benefited from technology like other companies have. They've had a lot of competition, so they've had to keep expenses up meaning their competition from other non-depository. So I think, generally, that's-- to me, that's not the story.Again, I'm going to come back to the fact that the yield curve has been historically ugly for these guys. That's bad for the banking industry. As that unwinds in the next couple of years, you're going to see big increases in earnings. And these big five-- these big seven banks, I think they're going to be great places to be long-term. You throw in a little M&amp;A and you've got a pretty good view forward or a pretty good runway here in the next couple of years.BRAD SMITH: Victoria, it's particularly interesting how the banks talk about the consumer right now and the state of the consumer. You've got JPMorgan basically saying that it's spending-- they're still spending, but a little bit more slowly. And then even if you look through some of the card metrics that these banks have put forward, Citi, they saw double digit cards growth.So I wonder. Even if they're saying that the consumer is healthy right now, at what point does the consumer start to show signs of being unhealthy, especially if they're leaning more into some of the credit services or the card services that banks have, and they're changing the way that they spend even if they're not spending as much as they were before, they're just changing or tapping different areas of spending as their cash buffers run out?Right. And we have seen that all through COVID, the shift in the way that consumers are spending. But we look at credit card debt. I mean, Julie was talking a minute ago. You've got JPMorgan, you've got Citi. These are the two biggest in credit card issuance.You look at Capital One Financial that does a lot of credit card business, they actually came out this week and said they're seeing delinquencies go up some. So think you have to start watching what those delinquency rates look like. Right now, I don't think it's something to be concerned with. The consumer continues to be strong.But here's what I think we need to pay attention to. We talk about the consumer slowing down. But if we see inflation continue to go on a downward trajectory and the wages and the labor market stay strong which is the situation that we're seeing, then real incomes actually are going to go higher. We could actually see more demand come out of consumers.And then where does that spending go? Does it go back to goods? Are we going to see goods inflation start to rise again? It's very much a cycle that we have to work through. And because the labor market is continuing to hold on, you've got a consumer that's continuing to spend.Even though we've seen saving rates come down, right? During COVID, what? Savings rates got up to around 35%. They're down now, back to around more historical averages around 5% or 6%, but still they have the ability to spend. And I think until we see the labor market really have some large cracks in it, until we really see those layoffs come in and people starting to struggle, then you're going to continue to see credit cards do well and the consumer spend.JULIE HYMAN: David, as you look at the banks going into the second half of the year, is there anything that could derail what looks like some good forward momentum here? I mean, we are obviously going to see some fading effect from the First Republic boon that JPMorgan got, for example, is there anything else you're watching that is a risk?DAVID ELLISON: Well, I think the risk is that the yield curve stays very inverted, and we get a big rally in the long end meaning rates fall and the short end doesn't fall because the Fed is not going to let that happen, let's say, for the next six or nine months, and then you're back into a squeeze on margins.So I think-- the credit issue, I obviously think about it, but I'd rather have be making loans at 6%, 7%, 8% and have credit problems than to be making loans at 3% and have no credit problems, because it's a much better model for an active managed portfolio manager like myself, because I can hopefully pick the better managers that are going to make the better loans and be able to take advantage.So I think the risk is still in my mind, the term structure of interest rates. That's been the problem. That was Silicon Valley. That's why JPMorgan got that great-- they made a great purchase, and they're seeing the benefit of that now. That was all the term structure of interest rates.And so if the term structure of interest rates improves, I think the stocks all go up.

(WBD) ‘Barbie’ hits theaters on July 21 and the hype around the film has been explosive. But it’s much more than just a movie to Mattel (MAT), which owns the Barbie brand. ‘Barbie’ is the first of 15 movies the company has agreed to make based on its toys. Yahoo Finance’s Seana Smith breaks down the significance of the film to Mattel and its future business.Video Transcript- Hi, Barbie.- Hi, Ken.- I thought you might stay over tonight.- Why?- Because we're girlfriend, boyfriend.- To do what?- I'm actually not sure.[MUSIC PLAYING]- Mattel is betting big on the Barbie movie. The live action film, starring Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken reportedly has a $100 million budget. It's a toymakers big chance to shake up its brand and prove that Barbie is still relevant. Barbie sales accounted for $1.5 billion of Mattel's $5 billion plus worldwide sales last year. It's a big number, but it's still down 11% from the prior year. Mattel unveiled the first Barbie dolls in 1959, and the company went public just a year later.The 1960s was transformative for Barbie. The Ken doll was introduced in 1961. The first Barbie dreamhouse popped up a year later. The doll's popularity took off, with sales passing $1 billion in the early '90s. But within a decade, the doll began to fall out of favor amid criticism for lacking diversity and promoting an unrealistic body image. As Barbie sales struggled, so did its IP owner Mattel.The company lost its spot as the world's largest toy company by market cap to Hasbro in 2015. Attempting to address some of the criticism, Mattel released a more body inclusive doll line in 2016. Two years later, Ynon Kreiz was named Mattel's chief executive and he brought a new vision to the brand. Dig into Mattel's vast IP and pull out the toys that could translate into hit movies. In addition to Barbie, Mattel is planning 14 more films based on toys.YNON KREIZ: It will be a way for us to show What does it mean when we say that Mattel is an IP driven high performing toy company, and an opportunity to extend our business outside of everything we do on the toy side of the company.Story continues- Between Mattel's business and the lackluster return to the movies, there's a lot riding on the film. So will people show up? We did a little research of our own.- Is that a plan to see the Barbie movie.- I'm so excited.- Yeah.- Oh, yes.- Yeah.- Absolutely.- I want to see it.- Yeah, unofficial plans, I'm definitely going to see it.- Yeah, definitely.- Yeah, I would love to see.- I want to see it.- I've been waiting for this for years.- We've had an astronaut Barbie, CEO Barbie, and presidential candidate Barbie. But will we get a blockbuster Barbie? We will see whether this hype translates into a Barbie boom.]"

It's Mattel stock (MAT), as the 78-year-old toymaker appears to have struck cultural relevance gold with its upcoming ""Barbie"" movie.Shares of Mattel are up 15% over the past month, outperforming the stock price of Mr. Potato Head-selling Hasbro, which has a 7% gain. And since you are wondering, shares of Nvidia are up 9% in the last month, Meta stock has notched a 12% increase, and Apple stock has trucked along with a 4% improvement.Mattel's ""Barbie"" is a live-action PG-13 flick headlined by Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken. It was directed by Greta Gerwig and reportedly had a budget of up to $100 million to make.The movie is slated to hit theaters on July 21, and Robbie, Gosling, and the rest of the star-studded cast are currently out doing red carpet events to build anticipation.""Barbie is a cultural conversation at this point,"" Mattel COO Richard Dickson told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). Dickson is credited with reinventing Barbie and making the brand more in line with cultural trends in his work at Mattel over the last five years.Mattel is betting that the cultural conversation around Barbie materializes in strong profit figures, created in a few different ways.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling attend the World Premiere of ""Barbie"" on July 09, 2023, in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Frazer Harrison/FilmMagic,)First is through the licensing of the Barbie name to merchandise that has sprouted up everywhere ahead of the movie's release. Mattel, for instance, inked a Barbie apparel deal with specialty retailer Gap (GPS) that hit stores on May 23.The product line ranges from pink Barbie hoodies to pink pet clothing.Fast fashion house Forever 21 has also released a Barbie-inspired clothing line.""I think what really becomes more interesting as you see the Barbie brand evolve is from a character into a platform and ultimately a franchise,"" Dickson said. ""And so from toys to lifestyle products to live experiences, digital gaming, now film, you really start to see the manifestation and the monetization of the power of this incredible franchise.""Story continuesDancer Kim Manning performs a routine to promote the film ""Barbie"" at the WeHo Pride Parade in West Hollywood, Calif., on Sunday, June 4, 2023. AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)The other profit driver is likely to come from the movie itself, which was produced by Mattel Films and is being distributed by Warner Bros.Stifel analyst Drew Crum recently estimated the ""Barbie"" movie could haul in $400 million at the box office. Crum's previous sales estimate stood at $325 million.""Barbie is the first of several movie releases from Mattel Films, with a stated mission to be an IP-driven toy business, and thus we see a successful launch as driving greater confidence around this part of the company's strategy,"" Crum said. ""And a higher box office = higher profits for Mattel ~ since the company did not fund production our estimates (including adj. EPS = $0.08) are admittedly modest, but a stronger showing in theaters certainly can't hurt numbers.""And lastly, a successful Barbie debut could validate the 14 other content projects in development for Mattel, including a Warner Bros. movie based on the toy car brand Matchbox.CEO of Mattel, Ynon Kreiz, arrives at the premiere of ""Barbie"" on Sunday, July 9, 2023, at The Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)Investors appear to be betting in advance that some of those projects pay off financially for Mattel, based solely on early reads for Barbie.""Barbie is clearly an important brand. It's one of our three power brands, and it will be in many ways a showcase for the quality of the movies that we're looking to make, the type of partnerships we're formulating with lead talent in Hollywood, working with major studios,"" Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz told Yahoo Finance Live.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

95,e795ba1e-6bc9-3582-85bc-d7b27473b135,SLB,2023-07-15,Schlumberger (SLB) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schlumberger-slb-earnings-expected-grow-140008869.html,1689343208,STORY,['SLB'],"[Schlumberger (SLB) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 21. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis world's largest oilfield services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.71 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +42%.Revenues are expected to be $8.25 billion, up 21.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.16% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Schlumberger?For Schlumberger, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.19%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Schlumberger will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Schlumberger would post earnings of $0.61 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.63, delivering a surprise of +3.28%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Schlumberger doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, Liberty Oilfield Services (LBRT) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.93 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +69.1%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $1.27 billion, up 34.8% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Liberty Oilfield Services has been revised 5.1% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -0.62%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Liberty Oilfield Services will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This company, which is in the Zacks Technology Services industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 4.48%.For the last reported quarter, Aptiv PLC came out with earnings of $0.91 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.89 per share, representing a surprise of 2.25%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.19 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.27 per share, delivering a surprise of 6.72%.Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Aptiv PLC lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Aptiv PLC currently has an Earnings ESP of +12.88%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on August 3, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

The drug is expected to be made available in online and offline stores in the country early next year during the first quarter.The removal of a prescription requirement for Opill would help American women get easy access to a contraceptive method that is more effective at preventing pregnancy than all current OTC methods.Though contraceptives like Opill have been available for decades, their demand is likely to increase following the overturning of the Roe v. Wade decision by the U.S. Supreme Court last year. Consequently, abortion is illegal in most states in the country.Management estimates that 45% of the six million yearly pregnancies in the United States are unintended. In fact, around one-third of American women who had ever tried to obtain a prescription or refill for birth control products, including the pill, had faced difficulties in doing so.Shares of Perrigo have lost 2.5% so far this year against the industry’s 4.2% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe FDA’s approval was expected as a joint committee meeting of the FDA’s Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee (“NDAC”) and the Obstetrics, Reproductive and Urologic Drugs Advisory Committee (“ORUDAC”) was held earlier in May, which unanimously recommended making Opill available as an OTC drug.Owing to abortions becoming illegal, the demand for birth control pills is likely to increase in the upcoming days as these are safe for most women to use. Though not a substitute for abortions, birth control pills do help prevent pregnancy.Increasing easy access to an OTC birth control pill will likely provide women with better control of their reproductive life without facing unnecessary barriers. Approval of non-prescription birth control pills has been advocated by health experts for some time. They feel these pills should be available easily over the counter. An approval of Opill as an OTC drug will likely increase the demand for the drug but, at the same time, may also help Perrigo in generating additional product revenues from the drug’s sales.Story continuesPerrigo Company plc Price Perrigo Company plc PricePerrigo Company plc price | Perrigo Company plc Quote Zacks Rank &amp; Other Stocks to ConsiderPerrigo carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

100,a8dbeb6c-1d99-3b5c-ba23-a4509924c9da,NTRS,2023-07-15,Northern Trust (NASDAQ:NTRS) shareholders have endured a 18% loss from investing in the stock five years ago,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/northern-trust-nasdaq-ntrs-shareholders-122626392.html,1689337586,STORY,['NTRS'],"[In order to justify the effort of selecting individual stocks, it's worth striving to beat the returns from a market index fund. But even the best stock picker will only win with some selections. At this point some shareholders may be questioning their investment in Northern Trust Corporation (NASDAQ:NTRS), since the last five years saw the share price fall 29%. We also note that the stock has performed poorly over the last year, with the share price down 23%. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 13% in the last three months.It's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in lockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some disparity between the two. So let's do just that. Check out our latest analysis for Northern Trust While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the unfortunate half decade during which the share price slipped, Northern Trust actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 1.6% per year. So it doesn't seem like EPS is a great guide to understanding how the market is valuing the stock. Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.By glancing at these numbers, we'd posit that the the market had expectations of much higher growth, five years ago. Having said that, we might get a better idea of what's going on with the stock by looking at other metrics.Revenue is actually up 3.6% over the time period. So it seems one might have to take closer look at the fundamentals to understand why the share price languishes. After all, there may be an opportunity.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthNorthern Trust is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. You can see what analysts are predicting for Northern Trust in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Northern Trust, it has a TSR of -18% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 17% in the last year, Northern Trust shareholders lost 21% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 3% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. If you would like to research Northern Trust in more detail then you might want to take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in the company.But note: Northern Trust may not be the best stock to buy.

Actors have used contract talks with the Hollywood studios to assert control over how these digital simulations are used on screen. It is one of several sticking points in contract talks with the Hollywood studios, which ended Wednesday without agreement.The AMPTP, the group negotiating on behalf of Walt Disney, Netflix and other major studios and streaming services, said it had agreed to a ""groundbreaking AI proposal"" that would protect performers' digital likeness.Such protections, the studios noted, would include gaining an actor's consent to create and use a digital replica, or digitally alter their performance.SAG-AFTRA chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland took issue with that characterization during a press conference Thursday in Los Angeles.""They propose that our background performers should be able to be scanned, get paid for one day's pay, and their company should own that scan of their image, their likeness, and should be able to use it for the rest of eternity,"" said Crabtree-Ireland. ""So if you think that's a groundbreaking proposal, I suggest you think again.""The AMPTP said SAG-AFTRA's claim that the digital replicas of background actors may be used in perpetuity with no consent or compensation is false. It said the current proposal would restrict the use of the digital replica to the motion picture for which the background actor is employed. Any other use would require that actor’s consent and bargaining for the use, subject to a minimum payment, the studios said.SAG-AFTRA is Hollywood's largest union, representing 160,000 members, including actors, stunt performers and voiceover artists.""I would like to see protections around artificial intelligence, not to stop the technology,"" said Linda Powell, first vice president of New York local of SAG-AFTRA. ""We know that the Earth is going to move forward, technology is going to move forward, but we don't want to participate in a contract that will end up in any way replacing us.""

The Earnings ESP looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.According to the ESP, Tesla TSLA, Netflix NFLX, and PPG Industries PPG are all set to beat analyst estimates at their scheduled earnings announcements next week. Additionally, all three have very strong long-term expectations with Tesla and Netflix projecting earnings growth greater than 20% annually over the next 3-5 years and PPG Industries set to grow at 18%.While beating estimates may not always guarantee a stock trade higher, on average it plays favorably so long as there isn’t particularly bad news following the beat. Thus, these three stocks are definitely worth keeping an eye on next week.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTeslaTesla is having a tremendous year so far, up 127% YTD, and growing sales even faster than most anticipated. That, along with the news of its charger network set to be standardized for broad adoption in the US, Tesla continues to lead the EV transition.TSLA’s Earnings ESP is forecasting a 2.41% beat at next weeks quarterly earnings report. Tesla is scheduled to announce its results Wednesday, July 19 after the market close.Story continuesAlthough Telsa has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, it has begun to see its earnings estimates rise over the last couple of months. Current quarterly earnings have been revised higher by 3.75% and are expected to climb 9.2% YoY.Also worth noting, sales are projected to grow a whopping 47% YoY to $25 billion. The automaker is riding on the robust demand for Models 3 and Y, which form a major chunk of its total deliveries. Deliveries of Model 3/Y witnessed a CAGR of more than 100% over the last 3 years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNetflixNetflix has staged an incredible comeback so far this year. After collapsing -76% in 2022 the stock has more than doubled off its lows.Even in the uber-competitive streaming landscape Netflix dominates with 232 million global subscribers, and plenty of room to grow, especially in developing markets.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewAccording to the Earnings ESP, Netflix is slated to beat earnings by 2.9%. Current quarter earnings are projected to see a -12.2% decline YoY so if the streaming service manages to beat these subdued estimates it could continue its campaign higher.Furthermore, while near-term earnings are expected to decline, looking further out they are set to see considerable growth. FY24 earnings are expected to grow 31%, along with 13% sales growth, so we can expect the streaming service to continue its expansion, even with the competition nipping at its heels.Netflix is also trading at a historically discounted valuation. At 40x one year forward earnings it is below the industry average of 51x, and below its five-year median of 60.5x.Netflix is scheduled to report earnings Wednesday, July 19 after the market closes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPPG IndustriesPPG industries, the global supplier of paints, coatings, chemicals, specialty materials, glass, and fiber glass boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating strongly upward trending earnings revisions. Current quarter earnings estimates have been revised higher by 0.5% and are expected to climb 18.2% YoY.The Zacks Earnings ESP also expects PPG to exceed earnings estimates by 2.6% at the coming announcement. PPG reports earnings Thursday July 20, after the market closes.Always sweetening the deal, PPG also offers a dividend yield of 1.6%. The company has a long history of raising dividend payments and has done so for 51 consecutive years making it one of the few Dividend Kings. The company has increased the payment by an average of 6.5% annually over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineThe Earnings ESP is just one of many tools investors can use to analyze and pick stocks at Zacks.

Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Alexandra Canal discusses how the strikes will impact all aspects of content production, including the box office.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Well, the ""Barbie"" movie, it hits theaters in just one week, and the film's actors have been on a marketing blitz the past month to promote it. But that campaign is over now after the Hollywood actors union SAG-AFTRA voted to go on strike. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal is with me, who has been following the story very closely, and, Allie, the question here is what this means for the box office. Could the box office potentially take a hit now that some of the movies, the big stars are not out promoting it?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Well, Seana, the one thing I'm going to say is thank goodness this SAG-AFTRA strike happened now and not before they started this press tour for the ""Barbie"" movie, because Margot Robbie's outfits were just so iconic, so I'm happy we at least got to see some of that. But absolutely it could.I mean, the timing here, it kind of stinks for a company like Mattel and Warner Brothers Discovery. Considering how much is riding on the success of this movie, the fact that now all marketing, all press has to stop at this point when we're a week out, that's disappointing, and that's something that I think a lot of people don't really think about. It's not just the acting, it's everything that happens pre-production, post-production. The junkets, the red carpets, all of that that's in anticipation for the movie has to stop.And, you know, that video package was talking about the importance that this is for Mattel, the future of Barbie, but like I said, it's also very important for Warner Brothers Discovery, which has been lagging at the box office recently, especially when we talk about some of their DC movies like ""The Flash"". That was a big disappointment. So they're really hoping that the ""Barbie"" movie can deliver this jolt, this box office boom.Story continuesSo far it seems like it is, considering how much hype is around this, but you just never know how that will translate to ticket sales, because, remember, we talked about Disney's ""The Little Mermaid"" for so long, and that was a bit of a disappointment. So, again, you just never know what the consumer, how they're going to react in this post-COVID environment, especially at the box office, but certainly a lot riding for this film.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Allie, there is so much riding for this film, and I know you've talked to so many people within the industry over the last several weeks just about what this will signal for the return to the box office. If we don't see a huge hit here from ""Barbie"", how worried should we be just about movie theaters here going forward?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Well, especially with not only the SAG-AFTRA strike but also the ongoing writers strike, that's a double whammy that is going to impact the box office, especially as we head into the back half of 2023, into 2024, and ""Barbie"" has been branded as one of the most significant movies at the box office this summer. It will come with a slew of other big titles like ""Mission Impossible"", ""Oppenheimer"".So if this doesn't do well, it sort of signals, OK, well, what kind of movies do consumers want? What is the new genre that we need in order to get people back to the theater? And I think a lot of people will be questioning the future of the box office and how vital it can be during these uncertain times. So certainly everyone is going to have their eye on those ticket sales and they're hoping that it can surpass those estimates.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly a lot of people will be tracking this very, very closely. Allie, what are you hearing just about the timeline? I guess how long this strike could potentially go on and when we're going to start seeing a significant hit here now that actors and the writers are not working.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Well, I don't think we're going to see any immediate impact this year, but from what I've been hearing from analysts and industry experts, by 2024 is where we could see some of that impact. I do expect this to continue through the summer and possibly into the fall, but it sort of feels like this situation of who is going to cave first. Is it going to be the studios or is it going to be the writers and the actors? And that's never a good position that you want anyone to be in. The stakes are very high.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, stakes are very high. All right, Allie Canal, great stuff. Thanks so much.]"

MNSO.5 Low-Leverage Stocks to Buy as Inflation Cools DownU.S. stocks ended slightly higher on Jul 12, buoyed by investors' optimism after consumer prices registered their smallest annual increase in more than two years, indicating some relief from the raging inflation hike observed in the recent past.This should encourage investors to spend in the stock market. However, considering the volatile state that Wall Street has been through lately, one should progress with caution. Hence, we recommend stocks like Humana, The TJX Companies, Sunstone Hotel Investors, Atmos Energy and MINISO Group Holding Ltd., which bear low leverage. These picks can shield investors from incurring losses in times of crisis.Now, before selecting low-leverage stocks, let's explore what leverage is and how choosing a low-leverage stock helps investors.In finance, leverage is a term used to denote the practice of borrowing capital by companies to run their operations smoothly and expand the same. Such borrowings are done through debt financing. But there remains an option for equity finance. This is probably due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing.However, debt financing has its share of drawbacks. Particularly, it is desirable only as long as it successfully generates a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate. So, to avoid considerable losses in your portfolio, one should always avoid companies that resort to exorbitant debt financing.The crux of safe investment lies in choosing a company that is not burdened with debt, as a debt-free stock is almost impossible to find.The equity market can be volatile at times and as an investor, if you don't want to lose big time, we suggest you invest in stocks, which bear low leverage and are hence less risky.Story continuesTo identify such stocks, historically, several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears and the debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most common ratios.Analyzing Debt/EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders' EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A lower debt-to-equity ratio reflects improved solvency for a company.With the second-quarter earnings cycle knocking on our doors, investors must be eyeing stocks that have exhibited solid earnings growth in the recent past. But if a stock bears a high debt-to-equity ratio in times of economic downturn, its so-called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure steady returns.Yet, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here we present our five picks out of the 15 stocks that made it through the screen.Humana: It is one of the largest health care plan providers in the United States, which offers health insurance benefits under Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), Private Fee-For-Service (PFFS) and Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) plans.

117,f30c132b-24cd-35ca-a157-af15467a9596,WYNN,2023-07-15,4 Consumer Discretionary Stocks to Buy on Cooling Inflation,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-consumer-discretionary-stocks-buy-130800523.html,1689340080,STORY,"['WYNN', 'GOLF', 'OSW']","[Inflation has started slowing and the Fed’s aggressive interest rate hike policy appears to be finally bearing fruit. Fresh data shows that inflation slowed further in June to its smallest annual increase since early 2021.The Labor Department said on Jul 12 that the consumer price index (CPI) rose 3% year over year in June from 4% in May. This is the lowest level since March 2021. Economists had predicted a rise of 3.1%.Month over month, CPI increased a modest 0.2% in June, beating analysts’ expectations of a rise of 0.3%. More importantly, core CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, rose just 0.2% month over month in June. On a year-over-year basis, core CPI rose 4.8%, its smallest increase in almost two years.Although food prices rose in June, the situation is far better than a year ago. Inflation had hit a 40-year high of 9.1% in 2022 but has since cooled to 4.8%, implying that the Fed’s decision to hike interest rates has helped in taming inflation.A day later,  the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the producer prices also eased in June. The producer price index (PPI) rose a modest 0.1% month over month in June, beating expectations of a rise of 0.2%. Core PPI, which strips out the volatile food and energy costs, also rose 0.1% in June.Although inflation is showing signs of cooling, market participants believe that Fed will still go for an interest rate hike in July. This is because the Fed had earlier said that two more rate hikes of 25 basis points each would be required this year.However, they also believe that the Fed might finally go for only one interest rate hike instead of two and could pause its tightening policy after July. A pause in interest rates bodes well for the broader market.Increasing interest rates can have multiple effects, including impacting consumer spending patterns, raising borrowing costs, influencing economic growth, and affecting stock market performance.Story continuesAdditionally, companies in the consumer discretionary sector are anticipated to gain from easing inflation rates and a pause in interest rate hikes. This is because consumers are likely to have more discretionary income, which can be allocated toward non-essential purchases.Our ChoicesTherefore, from an investment perspective, we have identified four stocks from the consumer discretionary sector that are likely to capitalize on reduced inflationary pressure.

But for transportation to and from the City of Angels, travelers can remain in the clouds.That’s because an airport shuttle called the Los Angeles FlyAway offers a contactless, tap-on-phone payment option, powered by the cloud and piloted by Mastercard beginning in 2021. “There are a lot of features that cloud commerce can help merchants with,” says George Maddaloni, executive vice president and chief technology officer of operations at Mastercard.Banks, payment providers, and private equity firms have recently accelerated their embrace of cloud computing. But the early adoption often lacked intentionality. In the initial rush to get their workloads onto the cloud, financial firms would often get frustrated as costs soared and business needs weren’t met. Millions of dollars were spent adopting cloud computing without fully taking advantage of the benefits the tech has to offer.“It’s not just about moving workloads to the cloud,” says Kathy Kay, CIO of Principal Financial Group. “It’s finding the right technology solution that is more modern to solve a business problem and serve our customers. And if that happens to be cloud, then so be it, we’ll be leveraging cloud.”Kay steers all technology decisions for the 144-year-old financial services company, adding diverse and more modern technologies to the system where legacy technology can be shut down to allow space for tech that can better serve Principal’s customers. Cloud providers are selected to match the solution they best offer Principal. Data sits with AWS, while Salesforce is leveraged for CRM and Google Cloud Platform is used for analytics. But Principal aims to avoid the idea of “lift and shift,” i.e., merely moving to the cloud just to say the data lives there.“Depending on the problem that we are solving, we try to look for, do we have technology already that we can leverage and if not, how do we leverage the right technology,” says Kay, “and we do tend to lean to cloud first.”Story continuesHoward Boville, head of IBM Cloud Platform, agrees. “Intentionality is becoming more mainstream now,” says Boville. “We’re at that point where how cloud is used as a tool amongst other tools is being thought through in a more business-context way than perhaps previously.”Experts say the pivot to start thinking through business problems before jumping to leverage cloud haphazardly has been underway the past two years. That said, altitude remains high for the cloud.Banks moved 15% of their workload into the cloud by 2022, nearly double the prior year, according to research conducted by Accenture, which studied nearly 100 banks. The workloads that have moved to cloud represent relatively “easy” wins, including systems for IT, sales and marketing, human resources, and finance. But the opportunity remains massive, with 85% not yet migrated and stuck in legacy systems. Accenture says the biggest untapped bucket is for core functions—consumer and commercial banking, payments, and risk and compliance—which are hampered by concerns about security and compliance risk as well as legacy systems.Industry insiders say some of the greatest potential for cloud in banking lies in the democratization of the tech. Cloud, when done right, can help reduce expenses and also power A.I. technologies to allow for greater tech advancements like smarter chatbots or greater functionality for mobile banking.“Even the midsize banks, or smaller banks, can compete with the largest banks because now they can buy these capabilities by the drink,” says Mike Abbott, Accenture’s global banking lead.Maddaloni says all industries are working through how they are going to use cloud and for the financial sector, he sees a focus on three areas. The first is how to leverage the cloud and run applications and software more efficiently. The second method is focused on how companies innovate and can test new concepts rapidly. And the third, which is explored most at Mastercard, is using cloud to extend the company’s large network ecosystem.Public clouds, which allow companies like Mastercard to rent computing and storage without having to build their own data centers, can help empower so-called edge computing. Edge computing is a way for Mastercard to tap users just outside of its network and give customers a new way to connect to the payment provider. This year already, 1 billion Mastercard transactions have been processed via edge computing. The company also launched Cloud Commerce, to enable the processing of contactless transactions from smartphones to the cloud.And while security remains the top barrier holding back adoption of cloud for financial institutions, those concerns are lessening. “On the cloud, security is engineered into the applications,” says Abbott. “So when you set up the cloud foundations, you set up the security patterns of how the compute environments are going to work.”“We always see that the highly regulated sectors, like financial services, tend to be leaders in deploying best practices,” says Jim Reavis, CEO of Cloud Security Alliance, when discussing data security. He views cloud’s relationship to the internet as similar in how electrification supercharged the industrial revolution in the 1800’s.“A.I. and cloud go together like a horse and carriage,” says Boville. “You need the compute capability to be able to train the models.”For banks, A.I.-powered chatbots must be trained with large data sets so the tech that talks to people can become more efficient over time. Five years ago, Boville said, customers disliked the experience of talking to a chatbot to answer questions such as how to open an account or order more checks. But today, consumers are warming up to A.I.-enabled conversations in lieu of long hold times and getting bounced around to different human representatives to get a simple question answered.“There are a lot of processes that are invisibly getting transformed that improve the customer experience,” says Boville.Mark Benaquista, managing director at THL Partners, has been an early advocate for cloud. In his role at the Boston-based private equity firm, Benaquista helps ensure the tech aspects of the businesses THL may acquire are well understood as part of the overall investment thesis.A little over a decade ago, “cloud was still for the upstarts, certainly not embraced by enterprise,” says Benaquista. “But the minds started shifting and people started getting their toes wet.”The bullishness for cloud solutions has impacted how THL steers the businesses it buys. Take the example of Fastaff, a travel nursing company that THL invested in back in 2015. The temporary staffing agency had a solid database of nurses willing to travel, but their credentials were stuck in manila file folders piled in offices. THL and Fastaff leveraged cloud to create a mobile app that would allow nurses to self-register their information and provide updates to their certifications, creating a model that better linked hospitals with staff.When hurricanes battered Florida and Texas in 2017, that cloud-enabled tech gave Fastaff the ability to respond quickly. Cloud has also lowered back-office costs, improved margins, and boosted morale among the nurses.“A lot of companies will adopt cloud-first as a mantra,” says Benaquista. “Unless they are bound by some regulatory requirement, a lot of technology leaders are thinking cloud-first.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

The US, where the majority of the technology originates, believes that restricting China’s access to it will bolster national security and hold back the Asian nation’s efforts to advance its military capabilities.Read More: ASML Faces Tighter Controls on Servicing Chip Gear in ChinaThe companies have argued that being cut off from their largest market will harm their ability to spend on advancing their technology and ultimately undermine US leadership.Representatives for the three companies declined to comment.Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon gets more than 60% of his company’s revenue from the China region by supplying components to smartphone makers such as Xiaomi Corp. Intel’s Pat Gelsinger, who visited Beijing earlier this month to show off his company’s latest artificial intelligence chips, counts the nation as his biggest sales region. The country provides about a quarter of Intel’s sales. And for Nvidia, run by co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang, China provides about a fifth of revenue.Story continuesThe Commerce Department in October issued rules that bar semiconductor equipment makers from selling certain tools to China, as well as prohibit the export of some chips used in artificial intelligence applications — an announcement that roiled the industry last October.So far, chip equipment makers such as Applied Materials Inc. have taken the biggest hits to revenue, being forced to knock billions of dollars off their projections. But the restrictions, which companies fear will be extended to other classes of chips, are also affecting some makers of devices. Nvidia’s ability to ship its industry-leading artificial intelligence accelerators to China has been curbed by an approval process, costing it sales.“I’m alarmed that some American CEOs continue to advocate for weaker export controls on sensitive technology,” Representative Mike Gallagher, a Wisconsin Republican and chairman of a House committee on competition with China, said in a statement on Friday. “The Biden administration needs to tighten our export controls on advanced chips”The administration is planning to update and finalize the measures by strengthening what’s already been announced. Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that the US is using some of its powers to influence overseas companies to further cut off China’s access. ASML Holding NV, one of the biggest providers of chipmaking equipment, is facing tighter restrictions from its home government in the Netherlands and new restrictions from the US, because some of its components are made in America.In general, the US new rules will also reflect the outcome of negotiations with Japan and the Netherlands, people briefed on the plans said.Reuters previously reported on the plan for some of the CEOs to meet with US officials.(Updates with Gallagher statement, in 10th paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekNo Testing, No Inspections: Contaminated Eyedrops Blinded and Killed AmericansWeightWatchers Is Gambling Everything on Obesity DrugsThis Supposed Mafia Manifesto Doesn’t Stand Up to a Google SearchWhat If the Next Big Social Media App Is ...

It was not immediately clear whom the executives would meet.Intel and Qualcomm declined to comment, and officials at the White House did not immediately return a request for comment.The sources said other semiconductor CEOs may also be in Washington next week. The sources declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media.U.S. officials are considering tightening export rules affecting high-performance computing chips and shipments to Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, sources told Reuters in June. The rules would respectively affect Intel, which is preparing a new artificial intelligence chip that could be shipped to China, and Qualcomm, which has a license to sell chips to Huawei.The Biden administration last October issued a sweeping set of rules designed to freeze China's semiconductor industry in place while the U.S. pours billions of dollars in subsidies into its own chip industry.The possible rule tightening would hit Nvidia particularly hard. The company's strong position in the AI chip market helped boost its worth to $1 trillion earlier this year.The chip industry has been warmly received in Washington in recent years as lawmakers and the White House work to shift more production to the U.S. and its allies, and away from China. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger and Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon have met often with government officials.Next week's meetings, which one of the sources said could include joint sessions between executives and U.S. officials, come as Nvidia Corp and other chip companies fear a permanent loss of sales for an industry with large amounts of business in China while tensions escalate between Washington and Beijing.Story continuesOne of the sources familiar with the matter said the executives' goals for the meetings would be to ensure that government officials understand the possible impact of any further tightening of rules around what chips can be sold to China.Many U.S. chip firms get more than one-fifth of their revenue from China, and industry executives have argued that reducing those sales would cut into profits that they reinvest into research and development.(Reporting by Andrea Shalal in Washington, Stephen Nellis in San Francisco and Karen Freifeld in New York; Editing by Chris Sanders and Edmund Klamann)]"

Among them are Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Omnicom Group (OMC) which are both scheduled to report next Tuesday, July 18.Here’s a look at what’s in store for Lockheed Martin and Omnicom''s Q2 reports and why now may be a good time to buy.Lockheed Martin (LMT)Lockheed Martin’s stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) going into its second-quarter earnings report next week.As the largest defense contractor in the world, Lockheed Martin’s stock remains attractive with the company already securing lucrative contracts so far this year.Last quarter CEO Jim Taiclet stated that Lockheed Martin has secured a contract for the United States sea-based hypersonic missile program, Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS), delivering the first F-16 fighter aircraft out of its new Greenville, South Carolina factory while also being selected to provide 88 F-35 fifth-generation fighter aircraft to Canada.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ2 Preview: Lockheed Martin’s Q2 earnings are expected to soar 223% at $6.43 per share compared to EPS of $1.99 in the prior-year quarter. Sales for the quarter are forecasted to be up 2% to $15.86 billion. Notably, Lockheed Martin has surpassed earnings expectations for nine consecutive quarters.Annual earnings are now forecasted to be roughly flat in fiscal 2023 but rise 4% in FY24 at $28.13 per share. Total sales are also expected to be virtually flat this year but rise 3% in FY24 to $67.79 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchP/E Valuation: What is most intriguing about Lockheed Martin’s stock is that at $464 a share, it currently trades at 17.2X forward earnings which is nicely beneath the S&amp;P 500’s 21.2X. Furthermore, Lockheed Martin is the clear-cut leader in its space and trades at a nice discount to the Aerospace-Defense Industry average of 28.8X while also trading 32% below its decade-long high of 25.3X and roughly on par with the median of 17X.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOmnicom Group (OMC)Also sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Omnicom is one of the world's largest advertising, marketing, and corporate communications companies and is certainly worthy of investors’ attention going into its Q2 report.With operations in most major global markets, Omnicom is starting to see stronger organic revenue growth following the pandemic and this should continue as global inflationary headwinds subside.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ2 Preview: Omnicom’s Q2 earnings are expected to rise 7% from a year ago at $1.80 per share with sales forecasted to be up 1% to $3.62 billion. Even better, Omnicom has surpassed earnings expectations for an astonishing 29 consecutive quarters dating back to April of 2016.Fiscal 2023 earnings are now projected to rise 7% and edge up another 4% in FY24 at $7.72 per share. On the top line, sales are expected to be up 3% this year and rise another 3% in FY24 to $15.23 billion. More importantly, FY23 and FY24 sales projections would eclipse pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $14.95 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchP/E valuation: With Omnicom stock trading at $96 a share its P/E valuation is also attractive at 12.9X forward earnings and well below the benchmark. Plus, Omnicom trades close to the industry average of 11.1X while trading 32% below its decade high of 19.1X and at a modest discount to the median of 13.5X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineLockheed Martin and Omnicom are two giants in their respective industries that offer dividends yeilds over 2% and well above the S&amp;P 500's 1.41% average.Now appears to be a good time to buy as their stocks are starting to stand out in terms of price-to-earnings valuation and both companies are expected to post strong quarterly results next week.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Higher sales volume from two major segments, along with impressive delivery numbers, is likely to have benefited LMT’s second-quarter performance.Let's see how things have shaped up prior to the announcement.Aeronautics &amp; Space to Post Impressive SalesThe Aeronautics segment, which primarily manufactures advanced, combat-proven jets, and contributes almost 40% to the company’s top line, is likely to deliver unimpressive results in the to-be-reported quarter.Lockheed Martin Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseLockheed Martin Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseLockheed Martin Corporation price-eps-surprise | Lockheed Martin Corporation QuoteIncreased volume from classified programs and F-16 jets is expected to have boosted the segment’s performance. However, lower F-35 deliveries due to software maturation with the Tech Refresh 3 program and hardware delivery timing might have partly impacted this business unit’s overall sales.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Aeronautics unit’s second-quarter revenues is pegged at $6,374 million, indicating an 8.7% improvement from the prior-year period’s reported figure.Continued ramp-up in the next-generation interceptor as well as classified program is expected to have benefited the Space business segment’s second-quarter performance. Favorable program lifecycle timing on Orion spacecraft might have also aided this unit’s sales growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues is pinned at $2,840 million, indicating 0.5% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.Impact of MFC &amp; RMS PerformanceLockheed’s Missiles and Fire Control (MFC) segment provides critical missile defense support to the United States and foreign allies. Within this unit, higher sales volume from integrated air and missile defense might have been outweighed by lower volume from tactical and strike missiles as well as sensors and global sustainment.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MFC’s second-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $2,733 million, indicating a 0.5% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Lower C6ISR and Black Hawk volume at Sikorsky might have had hurt the Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) segment’s sales in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the RMS segment’s second-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $3,9456 million, indicating a 1.4% decline from that registered in the prior-year quarter.Impressive Delivery ProjectionsFor manufacturing companies like Lockheed, successful delivery of its manufactured goods indicates solid revenue generation. To this end, we notice that our forecast estimates LMT to have delivered 76 jets in the second quarter, which indicates year-over-year growth of 6.5%.Q2 ExpectationsThe anticipated sales improvement in LMT’s two major segments, which together account for almost 58% of the company’s total revenues, might have outweighed the sales deterioration expected from the other two segments. This, along with solid delivery projections, is likely to have boosted Lockheed’s overall sales performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter revenues is pegged at $15.86 billion, indicating a 2.7% increase from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Such a solid sales performance, along with lower share count, is expected to have bolstered LMT’s earnings.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the defense giant’s second-quarter earnings is pinned at $6.43 per share.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Lockheed this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. This is not the case here as you will see below.LMT has an Earnings ESP of -0.48% and a Zacks Rank #2.

A cooler-than-expected inflation report revived hopes that the Fed is nearing the end of its interest rate increases. Additionally, favorable macroeconomic developments and optimism about the transformational power of artificial intelligence (AI) are driving market optimism.SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust SPY, the proxy version of the S&amp;P 500 Index, has risen 17.5% so far this year. We have highlighted five stocks from different sectors that have gained more than 50% this year and have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). These companies have also witnessed positive estimate revisions for the current fiscal year. These are Nvidia NVDA, Carnival Corporation CCL, PulteGroup Inc. PHM, West Pharmaceutical Services Inc. WST and Copart, Inc. CPRT.Technology remained the major outperformer, followed by the cyclical sectors. Inflation in the United States cooled down for the 12th consecutive month in June. The Consumer Price Index rose 3% year over year, marking the lowest rate since early 2021, and 0.2% over the last month. Although inflation has dropped from a peak of 9.1%, it is still significantly above the Federal Reserve's 2% target (read: 5 ETFs to Gain as Inflation Drops to a 2-Year Low).Easing inflation indicates that the economy is stabilizing and interest rates may be declining. This could boost investor confidence and encourage more investments in the stock market. Lower inflation often leads to lower interest rates, which can reduce borrowing costs for companies, potentially leading to higher profits and, in turn, higher stock prices. Economic activity continued to expand at a modest pace, with robust job gains and a low unemployment rate and moderated inflation.Consumer confidence unexpectedly jumped to an 18-month high in June amid lingering fears of a recession. The U.S. housing sector has also shown immense improvement, with homebuilder confidence reaching its highest level in almost a year.Despite the fact that the Federal Reserve has raised rates this year, interest rates have largely remained low.Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of SPY.Story continuesSPY in FocusSPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust holds 503 stocks in its basket, with each accounting for no more than 7.5% of the assets. This suggests a nice balance across each security and prevents heavy concentration. The fund is widely spread across sectors with information technology, healthcare, financials and consumer discretionary accounting for a double-digit allocation each.SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust has AUM of $421 billion and charges 9 bps in fees per year. The product trades in a heavy volume of around 79 million shares a day on average, ensuring higher liquidity with a tight bid/ask spread, leading to lower trading costs for investors. SPY has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook (see: all the Large Cap Blend ETFs here).Below we have highlighted the abovementioned five best-performing stocks in the ETF.Best-Performing Stocks of SPYNvidia is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of graphic processing unit or GPU. The stock has jumped 214.6% so far this year. It saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 4 cents over the past 90 days for the fiscal year ending January 2024, with an estimated growth of 129.9%.Nvidia makes up for 3.02% of the assets in SPY and has a Zacks Rank #1.

133,f131e82d-3074-3172-9779-792fd3999907,PHM,2023-07-15,PulteGroup (PHM) Upgraded to Strong Buy: Here's Why,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pultegroup-phm-upgraded-strong-buy-160007502.html,1689350407,STORY,['PHM'],"[PulteGroup (PHM) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for PulteGroup is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for PulteGroup imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for PulteGroupFor the fiscal year ending December 2023, this homebuilder is expected to earn $9.30 per share, which is a change of -13.9% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for PulteGroup. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 25.1%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of PulteGroup to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This new dividend will be paid on Aug 17, 2023, to shareholders of record as of Aug 3. The dividend yield, based on the latest payout and Jul 13 closing market price, is approximately 1.5%.The hike is reflective of KBH’s achievement of increasing both scale and profitability, improving asset efficiency and monetizing deferred tax assets under the Returns-Focused Growth Plan, which in turn enabled it to generate solid operating cash flow.Enhancement of Shareholder ValueSince 2016, KB Home has been pursuing a Returns-Focused Growth Plan, designed to drive revenues, homebuilding operating income margin, return on invested capital, return on equity and leverage ratio. The company is now in a better position to expect meaningful growth in the future, attributable to the increase in backlog and its ability to match housing starts to net orders.KB Home ended the second quarter of fiscal 2023 with $557 million in cash and cash equivalents, up from $328.5 million at fiscal 2022-end. The company has a total liquidity of $1.64 billion, including $1.08 billion of available capacity under the unsecured revolving credit facility, with no outstanding cash borrowings.Additionally, the company ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital of 30.9%, down from 33.4% in fiscal 2022. It also repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares of its outstanding common stock for $92.1 million.Investors always prefer a return-generating stock. A high-dividend-yielding one is highly coveted. Stockholders are always looking for companies with a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payments.Shares of the company have gained 66.3% compared with the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry’s 50.2% growth this year.Builders are now cautiously optimistic for 2023 as a lack of existing inventory shifts demand to the new home market. Although builders continue to grapple with high construction costs and material supply chain disruptions, they continue to witness strong pent-up demand as buyers wait for interest rates to drop and turn more to the new home market due to a shortage of existing inventory.Story continuesZacks RankCurrently, KBH carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

136,99d47cfb-98aa-3c3f-9ab7-76ce43c011b3,PHM,2023-07-15,"Meritage Homes Corporation (MTH) Hit a 52 Week High, Can the Run Continue?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meritage-homes-corporation-mth-hit-131515788.html,1689340515,STORY,"['MTH', 'PHM']","[Shares of Meritage Homes (MTH) have been strong performers lately, with the stock up 10.4% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $145.55 in the previous session. Meritage Homes has gained 56.6% since the start of the year compared to the 32.9% move for the Zacks Construction sector and the 53.1% return for the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 26, 2023, Meritage reported EPS of $3.54 versus consensus estimate of $2.51.For the current fiscal year, Meritage is expected to post earnings of $15.35 per share on $5.57 billion in revenues. This represents a -42.6% change in EPS on a -11.22% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $16.66 per share on $5.98 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 8.55% and 7.42%, respectively.Valuation MetricsMeritage may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Meritage has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 9.4X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 10.3X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 5.2X versus its peer group's average of 5.7X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Story continuesZacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Meritage currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Meritage fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Meritage shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does MTH Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of MTH have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM). PHM has a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of C.Earnings were strong last quarter. PulteGroup, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 32.02%, and for the current fiscal year, PHM is expected to post earnings of $9.30 per share on revenue of $15.14 billion.Shares of PulteGroup, Inc. have gained 8.6% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 8.64X and a P/CF of 6.87X.The Building Products - Home Builders industry is in the top 6% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for MTH and PHM, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Portland General Electric and WEC Energy Group are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This means that POR's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.POR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.68, while WEC has a forward P/E of 19.88. We also note that POR has a PEG ratio of 3. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. WEC currently has a PEG ratio of 3.45.Another notable valuation metric for POR is its P/B ratio of 1.48. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, WEC has a P/B of 2.41.Story continuesBased on these metrics and many more, POR holds a Value grade of B, while WEC has a Value grade of C.POR stands above WEC thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that POR is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Layoffs have continued to pile up. Now, halfway into 2023, we've seen more tech employees laid off this year – 216,910 – than all of last year, 164,709, according to Layoffs.fyi data.For most tech workers, it's tough going right now – and it's started to show up in the data.

Well, you're crushing it right now.""It's like there are two stories playing out in Silicon Valley at the same time,"" said Jonathan Siddharth, CEO and founder of tech talent platform Turing, whose clients include Walt Disney Co. (DIS) and PepsiCo Inc. (PEP). ""Story number one – the good times are over from 2021, and we all have to be more efficient in the way we hire and scale. Story number two is that everyone's excited about AI.""He added: ""Every board is asking their CEO what the ChatGPT moment means for them, and every CEO is asking their executive team to look into generative AI... we're seeing a ton of excitement around AI projects and initiatives.""In fact, there's an ""AI premium"" when it comes to salaries, said Layoffs.fyi founder Roger Lee.Senior software engineers who specialize in AI and machine learning are fetching 12% more in salary than engineers who don't specialize in AI, according to data from Comprehensive.io, another company Lee founded.""The demand for AI and ML [machine learning] engineers is undeniable with a huge focus on large language models,"" said Josh Hendler, Vice President, Network at Schmidt Futures, which recently launched an initiative called Tekalo. ""However, based on conversations we’re having with both tech workers and organizations, we’re seeing incredible demand from engineers, product managers, designers, and other tech workers to work in spaces that matter.""Story continues""Climate is the most obvious demonstration of that,"" Hendler added, ""but we are also seeing tons of interest in the education space, human rights, tech policy, responsible tech (including uses of AI), and improving government services delivery.""Also, new businesses will grow and emerge from the AI frenzy, which means even more jobs in that sector.""We're also seeing new employers and businesses getting created,"" said Josh Reeves, CEO and co-founder of HR software company Gusto. ""That's shot up like crazy, which isn't something we saw during the pandemic.""What's next?""It's hard to predict the future, but I think objectively we can say that [layoffs and cost-cutting] seems to have slowed down,"" said Turing's Siddharth.

It signifies increased attention and, depending on the rating given, often generates more trading volume and positive price action on a stock.On July 13, BMO Capital Markets analyst Ari Klein initiated coverage on three real estate investment trusts (REITs) that specialize in owning and operating the communications infrastructure that allows for the transmission of data across networks in the U.S. and other countries.Klein initiated coverage on American Tower Corp. (NYSE:AMT) with an Outperform rating and a price target of $230. He also initiated coverage on SBA Communications Corp. (NASDAQ:SBAC) with a Market Perform rating and a price target of $260. Finally, he initiated coverage on Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) with an Underperform rating and a price target of $113.The data REITs have not performed as well as some other subsectors in 2023, but perhaps Klein senses that's about to change. All three specialty REITs will announce earnings soon and that could provide investors with an opportunity to add some ""fiber"" to their portfolios and boost their total performance.The market has a long history of overselling REITs when facing a potential recession, providing an incredible opportunity for investors to “lock in” massive yields. Gain access to insights from Benzinga’s real estate research team with the free Weekly REIT Report.American Tower Corp. is a Boston-based specialty REIT that calls itself ""a global leader in wireless infrastructure."" Founded in 1995, American Tower owns, operates and develops wireless and broadcast communications real estate. Most of its business is leasing space on wireless and broadcast towers, and it also leases portions of the land below the tower for equipment storage. Typical tower components are coaxial cabling and fiber optic cables.American Tower has a presence in 226,000 global communication sites in 25 countries on six continents. About 43,000 of those properties are in the U.S. and Canada, and approximately 180,000 are international properties. Contracts usually have a term of five to 10 years with renewal options and annual lease escalators of approximately 3%.Story continuesYear to date, American Tower's total return is negative 7.5%.On May 25, American Tower raised its quarterly dividend from $1.56 to $1.57 per share, the 18th time it has increased its dividend over the past five years. The annual dividend of $6.28 now yields 3.23%. American Tower will announce second-quarter earnings on July 27.On July 13, American Tower announced it will deploy a state-of-the-art distributed antenna system solution to bring 5G technology to the Xcel Energy Center, a sports arena in Minnesota that hosts the Minnesota Wild franchise of the National Hockey League.Crown Castle Inc. is a Houston-based specialized REIT that focuses on owning, operating and long-term leasing of cell towers.

Less than 30 years later, Crown Castle has over 40,000 towers and 85,000 route miles of fiber and 120,000 ""small cells"" (base stations like 5G that are used to enhance cellular network coverage and capacity) in its portfolio. Seventy-five percent of its towers are in the 100 largest areas of the U.S.On June 6, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Daniel Schlanger told investors at the NAREIT conference that Crown Castle has two goals — first, to grow its dividends per share around 7% to 8% per year by offering its wireless carrier customers the lowest-cost solution to building out a network.Crown Castle's second goal is to grow its revenue on the 40,000 cell tower assets it owns. Cell tower leasing makes up about 70% of Crown Castle's revenue.Schlanger added that Crown Castle has a tremendous opportunity in its small-cell building part of the business, which he sees growing in large quantities over the next decade. Year to date, Crown Castle has a total return of negative 13.55%.On July 11, Goldman Sachs analyst Brett Feldman maintained a Neutral rating on Crown Castle but lowered his price target from $142 to $125.Crown Castle pays a quarterly dividend of $1.565 per share, and the annual dividend of $6.26 per share presently yields 5.37%.

We'll also discuss the continuously deteriorating air and environmental quality. If you want to skip the details, read 10 Cleanest Countries In The World In 2023. Grading the 25 cleanest countries in the world in 2023 is a subjective topic that requires a deep dive into their environment-related efforts. For instance, the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) offers a broad measure of environmental health and ecosystem vitality, ranking countries based on factors such as air and water quality, biodiversity, and climate and energy policies. The EPI, as of 2022, identified Denmark, Luxembourg, and Switzerland as the leading cleanest countries in the world.But these rankings might vary if we look at more specific indicators. For example, according to IQAir World Report 2022, Iceland has the highest air quality score, closely followed by Australia and New Zealand. Contrarily, these countries' wastewater treatment efforts are ranked 25th, 10th, and 15th, respectively. Moreover, cultural norms and attitudes towards cleanliness, waste management, and littering impact a country's cleanliness. Therefore, assessing a country's cleanliness is a subjective and complex topic, heavily reliant on the specific dimensions evaluated.Sustainability-Focused Waste Management CompaniesForward-thinking waste management companies like Waste Management Inc (NYSE:WM), Waste Connections Inc (NYSE:WCN), and Republic Services Inc (NYSE:RSG) are continuously implementing efforts to make waste dumping sustainable. For instance, Waste Management Inc (NYSE:WM) has goals like greenhouse gas emissions reduction and responsible waste dumping. The company has started producing renewable fuels by capturing gases released from its landfills and converting it into low-carbon fuel that supports a portion of its fleet.

For instance, urbanization and vehicular traffic explosion have badly impacted the country's air quality and propelled it to the bottom of the list. High emission levels from vehicles, combined with inadequate waste management, contribute to an alarming increase in air, water, and soil pollution. Additionally, India's reliance on biomass fuels, primarily in rural areas, further compounds the pollution problem. These fuels, including firewood, cow dung, and crop residues, emit substantial amounts of pollutants when burned. While India has tried to mitigate these issues, the magnitude of the challenges requires extensive environmental-friendly policies, justifying its ranking as the least clean country in the world per the EPI Report 2022.25 Cleanest Countries in the World in 202325 Cleanest Countries in the World in 2023Our Methodology To rank the 25 cleanest countries in the world in 2023, we relied on their air quality index, waste management system, and availability of wastewater treatment networks. To understand these crucial parameters, we referred to the Environmental Performance Index Report 2022 (collectively published by Yale and Columbia University), which analyzes 180 countries according to 40 environmental performance indicators. Our first step was to shortlist 25 countries with the best overall EPI score in 2022 (given that it is awarded based on extensive variables, these countries are doing well overall). Then, as solid waste management and wastewater treatment determine a country’s determination towards being ‘clean,’ we picked these two variables from the EPI Report and shortlisted 25 countries with the highest score in these categories. The report has awarded wastewater treatment scores to countries depending on what percentage of a nation’s wastewater undergoes at least some kind of treatment. For example, if a country’s whole population is connected to a sewerage system and all of the collected wastewater is treated, its score will be 100%. Similarly, the EPI Index measures a country’s waste management system according to its efforts to limit solid waste, recycling rates, and oceanic plastic pollution. So if a nation’s solid waste management score is 79%, it indicates its overall performance in these criteria collectively. For our 3rd key metric, i.e., air quality index, we referred to the IQAir World Air Quality Report 2022, which scores countries based on PM2.5 ranking. PM2.5 refers to atmospheric particulate matter (PM) with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers. So if a place’s air has particulate matter between 0-12 μg/m³ (micrograms per cubic meter), it is considered good. Likewise, AQI of 12.1-34.5 μg/m³ is moderate, while a μg/m³ score of 55.5-150.4 is unhealthy. In short, the lower the 2.5PM rating, the better a country’s air quality will be.After listing these three variables individually for the top 25 countries, we averaged their scores to get composite rankings to present a broader perspective of their cleanliness levels. Based on our findings, here are the 25 cleanest countries in the world in 2023: 25.

JPMorgan and Wells Fargo were the first of the bank stocks to report their earnings, both boasting beats this morning. Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Jared Blikre checks out stock action surrounding bank stocks, semiconductor manufacturers, and health care company UnitedHealth after the closing bell.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: All right, taking a look at some of the individual movers, it certainly was a big day for banks. JP Morgan, Citi, Wells Fargo kicking off earnings season with a beat in earnings here for the second quarter. However, there were some things to be a little bit concerned about within these reports and digging into what Citigroup saw profits fall amid slower corporate spending. Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre here to weigh in. And as you can see, JP Morgan one of the only big banks here holding onto gains today.JARED BLIKRE: The fortress balance sheet. What can you say about that that hasn't been said before? They tend to win, and the First Republic acquisition looks like it's working in their favor. You can see they're one of the few if not the only one up today, up 64 basis points.Wells Fargo, now they started out the day in the green. They were up 2 or 3 percentage points, have sunk into the red over the last few years. The really big year for banks was 2021, and they've just been kind of flagging ever since.Here's Citigroup intraday down 4%, but I just want to show you a chart, Seana, to argue against zombie banks, because guess what, this was before the global financial crisis, the great financial crisis, and this is after. Basically, 12 years of doing nothing there, so that is the downside.SEANA SMITH: Certainly the downside. All right, Jared, let's also talk about some of the chip makers. Truist was out with a note, raising their price targets for NVIDIA and Broadcom. Now, the company's citing that the two chip makers have, quote, ""meaningful upsides right now amid high demand"". Certainly, obviously--Story continuesJARED BLIKRE: Meaningful?SEANA SMITH: NVIDIA by far the-- yeah, what are we looking-- we're looking at losses today.JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, well, I mean, we're looking at some losses today, but that chart is from the lower left to the upper right here, so if they're still seeing meaningful upside here, hey, I hope-- I want to be part of that. Let's not forget, a lot of this huge rally that we've seen here in this market concentration has been on the backs of some of this AI. Not on some of it, a lot of it on the AI hype, so that does need to continue. But up 200% for the year. That is just incredible.Take a look at Broadcom here, who they're also commenting about. Up about 60% year to date. The stock is just flagging in the upper end of its range. Well, that's a very bullish chart right there. We'll have to see what happens, but this consolidation that we're seeing here, that's healthy.SEANA SMITH: All right, Jared, well, another name that's on the move today, UnitedHealth Group rallying in today's trading session after beating second quarter expectations. The company also raising the low end of its profit outlook for 2023. Obviously, that's adding to some of the boost that we did see today, and it's helping some of its competitors as well.JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. We can see kind of a mixed board here. I would say, overall, healthcare has not been one of the best performers this year. It has not been about defense. They did tend to do well last year, especially in the back half, and you just take a look at the year to date performance, you're going to see kind of a bifurcation. You're going to see some winners here, but for the most part, a lot of them are losers.We know healthcare is a very difficult business to be in. One of the items that caught my mind with respect to United was they were-- a bunch of the states are getting together and finally clamping down on Medicaid and kicking out people who committed fraud or were not eligible over the pandemic. It does not seem to be having an appreciable effect just so far, but I think that's an interesting data point that could be important going forward.SEANA SMITH: All right, Jared Blikre, thanks so much for breaking that down.]"

Baird Investment Strategy Analyst Ross Mayfield and Annandale Capital Founder George Seay share their opinions on the earnings performance of big bank stocks, such as JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, and what it may say about market volatility moving into the second half of 2023. Seay continues to say that the Fed may have even 'engineered a pretty brilliant' soft landing scenario, noting that further interest rate hikes won't immediately handicap markets or consumers.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Big names like JPMorgan, PepsiCo, and Delta all beating the Street's expectations. But is that enough for investors and for the market to continue here to the upside? We want to discuss with Ross Mayfield, Baird Investment strategy analyst, and George Seay, Annandale Capital founder and chairman.Great to see you both. Ross, let me start with you. When it comes to even the results that we saw today, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Citi, the trading action on those stocks have been mixed despite the fact that all three beat the Street's expectations. So beating the Street's expectations, is that not going to be enough once again this quarter?ROSS MAYFIELD: I think it's going to be enough to keep stocks from really retreating from this rally, but I don't know if it's enough to spark the next leg higher. We saw, as we did in Q1 and as we see in most quarters, expectations and estimates drop across the quarter until the earnings season is really de-risked, but when you beat those estimates, you're beating kind of a lower estimate than otherwise would be expected. So I think unless you're seeing big beats, double line beats, maybe it's not enough to spark the next leg higher for a market that's sitting at bull market highs or the highs for this cycle. So I think it'll take a little bit more than just beating these de-risked estimates to spark a new leg higher.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: George, is it more about guidance? We certainly know that is something that investors take very seriously, what they are focusing on when you're trying to gauge what the company, what the results are going to look like two, three quarters out from now. Is that going to be really the driving factor here?GEORGE SEAY: Well, that's the right question, Seana. You have classic sell the news today, and you're going to have to really outperform what the Street is looking for to continue upward momentum in stocks, and you see that the Fab Seven stocks that have led the markets higher so much this year are starting to stall out a little bit, and the market just looks heavy and looks tired, and we've had such an unbelievable rally the first half of this year.I don't think it'll be too difficult to have some factors come in that make it a lot harder for the market to press higher, especially the NASDAQ that is up so much more than the rest of the market this year. It just looks toppy and tired and ready to take a break, and the VIX is showing a lot of complacency. I think that going into the fall, we may get a little more volatility coming in.SEANA SMITH: Do you agree with that, Ross?ROSS MAYFIELD: Yeah. I mean, look, Q2 was as calm a quarter as we've had in three or four years, really, in the post-pandemic era. If you look at the VIX making a three-year low, if you look at something like the lack of plus or minus 2% moves for a day, it was a really calm quarter despite some of the headline news and noise, so I do expect volatility to pick up, especially July is usually fine, but getting into August and September are typically seasonally challenging months. You do have extended valuations, you do have rates spiking a little bit over the last couple of weeks.And so, do we expect some volatility? Yes. But at the same time, we respect the momentum and the resilience of the market from the first half, and if you look at history of first half strength like we saw has really been a bullish signpost for the second half. We might just have to get towards the end of the year towards Q4 before we really start to reap those results.SEANA SMITH: And, George, we're also starting to get some commentary on the consumer. We heard it from a number of the bank CEOs this morning, Citi CEO Jane Fraser saying that we are seeing a more cautious consumer but not necessarily a recessionary one. What are you expecting to hear this quarter about the health of the consumer?GEORGE SEAY: I think every aspect of the economy is going to start fading somewhat, Seana. I do think the Fed has engineered a pretty brilliant soft landing, which I always thought was kind of the most likely outcome because we had so much stimulus in the market they did have to jack rates up that excessively to bring inflation back to bear and bring the economy back to a more gradual steady state growth rate.But I think that, again, back to exhaustion, I think that these interest rate increases, they don't immediately handicap the economy and the market and the consumer. It's about a 9 to 18 month lag period in between the time they start jacking up those rates to see the really significant impacts of it, and I think this fall, this winter, and maybe even into the spring, we're going to start to see some real overhang from that and some real pressure on the consumer and the markets and the overall economy.SEANA SMITH: Ross, let's talk about some of the data that we got out this week, because we got a few readings on inflation, also the consumer, US consumer sentiment rising for the second straight month the highest level that we've seen in almost two years, and this sharp incline largely attributed to the fact that we are seeing inflation ease just a bit, stability in the labor markets. But, Ross, how do you think the Fed is looking at the data that we've gotten out over the last several days and what that tells them just about their fight against inflation and how much higher they need to go with rates?ROSS MAYFIELD: You know, to me it would say we could look at a pause or maybe one last rate hike, but what the Fed is saying is they still want to do two more hikes, if not more down the road, if they view inflation as not properly anchored. And they might look at the CPI data, the PPI data and be encouraged. They might also look at core CPI still around 5%, or in the consumer confidence report this morning inflation expectations still kind of anchored above 3%, and see reason to keep hiking.If I were the Fed, I would definitely be pausing here. I think the disinflationary trend is obvious. I think you can engineer a soft landing if you don't go too far here. But what the Fed wants to do has been made clear. They want to do two more hikes this year, and they want to keep the optionality to go higher if inflation isn't where they want it at 2%. They want to be higher for longer, and I think they feel like they can do that.SEANA SMITH: George, if we do see-- another rate hike is pretty much a sure thing, although you never say that, but largely in terms of what traders are betting on, they think that it's a sure thing later this month. If we do see though two more rate hikes before the end of the year, what does that mean for the labor market and what that's going to look like by year end?GEORGE SEAY: Well, as we've seen so far, it hasn't meant much. The labor market is still incredibly strong and we've seen a lot more rate hikes than just another 25 to 50 basis points. I think the Fed's got one to three hikes left in it, but I don't really like the slow and steady gradual drip methodology they've been using. I was calling six months ago for them to do a 75 basis point hike early this year and say, we're done, and we may be done for good, but we're done for at least six to eight months, give the market some certainty, and this slow drip, drip, drip may not matter for now, but eventually it may matter for the market if short term interest rates get up around 6%.All of a sudden people look at the multiples they're paying for NVIDIA and Microsoft and some of the other more speculative stocks and go, whoa, with 6% short term rates, we've got to discount these earnings more. So I wish they'd get it over with and hit a pause and then assess how the economy reacts. And I agree, I think that's going to happen pretty soon. I hope it's sooner rather than later.SEANA SMITH: Ross, let's talk about how to play all of this here. Bank of America strategists, they were out with a suggestion today saying to short stocks as global equity funds see inflows of nearly $70 billion in the past seven weeks, and I think this massive run-up that we've seen since the start of the year, a lot of strategists are saying, hey, maybe now is the time for a pause. Do you think it's time, Ross, for some caution from investors?ROSS MAYFIELD: So I think-- I think, sure, a sign for some caution, maybe expectations of volatility and some sideways trading for a bit, but I don't think it's time to get bearish or short stocks. As I mentioned, if your first half is 10% or greater, your second half has a higher percent chance of being strong. So the momentum in the market is really something to be respected.You know, maybe a rotation into some of the more cyclical value stocks economic. Momentum is pretty strong, economic surprise indices are at multi-year highs, you're starting to see just a little bit of percolation from something like energy, industrials have been the story of the market if not for tech, so I think there's still opportunity out there within the equity market to maybe rotate into something that looks a little bit more-- a little bit cheaper on a valuation basis, but without trimming your exposure to stocks, which are really responding to a stronger economy and have been resilient in the face of a lot of headwinds this year. So we're not getting bearish yet.SEANA SMITH: George, where do you see the most opportunity today?GEORGE SEAY: Well, I agree that trying to time the market I think is a fool's game and I don't advocate. We at Annandale Capital don't advocate that for anybody. But I think you ought to look hard at your allocation and make sure that whether it's 40% or 60% or 70%, you've got the right allocation to stocks, and if you've had a big move in your technology and other kind of high tech related growth areas of the market, you ought to look at trimming those or potentially riding some call options against them and look at sectors of the market that are much more attractive because they've been left behind this year.And as mentioned previously, that's energy, I would say that's also healthcare, and I would say financials too. We think regional banks are very attractive because they got thrown out so hard earlier this year, and there's going to be some consolidation in that space for sure, because they just can't compete with the big money center banks. And I think exposure to the best of class money center banks like JPMorgan is a great idea too.There was a sell the news today movement going on among the Street, but if you own the best of class firms in that area too, that's a good idea. So I would look at it less as trying to time the market or make a draconian reduction in your stock exposure, more to rotate to areas of the market where future upside is more attractive than it is in some of the stuff that's rallied so hard this year.SEANA SMITH: All right. George Seay and Ross Mayfield, great to get your perspectives here on the market. Thanks so much for joining. Have a good weekend.]"

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)A warning for smaller banksThere was also a new warning Friday for smaller banks. That came from State Street (STT), which was the nation's 12th largest as of March 31.In its second quarter results, State Street disclosed that its net interest income, which measures the difference between what it earns from loans and pays out in deposits, fell 10% when compared to the first quarter.That's largely because of rising deposit rates and a rotation by customers out of non-interest-bearing deposits as they seek higher yields. The bank now expects net interest income to drop 12% to 18% in the coming quarter.Read more: High-yield savings account vs. CD: Which is right for you?""What we found is that our larger clients, and we primarily have large, sophisticated clients, are quite active in thinking about their alternatives, and... that has been accelerated by the swiftness of this cycle and the place that we've come to and the speed,"" said Eric Aboaf, State Street CFO.Story continuesSome other mid-sized banks that report their results in the coming weeks have already revised down their expectations for how much of this income they can earn, including executives for US Bancorp (USB), Citizens Financial Group (CFG), Comerica (CMA), Huntington (HBAN), KeyCorp (KEY), and Zions (ZION).State Street's stock closed down 12% Friday.Navigating the chaosThe results kicked off a closely watched earnings season where banks of all sizes will be trying to show that they recovered from one of the most tumultuous periods for the industry since the 2008 financial crisis.JPMorgan demonstrated its hold over the rest of the industry during the chaos of the spring by winning a government-run auction to purchase the bulk of operations of First Republic after regulators seized the San Francisco lender.First Republic was one of three sizable regional banks to fail, along with Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Their seizures triggered a panic in the banking system and outflows of depositors from a number of smaller banks.The deal lifted JPMorgan's second quarter numbers. It said First Republic added $2.4 billion to net income. That helped push overall earnings to $14.5 billion, up 67% from the same period a year ago. Wells Fargo's earnings of $4.9 billion were up 57%.Trouble on Wall StreetThe industry is no longer at the same crisis level as it was in the spring, but second quarter results from some of the biggest banks contained reminders that the industry still faces a number of challenges on several fronts.Citigroup, for example, struggled with a recent drought of dealmaking that is making day-to-day life more difficult for all of Wall Street. Its investment banking revenues fell by 24% to $612 million. Trading was another weakness. Revenue from that activity fell 13%.Citigroup and other firms with big investment banking and trading units have made or announced cuts of roughly 12,000 jobs since the end of 2022. Dealmaking is drying up amid a rise in interest rates and economic uncertainty.Even JPMorgan had challenges on this front. Its investment banking fees fell by 6% from a year ago to $1.5 billion. Its trading revenues from equities and fixed income also fell.'Things are better than people would have expected'What JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup had in common Friday is that they set aside more money to cover future loan losses, a sign they expect the economy to slow in the coming quarters.Many other banks are also expected to do the same when they report their second quarter results.Wells Fargo set aside $1.71 billion in provisions for credit losses in the second quarter, compared with $580 million a year ago. That included a $949 million increase primarily for commercial real estate office loans.""I think things are better than people would have expected at this point in the cycle,"" said Wells Fargo CFO Mike Santomassimo. ""We do expect that they'll be more weakness in the [commercial real estate] market and it's going to take a while to play out. It'll be a while before we see you know, the end of end of this.""CEO Charlie Scharf said the US economy ""continues to be resilient.""JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. REUTERS/Brian Snyder (Brian Snyder / reuters)JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon also sounded optimistic about the US economy, saying it ""continues to be resilient"" and that ""consumers are spending, albeit a little more slowly.""His CFO, Jeremy Barnum, told reporters the bank does not expect a lot of loan demand except for credit cards and autos.

Whalen Global Advisors Chairman Richard Christopher Whalen tells Yahoo Finance Live there are two key takeaways from the reports. First, Whalen notes that the growth in the costs of deposits slowed down. Second, Whalen says that ""credit is basically flat...because frankly the consumer is still okay.""Whalen also discusses the impact of regulation, something JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned about in his company's earnings release, saying ""material regulatory changes would likely have real world consequences for markets and end users."" Whalen says that additional regulation will likely force some consolidation among smaller and mid-sized banks because ""some banks are going to be better at readjusting their balance sheet than others, and the ones that don't move quickly are going to get sold.""In the interview, Whalen also previews what investors can expect from Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) and how commercial real estate is a ""chopped salad"" for banks.Key video moments00:01:04 Whalen's key takeaways00:03:36 How smaller banks will be impacted by new regulations00:05:05 Impact of commercial real estate woes on banks00:08:00 What to expect from Goldman Sachs and Morgan StanleyVideo Transcript- All right, let's first start off with the big bank earnings. JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, and Citi all beating the Street's expectations. JP Morgan coming out strong in the second quarter. Thanks, in part, to higher interest rates. Profit at the bank jumping 67%. Lifted, in part, by the company's acquisition of the failed first Republic Bank that was back in May.Now, Wells Fargo's profit surged 57%. The bank also raising its annual forecast for net interest income. And Citi beating the Street's expectations. But revenue did fall 1% from a year ago and net income did drop about 36%.So let's break it all down. We want to bring in Chris Whalen, chairman at Whalen Global Advisors. Chris, it's good to see you. So certainly just taking a look at these results from the big banks, specifically Wells Fargo and JP Morgan, very strong numbers here from those two banks. And it's almost like we're just forgetting about some of the crises, some of the strains that we did see within the banking system earlier this year. What's your takeaway from these results and what it signals for the second half?Story continuesRICHARD CHRISTOPHER WHALEN: I think there's two big takeaways. First, the growth in the cost of deposits slowed down. So that's a big positive for the banks. We were worried that we could see deposit rates double this quarter, simply because of the aftershock from the three bank failures in the first quarter.So what you've seen is that slowed down and also credit is basically flat. Most of the banks didn't have to increase their provisions for future losses because frankly, the consumer is still OK. You're not seeing a huge spike. Although you are seeing things like multifamily and commercial obviously above average, if you will.But everybody else is still muted because of the Fed and quantitative easing. It's actually pushed down credit. And I think that's going to be a positive for the banks for the rest of the year. So what it comes down to is can they continue to adjust? Can they find higher yielding assets on the one hand, and somehow get rid of some of the legacy stuff from 2021 that they still own?- Chris, who is best positioned? Is it JP Morgan that's best positioned to make those types of changes, adjust their business, in order to position themselves for growth here in the coming quarters?RICHARD CHRISTOPHER WHALEN: Well, we put out a note a couple of weeks ago, just looking at the first quarter, and JP Morgan came out of that very strong. They have a 10-point advantage in terms of their operating leverage, versus the other three of the top four banks. That's extraordinary.They're down around peer group 1 levels, which is basically small banks, around 50% efficiency. And I really tip my hat to Jamie Dimon for growing the balance sheet on the one hand, but keeping his operating leverage down around the same as small banks. It's quite something.I mean, look at Bank of America, look at Wells, they're giving up 10 points of operating leverage to Jamie Dimon. So second quarter, he hit it out of the park, as you said. And I think you can expect to see them continue to do that because JB is better at managing the business, both in terms of the operations and also versus the Fed. And managing the duration of his balance sheet in a way that's at least not going to hurt him.The other banks haven't been that good at that. And I think you're going to see them tune that up. And I think the regulators, as you know, very focused on this, they're going to force them to tune up their market risk management.- Chris, how are you looking at the coming regulation within the space? The focus that we have seen on the banks. Obviously, when you take a look at the bigger banks, they are better equipped to handle some of the capital allocations, capital rules, that are changing here going ahead. But what is that going to do to some of the smaller banks or mid-sized banks within this sector? Are we going to see further consolidation and how much?RICHARD CHRISTOPHER WHALEN: I think it's going to force some consolidation because some banks are going to be better at readjusting their balance sheet than others. And the ones that don't move quickly are going to get sold. Very simple.I think you're going to see the big bank group, what we call peer group 1, it's 140 banks now, they're above $10 billion in assets. Everybody from Jamie Dimon on down. That's where you see growth in the industry. So I think those 20, 30, $40 billion banks are going to grow in number, as they should. And the big guys, frankly, would like to get smaller, if they could.If you sat down with Jamie and his CFO, he would tell you he'd love to be closer to 2 trillion because he'd make more money. But for now, they're doing fine. I think Wells Fargo is the most improved student in the class. I'm a little disappointed with US Bank because they traditionally have been right next to JB in terms of operating performance.You know, Citi, not a bad quarter. And they didn't have to increase credit provisions, which I think, again, was a big takeaway so far.- Chris, one sign of trouble, maybe we can say that, within Wells Fargo's report was the amount that they put aside for future loan losses. And I know you briefly touched on this before. But they did report $1.7 billion provision for loan losses. A lot of that attributed to some of the losses that we could see on office loans. Just give us a sense of what this tells us just about the current state and the risk that is still ahead, that's looming here, for some of these banks when it comes to the losses in commercial real estate?RICHARD CHRISTOPHER WHALEN: Commercial is chopped salad. Every building is different, every story is different. So you're going to see losses coming out of the Wells commercial book, and they're going to be quite idiosyncratic. They're going to be different sizes. And then you're going to see big recoveries too.So that's going to go on for years. It's a multi-year story. A lot of these commercial assets will be restructured or extended and they'll try and buy some time and see if the market doesn't turn back in their direction. Because does Wells Fargo want to take over a big multifamily building? No. They want that building to be functional and healthy and be able to support the tenants.So that, to me, is going to be the story for most banks going forward in the next year. It's not going to be residential. This is not like 2008. This is a different kind of credit story with multifamily as well as commercial office space, kind of on the block. You can see it in the specialty press if you follow the Real Deal and some of the other media that really focus on the commercial market. It's all over the place.You've got buildings going into bankruptcy being auctioned, you've got other buildings that are financing in good order. You've got cities like San Francisco. You know, no bank wants exposure in San Francisco right now. And I think the Bank regulators have told the banks to be very careful of legacy, B and C class, urban office space. That's been the message for a while.So I think every bank I look at, credit, efficiency, and how well they recover from default, is always one of the first things I assess. And I think the small banks have commercial exposures in the community. And then as you get up into the bigger banks, they're national. They have exposure to all kinds of deals everywhere.You can see fatigue in places like Texas, and some of the other hot markets, they're definitely overbuilt now. Houston, even, believe it or not, Austin, Texas, which has received enormous amounts of inflows of investment over the last few years.- Yeah, certainly a story that really varies--RICHARD CHRISTOPHER WHALEN: New York City.- We have regional--RICHARD CHRISTOPHER WHALEN: There's a lot of mezzanine finance in New York City held by banks. So we'll hear about that.- Yeah. And then there's also, of course, the pockets, like you were saying, that are strong and that are on solid footing within commercial real estate outside of office. Chris, let's look ahead to next week because we're also going to be getting a report here from Goldman Sachs. And we know Goldman obviously more exposed or more reliant, I should say, on trading and deal activity. Are we going to see a different type of report from Goldman.Oh, yeah, you always do. They're much more focused on your investment banking side. I think the guidance has been that side of the House is going to be light. You're going to see credit expenses continue to work themselves out as they shut down markets and get out of that business really.And then the question is cost of funds for the whole enterprise. It's going to be high. They and Morgan Stanley, frankly, have both seen the market side of their business, reprice very quickly. So they're paying market rates today.They both have banks. Morgan Stanley's got a bigger bank than Goldman. And the bank doesn't really support either firm entirely. It's not like Schwab or the bank is kind of a nice thing to have but they don't need it. So I think that-- the way I would put it is I'm looking to see how well the capital markets business is being managed, and see if they can avoid other credit, you know, stumbles, I guess, is the way I would put it.Morgan Stanley is in a different space right now than Goldman. They have bigger AUM. I think a more stable business, frankly.- All right, well, we will see what the results next week tell us about the health of those two banks, Chris Whalen, always great to speak with you, of Whalen Global Advisors.RICHARD CHRISTOPHER WHALEN: Have a great weekend, guys.- Thank you. You too.]"

In the TUSCANY-2 phase IIb study in ulcerative colitis, RVT-3101 led to improved efficacy data from the induction period at week 14 to the chronic period at week 56. RVT-3101 was well tolerated in the study, with a favorable safety profile across all doses.The data, announced last month, outperformed the company’s expectations. Roivant believes the data, if confirmed in phase III studies, has the potential to transform the treatment paradigm for IBD patients. Inflammatory bowel disease is an approximately $17 billion market in the United States alone and growing.

These companies often introduce new products, services, or business models that have the potential to significantly impact the market and drive growth. According to a report by McKinsey &amp; Company, companies that effectively utilize innovation as a core component of their business strategy gain a significant competitive advantage compared to their counterparts. Research has shown that these companies not only outperform others but also generate economic profits that are 2.4 times higher. In other words, by mastering the art of innovation, companies can achieve greater financial success and outshine their competitors.In a rapidly evolving global landscape, countries and economies need to stay at the forefront of innovation to remain competitive. Through the development of new products, services, and technologies, innovative companies create jobs, stimulate investment, and contribute to overall economic progress. The US  is widely recognized for its remarkable ability to innovate and its entrepreneurial spirit. This commitment to innovation has been a key driver of America's economic dominance. Economists estimate that roughly half of the annual GDP growth in the United States can be attributed to advancements and increases in innovation, as reported by the US Chamber of Commerce Foundation.Also read: Most Innovative Companies in the WorldAs mentioned above, successful innovation drives significant growth in a business. One of the main aspects of innovation is research &amp; development (R&amp;D), which involves systematic and scientific exploration to develop new products, technologies, or processes. By investing in R&amp;D, companies can enhance their capabilities, explore new ideas, and uncover innovative solutions to meet customer needs. Over the years, global R&amp;D investments have grown across different sectors. McKinsey reported that in various industries, such as high-tech, automotive, and consumer goods, companies are allocating more than 20 percent of their earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) towards research focused on innovation.Story continuesResearch from National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) showed that R&amp;D activities conducted in the US amounted to a total of $717 billion in 2020. The report further mentioned that the growth of total R&amp;D in the US, when adjusted for inflation, averaged 4.1% per year from 2010 to 2020. In contrast, during the previous decade, the average annual growth of U.S. total R&amp;D was lower at 2.1%. Major companies like Apple Inc.

In the last reported quarter, the New York-based integrated systems provider beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9 cents. The company is expected to have recorded marginally higher aggregate revenues year over year despite a challenging macroeconomic environment and softness in traditional businesses.Factors at PlayDuring the second quarter, IBM launched single frame and rack mount configurations of IBM z16 and IBM LinuxONE Rockhopper 4 to enhance data centers’ productivity and support a dynamic IT ecosystem. With enhanced security capabilities, the single frame and rack mount configurations enable seamless deployment in new environments, significantly improving data center flexibility. This is likely to have driven the top-line growth in the Software segment.During the quarter, IBM collaborated with Adobe to support brands with an enhanced content supply chain with next-generation AI capabilities. Integration of Adobe’s generative AI models with the in-depth technical expertise of IBM Consulting services, ranging from technological innovation, design and strategy, will help clients with a simplified generative AI landscape.IBM also collaborated with the All-England Lawn Tennis Club to introduce generative AI tools in the Wimbledon Championship and bring new features for a premium digital experience for the viewers. The All-England Lawn Tennis Club is aiming to increase fan engagement and expand the tournament's global audience by utilizing advanced AI technology from IBM watsonx.These are likely to have generated incremental revenues in the Consulting segment.However, escalating expenses toward cloud platform development amid intense competition in the cloud space are likely to have eroded its margins. In addition, the company is expected to have recorded adverse currency translation effects, likely hurting its bottom line.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues for the company stands at $15,566 million. It generated revenues of $15,535 million in the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $2.00 per share, indicating a decline from $2.31 in the year-earlier quarter.Story continuesKey Developments in Q2During the to-be-reported quarter, IBM unveiled plans to develop its first quantum data center in Europe. The strategic investment is likely to help the company better serve its clients in an expanding quantum computing ecosystem in the continent. The facility is the second of its kind from the company after Poughkeepsie, NY. Located at IBM's facility in Ehningen, Germany, the data center is expected to be operational in 2024. Leveraging multiple IBM quantum computing systems, each equipped with quantum processors of more than 100 qubits, the facility is likely to cater to cloud-based quantum computing research and exploratory activity of users in diverse domains such as material science, high energy physics, energy transition, sustainability and financial applications. It is likely to help clients manage their European data regulation requirements while tapping its huge potential to solve some of the world's most challenging problems.During the quarter, IBM inked a definitive agreement to acquire Apptio Inc., a prominent provider of financial and operational IT management and optimization software, for $4.6 billion. Apptio is a well-established, profitable leader in technology business management and FinOps, serving in excess of 1,500 clients, including more than half of the Fortune 100.

169,9a9e317f-6639-3621-8b19-202aac61b24a,TAP,2023-07-15,Brown-Forman's (BF.B) Brands & Strategies Provide Growth Impetus,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brown-formans-bf-b-brands-153500122.html,1689348900,STORY,"['BF-B', 'KOF', 'TAP-A', 'NAPA']","[Brown-Forman Corporation (BF.B) has been in a good spot, courtesy of strength in its brands, mainly Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey. The company has been gaining from the premiumization of its portfolio and aggressive brand investments. The gains of these efforts have been well reflected in its share price.Shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have risen 5% in the past three months against the industry and the sector’s declines of 2.9% and 1.3%, respectively.BF.B also remains on track with its long-term pricing strategy, which aims to increase prices year over year to grow sales as part of its revenue growth management initiatives. Consequently, management has issued an upbeat fiscal 2024 view.Brown-Forman anticipates organic sales growth of 5-7% for fiscal 2024. The company remains optimistic about organic sales and organic operating income growth. It predicts trends to normalize after two consecutive years of double-digit organic sales growth. Based on the aforementioned assumptions, Brown-Forman expects the organic operating income to increase 6-8%, driven by lower supply-chain disruption costs, partly offset by continued input cost pressures.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BF.B’s fiscal 2024 sales and earnings suggests growth of 6.6% and 8.5%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s reported numbers.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRobust Trends in PlaceBrown-Forman has been displaying portfolio strength thanks to its ongoing premiumization efforts. The company’s underlying sales for fiscal 2023 were aided by its strong brand portfolio and growth across all geographic regions. Premium bourbon brands reported sales growth of 23% and organic sales growth of 24% in fiscal 2023, driven by double-digit growth in Woodford Reserve and Old Forester. An estimated rise in distributor inventories, along with higher volumes and pricing, boosted sales for Woodford Reserve and Old Forester.New Mix reported sales growth of 53% and organic sales growth of 45%, driven by market share gains in Mexico, as well as higher volumes and prices. Brown-Forman’s tequila portfolio witnessed year-over-year sales growth of 10% each on a reported basis and organic basis. This was driven by double-digit sales growth for the el Jimador and Herradura brands.Another key contributor to the company’s growth story has been the continued momentum of its Jack Daniel family of brands. Jack Daniel’s RTDs/Ready-to-Pours have been benefiting from the introduction of the Jack Daniel’s and Coca-Cola RTD, as well as the launch of Jack Daniel’s Bonded Tennessee Whiskey, resulting in year-over-year sales growth of 11% and 16% on an organic basis in fiscal 2024.In fiscal 2023, net sales for Jack Daniel’s family of brands were up 4% on a reported basis and 9% on an organic basis. The brand’s sales were driven by solid demand, higher pricing and the estimated increase in distributor inventories. The upside in sales was also driven by the strength in Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey in the international markets and the Travel Retail channel.Story continuesWhat Holds Back the StockWhat could be a potential threat to Brown-Forman’s performance is the higher input costs and supply chain disruptions. Brown-Forman has witnessed several headwinds in fiscal 2023, including supply chain challenges, higher input costs due to inflation, the significant impact of negative foreign exchange and the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war. Going ahead into fiscal 2024, inflation is likely to continue to negatively impact input costs.Brown-Forman is also likely to continue witnessing higher advertising expenses due to continued investments in its brands.ConclusionDespite the threats, we believe that strength in Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey portfolio premiumization and pricing strategy are likely to offset inflation and cost woes.Stocks to ConsiderWe highlighted some better-ranked stocks from the beverages space, namely The Duckhorn Portfolio NAPA, Molson Coors TAP and Coca-Cola FEMSA KOF.Duckhorn currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

These, along with the adverse impacts of higher marketing investment, have been key deterrents. Going ahead, management expects inflation to remain the greatest challenge.During the first quarter of 2023, the company’s cost of sales increased to $1,609 million from $1,428 million reported in the year-ago period. This marred the company’s margins.In first-quarter 2023, the adjusted operating income decreased 4.5% to $699 million. Meanwhile, the adjusted operating margin contracted 300 bps to 20.8%. This was mainly due to the comparison to year-ago benefits, broad-based inflationary pressure and increased marketing investment.Additionally, the company is not free from the impacts of adverse currencies due to its worldwide operations. The weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar may require the company to either raise prices or contract profit margins in locations outside the country. Any fluctuation in foreign currency may act as a deterrent in the near term.Thanks to the hardships, shares of the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have lost 11% in the past three months against the industry’s growth of 1.4%. The company also compares unfavorably with the sector’s decline of 1.4% and the S&amp;P 500’s rally of 8% in the same period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDo Pricing Actions &amp; Innovation Place it Well?Keurig seems to be strong on its continued brand strength, significant pricing actions, solid performance in its cold beverages and strong market share gains. These traits have been boosting the company’s sales performance in recent quarters.The company has been particularly gaining traction in the Refreshment Beverage segment for quite some time now. The division reported strong sales growth for the first quarter, mainly on higher net price realization and a rise in volume/mix. The segment has witnessed strong traction from recent innovations, most notably Dr Pepper Strawberries &amp; Cream, effective in-market execution and its recently announced sales and distribution partnership for C4 Energy. The continuation of this trend may help the company's bottom line in the short term.The company is also witnessing remarkable trends on the market share front. It reported strong in-market performance in the Liquid Refreshment Beverages category in the first quarter on retail dollar consumption growing 13.6% and market share expansion above 88% of KDP's cold beverage portfolio.The market share expansion mainly reflected strength in CSDs, seltzers, energy, apple juice, coconut waters and fruit drinks. Strength in Dr Pepper, Canada Dry, A&amp;W, Sunkist, Squirt and Crush CSDs, Polar seltzers, Vita Coco, C4 Energy, Mott's and Hawaiian Punch also were key contributors. KDP’s manufactured shares in coffee were solid at 81%, driven by higher consumer mobility year over year.Driven by the robust quarterly results, Keurig Dr Pepper has reaffirmed its view for 2023, which seems encouraging. The company expects sales growth of 5% and adjusted earnings increase of 6-7%.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderWe highlighted some better-ranked stocks from the beverages space, namely The Duckhorn Portfolio NAPA, Molson Coors TAP and Coca-Cola FEMSA KOF.Duckhorn currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

172,88964dbe-35d4-33fa-9323-767b961abf9b,GM,2023-07-15,UAW negotiations with Big 3 underway: What's at stake for automakers,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/uaw-negotiations-big-3-underway-211228930.html,1689369148,VIDEO,"['STLA', 'GM', 'F']","[President Biden has tapped senior advisor Gene Sperling to lead negotiations between automakers and United Auto Workers (UAW) labor unions at Stellantis, Ford, and General Motors plants. Detroit Free Press Automotive Reporter Eric Lawrence joins Yahoo Finance Live's Seana Smith to break down union demands, including cost of living adjustments as automakers profit off of booming auto sales, as well as job security as more auto companies pivot towards EV adoption.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: I want to get to another big story that we're following. President Biden tapping advisor, Gene Sperling, as the administration's point person during the current labor union negotiations for auto workers. The UAW making it clear that, whether or not there is a strike, it's up to the automakers GM, Stellantis, and Ford. Negotiations, well, they kicked off this week. First with Stellantis, now, today, with Ford.Here to map out the road ahead for the auto industry, we want to bring in Eric Lawrence, Detroit Free Press automotive reporter. Eric, it's good to see you. So before we get into what exactly the union workers are asking for, just give us a sense of how significant this is and what's at stake.ERIC LAWRENCE: Well, this is a significant round of talks. It comes with a backdrop of the transition to electric vehicles. So it's a key moment for the industry. A lot of changes within the industry. So the union is looking for protections for its workers.Many of them work in powertrain and a lot of the vehicles obviously tied to internal combustion engine. So a lot of those jobs, there are questions about a lot of those jobs in the long-term. Part of what the union has staked out has been the need for job security.And they point to plants that have been idled or closed, places like Belvidere, Illinois, where Stellantis had made its Jeep Cherokee. Those are some of the issues. And of course, the union also wants to ensure that the jobs, that some of the new battery plants also have comparable wages to what folks at the other auto facilities have.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: Yeah, Eric. You mentioned there the transition to EVs and how union workers are a little bit worried about what that could mean for their jobs going forward. Are they worried that we could see more job cuts as a result? And just break down exactly why that could be the case.ERIC LAWRENCE: Well, one of the key things is the fact that EVs, they have fewer parts. So there will be likely to be fewer people needed to produce these vehicles. And a lot of the jobs that have been in the auto industry in the past, they won't necessarily transition over easily.So they have to-- the workers that are there, if they're working in some areas, will need to learn new skills. Battery plant work is going to be different than an assembly line work. And you'll see the need for that kind of a transition.SEANA SMITH: Eric, what are you hearing from automakers? We're going to hear quarterly results later this month. But in terms of how they are meeting or how they are, I guess, listening to the union workers' demands, how open are they to making some of these changes?ERIC LAWRENCE: Well, automakers, what they've said is they have a need for flexibility. There's a big focus on China right now. China recently became the top auto exporter in the world. And they're going to be-- that's an area where the focus has been on electric vehicles. So these automakers, they're global.They see the global picture, so they're concerned about that. The automakers have been tremendously profitable. That's part of what the UAW has been focused on. One of the things they've been referencing is the, they say, quarter of a trillion dollars in profits in the last 10 years. So the industry has been doing quite well.Stellantis is the owner of Jeep, RAM, Dodge, Chrysler. That company made, what? $18 billion last year in profit. So while they stress the need to be competitive, they're also talking to the union at a time when they've been very profitable for years. We don't necessarily expect to see a big change in the upcoming quarterly results.We expect they're still doing well. Even during the pandemic when there were issues with supply chains, things like that, they were able to maintain pricing pressure. Now, some of that's expected to ease a little bit. But they've basically-- even though they've maybe not sold as many vehicles as they could have, those vehicles are at really high average transaction prices. So they're doing OK on that front, too.SEANA SMITH: Eric, the timeline of these talks, the fact that it started with Stellantis yesterday, I believe, four got underway today, GM next week. Is it normally at the same time? Or have the union workers taken a different approach in the past? And why would that be the case?ERIC LAWRENCE: Well, right now it's starting out pretty similar in terms of timing. They get started in the summer. There are some initial meetings. This is just early days in this process. And just so the specifics with which companies are going first right now, I don't know if that's so significant.Normally, at some point, the union would announced a lead company. And then when they-- and then that would be the company they would do the main kind of negotiations with. And they'll set a pattern for the other automakers to follow. We're not sure what the union's going to do this time.The union president has said the Detroit 3 is the target. So they've been careful with how they frame that. So we're not sure. The automakers themselves, they indicate that they're taking it seriously. They think they expect they'll get to some kind of an agreement.But this is a different time. The union is talking in terms that they probably haven't talked in a long time. They've kind of come out swinging. They've kind of put the automakers on notice and they've told the workers that they expect to fight for a lot this contract.So we'll have to see how it turns out. The contracts are in effect until mid-September. And so we won't see a lot of action probably for the next couple of weeks, but it'll start to heat up certainly next month.SEANA SMITH: Well, Eric, we've heard from a number of analysts. It sounds like, largely speaking, they expect a strike. Do you?ERIC LAWRENCE: Well, that's kind of the expectation. The UAW has not done anything to dissuade us from that. There have been some strikes at some suppliers. There's been a lot of talk about the need to be-- the need to take action and to stand up. I don't think anybody would be surprised to see a strike.Precisely which automaker it might be, we've heard many number of scenarios. I would not be surprised to see a strike. I don't know that a strike is always inevitable. Obviously, the automakers and a lot of folks connected to the industry are quick to point out the cost of a strike.But I'd say that a lot of the rank and file are pretty motivated this time around. And even four years ago, the UAW struck then and maybe it didn't seem so pressing to folks then. So we'll have to see.SEANA SMITH: All right. Well, we will follow the negotiations. And like you said, the contracts are set to expire in September. Eric Lawrence, great to have you. Thank you so much for joining.ERIC LAWRENCE: Thank you very much.]"

Last Saturday, Renault (OTC: RNLSY) Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard expressed his concerns to Reuters regarding Europe’s over-reliance on China, emphasizing the need for building a costly supply chain. Meanwhile, in the U.S., Worksport Ltd (NASDAQ: WKSP) has just announced it has made significant progress at its 220,000 square feet U.S. facility, continuing its way towards delivering its revolutionary Solis solar-powered tonneau cover and COR remote power storage system. Meanwhile, EV king Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) told the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that the United States could go all-electric by the end of the decade, but it would settle for 69% of new car sales.Toyota And Stellantis Believe The EPA Is Overly OptimisticToyota Motor (NYSE: TM) finds the EPA has underestimated key EV challenges, such as scarcity of raw materials out of which batteries are made, as well as the fact that that the U.S. is not either the mining or refining home to these minerals. There’s also the issue of the high cost of making EVs along with a developing infrastructure that is, at its current state, unable to support a wide EV adoption.Stellantis (NYSE: STLA) also believes that EPA’s expection of EV market growth is too optimistic while assuming a ‘perfect’ transition and underestimating challenges such as lagging manufacturing capacity and the support for EV drivers.Tesla Is Still Running The Show Although GM Promises To Catch UpWhile US is still lagging behind other major markets in the contribution of EVs in total car sales, it’s certainly picking up pace going from 3% in 2021 to 5% in 2022, while expecting 8 to 10% this year. Without exaggeration, this was achieved mainly by Tesla who makes the most of EVs in the U.S. However, General Motors (NYSE: GM) CEO Mary Barra is confident the automaker would catch up to and surpass Tesla to become the top EV seller in the US, but after producing just over 39,000 all-electric vehicles last year compared to Tesla’s 1.4 million, GM seems to be aiming too high. But GM is going for the “EVs for everyone” strategy and not by going through the struggle of replicating of the company’s internal combustion engine portfolio. Rather, GM is going strategic with its EV approach by offering both affordable and luxury models, along with pickups and SUVs and therefore, covering every EV front. After adopting Tesla charging technology, or more precisely NACS chargers, GM provided its EV drivers with enhanced durability and reliability at across 25,000 stations across the U.S. instead of the current 13,000, making good on its promise.Story continuesThe US is in great need for intense EV programs, and with the initiatives of the Biden administration, they are finally underway, coinciding with a wider consumer mindset shift in favor of an all-electric transportation future.Renault’s Concern Due To China’s Recent Decision To Restrict Exports Of MetalsAsia has undoubtedly a superpower when it comes to essential raw materials that are used to build EV batteries. Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard expressed his concern as China decided at the beginning of July to restrict export metals, more precisely, gallium and germanium, that are used in both EVs and semiconductors. However, empowered by its alliance with Nissan Motor Co Ltd (OTC: NSANY), as well as Mitsubishi Motors Corporation (OTC: MMTOF), and supported by its electrification expertise, Renault Group upgraded its full year 2023 outlook as it continues aiming for carbon neutrality by the end of the decade. But the bigger picture does seem scary as the China-U.S. technology war continues to escalate, possibly resulting in massive disruptions across global supply chains and therefore, hampering EV progress.Worksport Transitions From Preparation Phase To Scaling Of ProductionWith production expected to start in the upcoming weeks, Worksport announced this week it has made significant progress in its operational developments as its skilled and diligently selected staff undergoes the final phase of training with validation processes kicking off with its new U.S. tonneau manufacturing line. Over the following few weeks, a pivotal moment of Worksport’s growth journey is on the horizon as its cutting-edge hard folding tonneau covers go into production. Its U.S. state of art facility is a testament of Worksport’s commitment to U.S. home-grown innovation, product quality and excellence. Worksport's innovative portfolio holds big promises for both automotive and the EV industry, with Hyundai Motor Company (OTC: HYMTF) being among the first to equip its Santa Cruz pickup with its customized Solis solar-powered tonneau cover. In other words, Worksport is setting the stage for a strategic leap in its business operations, marching on towards boosting revenue growth and increasing shareholder value along the way.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

175,b5f44ad2-c504-3c88-b75b-bcdb71823521,UAL,2023-07-15,Delta Lifts Guidance As Travel Boom Is Here To Stay,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/delta-lifts-guidance-travel-boom-161846674.html,1689351526,STORY,"['DAL', 'UAL']","[On Thursday, Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) posted a quarterly earnings surprise and lifted its full year profit outlook as travel remains among top priorities for consumers. Delta posed its highest ever quarterly earnings as its bottom line benefited from strong international travel demand and lower fuel costs. Meanwhile on Wednesday, its rival United Airlines (NASDAQ: UAL) unveiled its nearly once-in-a-decade refreshment of seats as airlines continue to fight for premium passengers.Delta’s Latest Figures Confirm That Travel Is Hot This Summer But Aviation Structure Remains FragileDelta CEO Ed Bastian stated that capacity constraints that U.S. carriers are having, in terms of aircraft, spare parts and labor issues, are disabling them from catching up with demand. Despite persistently high inflation that is weakening customers’ budgets, consumers are cutting spending elsewhere to be able to provide for experiences, helping to maintain the post-pandemic travel boom and possibly leading to a multi-year phenomenon.Airlines are still enjoying pricing power even though there are signs air fares have peaked.Delta's proxy for pricing power shows airlines remain in power as its total revenue per seat mile was up 1% YoY in the second quarter, with a 17% jump in capacity, and it is expected to remain strong. Bastian noted that fees have normalized after capacity constraints and strong demand drove them high with Delta’s pricing still holding up. According to the inflation read, fares went down almost 19% in the U.S. in June compared to 2022’s June and 8% from May.Quarterly HighlightsFor the quarter that ended on June 30th, Delta made $14.61 billion in adjusted revenue that excludes sales from its refinery, topping the expected $14.49 billion based on Refinitiv consensus estimates as it rose 19% YoY. Total revenue amounted to $15.58 billion, rising 13% YoY. Trans-Atlantic travel revenue went up more than 60% compared to last year, while domestic revenue rose 8% and overall passenger revenue expanded 8%.Story continuesNet income for the quarter amounted to $1.83 billion, being its highest since 2013’s fourth quarter $735 million, with the bottom line benefiting from 22% drop in its fuel costs. Adjusted earnings per share amounted to $2.68 cents, exceeding the expected $2.40 and rising from last year’s comparable quarter when they amounted to $1.44.Delta’s OutlookIn the undergoing, third, quarter, earnings are expected in the range between $2.20 to $2.50 a share, topping analyst expectations on a 16% increase in capacity. Revenue is expected to grow 14% YoY.  As for full year 2023, adjusted earnings forecast was lifted from prior $5 to $6 per share range to $6 to $7 a share, on the back of strong international demand remaining through the fall along with a steady increase in sluggish corporate travel bookings.United Unveils Its First-class Seats UpgradeOn Wednesday, United became the latest carrier to upgrade its cabin in attempt to lure in premium passengers by unveiling its first new seat in nearly a decade for passengers at the front of the plane.  The upgraded first-class seat will be installed on 200 domestic flight planes that were not refreshed since 2015. Delta already upgraded its first class seat with privacy barrier last year as well as did JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ: JBLU) to provide more comfort to premium customers with its redesigned Mint class whose seats have sliding doors.The new United Airlines first-class seat will make its debut this month at The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA)-made 737 plane.Travel Boom Isn't Going Anywhere Anytime SoonAs the airline industry continues to rebuild its empire after the Covid pandemic horror, Delta has set an upbeat tone as airlines make most of their money in the second and third quarters, defying fears of a sluggish economy hampering demand for travel. With Delta being the first who reported its second quarter results, United Airlines and American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL) will be following with their reports next week.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

We will also explore the current scenario of the job market in US with the context for teenager jobs and the companies that fully support teen employment with lucrative benefits. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to 10 Highest-Paying Summer Jobs for Teens.As reported by the Department of Labor in April 2023, with 9.8 million job openings and 5.7 million unemployed Americans, the labor scarcity has caused wages to rise, particularly for teenagers. In fact, teens have experienced a 7% increase in their median weekly summer pay between 2019 and 2022 and surpassed the other age groups.Interestingly, there has been also a shift in priorities among teenagers. In May, the percentage of US teens who were either employed or actively seeking employment stood at 36.8%, which is higher than the pre-pandemic low of 32.5% in 2014. However, it is still lower than the consistent 50% or more observed before 2001. Economists often attribute this decline to changes in priorities, such as a greater focus on education, unpaid internships, and participation in extracurricular activities.Teens Are Making a Comeback in SummersOne job area where these trends become particularly evident is at pools and beaches, where a shortage of lifeguards had resulted in limited job opportunities. For instance, the city of Seattle has been facing severe staffing shortages which led them to increase the starting wage for lifeguards to $21 per hour or higher. It's worth noting that different states have varied rates of teen employment during summer. In 2022, Nebraska had the highest teen employment rate of 65.9%, while Hawaii had the lowest, at 23.7%.In fact, according to Gusto, a payroll process for small businesses, teenagers is expected to account for nearly 1 in 5 summer hires this year. While many adults in the U.S. who were affected by the pandemic have returned to their jobs, teenagers have been quick to re-enter the job market, specifically for summer jobs. Experts attribute this trend to the attractively higher wages and a desire to break free from the routine of remote classes and other constraints they may have experienced due to Covid-19.Story continuesWhere Can Teens Work?Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) provides an exceptional opportunity for teen jobs with its inclusive policies and commitment to education.

(NASDAQ:ISRG) and were rewarded last week after stock increased 6.9%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-control-86-intuitive-120018915.html,1689422418.0,STORY,"['ISRG', 'TROW']","[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Intuitive Surgical's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsA total of 22 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownershipUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a companyEvery investor in Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 86% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And as as result, institutional investors reaped the most rewards after the company's stock price gained 6.9% last week. One-year return to shareholders is currently 68% and last week’s gain was the icing on the cake.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Intuitive Surgical, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Intuitive Surgical?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Intuitive Surgical. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Intuitive Surgical's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Intuitive Surgical. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.4% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.3% of common stock, and T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. holds about 5.8% of the company stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 22 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Intuitive SurgicalThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Intuitive Surgical, Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$600m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 13% stake in Intuitive Surgical. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

These estimates show corresponding increases of 5% and 29.7% year over year.Strategies in DetailUnder Armour’s focus on reinforcing brands, effective innovations and strict go-to-market processes appears encouraging. Additionally, the company strives to boost its operating model as well as return greater profitability and value to shareholders. The company’s long-term growth strategy is focused on improving sales through product innovation, building long-term relationships with key wholesale partners, investments in its own stores and digitization to directly reach customers, and selling more inventory at full price.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUAA is focusing on digitization by converting real-time data and analytics to drive brand interest and consideration within its largest categories of training and running. Under Armour also initiated a loyalty program in North America, UA Rewards, on a pilot basis. Restructuring initiatives, cost management, inventory balance and emphasis on productivity should position the company well for growth.To aid overall growth, management has announced three priorities to drive clarity and business alignment across the company.

It signifies increased attention and, depending on the rating given, often generates more trading volume and positive price action on a stock.On July 13, BMO Capital Markets analyst Ari Klein initiated coverage on three real estate investment trusts (REITs) that specialize in owning and operating the communications infrastructure that allows for the transmission of data across networks in the U.S. and other countries.Klein initiated coverage on American Tower Corp. (NYSE:AMT) with an Outperform rating and a price target of $230. He also initiated coverage on SBA Communications Corp. (NASDAQ:SBAC) with a Market Perform rating and a price target of $260. Finally, he initiated coverage on Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI) with an Underperform rating and a price target of $113.The data REITs have not performed as well as some other subsectors in 2023, but perhaps Klein senses that's about to change. All three specialty REITs will announce earnings soon and that could provide investors with an opportunity to add some ""fiber"" to their portfolios and boost their total performance.The market has a long history of overselling REITs when facing a potential recession, providing an incredible opportunity for investors to “lock in” massive yields. Gain access to insights from Benzinga’s real estate research team with the free Weekly REIT Report.American Tower Corp. is a Boston-based specialty REIT that calls itself ""a global leader in wireless infrastructure."" Founded in 1995, American Tower owns, operates and develops wireless and broadcast communications real estate. Most of its business is leasing space on wireless and broadcast towers, and it also leases portions of the land below the tower for equipment storage. Typical tower components are coaxial cabling and fiber optic cables.American Tower has a presence in 226,000 global communication sites in 25 countries on six continents. About 43,000 of those properties are in the U.S. and Canada, and approximately 180,000 are international properties. Contracts usually have a term of five to 10 years with renewal options and annual lease escalators of approximately 3%.Story continuesYear to date, American Tower's total return is negative 7.5%.On May 25, American Tower raised its quarterly dividend from $1.56 to $1.57 per share, the 18th time it has increased its dividend over the past five years. The annual dividend of $6.28 now yields 3.23%. American Tower will announce second-quarter earnings on July 27.On July 13, American Tower announced it will deploy a state-of-the-art distributed antenna system solution to bring 5G technology to the Xcel Energy Center, a sports arena in Minnesota that hosts the Minnesota Wild franchise of the National Hockey League.Crown Castle Inc. is a Houston-based specialized REIT that focuses on owning, operating and long-term leasing of cell towers. Crown Castle works with businesses and governments to design and build solutions that meet connectivity needs like wireless coverage and custom fiber optic networks. It has a market cap of $50.84 billion, making it one of the largest REITs in the U.S.Crown Castle was founded in 1994 with a portfolio of 133 cell towers. Less than 30 years later, Crown Castle has over 40,000 towers and 85,000 route miles of fiber and 120,000 ""small cells"" (base stations like 5G that are used to enhance cellular network coverage and capacity) in its portfolio. Seventy-five percent of its towers are in the 100 largest areas of the U.S.On June 6, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Daniel Schlanger told investors at the NAREIT conference that Crown Castle has two goals — first, to grow its dividends per share around 7% to 8% per year by offering its wireless carrier customers the lowest-cost solution to building out a network.Crown Castle's second goal is to grow its revenue on the 40,000 cell tower assets it owns. Cell tower leasing makes up about 70% of Crown Castle's revenue.Schlanger added that Crown Castle has a tremendous opportunity in its small-cell building part of the business, which he sees growing in large quantities over the next decade. Year to date, Crown Castle has a total return of negative 13.55%.On July 11, Goldman Sachs analyst Brett Feldman maintained a Neutral rating on Crown Castle but lowered his price target from $142 to $125.Crown Castle pays a quarterly dividend of $1.565 per share, and the annual dividend of $6.26 per share presently yields 5.37%.

But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.Our proprietary system currently recommends SBA Communications (SBAC) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this communications tower operator a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for SBA Communications is 12.7%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 3.7% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -0.4%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for SBA Communications is 14.8%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 10.6%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 8.2% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 4.7%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for SBA Communications. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.1% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made SBA Communications a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that SBA Communications is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $312.07 indicates a potential upside of 28%.The average comprises 15 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $260 to a high of $410, with a standard deviation of $37.17. While the lowest estimate indicates an increase of 6.6% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 68.1% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.But, for SBAC, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.Here's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Why SBAC Could Witness a Solid UpsideThere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current year, two estimates have moved higher over the last 30 days compared to no negative revision. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 0.1%.Moreover, SBAC currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much SBAC could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Disaster strikes. People, businesses and nonprofits respond.Immediate recovery is fueled in equal parts by adrenaline and goodwill.But what about later - when the news crews have left? What about when the initial recovery money is exhausted?This is a story about long-term support … long after the skies have cleared … but also long before the community could ever return to normal.To set the stage, Doing More Today spoke with Matthew Allen of Mayfield, Kentucky.If the town sounds familiar - there's a reason.""I was in the path of the tornado just an hour before it passed through, and I returned within a couple hours to check on family,"" said Allen. ""The very place I'd stood before was completely changed. The streets were pitch black with power lines and debris everywhere.""Dozens of families were at the beginning of a heart-breaking journey. People urgently looked for survivors. They were not always successful.James Potter wasn't far away. He remembers the sequence. First, the sirens. Then silence. Then the roar.""Earlier that night, I remember thinking, ‘This seems different, this isn't a normal storm,'"" recalled Potter. ""Later, I couldn't really fathom what I was seeing. I've seen this in the movies. We were in the eye of the storm.""While Potter was on the first floor of the house, his partner, Tanya Jackson, was huddled in the basement with a friend.""You could see the house shift,"" said Jackson. ""It was just horrific. I'd never been in a tornado.""But they survived. Other houses nearby were simply wiped away.""We were lucky,"" said Potter.To help people in Mayfield, the Regions Foundation, a nonprofit funded primarily by Regions Bank, immediately pledged $100,000 for tornado recovery.""When our Western Kentucky neighbors experienced the unimaginable, the Regions Foundation and our colleagues at Regions Bank immediately deployed financial resources and volunteer support to help,"" said Marta Self, executive director of the Regions Foundation. ""It was clear the widespread, catastrophic damage would require an extended focus. Nonprofits like the Mayfield Graves County Long-Term Recovery Group have been leading the way. We're incredibly proud to support the organization's commitment to rebuilding the area's homes and restoring the hope of so many people.""Story continuesMayfield looks a lot better today than 18 months ago - but it's still a world away from what it was.So, the final $15,000 of the Regions Foundation's funding is going toward the Mayfield Graves County Long-Term Recovery Group (MLTRG). In addition to the Foundation's support, local Regions Bank associates are lending their own assistance - because they're invested in seeing Mayfield made whole.Remember Matthew Allen? He works for Regions Bank's Consumer Banking team. And his commitment to Mayfield runs deep.""When I had the chance to come back to Mayfield as the branch manager last May, I knew I wanted to get involved in a meaningful way to help our community with the recovery and rebuilding,"" he said. ""After hearing about the collaboration that was happening to help our survivors - and the need for volunteers - I decided to make myself available in any way I could.""That includes being part of MLTRG's Unmet Needs Committee. Help is still available. People are not forgotten.Of course, the most immediate need for people like James Potter and Tanya Jackson was shelter.""I was at a loss; I had no clue where to go or what to do,"" said Potter after living in a temporary trailer and motel for several months following the storm. ""The only sane thing was going to work to not think about it.""Then, Potter and Jackson met Shanna Bradley, a case manager with Catholic Charities in Graves County, who works with MLTRG, too.""Once we met Shanna, things just seemed to fall into place,"" said Potter. ""She led us in the right direction and helped us complete applications. She helped us with food. She's got a good heart and goes out of her way for people.""With Bradley's help, Potter and Jackson first moved to a camper in June of 2022 and then into a formerly vacant home remodeled by volunteers. Matthew Allen and several of his Regions Bank teammates were part of the ""New Lease on Life"" renovation project.Jackson said moving in was a full-circle moment. Turns out, she'd lived in the exact same house years before meeting Potter - and even raised her son there.""I can still remember seeing the swing set in the backyard,"" she said. ""It's coming home, but better this time. This is about the nicest place I've ever lived.""Potter is equally thankful.""I'm just grateful for everything that's happened … for a roof over my head, for food in my belly,"" he said. ""Now, I have a peace of mind. We're blessed.""It may not make headlines anymore. But the story is just as powerful.Because support for survivors didn't fade away after the skies cleared.""The experience has taught me to have a little more faith in people,"" Potter concluded. ""There are good people out there still.""See how another Mayfield family has created their new sense of home thanks to Regions Bank.About Regions Foundation The Alabama-based Regions Foundation supports community investments that positively impact communities served by Regions Bank.

192,2dc36615-cb4b-3c35-8ce2-bb498b9641c8,RF,2023-07-15,Regions Financial (RF) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regions-financial-rf-earnings-expected-140010356.html,1689343210,STORY,"['RF', 'CSTR']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Regions Financial (RF) reports results for the quarter ended June 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 21, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis holding company for Regions Bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.60 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +1.7%.Revenues are expected to be $1.94 billion, up 10.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.3% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Regions Financial?For Regions Financial, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.65%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Regions Financial will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Regions Financial would post earnings of $0.65 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.62, delivering a surprise of -4.62%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Regions Financial doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Banks - Southeast industry, Capstar Financial (CSTR) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.34 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -24.4%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $30.15 million, down 0.6% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Capstar Financial has been revised 1.7% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.88%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Capstar Financial will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of the global tourism industry, the recent revival of the tourism industry, role of the entertainment industry in reviving the T&amp;T sector, the largest travel company in the world, and the need for sustainable tourism, and go directly to 10 Most Magical Places in the World.People have always had a need to travel, be it to discover and explore new lands, seek spiritual enlightenment, or merely for personal enjoyment. Although the first tourism agencies appeared in the 19th century, with Thomas Cook &amp; Son being one of the industry pioneers, the sector witnessed rapid evolution with the dawn of the 1900’s, thanks to the mass production of buses and cars. Also, improvements in air transport, as well as progress in labor legislation and a growth in social welfare led to a boom in tourism globally.  The Global Tourism Industry:Tourism has evolved into a massive industry with time, encompassing several other industries, such as hospitality, transport, entertainment etc. In 1950, at the dawn of the jet age, just 25 million people took foreign trips. By 2019, that number had reached 1.5 billion. As we mentioned in our article – World Tourism Ranking by Country: Top 20 Countries – the global Travel &amp; Tourism (T&amp;T) industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.1% between 2021 and 2026, to be worth an estimated $8.9 trillion by the end of the forecast period. Revival of the Tourism Industry: The T&amp;T industry was among the hardest hit by the pandemic, as people could no longer move around and the world came to an abrupt halt. Estimates from the United Nations World Tourism Organization show that international travel shrank by 72% in 2020, leading to 1.1 billion fewer trips taken and setting the industry back massively. However, 2022 witnessed a reversal in this trend as international borders began opening up, coupled with the disposable income people saved up during the lockdown and their increasing longing to travel around. According to the WTO, more than 900 million tourists traveled internationally in 2022 - double the number recorded in 2021. Story continuesThe World Tourism and Travel Council has reported that the T&amp;T sector contributed 7.6% to the global GDP in 2022, an increase of 22% from 2021 and only 23% below 2019 levels. Role of the Entertainment Industry in Reviving the T&amp;T Sector: The entertainment industry is another sector having a significant impact on the revival of the travel and hospitality industries. The American government agencies have officially credited the ongoing Eras Tour by the uber-popular American singer Taylor Swift with boosting the American economy. According to the Philadelphia Federal Reserve, hotel bookings have risen dramatically, showing the strongest growth since the beginning of the pandemic, thanks to Swift’s show dates. Earlier this month, Cincinnati officials also credited Swift and Eras tour with helping downtown hotels gross more than $2.6 million, and surrounding Hamilton County hotels gross more than $5.3 million in revenue. Largest Travel Company in the World: With a market cap of about $105.9 billion, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) holds the title of being the largest travel company in the world. Operating in over 220 countries and 40 different languages, there are more than 28 million global listings available between hotels, homes and apartments under the Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) travel sites. The company also strongly felt the shocks of the pandemic when its revenue fell by almost 55%, from $15.06 billion in 2019, to $6.8 billion in 2020. However, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) boasted a revenue of $17.09 billion in 2022 after the revival of international tourism, even higher than its pre-pandemic levels, and stocks of the company have sailed 34% higher during the first half of the current year. Booking.com has also recently started conversational trip planning with ChatGPT. Need for Sustainable Tourism: Although the tourism industry comes as a boon for many and supports millions of businesses and jobs worldwide, it often doesn’t come without a price. An example of this is the listing and rental of local homes on the online platform of Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB). In many cities in Europe, the increasing listing of local homes for short-term rental on Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) has created a shortage of available residences for the cities’ locals, leading to insufficient housing and a massive increase in rents. In downtown Barcelona, some residents have even complained of their rents straight up getting doubled after the easing down of travel restrictions. In June, the city of Florence announced an outright immediate ban on new short-term private location rentals in the Renaissance city’s historic center, part of an effort to draw full-time residents back to one of Italy’s most popular tourist destinations. With that said, let’s take a look at some of the Most Magical Places on Earth. 30 Most Magical Places in the Worldmuratart/Shutterstock.comMethodology:Our world has been blessed with a myriad of enchanting and wonderful places and it is tough to rank one above the other.

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.1%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.33%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 5.8%.Heading into today, shares of the hotel company had gained 8.38% over the past month, outpacing the Consumer Discretionary sector's gain of 0.66% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 3.39% in that time.Marriott International will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be August 1, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Marriott International to post earnings of $2.18 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 21.11%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $6.05 billion, up 13.29% from the year-ago period.MAR's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $8.41 per share and revenue of $23.49 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +25.71% and +13.07%, respectively.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Marriott International. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends.

198,3812e4ec-638a-3476-9c76-da343ccd73e4,MAR,2023-07-15,5 Top Stocks to Tap the Steady Fall in Inflation Rate,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-top-stocks-tap-steady-121700386.html,1689337020,STORY,"['META', 'PANW', 'DKNG', 'MAR', 'NVDA']","[The Fed’s decision to pursue stringent monetary policies and rigorous hike in the benchmark interest rate has started paying off. Inflation has declined steadily in the past year. The latest inflation data of June — the consumer price index (CPI) and the producer price index (PPI) — have reaffirmed this trend.On Jul 12, the Department of Labor reported that CPI increased 0.2% month-over-month in June compared with the consensus estimate of 0.3%. CPI rose 0.1% month over month in May. Year over year, CPI rose 3% in June, lower-than-the consensus estimate of 3.1%. This marked the lowest annual reading of CPI since April 2021.Notably, the headline CPI reached a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022. Thereafter, it has shown a sharp fall. Core CPI (excluding volatile food and energy items) also rose 0.2% month over month in June, below the consensus estimate of 0.3%. In May, core CPI was up 0.4% month over month.Year over year, core CPI climbed 4.8% in June, lower-than-the consensus estimate of 5%. This marked the lowest year-over-year increase in core CPI since October 2021. However, the data remained elevated to the Fed’s target rate of 2%.On Jul 13, the Department of Labor reported that PPI increased 0.1% month-over-month in June compared with the consensus estimate of 0.2%. Core PPI decreased 0.2% month over month in June in contrast to the consensus mark of a rise of 0.1%. In May, core PPI increased 0.1%.A steady decline in the inflation rate may compel the central bank to move toward the end of the current rate hike cycle. Notably, the Fed paused the interest rate hike in the June FOMC meeting after 10 consecutive increases.Top PicksA lower interest rate is expected to benefit growth-oriented sectors like technology, communication services and consumer discretionary.

NWSA, World Wrestling Entertainment WWE, Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF.A) and IMAX Corp. IMAX.Industry: EntertainmentLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2120503/4-stocks-to-watch-from-a-prospering-entertainment-industryThe Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry is benefiting from a spike in demand for digital entertainment, fueled by limited capacity and operational limitations in movie theaters, theme parks and cruise lines. Increased consumption of media, music and news over the web, triggered by the work-and-learn-at-home wave, has been a key catalyst for industry participants like News Corp., World Wrestling Entertainment, Lions Gate Entertainment and IMAX Corp.Companies have been focusing on a superior product strategy and prudent capital investments. Steady recovery in the advertising spending environment and resumption of production pipelines bode well for film and television production companies.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry comprises companies involved in film and TV production, distribution and exhibition. The main activities of the industry participants include the production and distribution of entertainment content to theaters, TV networks, video-on-demand platforms, streaming services and other exhibitors. Imax offers entertainment technology and specializes in motion picture technologies and presentations.Industry participants produce and distribute motion pictures for theatrical and straight-to-video releases besides TV programming. These players are heavily dependent on the box-office performance of their films, both domestically and internationally, the number of film releases, and the ratings of TV shows.3 Film and Television Production Industry Trends in FocusOver-the-Top Services Gaining Prominence: Companies involved in content creation are looking to distribute content through over-the-top services to leverage the popularity of their franchises. With this, they are looking to provide exclusive content and a differentiated experience. However, streaming companies are increasingly producing original and award-winning feeds to reduce licensing costs and excessive dependence on third-party content providers. This is likely to hurt industry participants' content distribution strategy.Story continuesBinge-Watching Driving Consumption: Factors such as binge-watching, deepening Internet penetration, and advancement in mobile, video, and wireless technologies have got viewers glued to small screens. In order to keep pace with new consumption patterns, industry participants are turning to digital content distribution. The emergence of digital capabilities is making consumer data easily available to companies.With the use of AI tools, production houses are gaining a better understanding of user preferences. This helps them produce content that strikes a chord with viewers. However, increasing spending on content and sales &amp; marketing is hurting profitability due to stiff competition from streaming players.Technological Advancement Aids Prospects: Exhibitors are turning to highly efficient and cost-effective technologies like laser-based projection systems to enhance image quality and the entire movie experience. Additionally, the use of technologies like motion seating, immersive audio systems and interactive movies among others is expected to enhance the viewing experience.The increasing adoption of AR and VR technologies bodes well for industry participants. However, the evolution of alternative motion picture distribution channels such as home video, pay-per-view, streaming services, video-on-demand, Internet and syndicated and broadcast television is hurting exhibitors.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Film and Television Production and Distribution industry is housed within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector.

Those networks are now owned by several national carriers including AT&amp;T, Verizon Communications Inc. and Lumen Technologies Inc.AT&amp;T shares fell 4.1% to $14.50 at the close in New York, their lowest price since February 1994. Verizon declined 1.8% and Lumen dropped 10%.Industry analysts have been trying to calculate the potential costs and risks that may await the carriers.With a service area that covers about 40% of US homes plus an extensive long distance network, “AT&amp;T will have the largest exposure,” JPMorgan analyst Phil Cusick wrote in a note Friday. Citing the uncertainty around the outcome, Cusick cut his AT&amp;T target price to $17 from $22.The lead concerns add to an already challenging year for the largest US phone company. In April, AT&amp;T reported $1 billion in free cash flow, missing analysts’ $3 billion target and setting off alarms for the second year in a row about dividend payments. Last month, the company warned that wireless subscriber growth was less than anticipated. The company also clumsily obscured a massive restructuring and job reduction effort behind a new return-to-work policy.AT&amp;T declined to comment. The company has referred questions about the lead situation to USTelecom, an industry group, which has created a website featuring several statements including a claim disputing the charge that phone cables are a leading cause of lead exposure. The group, which represents most US phone companies, says it’s “ready to engage constructively on the issue.”Story continues(Updates with closing price in the third paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekNo Testing, No Inspections: Contaminated Eyedrops Blinded and Killed AmericansWeightWatchers Is Gambling Everything on Obesity DrugsThis Supposed Mafia Manifesto Doesn’t Stand Up to a Google SearchWhat If the Next Big Social Media App Is ...

We were advised to hit the restrooms before the descent, lest our innards succumb to the g-forces.We made it down safely (and unsoiled), but the experience offered an apt metaphor for the state of the tech industry right now—a dizzying spectacle of speed, risk, and folly. The U.S. government's effort to temporarily stop Microsoft's $69 billion Activision acquisition from closing was rejected and then appealed in a matter of days, Meta's Twitter-rival Threads racked up 100 million users in five days, and Mark Zuckerberg posted a topless photo of himself while Elon Musk tweeted something about measurements.The testosterone-fueled antics of the two feuding billionaire tech bros did not go unnoticed at Brainstorm. ""Can you imagine the reaction if two women executives behaved this way in public?"" said a female startup founder I spoke to.The sad reality is that there aren't enough women tech CEOs to draw good comparisons. But a decade ago there was Carol Bartz, the Yahoo CEO whose habit of dropping the occasional public f-bomb reportedly drew admonitions from her fellow boardmembers. Bartz, who was hired to turn around the faltering internet pioneer, was famously fired over the phone by Yahoo's chairman in 2011 with more than a year left on her contract.Marissa Mayer, another former Yahoo CEO, was at Brainstorm Tech this week to discuss the future of the tech business. Back when Mayer was the Yahoo CEO she also caused a public outcry—not because of a Musk-style public display of crassness, but because of the length of the maternity leave that she took (less than one month).I didn't get a chance to ask Mayer her thoughts about the Musk-Zuck shenanigans, but I enjoyed listening to her panel on A.I. and learning more about her startup Sunshine, which has raised $22 million in funding since it was founded five years ago.Story continuesMayer spoke a few hours after Adam Neumann, the ousted WeWork founder known for walking around barefoot and hosting company meetings with tequila shots. Neumann reflected on his past, noting that one of the key lessons he has learned is to surround himself with people who will tell him the hard truths.Like Mayer, Neumann has a new startup. It's called Flow, and according to Neumann, it might compete directly with WeWork when his noncompete expires in October.

In sub-Saharan Africa, the gaming market is poised to generate over $1 billion in revenue for the first time in 2024. “These initial numbers for gaming on the continent are promising, but the longer-term trends of population growth, internet penetration, and smartphone adoption paint a picture of incredible growth for gaming on the continent."" - Jackson Vaughan, managing partner at KonvoyThe gaming industry in the United States is also experiencing robust growth. Based on insights from Insider Intelligence, more than half (54.2%) of the US population actively participated in digital gaming in 2022. Notably, mobile gaming emerged as the dominant segment, with 48.3% of the population (equivalent to approximately 162.9 million individuals) engaging in gaming activities on their smartphones. These statistics underscore the widespread popularity and significant impact of mobile gaming, positioning it as a leading force within the thriving US gaming landscape.Furthermore, nearly one in four (24%) video game developers foresee substantial growth in the mobile gaming sector by 2025. This will surpass their projections for console games (10%) and the metaverse (18%). These predictions highlight the significant potential and increasing popularity of mobile gaming as a dominant force in the gaming industry.When it comes to game development, questions like what is the most useful language for game development, whether or not Python is good for game development, and is C++ or C# better for game development arise. C/C++ remains highly valued by top game companies such as Valve, Riot, Blizzard, and Nintendo, according to job postings. The dominance of C/C++ in the game development landscape reflects its versatility and performance benefits, making it a solid choice for aspiring game developers.However, it's essential to explore other user-friendly programming languages tailored for game development. Python, known for its simplicity and readability, has gained popularity for rapid prototyping and is widely used in various applications, including game development. JavaScript, with its extensive libraries and frameworks, particularly shines in browser-based games, while Lua offers ease of use and scripting capabilities for modifying game behavior.For developers seeking a language specifically designed for game development, GDScript, tailored for the Godot game engine, offers a user-friendly and intuitive experience. Its simplicity, Python-like syntax, and built-in functionalities streamline the development process, This makes it accessible for developers of all skill levels.So, let's explore the 10 most user-friendly programming languages for developing games. 10 Most User-friendly Programming Languages for Developing Gamessabrisy/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology: For our list, we conducted extensive research on platforms like Reddit and Quora. We considered factors such as ease of learning, simplicity of syntax, available resources and libraries, community support, documentation, and development tools. Finally, we compiled a list of the 10 most user-friendly programming languages for game development, ranking them on a scale of 1 (least) to 5 (most). We gave higher weight to ease of learning and community support. The list is ordered in ascending order based on the scores.Here is the list of the 10 most user-friendly programming languages for game development. 10. C++Overall Score: 3.5C++ is recognized as one of the most prevalent programming languages, albeit with a steep learning curve. But, you might have questions like, why is C++ used for games? It's mainly because of the benefits it offers. C++ allows for direct control over hardware and graphical processes — crucial aspects of video game design.As an object-oriented language, C++ utilizes internal structures to enhance code organization, making it easier to create reusable blocks in the form of classes and objects.C++ stands out as the optimal choice for game development, to the extent that certain engines like Unreal exclusively support C++ code. If you have to select just one programming language to learn for game development, C++ is the ideal option. Moreover, since many other object-oriented languages derive from C++, acquiring proficiency in them becomes significantly easier once you grasp C++ projects.9. C#Overall Score: 3.6C# is a modern, object-oriented programming language known for its seamless integration with Visual Studio and compatibility with the popular Unity Engine. It offers a wide range of libraries and tools through the .NET framework. This makes it a preferred choice for game development.C# is simple, readable, and easy to use. This allows developers to focus on creating high-quality games without being burdened by intricate technical complexities. Its static typing ensures strong type safety, minimizing the risk of runtime errors, which is advantageous for game development compared to dynamically-typed languages.Moreover, C# is highly efficient, particularly when utilized alongside the .NET framework. It supports multithreading and parallel programming, enabling developers to write concurrent code that optimizes hardware resources, an essential feature for game development. However, it is worth noting that C# for game development is heavily dependent on the Unity Engine.8. Lua Overall Score: 3.8Lua, although not as popular as other game development languages, is included on our list of most user-friendly programming languages for game development due to its ease of use. While Lua may have less community support, it offers speed, efficiency, and flexibility, making it suitable for scripting game logic, and creating mods, and extensions.One of Lua's standout features is its ability to modify game behavior without the need for recompiling game code. This allows developers to make quick changes and adjustments. Additionally, Lua gained recognition for its role as the foundational language for the immensely popular game Roblox, where it enables users to create their own games and experiences, as well as customized gameplay. Despite its lower profile, Lua remains an accessible and powerful option for game developers seeking simplicity and versatility.7. RubyOverall Score: 3.9Ruby is a dynamic, interpreted programming language. This programming language is known for its simplicity and readability. While not commonly used for game development compared to other languages, Ruby offers several user-friendly features. Its elegant syntax and focus on developer happiness make it accessible for beginners.Ruby's vast collection of open-source libraries, such as Gosu and Rubygame, provide game development frameworks and tools. Additionally, Ruby's flexibility enables rapid prototyping and iterative development. This way, developers can experiment and iterate quickly. Although not as widely adopted in the game development industry, Ruby's user-friendly nature and community support make it an option worth considering for certain games.It is one of the best programming languages since it places a strong emphasis on reducing confusion and offering simple error correction.6. JavaScriptOverall Score: 4JavaScript, a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for web development, has gained popularity in game development due to its ease of use and versatility. While often associated with web-based games, JavaScript is ideal for browser-based games. Its straightforward syntax and abundance of libraries and frameworks make it accessible and convenient for developers. However, being an interpreted language can impact performance. Nonetheless, JavaScript's non-blocking, event-driven nature allows for writing asynchronous code, vital for responsive games.

Its expressive nature fosters code intuitiveness and readability for developers.Javscript is also one of the easiest programming languages for kids to learn. For kids, JavaScript has some special benefits. Around the age of twelve, aspiring young programmers can begin learning JavaScript. Kids can use JavaScript to include interactive features and dynamic aspects in their projects, games, and webpages.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Most User-friendly Programming Languages for Developing Games.Suggested Articles:15 Best Coding Games to Learn Programming for Beginners12 Easiest Programming Languages for KidsTop 10 Programming Languages for AI and Natural Language Processing Disclosure: None. 10 Most User-friendly Programming Languages for Developing Games is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
210,b0313ca6-82ff-3ecc-aed4-1fce2fe32a96,NVDA,2023-07-15,Investors brace for earnings from ‘Magnificent Seven’ US growth giants,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-brace-earnings-magnificent-seven-211410065.html,1689369250,STORY,"['NVDA', 'MSFT', 'META', 'AAPL', 'AMZN', 'GOOGL', '^GSPC']","[By Lewis KrauskopfNEW YORK (Reuters) - A handful of massive growth and technology names that have dominated the U.S. stock market in 2023 are set to report earnings in coming weeks, potentially determining the path for this year’s equity rally.Lately dubbed the “Magnificent Seven” by investors, shares of the U.S. companies with the biggest market values soared between 40% and over 200% so far this year. Those moves have accounted for a lion's share of the S&amp;P 500's 17% year-to-date rise and propelled the index to its highest level since April 2022.The outsized gains have come with big earnings expectations for the seven companies: Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta Platforms. BofA Global Research projects they will increase earnings by an average of 19% over the next 12 months, more than double the an 8% estimated rise for the rest of the S&amp;P 500.They will need strong results to justify premium valuations. Those companies trade at an overall trailing price-to-earnings ratio of about 40 times, versus 15 times for the S&amp;P 500 excluding those companies, according to BofA.Their results may be crucial to the market as a whole. Fueled by their recent gains, megacap stocks have climbed to dominate benchmark indexes, causing headaches for some managers of active funds. In the S&amp;P 500, the seven stocks comprise 27.9% of the index's weight.Investors will look beyond second quarter results, said Bill Callahan, an investment strategist at Schroders.“It’s also how do these big companies, which are carrying the market ... guide for the rest of the year and into 2024,” he said.Overall, the seven companies account for 14.3% of overall S&amp;P 500 estimated earnings for the second quarter, and 9.3% of estimated revenue, according to Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at Refinitiv.Among the reports in the previous quarter, Nvidia was one of the standouts. The semiconductor company's revenue forecast blew past estimates as it said it was boosting supply to meet surging demand for its artificial-intelligence chips, further fanning the market's excitement over AI. Nvidia shares are up well over 200% this yearStory continuesTesla is the first of the growth giants to report, with earnings expected on Wednesday. The Elon Musk-led company this month said it delivered a record number of vehicles in the second quarter.Microsoft and Meta are among the companies due to report the following week, and investors are expected to focus on how companies are seeking to harness AI.While AI benefits may not immediately materialize for every company, investors are eager to learn ""more about how they are going to convert that into money, essentially,"" said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments.""It’s going to take some time for that to work its way through and to show up,"" said Martin, who is overweight some of the megacap stocks. ""Along the way, people are going to want to see some sort of progress.""There are signs market gains are broadening beyond the megacaps. The equal-weight S&amp;P 500, a proxy for the average stock, is modestly beating the S&amp;P 500 over the past month -- up 3.6% versus about 3% for its counterpart. The equal-weight version trailed badly for most of 2023. Strong U.S. data have driven confidence the economy can avoid a long-feared recession. A so-called ""soft-landing"" could lift cyclical stocks such as industrials and small-caps that are trading at cheaper valuations. But many investors say the corporate giants are nevertheless here to stay as critical holdings. Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment officer at BMO Wealth Management said that while “there is a lot priced in” to megacaps’ valuations, that did not mean they are overvalued.""If you think about the megacaps broadly ... they have gone from a core holding of a portfolio to an almost absolute necessary major component of the portfolio once you factor in trends such as AI,"" he said.(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and David Gregorio)]"

JPMorgan and Wells Fargo were the first of the bank stocks to report their earnings, both boasting beats this morning. Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Jared Blikre checks out stock action surrounding bank stocks, semiconductor manufacturers, and health care company UnitedHealth after the closing bell.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: All right, taking a look at some of the individual movers, it certainly was a big day for banks. JP Morgan, Citi, Wells Fargo kicking off earnings season with a beat in earnings here for the second quarter. However, there were some things to be a little bit concerned about within these reports and digging into what Citigroup saw profits fall amid slower corporate spending. Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre here to weigh in. And as you can see, JP Morgan one of the only big banks here holding onto gains today.JARED BLIKRE: The fortress balance sheet. What can you say about that that hasn't been said before? They tend to win, and the First Republic acquisition looks like it's working in their favor. You can see they're one of the few if not the only one up today, up 64 basis points.Wells Fargo, now they started out the day in the green. They were up 2 or 3 percentage points, have sunk into the red over the last few years. The really big year for banks was 2021, and they've just been kind of flagging ever since.Here's Citigroup intraday down 4%, but I just want to show you a chart, Seana, to argue against zombie banks, because guess what, this was before the global financial crisis, the great financial crisis, and this is after. Basically, 12 years of doing nothing there, so that is the downside.SEANA SMITH: Certainly the downside. All right, Jared, let's also talk about some of the chip makers. Truist was out with a note, raising their price targets for NVIDIA and Broadcom. Now, the company's citing that the two chip makers have, quote, ""meaningful upsides right now amid high demand"". Certainly, obviously--Story continuesJARED BLIKRE: Meaningful?SEANA SMITH: NVIDIA by far the-- yeah, what are we looking-- we're looking at losses today.JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, well, I mean, we're looking at some losses today, but that chart is from the lower left to the upper right here, so if they're still seeing meaningful upside here, hey, I hope-- I want to be part of that. Let's not forget, a lot of this huge rally that we've seen here in this market concentration has been on the backs of some of this AI. Not on some of it, a lot of it on the AI hype, so that does need to continue. But up 200% for the year. That is just incredible.Take a look at Broadcom here, who they're also commenting about. Up about 60% year to date. The stock is just flagging in the upper end of its range. Well, that's a very bullish chart right there. We'll have to see what happens, but this consolidation that we're seeing here, that's healthy.SEANA SMITH: All right, Jared, well, another name that's on the move today, UnitedHealth Group rallying in today's trading session after beating second quarter expectations. The company also raising the low end of its profit outlook for 2023. Obviously, that's adding to some of the boost that we did see today, and it's helping some of its competitors as well.JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. We can see kind of a mixed board here. I would say, overall, healthcare has not been one of the best performers this year. It has not been about defense. They did tend to do well last year, especially in the back half, and you just take a look at the year to date performance, you're going to see kind of a bifurcation. You're going to see some winners here, but for the most part, a lot of them are losers.We know healthcare is a very difficult business to be in. One of the items that caught my mind with respect to United was they were-- a bunch of the states are getting together and finally clamping down on Medicaid and kicking out people who committed fraud or were not eligible over the pandemic. It does not seem to be having an appreciable effect just so far, but I think that's an interesting data point that could be important going forward.SEANA SMITH: All right, Jared Blikre, thanks so much for breaking that down.]"

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like McKesson (NYSE:MCK), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide McKesson with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for McKesson McKesson's Improving ProfitsInvestors and investment funds chase profits, and that means share prices tend rise with positive earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So a growing EPS generally brings attention to a company in the eyes of prospective investors. Commendations have to be given in seeing that McKesson grew its EPS from US$7.35 to US$26.29, in one short year. When you see earnings grow that quickly, it often means good things ahead for the company.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. McKesson maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 4.8% to US$277b. That's progress.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of McKesson's forecast profits?Story continuesAre McKesson Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of McKesson, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Holding US$64m worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. That's certainly enough to let shareholders know that management will be very focussed on long term growth.Does McKesson Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?McKesson's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. This level of EPS growth does wonders for attracting investment, and the large insider investment in the company is just the cherry on top. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching McKesson very closely. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 1 warning sign for McKesson that you need to be mindful of.Although McKesson certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

During this period, the company sold 1 million ounces of gold and 101 million pounds of copper. Additionally, it produced 1.01 million ounces of gold and 107 million pounds of copper. Barrick expects its gold and copper production to continue to increase throughout 2023, with higher production anticipated in the second half of the year. The company remains confident about achieving its full-year guidance for gold and copper.In the second quarter, the average market price for gold was $1,976 per ounce, while copper averaged $3.84 per pound. However, Barrick's realized copper price for the quarter is expected to be 3% to 5% lower than the average market price. This decline is primarily due to provisional pricing adjustments that reflect the decrease in copper prices during the second quarter.Preliminary gold production in the second quarter exceeded that of the first quarter. This increase was mainly driven by higher production at the Carlin mine, where normal throughput levels were restored after significant maintenance work conducted in the first four months of the year. Additionally, higher grades at the Kibali and Veladero mines contributed to the overall increase. However, production was lower at the Cortez mine due to mine sequencing, at the Turquoise Ridge mine due to planned autoclave maintenance and at the Pueblo Viejo mine due to tie-in work and commissioning of the plant expansion project.Compared to the first quarter, the second-quarter gold cost of sales per ounce is expected to be 3% to 5% lower, total cash costs per ounce are expected to be 1% to 3% lower, and all-in sustaining costs per ounce are anticipated to be up to 2% lower.In terms of copper production, the second quarter exceeded the production in the first quarter, primarily driven by the Lumwana mine. Compared to the first quarter, the second quarter copper cost of sales per pound is expected to be 11-13% lower, C1 cash costs per pound are expected to be 15-17% lower, and all-in sustaining costs per pound are anticipated to be 7-9% lower.Story continuesBarrick stock has gained 11.6% in the past year compared with the industry’s rise of 28.2% in the same period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksBarrick currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the basic materials space include ATI Inc.

(NYSE:CMI) has announced that it will be increasing its periodic dividend on the 7th of September to $1.68, which will be 7.0% higher than last year's comparable payment amount of $1.57. This makes the dividend yield 2.5%, which is above the industry average. Check out our latest analysis for Cummins Cummins' Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. However, Cummins' earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 17.3%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 34% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendCummins Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $2.00 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $6.28. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 12% per annum over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Cummins has impressed us by growing EPS at 26% per year over the past five years. Earnings per share is growing at a solid clip, and the payout ratio is low which we think is an ideal combination in a dividend stock as the company can quite easily raise the dividend in the future.We Really Like Cummins' DividendOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Cummins is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesIt's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

(Photo: Bosch)Germany-based automotive supplier Robert Bosch expects to post $5.3 billion in sales by the end of the decade from hydrogen fuel cells, hydrogen internal combustion engines and electrolyzers that make hydrogen.It is the latest proclamation that hydrogen is emerging as a meaningful alternative to battery-electric vehicles, which lead the transition to zero tailpipe emissions by at least a couple of years, according to industry leaders.Bosch became the second industry player this week to add hydrogen as a fuel for internal combustion engines, following Daimler Truck and engine maker Cummins, which is investing $452 million in a plant in Jamestown, New York, to make fuel-agnostic variants of its X15 engine. Bosch is investing $2.6 billion in hydrogen between 2021 and 2026.Growing adoption of hydrogen ICEBosch is developing systems for port and direct injection of hydrogen. Hydrogen ICEs are particularly suitable for heavy vehicles on long hauls with especially heavy loads.“A hydrogen engine can do everything a diesel engine does, but on top of that, it is carbon neutral,” Markus Heyn, member of the Bosch board of management and chairman of Bosch Mobility, said in a news release from Bosch Tech Day 2023 in Stuttgart. “It also allows a fast and cost-effective entry into hydrogen-based mobility.”Interest in hydrogen ICE powertrains grew following a recent European Commission decision declaring them as zero emission despite a small amount of carbon dioxide created through the burning of hydrogen as a fuel.A major advantage of hydrogen engines is that more than 90% of the development and manufacturing technologies needed already exist. Bosch expects to start production in 2024, three years sooner than Cummins. It has four orders for production projects from major economic regions and expects six-figure unit volumes by 2030.Bosch adding to fuel-cell effortsBosch is leveraging several German locations and one in Anderson, South Carolina, to advance work in hydrogen fuel cells.Story continuesThe Bosch plant in Bamberg, Germany, will supply the Feuerbach factory with the fuel-cell stack. The electric air compressor and recirculation blower come from the Bosch plant in Homburg, Germany.An early customer is Nikola Corp., which begins production of a fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) — the Class 8 Tre — in the third quarter from a plant in Coolidge, Arizona. Nikola has a license to assemble the modules at its plant.“Bosch is one of the very few companies that are capable of mass producing technology as complex as fuel-cell stacks,” Heyn said. “We don’t just have the required systems expertise but also the capability of quickly scaling up new developments to mass production.”Making the equipment that makes hydrogenLike battery-powered engines, an abundance of fuel cells means little without the infrastructure. Bosch joins Cummins and a host of other suppliers in making electrolyzers with proton exchange membranes. They effectively the reverse of the energy conversion method used in mobile fuel cells.The company intends to make 1.25-megawatt prototypes for pilot applications this year. Volume production is on track for 2025.Bosch also is working on solid-oxide fuel cells that can be used for the distributed supply of power and heat. In a pilot project at a hospital near Cologne, Germany, Bosch seeks to achieve overall efficiency of 90%. The micropower plant initially will run on natural gas. It can be converted to green hydrogen made from renewables.“Bosch knows its way around hydrogen and Bosch is growing with hydrogen,” Bosch Chairman Stefan Hartung said at the Bosch Tech Day.Related articles:Bosch investing $200M to make hydrogen fuel cells for Class 8 trucksNikola licenses Bosch fuel cells for module assembly in ArizonaBosch will supply key components to Daimler-Volvo fuel cell joint ventureClick for more FreightWaves articles by Alan Adler.The post Robert Bosch going all-in on hydrogen technologies appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of the global tourism industry, the recent revival of the tourism industry, role of the entertainment industry in reviving the T&amp;T sector, the largest travel company in the world, and the need for sustainable tourism, and go directly to 10 Most Magical Places in the World.People have always had a need to travel, be it to discover and explore new lands, seek spiritual enlightenment, or merely for personal enjoyment. Although the first tourism agencies appeared in the 19th century, with Thomas Cook &amp; Son being one of the industry pioneers, the sector witnessed rapid evolution with the dawn of the 1900’s, thanks to the mass production of buses and cars. Also, improvements in air transport, as well as progress in labor legislation and a growth in social welfare led to a boom in tourism globally.  The Global Tourism Industry:Tourism has evolved into a massive industry with time, encompassing several other industries, such as hospitality, transport, entertainment etc. In 1950, at the dawn of the jet age, just 25 million people took foreign trips. By 2019, that number had reached 1.5 billion. As we mentioned in our article – World Tourism Ranking by Country: Top 20 Countries – the global Travel &amp; Tourism (T&amp;T) industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.1% between 2021 and 2026, to be worth an estimated $8.9 trillion by the end of the forecast period. Revival of the Tourism Industry: The T&amp;T industry was among the hardest hit by the pandemic, as people could no longer move around and the world came to an abrupt halt. Estimates from the United Nations World Tourism Organization show that international travel shrank by 72% in 2020, leading to 1.1 billion fewer trips taken and setting the industry back massively. However, 2022 witnessed a reversal in this trend as international borders began opening up, coupled with the disposable income people saved up during the lockdown and their increasing longing to travel around. According to the WTO, more than 900 million tourists traveled internationally in 2022 - double the number recorded in 2021. Story continuesThe World Tourism and Travel Council has reported that the T&amp;T sector contributed 7.6% to the global GDP in 2022, an increase of 22% from 2021 and only 23% below 2019 levels. Role of the Entertainment Industry in Reviving the T&amp;T Sector: The entertainment industry is another sector having a significant impact on the revival of the travel and hospitality industries. The American government agencies have officially credited the ongoing Eras Tour by the uber-popular American singer Taylor Swift with boosting the American economy. According to the Philadelphia Federal Reserve, hotel bookings have risen dramatically, showing the strongest growth since the beginning of the pandemic, thanks to Swift’s show dates. Earlier this month, Cincinnati officials also credited Swift and Eras tour with helping downtown hotels gross more than $2.6 million, and surrounding Hamilton County hotels gross more than $5.3 million in revenue. Largest Travel Company in the World: With a market cap of about $105.9 billion, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) holds the title of being the largest travel company in the world. Operating in over 220 countries and 40 different languages, there are more than 28 million global listings available between hotels, homes and apartments under the Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) travel sites. The company also strongly felt the shocks of the pandemic when its revenue fell by almost 55%, from $15.06 billion in 2019, to $6.8 billion in 2020. However, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) boasted a revenue of $17.09 billion in 2022 after the revival of international tourism, even higher than its pre-pandemic levels, and stocks of the company have sailed 34% higher during the first half of the current year. Booking.com has also recently started conversational trip planning with ChatGPT. Need for Sustainable Tourism: Although the tourism industry comes as a boon for many and supports millions of businesses and jobs worldwide, it often doesn’t come without a price. An example of this is the listing and rental of local homes on the online platform of Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB). In many cities in Europe, the increasing listing of local homes for short-term rental on Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) has created a shortage of available residences for the cities’ locals, leading to insufficient housing and a massive increase in rents. In downtown Barcelona, some residents have even complained of their rents straight up getting doubled after the easing down of travel restrictions. In June, the city of Florence announced an outright immediate ban on new short-term private location rentals in the Renaissance city’s historic center, part of an effort to draw full-time residents back to one of Italy’s most popular tourist destinations. With that said, let’s take a look at some of the Most Magical Places on Earth. 30 Most Magical Places in the Worldmuratart/Shutterstock.comMethodology:Our world has been blessed with a myriad of enchanting and wonderful places and it is tough to rank one above the other.

Well, here to help us navigate some of this uncertainty, some of his picks, and also some stocks to stay away from, we want to bring in Ben Kirby, Thornburg Investment Management co-head of investments.Ben, it's good to see you here. So let's start with one of your picks, and it goes along the theme with bank earnings today, but you're looking at a name, Charles Schwab, one of the banks that was caught up in the regional crisis that we saw play out earlier this year. Why are you seeing a buying opportunity?BEN KIRBY: Yeah, well, thanks. Great for having me on the show. So, look, I think the economy is slowing. So let's try to find some investments that can be resilient even as the economy slows, and we think we think Schwab is one of those. So Schwab is a very high quality, large cap blue chip company. Its compounded earnings at 15% a year for the last decade, but the stock is down 30% this year while the market is up 17%.Story continuesSo Schwab used to trade at a 20% premium to the market. Today it's a 20% discount to the market. We think that valuation will close over time. Schwab is not facing liquidity challenges, they're not facing solvency challenges, they have a near-term earnings headwind from higher rates. They're going to work through that and we think the premium will come back over time.SEANA SMITH: But what about the crisis of confidence, though? Because we know so much of what happened in what played out with the regional banks and even the larger names was because consumers didn't know what to think. They didn't know how confident they should be in their banks. Is there still some lingering risk from that line of thinking?BEN KIRBY: There's still lingering concern, and I think that's the opportunity. Schwab is in a totally different bucket than some of the banks that were really challenged. Schwab is continuing to get net new money inflows over this time period. We think that the bank is really not in any stress. They have liquidity, they're going to work their way through this, come out the other side a stronger company we think still with a very attractive growth profile.SEANA SMITH: And their executives, of course, have been extremely vocal just about their positioning amid all of that fear. All right, Ben, let's move on to your next pick and that is BioMarin Pharmaceutical, one of the mid-cap biotech companies. What's the bull case here?BEN KIRBY: It's another name that's been left behind in the year where, again, S&amp;P up 17, this name is down 17%. They just got approved for a really important drug called Roctavian, which is for hemophilia A, and it's going to significantly improve patients' quality of life. Instead of having to go to a treatment center on a regular basis, you can take Roctavian and you won't have to go there for four years. So it's going to significantly improve patients' quality of life.We think that peak sales for this drug are probably $1.1 billion or higher, and the stock's trading at about $85. We think that just on pure fundamentals alone, it's probably worth $120, maybe $130, and we think it's an attractive M&amp;A target, and in an M&amp;A scenario, it goes to $200. So we think maybe $10 of downside in the price, and more than $100 in upside if things play out over the next 6 to 12 months.SEANA SMITH: All right, Ben, let's flip over to stocks that you're saying to avoid, and your first pick is a name that has certainly generated a number of headlines over the last couple of days, and that's Disney. We know CEO Bob Iger is going to stay on two more year-- two years longer than initially he committed to. He also made some comments just about the strategy for Disney here going forward. Why aren't you too confident that he's going to right the ship quickly?BEN KIRBY: You know, Bob Iger is a great CEO, and the fact is Disney has great content, they have great brands. It's a great company. The problem is they have a lot of challenges facing them right now and it's just going to take a while to turn it around. I mean, what's very clear again is the consumer is slowing, and Disney is exposed to that. We see parks visitation is down significantly in the current year. We've seen the reporting on that. So a cyclical component.They're also facing structural pressures from the decline of linear TV that's impacting even ESPN as well as some of their other assets, and the direct to consumer business, the streaming business, is burning cash, and we think that they can maybe make-- break even in a year or two, but the fact is it's not a great business. It's burning a lot of cash.So we just kind of put it all together. Strengths aside, there are social pressures, there are secular pressures. We think there's going to be better places to invest and kind of sidestep the slowing economy that Disney is going to get hit by.SEANA SMITH: Ben, speaking of the slowing economy, your next player that you're saying to avoid, or really a sector here at this point or a group of stocks I should say is the buy now, pay later space. How much weakness, how much more weakness are you expecting to see from the consumer?BEN KIRBY: Especially the low end consumer I think is most at risk. So high end consumers, if you look at excess savings and sort of net wealth accumulation from home prices going up, from the stock market going up, from bond yields falling a little bit, all of those indicate that the high end consumer is still in a pretty decent position.The low end consumer though, look, student loan payments are going to be coming back, stimulus is gone, and they've worked through all their excess savings, and they've had a lot of tailwinds in the last few years that are going to be reversing. So a strong job market has led to rising wages. That's going to be reversing, and so we think that as we slow, you're going to see layoffs, you're going to see wage growth slow, and that should lead to in a traditional cycle, and we think in this one as well, higher default rates among some of those lower income consumers. So it's a cycle, and we think that we're entering the slowdown phase, so stay away from those parts of the economy and those parts of the market that are going to be most exposed to it.SEANA SMITH: All right, Ben Kirby, great to get your picks. Two names to buy, two names to avoid here as we look ahead to the remaining of the year. Ben, thanks so much.]"
226,7e55fcc5-fd0d-31a3-8cfa-a897bcb583c2,DIS,2023-07-15,Hollywood actors join writers on strike: How it will impact the box office,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/hollywood-actors-join-writers-strike-204158773.html,1689367318,VIDEO,"['SNEJF', 'SONY', 'CMCSA', 'DIS', 'WBD', 'AMC', 'PARA', 'PARAA', 'PARAP', 'NFLX']","[With SAG-AFTRA members joining writers on the picket line, all marketing campaigns and press for films and television shows will be called off. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Alexandra Canal discusses how the strikes will impact all aspects of content production, including the box office.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Well, the ""Barbie"" movie, it hits theaters in just one week, and the film's actors have been on a marketing blitz the past month to promote it. But that campaign is over now after the Hollywood actors union SAG-AFTRA voted to go on strike. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal is with me, who has been following the story very closely, and, Allie, the question here is what this means for the box office. Could the box office potentially take a hit now that some of the movies, the big stars are not out promoting it?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Well, Seana, the one thing I'm going to say is thank goodness this SAG-AFTRA strike happened now and not before they started this press tour for the ""Barbie"" movie, because Margot Robbie's outfits were just so iconic, so I'm happy we at least got to see some of that. But absolutely it could.I mean, the timing here, it kind of stinks for a company like Mattel and Warner Brothers Discovery. Considering how much is riding on the success of this movie, the fact that now all marketing, all press has to stop at this point when we're a week out, that's disappointing, and that's something that I think a lot of people don't really think about. It's not just the acting, it's everything that happens pre-production, post-production. The junkets, the red carpets, all of that that's in anticipation for the movie has to stop.And, you know, that video package was talking about the importance that this is for Mattel, the future of Barbie, but like I said, it's also very important for Warner Brothers Discovery, which has been lagging at the box office recently, especially when we talk about some of their DC movies like ""The Flash"". That was a big disappointment. So they're really hoping that the ""Barbie"" movie can deliver this jolt, this box office boom.Story continuesSo far it seems like it is, considering how much hype is around this, but you just never know how that will translate to ticket sales, because, remember, we talked about Disney's ""The Little Mermaid"" for so long, and that was a bit of a disappointment. So, again, you just never know what the consumer, how they're going to react in this post-COVID environment, especially at the box office, but certainly a lot riding for this film.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Allie, there is so much riding for this film, and I know you've talked to so many people within the industry over the last several weeks just about what this will signal for the return to the box office. If we don't see a huge hit here from ""Barbie"", how worried should we be just about movie theaters here going forward?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Well, especially with not only the SAG-AFTRA strike but also the ongoing writers strike, that's a double whammy that is going to impact the box office, especially as we head into the back half of 2023, into 2024, and ""Barbie"" has been branded as one of the most significant movies at the box office this summer. It will come with a slew of other big titles like ""Mission Impossible"", ""Oppenheimer"".So if this doesn't do well, it sort of signals, OK, well, what kind of movies do consumers want? What is the new genre that we need in order to get people back to the theater? And I think a lot of people will be questioning the future of the box office and how vital it can be during these uncertain times. So certainly everyone is going to have their eye on those ticket sales and they're hoping that it can surpass those estimates.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly a lot of people will be tracking this very, very closely. Allie, what are you hearing just about the timeline? I guess how long this strike could potentially go on and when we're going to start seeing a significant hit here now that actors and the writers are not working.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Well, I don't think we're going to see any immediate impact this year, but from what I've been hearing from analysts and industry experts, by 2024 is where we could see some of that impact. I do expect this to continue through the summer and possibly into the fall, but it sort of feels like this situation of who is going to cave first. Is it going to be the studios or is it going to be the writers and the actors? And that's never a good position that you want anyone to be in. The stakes are very high.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, stakes are very high. All right, Allie Canal, great stuff. Thanks so much.]"

The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Akamai Technologies has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while The Trade Desk has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that AKAM has an improving earnings outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.AKAM currently has a forward P/E ratio of 16.14, while TTD has a forward P/E of 69.79. We also note that AKAM has a PEG ratio of 1.61. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. TTD currently has a PEG ratio of 2.91.Another notable valuation metric for AKAM is its P/B ratio of 3.49. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

This innovative technology combines performance and sustainability, offering significant benefits for both the environment and Corning's bottom line.Pharmaceutical manufacturers face the challenge of meeting the growing demand for injectable medicines while reducing their environmental impact. Viridian Vials addresses this challenge by improving filling-line efficiency by up to 50% and reducing vial-manufacturing carbon-dioxide-equivalent (CO2e) emissions by up to 30%. These advancements are made possible through cutting-edge coating technology, allowing medications to be delivered safely and efficiently while minimizing harm to the planet.One of the key environmental benefits of Viridian Vials is the reduction in glass material usage. Compared to conventional glass vials, Viridian Vials uses 20% less glass material without compromising quality or safety. This lowers manufacturing and transportation-related emissions while reducing the total amount of glass waste. Additionally, the vials' low-friction external coating helps improve filling-line efficiency while minimizing cracks, breaks and cosmetic rejects.Corning's commitment to sustainability extends beyond its own innovations. The company has partnered with West Pharmaceutical Services as the exclusive distributor of Viridian Vial technology. This collaboration brings together two industry leaders who share a common goal of using resources responsibly for a healthier, more sustainable world.Notwithstanding challenging macroeconomic conditions, Corning expects to witness 6-8% compound annual sales growth and 12-15% compound annual earnings per share growth through 2023 while investing $10-$12 billion in research, development &amp; engineering, capital, and mergers and acquisitions. It plans to expand its operating margin and return on invested capital and deliver $8-$10 billion to shareholders, including an annual dividend per share increase of at least 10%. To achieve its goals, the company expects to add an incremental $3-$4 billion in annual sales and improve profitability by the end of 2023.The stock has gained 7.9% over the past year compared with the industry’s rise of 30.4%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCorning currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

235,7e55fcc5-fd0d-31a3-8cfa-a897bcb583c2,CMCSA,2023-07-15,Hollywood actors join writers on strike: How it will impact the box office,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/hollywood-actors-join-writers-strike-204158773.html,1689367318,VIDEO,"['SNEJF', 'SONY', 'CMCSA', 'DIS', 'WBD', 'AMC', 'PARA', 'PARAA', 'PARAP', 'NFLX']","[With SAG-AFTRA members joining writers on the picket line, all marketing campaigns and press for films and television shows will be called off. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Alexandra Canal discusses how the strikes will impact all aspects of content production, including the box office.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Well, the ""Barbie"" movie, it hits theaters in just one week, and the film's actors have been on a marketing blitz the past month to promote it. But that campaign is over now after the Hollywood actors union SAG-AFTRA voted to go on strike. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal is with me, who has been following the story very closely, and, Allie, the question here is what this means for the box office. Could the box office potentially take a hit now that some of the movies, the big stars are not out promoting it?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Well, Seana, the one thing I'm going to say is thank goodness this SAG-AFTRA strike happened now and not before they started this press tour for the ""Barbie"" movie, because Margot Robbie's outfits were just so iconic, so I'm happy we at least got to see some of that. But absolutely it could.I mean, the timing here, it kind of stinks for a company like Mattel and Warner Brothers Discovery. Considering how much is riding on the success of this movie, the fact that now all marketing, all press has to stop at this point when we're a week out, that's disappointing, and that's something that I think a lot of people don't really think about. It's not just the acting, it's everything that happens pre-production, post-production. The junkets, the red carpets, all of that that's in anticipation for the movie has to stop.And, you know, that video package was talking about the importance that this is for Mattel, the future of Barbie, but like I said, it's also very important for Warner Brothers Discovery, which has been lagging at the box office recently, especially when we talk about some of their DC movies like ""The Flash"". That was a big disappointment. So they're really hoping that the ""Barbie"" movie can deliver this jolt, this box office boom.Story continuesSo far it seems like it is, considering how much hype is around this, but you just never know how that will translate to ticket sales, because, remember, we talked about Disney's ""The Little Mermaid"" for so long, and that was a bit of a disappointment. So, again, you just never know what the consumer, how they're going to react in this post-COVID environment, especially at the box office, but certainly a lot riding for this film.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Allie, there is so much riding for this film, and I know you've talked to so many people within the industry over the last several weeks just about what this will signal for the return to the box office. If we don't see a huge hit here from ""Barbie"", how worried should we be just about movie theaters here going forward?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Well, especially with not only the SAG-AFTRA strike but also the ongoing writers strike, that's a double whammy that is going to impact the box office, especially as we head into the back half of 2023, into 2024, and ""Barbie"" has been branded as one of the most significant movies at the box office this summer. It will come with a slew of other big titles like ""Mission Impossible"", ""Oppenheimer"".So if this doesn't do well, it sort of signals, OK, well, what kind of movies do consumers want? What is the new genre that we need in order to get people back to the theater? And I think a lot of people will be questioning the future of the box office and how vital it can be during these uncertain times. So certainly everyone is going to have their eye on those ticket sales and they're hoping that it can surpass those estimates.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly a lot of people will be tracking this very, very closely. Allie, what are you hearing just about the timeline? I guess how long this strike could potentially go on and when we're going to start seeing a significant hit here now that actors and the writers are not working.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Well, I don't think we're going to see any immediate impact this year, but from what I've been hearing from analysts and industry experts, by 2024 is where we could see some of that impact. I do expect this to continue through the summer and possibly into the fall, but it sort of feels like this situation of who is going to cave first. Is it going to be the studios or is it going to be the writers and the actors? And that's never a good position that you want anyone to be in. The stakes are very high.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, stakes are very high. All right, Allie Canal, great stuff. Thanks so much.]"

Michael Pachter, Wedbush Managing Director, Equity Research, tells Yahoo Finance Live how broadcast media is in ""big, big trouble,"" but streamers won't be ""hit as bad"" due to international production and being able to purchase streaming rights to existing content.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: The fight in Hollywood heating up as actors and writers come together on the picket line for the first time in over 60 years. So how will this impact studios and streamers? Joining us now, we've got Michael Pachter, Wedbush Managing Director of Equity Research.And we still have our own very own Ale Canal here. Michael, Thanks for joining us this morning for the conversation. So from your perspective, does this change the calculus about how you evaluate these companies that are still in the business of creating content to try and drive even more subscriptions?MICHAEL PACHTER: Yeah, it makes me question the judgment of their managements. And I actually agree with Brianne Drescher. I think the studios are just completely wrong on this one. I'm not suggesting that they cave but I'm suggesting that they compromise.And they just haven't even begun discussions with the writers. The actors, obviously, just went on strike. So, yeah, content is their lifeblood. They're being really foolish about this. And you know, Ale pointed out that the biggest impact is on scheduled series, commercial broadcast. And in particular, daily television. So soap operas and late night.Those guys are going to have to stop production like now. So that's a real problem. And then, it's going to become a huge problem in September when the new season for broadcast television starts. The streamers aren't hit as bad.And in fairness, Netflix is like profitable. They're the only profitable streamer. So they can afford to kind of hang out and do nothing. They can shift production overseas. They're making 25 Korean language television shows as we speak. And they can pay up for catalog some more Seinfeld.Story continuesAnd their viewers aren't going to really notice because there's something like 15,000 different titles on Netflix. So you'll always find something to watch there. But broadcast is in big, big trouble. And really, questions the judgment of the managements.ALEXANDRA CANAL: So Michael, given that point, do you think Netflix is best positioned to weather both of these strikes when you look at all of the media and cable and entertainment companies right now?MICHAEL PACHTER: Yeah, by far. The movie-- first, it's the commercial broadcast guys that are hit. Second, it's the movie studios. Because, you're right, that it's not going to hit anybody until 2024. But if you have no summer films for 2024. If you let this thing drag out two or three more months, they're screwed. And theaters are screwed.So the movie studios have to get to the table. Fortunately for them, Netflix sucks at making movies. I mean, they haven't made a good one yet. And the handful that they've made that a lot of people have watched, kind of keep you busy for another two hours. But they don't really care.And they've been pissing money away on film because they don't have theatrical. So they lose the biggest revenue piece of the pie. They don't have DVD sales. So they-- and they're really de-emphasizing studio films anyway and they're focused more on television. And what they've really discovered is foreign language TV plays well in the US and elsewhere.So Spanish language plays globally. You're seeing a slew of Scandinavian shows showing up in the US that are dubbed. They're just-- I saw a Turkish show the other day. And I didn't even know you know Turkey made spy thrillers, but it looked very much like a US show.So Korean TV works. They're going to be absolutely fine. And they're the problem. They're the problem. The studios fed them and made them successful. And now the studios are suffering because they're trying to compete and they can't afford to compete. Netflix would love this to drag on for five more years. So they're the wrong guys to look at to be the first to cave, they will not be the first.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Michael, I was really struck yesterday by Bob Iger comments in an interview that it's not realistic what the actors and writers are asking for, which I found sort of unusually adversarial. And I just wonder, I've seen a lot of vilifying too of he and some of the other CEOs, who are taking home very hefty paychecks, right?The relationship between the studios and the actors and writers. Is there a chance of permanent damage there and does it even matter? I mean, do they even have a choice but to work with each other?MICHAEL PACHTER: Yes, yes, permanent damage. And, no, it doesn't matter. I mean, it's a great headline. Iger made 65 million bucks. That's like 25% of the cost of ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" So who cares.I mean, it's a lot of money for an individual but that 65 million wouldn't be spread very far among the Actors Guild or the Writers Guild. So what matters more is your attitude. And Iger is as big a part of the problem as anybody because he decided to chase streaming. And before he chased it, he supported it.So he used to license Disney content. They pulled their movies off the stars and gave them to Netflix. He's one of the biggest reasons Netflix has succeeded. I think the biggest culprit was probably Les Moonves, who's not employed anymore.But these guys were so quick to reward shareholders by licensing content immediately to Netflix as soon as the season ended, that they propped up Netflix and they made Netflix into this big threat. Then, they all stupidly decided to follow Netflix.What they should have done is pulled their content from Netflix and kept it off of streaming for three years and not allowed us to become accustomed to an inexpensive way to view a mass quantity of high quality content. They blew it. And he's the biggest-- second biggest behind Moonves, biggest culprit.So for him to say it's not realistic. Look at sports. Sports has figured this out they pay out 50% of overall revenue to the athletes. And somehow that works. And what happened? Yeah, the price of a ticket to a football game went from 25 bucks to $200 or more. But, we got more television.We have now Monday night, Thursday night, Sunday night football. We used to only have one. So more football on TV because they have to pay the athletes more. You'll get better distribution of television or film to televised content if they pay the actors more and you'll get better content.I think Iger, who's only a few years older than me, is a Luddite. He doesn't get the tech. He's afraid of it. He's emulating it poorly. And I think he's just completely wrong.BRAD SMITH: Now if we could just do something about my forced exposure to watching the Giants or New York sports versus watching my Philadelphia Eagles in this territory and market.]"

They'll be joining writers, who have been on strike since May. It's the first time in more than 60 years writers and actors have been on strike at the same time. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Alexandra Canal breaks down the strikes' impact on future content production and production-reliant businesses.Video Transcript- Well, Hollywood actors have joined writers on the picket line. SAG-AFTRA, the union that represents over 160,000 professionals in the industry, has voted to go on strike after failing to get to a deal with a major studio. This is the first time that writers and actors are striking at the same time since 1960. Joining us now, Yahoo Finance reporter, Alexandra Canal. Ali, set the scene for us. So what does it mean that they're both striking?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Well, it likely means that we won't see an immediate impact given the fact that the content [INAUDIBLE] is very baked in at this point. However, it's likely that we will see the delay of shows, series, episodes beginning in 2024. And if you think about where we're at in the media environment right now, it's very disruptive.That's what Bob Iger was talking about during that CNBC interview yesterday, saying the union demands were not realistic given this fragmented environment where cord cutting is escalating, direct-to-consumer remains unprofitable. He said it was, quote, very disturbing that these strikes would be happening concurrently at this critical time for the industry.But SAG-AFTRA fighting back on those comments, saying they are the ones that are being taken advantage of, given where contracts are today and how they don't account for streaming residuals and AI and all of these advancements in media. Fran Drescher, she's president of SAG-AFTRA. She's also an actress herself. She spoke following the announcement of these strikes. Take a listen to what she had to say.FRAN DRESCHER: We are the victims here. We are being victimized by a very greedy entity. I am shocked by the way the people that we have been in business with are treating us. I cannot believe it, quite frankly, how far apart we are on so many things, how they plead poverty, that they're losing money left and right when giving hundreds of millions of dollars to their CEOs.ALEXANDRA CANAL: So some really fiery words there, and you can really feel the passion on all sides here because the stakes are high for everyone and not to mention those Hollywood-adjacent businesses, those businesses that rely on production. Think craft services, transportation companies, studio crews, I mean, there's a ripple effect here beyond just those media companies. The writers are currently in month three of their own strike with no end in sight. Now with SAG joining them, the damage here could be quite devastating, especially the longer this goes on.]"

A survey by Comcast found that 51 percent of Americans say it’s easier to find a new romantic partner than a new mobile provider. Xfinity Mobile wants to make switching easier for the one in five Americans looking for a new mobile provider by offering a convenient, cost-effective alternative to Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&amp;T.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230714036260/en/National Break Free From the Big Three Day (Photo: Business Wire)Nearly half of all Americans (48 percent) have had a negative experience with their current mobile provider due to bad coverage, while nearly 70 percent of Americans have dealt with steady price increases. On National Break Free from the Big Three Day, it’s time for a fresh start with a new mobile provider that will save consumers from complicated billing charges, spotty coverage, and customer service headaches.""We're thrilled to provide Michiganders the freedom to choose and the power to save,"" said Kristee Cominiello, Senior Vice President of Comcast's Heartland Region, which includes Michigan, Indiana and Kentucky. ""Our Big Three offer empowers customers to switch mobile providers and reduce wireless expenses without compromising value or service.""Breaking Up Is Hard to DoBreaking up with your mobile provider can be tough. Even when people decide they’ve had enough many drag their feet when it comes to canceling. On average, Americans who decide to sever ties with their mobile provider end up staying for an additional six months. That average jumps to a full year for parents.Story continuesMore than 3 in 4 people (76 percent) would prefer their new mobile provider ""break up"" with their old one for them. Xfinity Mobile is here to help. Customers looking to switch to Xfinity Mobile can walk into any Xfinity Store and ask for help to switch their service, from swapping out a SIM card, porting a phone number, and even breaking up with a customer’s previous carrier.Parents Have it HardestParents are particularly prone to be over their mobile provider. A third of parents (33 percent) say they are done and ready for a change, more than double that of non-parents (14 percent). The biggest gripe for parents is pricing. In fact, parents report they are four times more likely than non-parents to be always looking for the next new plan. And when families do decide to move on, kids are usually impacted by breakups with mobile service providers. More than half of parents (53 percent) have their kids on their service plans, with kids getting their first phone at the average age of 11.Xfinity Mobile offers parents the tools they need to make sure everyone in the family is happy. Parental controls, flexible plans, and the ability to share data across users makes Xfinity a great option to add to your family.The Last StrawAmericans cited a number of reasons for wanting out of their relationship with their current mobile provider. The largest driver was price increase(s) (69 percent), followed by spotty coverage/dropped calls (50 percent), unexplained charges (49 percent) and slow data speeds (48 percent). Fortunately, Xfinity Mobile offers straightforward pricing, with by the gig plans starting at only $15 a month, and unlimited plans starting at $30 a month per line for two or more lines.Now’s The Time to SwitchThere are several device deals happening right now for customers looking to break up with their current provider and switch to Xfinity Mobile. New and existing customers can get up to $800 toward select iPhones, including the iPhone 12, 13, and 14 with an eligible trade-in. New customers porting their line can also get $100 off a Pixel 7a, or a Samsung A54 G5 ""On Us"" (a $449.99 value). Want to bring your own device? Xfinity Mobile is also offering a $100 Visa gift card for customers who BYOD.Xfinity customers can also celebrate Break Free from the Big Three Day on X1. All they have to do is say, ""Break Free Day"" into their Xfinity voice remote to pull up dozens of movies, TV shows and songs about break up, heartache, and tainted love.With millions of lines added since its launch in 2017, Xfinity Mobile is one of the fastest growing mobile providers in the country. Rated the fastest mobile service with 5G cellular and millions of WiFi hotspots throughout Comcast’s extensive WiFi footprint*, Xfinity Mobile delivers a great wireless experience for less money. 90 percent of Xfinity Mobile customers’ data is over WiFi, allowing customers to use less data and connect to the Xfinity 10G Network.Xfinity offers unparalleled convenience by offering customers unlimited or by the gig options, and customers can always change their plans even in the middle of their billing cycle. And with mobile plans starting for as little as $15 a month, customers can save hundreds every year.Comcast BusinessComcast Business Mobile offers small business owners an opportunity to break free from current providers with affordable, flexible data options and a fast, reliable network.About the SurveyThe survey, conducted by Wakefield Research, polled 1,000 nationally representative US adult smartphone users, ages 18+, between May 31st and June 6th, 2023, using an email invitation and an online survey.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One stock to keep an eye on is United Rentals (URI). URI is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 11.29. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 14.97. Over the past 52 weeks, URI's Forward P/E has been as high as 11.83 and as low as 7.57, with a median of 9.38.URI is also sporting a PEG ratio of 0.70. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. URI's industry currently sports an average PEG of 1.62. Within the past year, URI's PEG has been as high as 0.72 and as low as 0.43, with a median of 0.54.Finally, we should also recognize that URI has a P/CF ratio of 7.11. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. URI's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 17.69. Over the past year, URI's P/CF has been as high as 7.72 and as low as 4.57, with a median of 5.89.Story continuesThese are only a few of the key metrics included in United Rentals's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now.

Well, consider venturing into the dynamic realm of semiconductor stocks. These technological powerhouses not only continue to drive progress in our modern world, but they also show no signs of deceleration. So, if you’re looking for where to invest in semiconductor stocks, you’ve come to the right place. Dipping into these stocks allows you to align with the heartbeat of the technological revolution. Below, you’ll find a curated list of three options worth considering.Focusing on the domestic market is prudent to ensure a wise choice in semiconductor stocks. After all, international investments can be intricate and, as the legendary Warren Buffett once advised, “Never invest in a business you cannot understand.” So, let’s narrow down the options to three exceptional blue-chip chipmakers.Starting with just $1,000, it would be wise to allocate most of your investment to the confident pick while reserving a moderate portion for the overlooked semiconductor giant. This strategic approach holds the potential for significant gains. So don’t hesitate! Immerse yourself in the thrilling world of semiconductor stocks and ride the wave of technological progress to achieve financial success.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD)Investing in semiconductor stocks has become a hot topic, and one company that stands out is Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Despite heavy competition, AMD, led by Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Dr. Lisa Su, has staged an impressive comeback.AMD’s recent earnings report showcased why investors are bullish on this chipmaker. AMD has solidified its position with quarterly revenue reaching $5.6 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase and data center revenue skyrocketing by 42% to $1.7 billion. These impressive numbers back Su’s confidence in gaining market share in 2023.Story continuesAMD’s growth prospects are compelling. Despite a slowdown in PC sales, the company’s margins have remained strong, boasting a non-GAAP operating margin of 27% compared to Intel’s (NASDAQ:INTC) 12.6% in 2022. Moreover, AMD is pivoting toward data center dominance, with revenues of $5.6 billion last year, growing three times faster than its gaming unit.AMD’s strategy for 2023 revolves around placing innovation at its very foundation. The upcoming Ryzen 7000 series processors, set to launch soon, promise improved performance. The Ryzen 7040 CPU series offers exceptional battery life, while the Ryzen AI provides dedicated on-chip AI inference capabilities. Both of these will become exceptional money-makers for the company moving forward.AMD’s latest MI300 accelerator is specifically designed to cater to the demands of cloud data centers, focusing on empowering large-scale AI applications.AMD appears to be an odds-on favorite for those considering semiconductor stock investments. With its relentless drive for newer, faster, and more powerful components, AMD continues to widen its competitive moat. As inflation stabilizes and the PC market potentially recovers, the company’s long-term growth prospects remain enticing.Investing a healthy slice of your $1,000 in AMD seems smart among U.S.-based semiconductor specialists.Intel (INTC)Investing in semiconductor stocks, particularly in the booming AI chip market, presents a highly lucrative opportunity. Intel is rapidly emerging as a formidable competitor in this field, although Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) currently holds a dominant position.Intel’s strategic acquisition of Habana Labs in 2019 has proven to be wise as the demand for AI chips continues to soar. Although Habana’s Gaudi2 AI chip may not surpass Nvidia’s H100 GPU in raw performance, it offers an appealing value proposition. Intel aims to rival the company directly with the upcoming Gaudi3 chip.The MLPerf benchmarks clearly demonstrate Nvidia’s H100 as the current leader, but Habana’s Gaudi2 chips hold their ground. While H100 outperforms Gaudi2 by threefold, a software update for the latter is set to narrow the gap. The performance per dollar ratio in the AI realm is crucial, and Gaudi2’s competitive pricing presents an attractive alternative to Nvidia’s H100.Intel has multiple avenues to capitalize on the AI boom. In addition to Habana’s chips, Intel’s Sapphire Rapids data center CPUs incorporate AI accelerators for inference tasks. Furthermore, Intel’s data center GPUs power the cutting-edge Aurora supercomputer. Intel is also aggressively pursuing advancements in its foundry business, which could potentially secure future orders for manufacturing AI chips.While Nvidia currently dominates data center GPUs, Intel’s Gaudi chip family should not be overlooked or underestimated. Intel is well-positioned to attract new customers with its compelling value proposition in the ongoing AI revolution.Investing in semiconductor stocks, including Intel, can be a strategic move to capitalize on the ever-growing demand for AI chips. More importantly, you get an established player with a company like Intel. Whosoever is looking for where to invest in semiconductor stocks, their research should start with Intel.Micron Technology (MU)Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), the leading memory and storage chip manufacturer, has quietly thrived amidst the semiconductor frenzy. While attention gravitates toward Nvidia and its AI-centric graphics processors, Micron’s chips power smartphones, data centers, and electric vehicles.Despite its recent under-the-radar status, Micron stands to benefit greatly from the expanding AI industry. AI servers demand up to eight times more DRAM and three times more storage than regular servers, promising a bright future for Micron’s stock.In the short term, Micron faces challenges in consumer segments due to the economic slowdown. Excess inventory led to price markdowns and a substantial percentage drop in revenue decline of 52% in Q2 of fiscal 2023, year over year. However, Micron has taken proactive measures by reducing costs and personnel.Encouragingly, Micron anticipates the peak of inventory issues has passed, indicating an imminent improvement in financial results. Additionally, with its stock down by double digits from its peak, now could be an opportune time for investors to enter the market.Determining where to invest in semiconductor stocks is a perpetual question. However, it is essential not to overlook the potential of Micron and the imminent surge in demand for AI. As a semiconductor stock, Micron presents a unique investment opportunity poised to shine in the coming years.If you have completed the list and wish to explore potential stock picks further, there’s no need to worry.

It's Mattel stock (MAT), as the 78-year-old toymaker appears to have struck cultural relevance gold with its upcoming ""Barbie"" movie.Shares of Mattel are up 15% over the past month, outperforming the stock price of Mr. Potato Head-selling Hasbro, which has a 7% gain. And since you are wondering, shares of Nvidia are up 9% in the last month, Meta stock has notched a 12% increase, and Apple stock has trucked along with a 4% improvement.Mattel's ""Barbie"" is a live-action PG-13 flick headlined by Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken. It was directed by Greta Gerwig and reportedly had a budget of up to $100 million to make.The movie is slated to hit theaters on July 21, and Robbie, Gosling, and the rest of the star-studded cast are currently out doing red carpet events to build anticipation.""Barbie is a cultural conversation at this point,"" Mattel COO Richard Dickson told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). Dickson is credited with reinventing Barbie and making the brand more in line with cultural trends in his work at Mattel over the last five years.Mattel is betting that the cultural conversation around Barbie materializes in strong profit figures, created in a few different ways.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling attend the World Premiere of ""Barbie"" on July 09, 2023, in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Frazer Harrison/FilmMagic,) (Frazer Harrison via Getty Images)First is through the licensing of the Barbie name to merchandise that has sprouted up everywhere ahead of the movie's release. Mattel, for instance, inked a Barbie apparel deal with specialty retailer Gap (GPS) that hit stores on May 23.The product line ranges from pink Barbie hoodies to pink pet clothing.Fast fashion house Forever 21 has also released a Barbie-inspired clothing line.""I think what really becomes more interesting as you see the Barbie brand evolve is from a character into a platform and ultimately a franchise,"" Dickson said. ""And so from toys to lifestyle products to live experiences, digital gaming, now film, you really start to see the manifestation and the monetization of the power of this incredible franchise.""Story continuesDancer Kim Manning performs a routine to promote the film ""Barbie"" at the WeHo Pride Parade in West Hollywood, Calif., on Sunday, June 4, 2023. AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)The other profit driver is likely to come from the movie itself, which was produced by Mattel Films and is being distributed by Warner Bros.Stifel analyst Drew Crum recently estimated the ""Barbie"" movie could haul in $400 million at the box office. Crum's previous sales estimate stood at $325 million.""Barbie is the first of several movie releases from Mattel Films, with a stated mission to be an IP-driven toy business, and thus we see a successful launch as driving greater confidence around this part of the company's strategy,"" Crum said. ""And a higher box office = higher profits for Mattel ~ since the company did not fund production our estimates (including adj. EPS = $0.08) are admittedly modest, but a stronger showing in theaters certainly can't hurt numbers.""And lastly, a successful Barbie debut could validate the 14 other content projects in development for Mattel, including a Warner Bros. movie based on the toy car brand Matchbox.CEO of Mattel, Ynon Kreiz, arrives at the premiere of ""Barbie"" on Sunday, July 9, 2023, at The Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello) (Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP)Investors appear to be betting in advance that some of those projects pay off financially for Mattel, based solely on early reads for Barbie.""Barbie is clearly an important brand. It's one of our three power brands, and it will be in many ways a showcase for the quality of the movies that we're looking to make, the type of partnerships we're formulating with lead talent in Hollywood, working with major studios,"" Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz told Yahoo Finance Live.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

247,830a918d-6521-3a33-a76f-cde4aeafc5b6,AON,2023-07-15,Will Rising Costs Hurt Discover Financial's (DFS) Q2 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rising-costs-hurt-discover-financials-163100963.html,1689352260,STORY,"['DFS', 'AON']","[Discover Financial Services DFS is set to report its second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 19, after the closing bell.What Do the Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share of $3.69 suggests a 6.8% decrease from the prior-year figure of $3.96. The consensus mark remained stable over the past week. The consensus estimate for second-quarter revenues of $3.9 billion indicates a 20.1% increase from the year-ago reported figure.Discover Financial beat the consensus estimate for earnings in two of the trailing four quarters and missed on the other two occasions, with the average surprise being 0.2%. This is depicted in the graph below:Discover Financial Services Price and EPS SurpriseDiscover Financial Services Price and EPS SurpriseDiscover Financial Services price-eps-surprise | Discover Financial Services QuoteBefore we get into what to expect for the to-be-reported quarter in detail, it’s worth taking a look at DFS’ previous-quarter performance first.Q1 Earnings RewindThe digital banking and payment services company reported adjusted earnings of $3.58 per share for the previous quarter, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.8%. The quarterly results received a blow from escalating operating costs and feeble contributions from the Digital Banking segment. Nevertheless, higher receivables growth, record deposit inflows and the solid performance of its Payment Services segment partially offset the negatives.Now let’s see how things have shaped up before the second-quarter earnings announcement.Q2 Factors to NoteThe top line of Discover Financial is expected to have benefited from higher net interest income, the primary contributor to its revenues. This metric is likely to have been driven by strong asset growth and net interest margin expansion in the second quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the net interest income of DFS is pegged at $3,197.4 million, indicating 22.5% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure, while our estimate suggests an 18.4% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the net interest margin is likely to have been favored by a high interest rate environment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net interest margin is pegged at 11.23% for the second quarter, implying an increase from 10.94% a year ago.Story continuesStrong sales, moderation in payment rates and improved new account growth are expected to have provided an impetus to receivable growth in the to-be-reported quarter. DFS’ disciplined underwriting, pricing and marketing of its non-card products are likely to have aided its performance in the second quarter.The top line of Discover Financial is also expected to have benefited from improving non-interest income in the second quarter. Improved loan fee income, and higher net discount and interchange revenues, aided by a favorable sales mix, are likely to have contributed to the non-interest income growth of DFS.However, strong sales usually give rise to high reward costs, which is expected to have partially offset the company's non-interest income. Our estimate for second-quarter reward costs indicates almost 6% year-over-year growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the non-interest income of DFS is pegged at $674.1 million, indicating almost 10% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for non-interest income suggests around 15% rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.Increased debit transaction volume and growing travel and entertainment spending are expected to have driven PULSE and Diners Club volume, which is likely to have aided the performance of the Payment Services unit.However, the profits of Discover Financial are likely to have suffered a setback due to escalating costs. Also, the bottom line is expected to have been impaired by rising provisions for bad loans in the second quarter.Marketing costs and professional fees are likely to have witnessed increases as DFS has been investing in technology, and card and consumer banking products. Our estimate for employee compensation and benefits suggests 22.5% year-over-year growth. We expect total operating expenses for the second quarter to have jumped almost 15% year over year, leading to a noticeable decline in the bottom line, making an earnings beat uncertain.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Discover Financial this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of -1.46%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate currently stands at $3.64 per share, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.69.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Discover Financial currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Discover Financial, here are some companies from the broader finance space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:Corebridge Financial, Inc.

248,6d2b90f1-8bf5-3f5f-a630-262c5409af8d,MCD,2023-07-15,'Hot labor summer' meets actual heat wave: Los Angeles workers picket as temperatures soar,LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hot-labor-summer-meets-actual-004022398.html,1689381622,STORY,['MCD'],"[Los Angeles fast-food workers armed with umbrellas to shield themselves from the sun rallied on Thursday outside the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce. (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times)It is shaping up to be a ""hot labor summer"" — literally.As the region plunges into a record heat wave, Southern California workers across multiple industries are hitting steamy sidewalks and scorching asphalt to picket in front of iconic Los Angeles hotels, fast-food restaurants and major Hollywood studios — to name a few. It's sweat-inducing and so potentially dangerous that the Writers Guild of America canceled New York picketing during one of that region's hottest days last week.For fast-food workers, the broiling conditions are nothing new. Protesting outside during a heat wave is even a welcome break for some. Those in hot restaurant kitchen facilities without adequate air conditioning are among workers least protected by California's heat safety standards — with state regulators sluggish to create new regulations that keep pace with accelerating climate change.""You're joking right?"" said Maria Liehr, 58, a Del Taco supervisor, when asked if the heat wave was a concern.Church's Texas Chicken employee Rosaura Ramos had a similar reaction as she joined Liehr and about 100 other fast-food workers at a Thursday morning rally outside the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce in downtown Los Angeles.""We work in a very hot area,"" said Ramos, 47. ""We need to make more money.""Read more: Fast-food workers rally as California lawmakers hold controversial franchise liability billAt 11 a.m. Thursday it was already 86 degrees. By 3 p.m., when fast-food workers staged a second protest outside a McDonald's in East L.A., the temperature had climbed to 92 degrees.Workers in front of the McDonald's took shelter under black umbrellas stamped with “Fast food justice ahora!” Others sat using their hands to block the sun or scurried to the shade under the overhang of the McDonald's during lulls. A man began distributing water bottles to workers from the back of his truck.Story continuesOn Friday, as actors, writers and others took to the streets with picket signs, it was even hotter. Labor leaders have dubbed this a season of labor solidarity under the rallying cry, ""hot labor summer.""Striking Hollywood actors and screenwriters set up tents, layered in sweat-wicking clothing and donned sun visors. The heat did not seem to put a damper on turnout — bolstered by an influx of newly striking workers.WGA members have been on strike since May 2, and on Friday they were joined by members of actors union SAG-AFTRA on the initial day of that strike, marking a historic converging of labor actions by the two unions — the first in 63 years.Teri Fruichantie, a SAG-AFTRA member, took a break from picketing to have a beer, outside the Warner Bros. studio lot in Burbank on Friday. (Jay L. Clendenin / Los Angeles Times)Outside Fox Studios in Century City, a breeze blowing a cooling mist from a nearby fountain made the weather more bearable. Still, the unions are advising people to stay within their limits, said Jefferey Reeves, a SAG-AFTRA member.Reeves patrolled a crosswalk wearing a hat and sunglasses and said he has been mixing liquids and various electrolyte powders to create hydrating “concoctions.”“The heat has changed the game quite a bit,” Reeves said. “I don’t do well in the heat, as a rule. So I’ve been turned on by the writers to certain products that hydrate.""Although extreme weather is hard on those walking outdoor picket lines, the real concern for many workers is high temperatures on the job.Rajpal Singh, 40, has been baking in the high desert sun on a small picket line outside an Amazon facility in Palmdale. He's among about 80 unionized delivery drivers — represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters — that Amazon terminated in late June.Read more: What it's like working at Amazon during a Southern California heat waveSingh and other workers organized last year to demand better heat safety conditions when temperatures topped 100 degrees. In the backs of the cargo vans where delivery drivers rummage through packages on their delivery routes, temperatures might be 10 to 15 degrees higher.The Teamsters union reached an agreement last month with delivery giant UPS to install air conditioning systems in its brown delivery trucks. The tentative deal comes as the two parties continue to negotiate the terms of a new contract for more than 340,000 unionized employees and after reports of UPS workers facing extreme heat in their vehicles while on the job.Despite the union's win on that front, UPS delivery drivers are poised to join the ballooning ranks of striking Southern California workers if the union and the company don't reach a deal by July 31, the nationwide contract expiration date. The Teamsters union has been holding ""practice"" picket lines around the city in preparation.From 1992 to 2017, about 815 U.S. workers died of heat stress, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. More than 70,000 were injured.California was the first state to establish heat exposure standards for outdoor workers, after multiple farmworkers died from heat-related causes in 2005. The rules require employers to provide access to fresh water and shade, as well as training about heat illness prevention and planning.But the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health, or Cal/OSHA, has lagged on creating regulations for indoor workers despite a legal deadline to have an indoor heat standard in place by 2019. Temperatures at massive Inland Empire warehouses, many of which lack air conditioning, can climb above 90 degrees, making workers sick.The agency held a public hearing in May on proposed worker heat protections, but final action isn't expected for months — certainly not in time for other heat waves expected this season.Read more: 'All I can think about is the sun': How workers are coping with California's heat waveTV writer and producer Rachel Lewis on Friday helped direct Writers Guild of America strikers from the shade of a tent outside Amazon Studios in Culver City. As a strike captain, she's been stationed there for months.Lewis said she just bought shorts to wear even though she hates having her legs exposed, but she's resolved to do whatever it takes to make sure ""everybody is being safe"" during the heat wave and keep the picket line going.""Nothing will deter me from coming out to strike,“ Lewis said. ""We have extra sunscreen, we have extra water, we have extra ice. We have misters, and we’re just making sure as captains that people stay hydrated and take breaks and get shade.""The morning weather is more forgiving, but with picket lines going until 2 p.m., people on the later shifts start to suffer, said Peter Meech, a member of both SAG-AFTRA and WGA West.“I wouldn’t be surprised to see the hours curtailed,” Meech said. “It may be curtailed in terms of the distance people march and the times that people actually protest.”On Friday, Meech brought along Poppy the pug, his “strike animal,"" to the picket line at Fox Studios. Worried about the small black dog's safety, Meech sequestered himself on the sidelines, periodically waving his sign at passersby from his and Poppy's spot in the shade. A staff member brought Poppy a cup of water.“The heat is extraordinary, and if you have a strike animal ... you have to be doubly careful about it,” Meech said. “There are water stations along the picket route here, but it does make you think twice about how long you’ve been on strike.”This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

The industry faced unprecedented challenges and had to navigate through a rapidly evolving landscape. One of the most notable changes was the shift towards takeout and delivery services. Restaurants had to quickly adapt their business models to offer these options and leverage technology to facilitate online ordering and contactless transactions. The concept of online ordering in the restaurant sector has now persisted for a significant duration, becoming a permanent feature within the industry. Takeout continues to be popular despite a decrease from its peak during the first year of the pandemic. In 2022, 85% of orders at fast-food restaurants in the United States were for takeout, as reported by NPD Group. This percentage has dropped from the highest point of 90% in 2020 but remains higher than the pre-pandemic level of around 76%. The report also mentioned that around 33% of orders at full-service restaurants were for takeout last year, which is almost double the rate before the pandemic.The popularity of online and digital ordering is expected to keep increasing. Grand View Research reported that the global online food delivery market will reach a size of USD 505.50 billion by 2030, representing a (CAGR) of 10.3% from 2023 to 2030. The report further highlighted that this growth will be driven by the easy availability of smartphones as they make it convenient for users to browse restaurant options and place orders. With better connectivity and increased smartphone access, businesses can expand into new markets and attract more customers.While many industries were negatively affected by high inflation last year, the restaurant sector managed to maintain a stable position. The S&amp;P 500 Restaurant Sub Industry Index gained 24.5% in the past 12 months and its year-to-date returns came in at 12.5%. However, as concerns about inflation persist, major food companies and restaurant chains are making efforts to attract price-conscious consumers. According to a report by Wall Street Journal, in response to changing consumer behaviors in grocery shopping and dining out, companies like Yum! Brands Inc. (NYSE:YUM) and The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) are directing their focus toward value offerings. The report also mentioned that certain restaurant chains, such as McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) and Domino’s, have observed that lower-income consumers are adjusting their dining habits. These consumers are opting for smaller-sized meals at restaurants or reducing the frequency of their delivery orders, which often incur an additional fee.Story continuesAlso read: Top 10 Restaurant Stocks Under $1010 Best Restaurant Dividend Stocks to BuyPhoto by Rod Long on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds as of Q1 2023 and identified dividend companies that operate in the restaurant industry.

250,537e3bc8-0e18-39be-b759-917435246831,PLD,2023-07-15,Key Factors to Impact Prologis (PLD) This Earnings Season,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/key-factors-impact-prologis-pld-155400594.html,1689350040,STORY,['PLD'],"[Prologis PLD, the leading industrial REIT, is slated to report second-quarter 2023 earnings on Jul 18 before the bell. In anticipation of the announcement, industry analysts and investors are eager to assess the company's performance and prospects in the current economic climate.In the last reported quarter, this REIT delivered a surprise of 0.83% in terms of FFO per share. Results reflected solid demand for industrial real estate, leading to low vacancies and an increase in rents.Over the trailing four quarters, Prologis beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in terms of FFO per share on three occasions and missed the same on the other, the average beat being 1.50%. This is depicted in the graph below:Prologis, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePrologis, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePrologis, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Prologis, Inc. QuoteIn late June, Prologis announced an agreement to acquire close to 14 million square feet of industrial properties from opportunistic real estate funds affiliated with Blackstone in a cash-funded transaction valued at $3.1 billion.Let’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.US Industrial Real Estate Market in Q2Per a Cushman &amp; Wakefield CWK report, following two years of exceptional demand fueling cumulative rent growth of 30% or more, the industrial real estate sector is starting to normalize. Net absorption for the second quarter measuring 44.9 million square feet (msf) marks a drop from the heights of the previous year. However, it is still in line with the healthy pre-pandemic absorption levels.Leasing activity too mirrors this trend amid economic challenges. While the gross new leasing of 141.1 msf is down 8.9% from the first quarter, it is still in line with the quarterly average experienced from 2015 to 2019. The rise in vacant sublease space in certain markets has a moderating effect on overall absorption figures.The second quarter saw a swift influx of new industrial supply, with a staggering 139.5 msf of new developments reaching completion. Amid this, the national vacancy rate increased by 60 basis points to 4.1%, surpassing the 4% mark for the first time since mid-2021. Despite the rise, the vacancy rate remains well below the 10-year average, suggesting a resilient market.However, despite the softening market conditions, rents continued to rise. Second-quarter asking rental rates increased by 4.6% quarter over quarter, pushing the figure to $9.59 per square foot (psf). In many markets, the healthy delivery of Class A speculative logistics space at a premium price is exerting upward pressure on prices. However, amid the slowing demand, developers are dialing down, with the construction pipeline declining by 5.1% quarter over quarter.Story continuesFactors to NoteGiven Prologis’ capacity to offer high-quality facilities in key markets, it is well-poised to capitalize on the still healthy industrial real estate sector trends. Prologis is likely to have captured favorable fundamentals with its differentiated customer offerings and strategic investments in the to-be-reported quarter.Prologis’ expansion efforts through acquisitions and developments in recent years are likely to have boosted the top line in the to-be-reported quarter. In October 2022, Prologis closed the acquisition of Duke Realty in an all-stock transaction valued at $23 billion, thereby boosting its presence in the key markets. In addition, PLD is likely to have gained from its industry-leading cost structure.Moreover, Prologis has decent balance sheet strength to fuel its growth endeavors. A market leader, this industrial REIT has the ability to raise capital at favorable rates. It is likely to have maintained financial strength with liquidity during the period in discussion.Projections for Q2 2023The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $1.66 billion, suggesting a nearly 52.2% year-over-year jump.Our estimate for development management and other revenues is presently pegged at $4.2 million for the second quarter. Our estimate for second-quarter average occupancy is 97.5%, implying a 40-basis point decline from the prior quarter. Moreover, the same-store net operating income is expected to increase 8.9%.Prologis’ activities during the soon-to-be-reported quarter were not adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second-quarter FFO per share has been revised a cent downward to $1.67 in the past month. However, it suggests 50.4% growth year over year.Here Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model predicts a surprise in terms of FFO per share for Prologis this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is the case here.Prologis currently has a Zacks Rank of 3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.10%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are two other stocks from the broader REIT sector — Crown Castle Inc.

In this article we’ll delve deeper into the second-quarter performance in terms of demand, net absorption, leasing activity, vacancy rates and rents, and then further probe into the future outlook of this asset category.Finally, we will try to figure out how the four major Industrial REITs – Prologis PLD, Rexford Industrial Realty REXR, Americold Realty Trust COLD and EastGroup Properties EGP – are likely to have performed in the second quarter and what lies ahead for them.Industrial Real Estate Market Fundamentals in Q2Per a Cushman &amp; Wakefield CWK report, the industrial real estate sector is starting to normalize after two years of exceptional demand fueling a cumulative rent growth of 30% or more. Net absorption for the second quarter measuring 44.9 million square feet (msf) marks a decline from the heights of the previous year. However, it is still in line with the healthy pre-pandemic absorption levels.Leasing activity too mirrors this trend amid economic challenges. While gross new leasing of 141.1 msf is down 8.9% from the first quarter, it is still in line with the quarterly average experienced from 2015 to 2019. Moreover, the market is on track to surpass 500 msf for the eighth consecutive year. The rise in vacant sublease space in certain markets has had a moderating effect on the overall absorption figures.The second quarter saw a swift influx of new industrial supply, with a staggering 139.5 msf of new developments reaching completion. Amid this, the national vacancy rate increased 60 basis points to 4.1%, surpassing the 4% mark for the first time since mid-2021. Despite the rise, the vacancy rate remains well below the 10-year average, suggesting a resilient market.However, despite the softening market conditions, rents continued to rise. The second quarter asking rental rates increased 4.6% quarter over quarter, pushing the figure to $9.59 per square foot. In several markets, the healthy delivery of Class A speculative logistics space at a premium price is exerting upward pressure on prices.However, developers are dialing down amid the slowing demand, with the construction pipeline declining 5.1% quarter over quarter. Notably, the current speculative developments make up 83% of the pipeline, and only 19% of that space has been pre-leased by tenants.Story continuesWhat Lies Ahead?Per the CWK report, construction completions are likely to outstrip demand in the second half of 2023 and 2024, pushing the vacancy rate to more than 5% by 2024. However, compared to the 15-year historical average of 6.6%, vacancy will still be considered tight, favoring landlords.The report also expects absorption totals to hover marginally below pre-pandemic levels in 2023 and 2024 as softer demand for consumer goods merges with the challenges of high inflation and interest rates. Despite this, net absorption is expected to remain in the positive territory in both 2023 and 2024, indicating the enduring resilience of this sector amidst prevailing economic challenges.Moreover, going forward, rents are projected to trend higher, albeit at a slower pace. While annual growth is expected to decline and be within the 10-11% range in 2023 and slow further to 3-4% in 2024, rents are still expected to surpass the $10 mark for the first time ever in 2024.Stock DiscussionPrologis: Prologis is a global leader in logistics real estate, with a portfolio that spans 19 countries. While the company might face challenges amid slowing demand and rising vacancies, its sturdy portfolio indicates a promising mid to long-term performance. PLD is likely to show resilience in terms of rental growth and occupancy rates.Moreover, its strategic buyouts and solid balance sheet bode well. In October 2022, Prologis closed on the acquisition of Duke Realty in an all-stock transaction valued at $23 billion, thereby boosting its presence in the key markets. In late June, Prologis announced an agreement to acquire close to 14 million square feet of industrial properties from opportunistic real estate funds affiliated with Blackstone in a cash-funded transaction valued at $3.1 billion.PLD currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). It is scheduled to release its earnings on Jul 18 before market open. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PLD’s second-quarter 2023 funds from operations (FFO) per share of $1.67 indicates a whopping 50.4% increase from the year-ago reported number. For 2023, the consensus mark for the same is $5.48, suggesting a 6.2% increase year over year. For 2024, FFO per share is expected to rise 2.1%.Rexford Industrial Realty: REXR is focused on owning and operating industrial properties in Southern California, a region characterized by high demand and limited supply. REXR's strategic positioning in the supply-constrained Southern California, coupled with its focus on infill properties, could provide stability amidst the sector-wide cool-down. The region's potential for premium rents presents a promising outlook.REXR currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and is slated to release its earnings on Jul 19 after market close.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for REXR’s second-quarter 2023 FFO per share of 54 cents indicates a 10.2% increase year over year on a 27.6% projected increase in revenues. For 2023, the consensus mark for FFO per share is $2.19, which suggests an 11.7% increase year over year on a 21.8% rise in revenues. For 2024, FFO per share is projected to increase 15.4%.Americold Realty Trust: As the world's largest publicly traded REIT focused on temperature-controlled warehouses, COLD benefits from the rising demand for cold storage facilities. COLD, with its temperature-controlled warehouses, could fare well in the changing market conditions. The need for cold storage is unlikely to wane, which suggests a strong demand for its specialized real estate assets.COLD currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and is scheduled to release earnings on Aug 3 after market close.While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for COLD’s second-quarter 2023 FFO per share has moved marginally down in the past month to 24 cents, the same for the third and the full-year 2023 climbed north over the past month to 31 cents and $1.21, respectively. It has a long-term growth rate of 9.5%, which is ahead of the industry average of 6.7%.EastGroup Properties: EGP is a self-administered equity REIT focused on the development, acquisition and operation of industrial properties. EGP's focus on high-growth Sunbelt markets and diversified tenant base might alleviate the effects of the overall slowing demand.EGP currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and is scheduled to release earnings on Jul 25 after market close.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EGP’s second-quarter 2023 FFO per share has moved marginally north over the past two months to $1.88, implying a 9.3% increase year over year. For 2023, the consensus mark for the same has climbed marginally to $7.56, suggesting an 8% increase year over year. For 2024, FFO per share is projected to increase 6.5%.Here’s how PLD, REXR, COLD and EGP have performed over the past three months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchParting ThoughtsWhile the industrial real estate market cools offs, the underpinning fundamentals and continuing healthy demand paint a promising picture. Investors should remain optimistic about the resilience of this sector and consider the compelling opportunities offered by Industrial REITs like PLD, REXR, COLD, and EGP.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Currently, Paccar has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Fox Factory Holding has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that PCAR's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.PCAR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 10.95, while FOXF has a forward P/E of 21.48. We also note that PCAR has a PEG ratio of 1.09. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. FOXF currently has a PEG ratio of 1.97.Another notable valuation metric for PCAR is its P/B ratio of 3.23. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

It is worth considering T. Rowe Price (TROW), which belongs to the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry.When looking at the last two reports, this financial services firm has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 2.74%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, T. Rowe was expected to post earnings of $1.62 per share, but it reported $1.69 per share instead, representing a surprise of 4.32%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.72 per share, while it actually produced $1.74 per share, a surprise of 1.16%.For T. Rowe, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.T. Rowe currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.49%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on July 28, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

256,3996f117-d956-3765-8454-622c17597825,UPS,2023-07-15,"Should You Be Impressed By United Parcel Service, Inc.'s (NYSE:UPS) ROE?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/impressed-united-parcel-inc-nyse-110100119.html,1689418860,STORY,['UPS'],"[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for United Parcel Service How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for United Parcel Service is:54% = US$11b ÷ US$20b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.54 in profit.Does United Parcel Service Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, United Parcel Service has a better ROE than the average (15%) in the Logistics industry.roeThat's what we like to see. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCombining United Parcel Service's Debt And Its 54% Return On EquityUnited Parcel Service clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.09. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.Of course United Parcel Service may not be the best stock to buy.

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)UPS Inc. said Friday it has begun “business continuity” training to prepare nonunion employees to handle packages in the event a Teamsters union strike disrupts operations.“Over the coming weeks, many of our U.S. employees will participate in training that would help them safely serve our customers if there is a labor disruption. This “temporary plan’ has no effect on current operations,” UPS (NYSE: UPS) said.“While we have made great progress and are close to reaching an agreement, we have a responsibility as an essential service provider to take steps to help ensure we can deliver our customers’ packages if the Teamsters choose to strike.” The training is “aligned with our ongoing commitment to safety and business continuity,” the company said.UPS has been preparing contingencies for some time. As far back as last year, it directed managers not to schedule paid time off during July and August 2023, periods when they could be pressed into service to move parcels if there was a strike.As of the end of the first quarter, UPS moved about 18.6 million parcels each day in the U.S. It is estimated that management contingency efforts could move about 4 million of those parcels. The balance would be subject to possible diversion to competitors.The two sides are 17 days shy of the July 31 date when the current five-year contract expires. The Teamsters have warned they will strike Aug. 1 if a contract isn’t agreed to and ratified by the 340,000 rank-and-file members.Talks stalled out on July 5, reportedly over how much UPS part-timers, who make up at least half of the unionized workforce, should be paid both in starting wages and wages for those established on the job. It was reported that Teamsters General President Sean O’Brien said the two sides are $6 to $7 an hour apart in their proposals.No new talks are scheduled.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 21, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis credit card issuer and global payments company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.80 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +9%.Revenues are expected to be $15.38 billion, up 14.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.38% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for American Express?For American Express, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.46%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that American Express will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that American Express would post earnings of $2.64 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.40, delivering a surprise of -9.09%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.American Express appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry, Blackstone Inc. (BX) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.92 per share for the quarter ended June 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -38.3%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $2.37 billion, down 42.9% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Blackstone Inc. has been revised 4% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.65%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Blackstone Inc. will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.

The aforementioned work procedures will be undertaken along the environmentally sensitive Denali Park Road, initiating access to the site.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of GVA have gained 44.4% in the past year, compared with the Zacks Building Products - Heavy Construction industry’s 53% growth. Although the shares of the company have underperformed its industry, the consistent award wins will enable GVA to gain momentum in the upcoming period.Polychrome Area Improvements ContractOn Feb 15, 2023, Granite was selected as the Construction Manager or General Contractor (CM/GC) by the FHWA for the Polychrome Area Improvements project. The preconstruction of this project was initiated in January 2023 and is now expected be complete by July 2026. This project win is a boost in GVA’s Mountain group pipeline under the Construction segment.The entire project is divided into three main portions. Option W is for long-lead materials procurements made as the design progressed, Option X is for earthwork and staging, and Option Y is for bridge construction. Following the Option X portion win, the total value of awarded options stands at $67 million since its preconstruction. The total value of the entire project ranges within $100 million.As a CM or GC, Granite will engage early in the design process for constructability input which will give the company more opportunity for innovation and efficiency compared to traditional delivery methods. The CM/GC project delivery method will promote collaboration and solicit value-adding feedback from the contractor.Story continuesRobust CAP GrowthThe Construction segment and the performance of the Granite’s operating segments showcased strong market growth in first-quarter fiscal 2023, with Committed and Awarded Projects (CAP) reaching $5.1 billion. The upside was driven by the momentum in the most recent quarters, reflecting strategic expansion. Despite unfavorable weather conditions, the company's strategic approach of selective bidding resulted in increased margins and a higher number of projects won in the quarter.Precisely, the Mountain Group reported CAP of $364 million in first-quarter fiscal 2023, up 34% from the previous quarter’s levels and a remarkable 40% increase since the first quarter of 2022. The Alaska region played a key role in this growth, with a notable increase of $215 million, which was primarily driven by the successful booking of two best-value projects during the quarter. This group was reported as the largest group by revenue in 2022.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksGranite currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the Construction sector are Eagle Materials Inc.

More than two years after the COVID-19 pandemic began, the diagnoses of prostate and breast cancer continue to lag pre-pandemic levels (as quoted in the recent Quest Diagnostics Health Trends Study). This indicates that presently more people are living with undiagnosed cancers, than before the pandemic.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDespite prostate cancer being one of the most common cancers globally, existing testing methods, in particular for early, lower-grade stages, have limited accuracy across pathologists.News in DetailQuest developed and validated the laboratory test under an intellectual property license agreement with Envision, to use its proprietary biomarker and immunohistochemistry technology. This includes Envision's unique staining technology and novel biomarkers (named EV1, EV2 and EV3).Per a representative at DGX, the collaboration with Envision will expand access to this innovative technology. Quest’s national scale and industry-leading prostate cancer portfolio fortify the company’s efforts to reach a larger number of patients and provide them with diagnostic insights to inform their treatment decisions.Barring New York, physicians in the United States may order the test with immediate effect.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsThe global prostate cancer therapeutics market was valued at $12.12 billion in 2022 and is expected to witness a CAGR of 8.4% by 2030.Recent DevelopmentsEarlier this month, DGX launched its first consumer-initiated genetic test, Genetic Insights, which is exclusively available through the company's consumer health business at questhealth.com.

In addition, income stocks have been significant long-term outperformers, when compared to stocks that don’t offer dividends.In 2023, Buffett and his team should oversee the collection of around $6 billion in dividend income — and nearly half of this dividend income, $2.75 billion, will come from just three stocks, according to The Motley Fool.“Buffett (through Berkshire Hathaway) has always shown a proclivity toward dividend-paying stocks,” said Peter C. Earle, economist, American Institute for Economic Research. “But that preference has paid ‘dividends’ of its own more recently. Dividend-paying stocks often do well in inflationary environments; they offset the loss of purchasing power from inflation and thus serve as a sort of hedge when the price level is rising.”Earle added that Buffett’s three major dividend-paying stocks have definitive advantages in the current economic environment.AppleAccording to David Kass, clinical professor of finance at University of Maryland, Robert H. Smith School of Business, the outlook for Apple for the rest of the year is very bright.“Apple, Berkshire’s largest equity holding, representing about 50% of its $300+ billion portfolio, has the largest U.S. stock market capitalization of about $3 trillion,” Kass said. “It is growing rapidly and enjoys an extremely loyal customer base within its ecosystem. In addition to its cash dividend, it is returning capital to shareholders through a very large share buyback program. Berkshire currently owns 5.6% of Apple. Warren Buffett is a big fan of Apple CEO, Tim Cook.”Story continuesCFRA Research has a Buy opinion on Apple, reflecting its “view of AAPL’s ecosystem, high customer retention rates, and expanding addressable market,” according to a July 8 analyst research note.The Motley Fool reports that despite Apple’s paltry 9.5% yield, since Buffett,  “has 47% of his company’s invested assets tied up in Apple, the nearly 915.6 million shares owned equates to almost $879 million in yearly dividend income.”Shares of Apple are up 52.3% year-to-date, as of July 14.Occidental PetroleumEarle explained that inflation tends to lift commodity prices faster and higher than that of most other goods, and as such, the revenue of energy firms tends to rise with those increases.“That usually results in more reliable dividend prospects than for the vast majority of other kinds of companies which face increasing expenses as commodity prices rise,” said Earle.Buffett has been steadily increasing his stake in the company and has now accumulated more than 224,000 shares, representing a 25% stake, according to CNBC‘s Berkshire Hathaway portfolio tracker.And according to Kass, this is the result of Berkshire CEO, Vicki Hollub, planning to use its free cash flow to pay down its debt and reduce its preferred stock, buy back its common shares, increase its cash dividends, and invest in projects where its return on capital exceeds its cost of capital.“With oil prices likely to be stable in the months ahead, the outlook for Occidental is very good,” said Kass.While Occidental Petroleum has just a 1.3% yield, these shares are earning Berkshire $161,373,018 in annual dividend income, according to The Motley Fool.CFRA Research has a Buy opinion on the company.“OXY’s hostile 2019 takeover of the former Anadarko remains a gamble that looks better today than it did a year ago, due to the recovery in energy prices, which has enabled OXY to largely restore its balance sheet, CFRA equity analyst Stewart Glickman, wrote in a note.Shares of the company are down 0.46% year-to-date.Bank of AmericaAccording to Kass, Bank of America, under CEO Brian Moynihan, is a very conservatively run bank and is Berkshire’s second largest equity holding, representing about 10% of its portfolio.“It recently announced a 9% increase in its quarterly cash dividend and is also buying back its shares. Its outlook is also very bright,” said Kass.He added that although Buffett likes to receive cash dividends, he does not like to pay them to his shareholders.“He prefers to re-invest the cash flow generated by Berkshire. Berkshire has not declared a dividend since 1967,” Kass said.CFRA Research has a Buy opinion on Bank of America saying the institution “is at the top of its game as a large U.S. bank.”“And we think lending and investment banking is positioned to benefit from a second half recovery in 2023. Nearly 90% of rate sensitivity to BAC loans is driven by short rates. What remains the wild card is whether loan activity will continue to grow at a decent pace,” CFRA equity analyst Angelo Zino wrote in a July 8 note.How To Buy ChatGPT Stock: Your 2023 Guide to AI InvestingBerkshire has 1.03 billion shares in the company- a 13% stake, according to CNBC’s portfolio tracker. In turn, this nets Buffett’s company close to $909 million in yearly dividend income, according to The Motley Fool.Shares of the company are down 11% year-to-date, as of July 14.More From GOBankingRatesI'm a Financial Advisor Who Knows What Retirees Actually Do With Their Savings (It Might Surprise You)Costco's 7 Best Premade Meals To Save You Money3 Ways to Recession Proof Your RetirementTake our poll: How will you achieve your financial goals?This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: $2.75 Billion From Just 3 Stocks: Warren Buffett’s Top Earners in 2023]"
269,391f9b9f-fb2d-3df8-b5b4-ad2757e51e8f,OXY,2023-07-15,Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/occidental-petroleum-corporation-oxy-attracting-130011134.html,1689339611,STORY,['OXY'],"[Occidental Petroleum (OXY) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this oil and gas exploration and production company have returned +5.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.4% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, to which Occidental belongs, has gained 6.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Occidental is expected to post earnings of $1.07 per share, indicating a change of -66.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.84 points to a change of -48.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.01 indicates a change of +24.2% from what Occidental is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Occidental.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Occidental, the consensus sales estimate of $7.28 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -32.2%. The $29.84 billion and $31.34 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -19.6% and +5.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOccidental reported revenues of $7.26 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -14.9%. EPS of $1.09 for the same period compares with $2.12 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.54 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -3.68%. The EPS surprise was -16.15%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Occidental is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Occidental. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B), Occidental Petroleum Corp. OXY, Oceaneering International, Inc. OII, Ecopetrol S.A. EC and Battalion Oil Corp. BATL.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:What Warren Buffett's Bet on OXY Signals for the Energy IndustryLate last month, legendary investor Warren Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway Inc. further boosted its stake in Occidental Petroleum Corp. amid its falling share prices. This is thereby widening Berkshire Hathaway's lead as the largest shareholder in Occidental.The bet on the oil and gas major signals a bullish outlook for the energy sector as a whole. Thus, energy players like Oceaneering International, Inc., Ecopetrol S.A. and Battalion Oil Corp. are well-poised to gain.Berkshire Hathaway Lifts OXY StakeBerkshire Hathaway recently announced in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it has increased its stake in Occidental to more than 25%. Berkshire Hathaway bought 2.14 million more Occidental shares for $122.1 million. This makes the Omaha, NE-headquartered holding company's total ownership of the oil and gas player 224.13 million shares.The recent investment signals the willingness of the holding company to explore new investment opportunities and pour money into a company that is highly exposed to volatility in oil and gas prices. This reflects that Warren Buffett is probably bullish on oil prices since the fate of the energy player is mostly dependent on crude prices.Oil Price to Remain FavorableThe U.S. Energy Information Administration (""EIA"") has also expressed bullishness on oil prices in its short-term energy outlook. Currently, West Texas Intermediate (""WTI"") oil and Brent crude are trading at more than $75 per barrel and $80 per barrel marks, respectively. The pricing environment will remain favorable, as echoed in EIA's healthy projection of $74.43 per barrel and $79.34 per barrel for WTI and Brent oil for this year.Story continuesThe expectation is handsome, despite lower year-over-year prices since the projected commodity prices will still be promising for exploration and production activities. EIA, in its short-term energy outlook, added that anticipation of declining oil inventories, across the globe, over the next five quarters will create upward pressure on oil prices.3 Stocks to BuyGiven the backdrop, it can be concluded that investors should allocate money to stocks of the companies whose operations are directly correlated with oil prices and are capable of capitalizing on the favorable business landscape. Employing our proprietary stock screener, we have zeroed in on three stocks sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Oceaneering International is well placed on improving oil prices since it is a leading provider of engineered services and products and robotic solutions to the energy companies working offshore. Higher oil price is supporting increased upstream activities, which, in turn, will improve demand for Oceaneering's drilling and completions support services.Ecopetrol is a well-known integrated energy player in the American continent, with the Permian – the most prolific basin in the United States – being a prominent growth driver. Ecopetrol is responsible for as high as 60% of hydrocarbon production in Colombia and thus is well-positioned to derive more cashflows from improving oil prices.Battalion Oil is also a highly prospective stock to gain on healthy oil prices since it is engaged in exploring, producing and developing liquid-rich resources in the prolific Delaware Basin. Battalion Oil is a pure-play Delaware operator with a deep inventory of high-return locations, securing a solid production outlook.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

The operating margin of 6.6% deteriorated 70 bps year over year.The Optum segment benefited on the back of solid performance of its sub-units Optum Health, Optum Insight and Optum Rx. Optum Health was aided by catering to an expanding customer base under value-based care arrangements and consistent expansion of care services. While the addition of Change Healthcare provided an impetus to Optum Insight revenues, Optum Rx gained on significant growth in its home delivery, specialty, infusion and community-based pharmacy offerings.The Uptick in Membership EnrollmentAs of Jun 30, 2023, the UnitedHealthcare segment catered to 52.8 million people, which rose 3.1% year over year on the back of higher number of people served with commercial and public sector program offerings.

Also, lower revenues were generated from Inogen’s direct-to-consumer channel despite continued productivity gains. However, this performance was partially offset by growth in rental revenues, thus reflecting the company’s strategic focus on U.S. prescribers.Quarterly Performance So FarIn first-quarter 2023, Inogen registered a solid year-over-year uptick in rental revenues and domestic business-to-business sales. Per management, rental revenues are also expected to be strong in the second quarter. In first-quarter 2023, management confirmed that Inogen had increased its total covered lives to approximately 160 million, with the additions of two large private healthcare payers supporting its prescriber channel and overall rental strategy. This is likely to be another contributor to Inogen’s rental revenues in the second quarter. This raises our optimism.However, management’s expectations of lower revenues from Inogen’s U.S. and International business-to-business channels and direct-to-consumer channels raise our apprehensions about the stock.Price PerformanceShares of the company have lost 7.5% between Apr 1, 2023 and Jun 30, 2023 against the industry’s 6.7% rise and the S&amp;P 500’s 8.7% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Inogen carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Story continuesSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX, popularly known as BD, HealthEquity, Inc.

We'll also discuss the continuously deteriorating air and environmental quality. If you want to skip the details, read 10 Cleanest Countries In The World In 2023. Grading the 25 cleanest countries in the world in 2023 is a subjective topic that requires a deep dive into their environment-related efforts. For instance, the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) offers a broad measure of environmental health and ecosystem vitality, ranking countries based on factors such as air and water quality, biodiversity, and climate and energy policies. The EPI, as of 2022, identified Denmark, Luxembourg, and Switzerland as the leading cleanest countries in the world.But these rankings might vary if we look at more specific indicators. For example, according to IQAir World Report 2022, Iceland has the highest air quality score, closely followed by Australia and New Zealand. Contrarily, these countries' wastewater treatment efforts are ranked 25th, 10th, and 15th, respectively. Moreover, cultural norms and attitudes towards cleanliness, waste management, and littering impact a country's cleanliness. Therefore, assessing a country's cleanliness is a subjective and complex topic, heavily reliant on the specific dimensions evaluated.Sustainability-Focused Waste Management CompaniesForward-thinking waste management companies like Waste Management Inc (NYSE:WM), Waste Connections Inc (NYSE:WCN), and Republic Services Inc (NYSE:RSG) are continuously implementing efforts to make waste dumping sustainable. For instance, Waste Management Inc (NYSE:WM) has goals like greenhouse gas emissions reduction and responsible waste dumping. The company has started producing renewable fuels by capturing gases released from its landfills and converting it into low-carbon fuel that supports a portion of its fleet. Waste Management Inc (NYSE:WM) has a current market cap of $68.484 billion and it is one of the largest waste management companies in the USA. Story continuesMoreover, Waste Connections Inc (NYSE:WCN), the third-largest solid waste management company in North America, that boasts a current market cap of $36.346 billion, increased the use of robotics in its recycling facility and consistently recycles 50% of its collected waste. Waste Connections Inc (NYSE:WCN) also processes 50% of its leachate on-site and has completed the construction of two new leachate plants in 2022 to meet its groundwater safety goals. Arizona-based Republic Services Inc (NYSE:RSG) is also focused on responsible environmental solutions for the residential sector. For instance, Republic Services Inc (NYSE:RSG) has recorded a 9% reduction in its operational greenhouse gas emissions since 2017 and aims to drop this level to 10% by 2025. The company is also close to opening the country's first fully integrated plastic recycling facility in Las Vegas, named Polymer Center, by the end of this year, that'll aim to produce 100 million pounds of recycled plastic annually. Waste management companies are now focusing on recycling and clean energy sources more than ever. If you wish to be a part of these progressive mitigation efforts, read 11 Best Waste Management Stocks to Buy Now, and add more weight to your investment strategy. Which Is The No 1 Cleanest Country In The World?As per our recent analysis of multifaceted environmental parameters, Luxembourg is the cleanest country in the world in 2023. The country has exhibited an exemplary approach towards waste management, boasting an impressive recycling rate. Coupled with legislation and progressive public attitudes, this has facilitated a highly effective waste disposal system and minimized the country's environmental contamination. The wastewater treatment facilities in Luxembourg also display advanced technical acuity, achieving near-perfect filtration rates and significantly reducing aquatic pollution. This treatment proficiency and a remarkable level of infrastructure investment contribute to the nation's place among the top 10 cleanest countries in the world in 2023.Which Is The Cleanest Country In Asia?Japan's concerted efforts towards ecological sustainability confidently assert the country's distinction of being the cleanest country in Asia. Japan's initiatives focused on environmental preservation, particularly its commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and developing renewable energy resources, have proven instrumental in setting new benchmarks for sustainable living. The country's environmentally-friendly policies are backed by robust infrastructure encouraging green practices and waste management.We have already covered 30 Least Polluted Countries in the World; give this detailed article a read to learn the planet's pollution dynamics. Which Is The Least Clean Country In The World?The Environmental Performance Index (EPI) 2022 report ranks India as the dirtiest country in the world, primarily due to its high population density, considerable vehicular congestion, and extensive biomass fuel usage. India's population growth, which is currently surpassing China, poses environmental challenges and calls for expansive mitigation efforts. For instance, urbanization and vehicular traffic explosion have badly impacted the country's air quality and propelled it to the bottom of the list. High emission levels from vehicles, combined with inadequate waste management, contribute to an alarming increase in air, water, and soil pollution. Additionally, India's reliance on biomass fuels, primarily in rural areas, further compounds the pollution problem. These fuels, including firewood, cow dung, and crop residues, emit substantial amounts of pollutants when burned. While India has tried to mitigate these issues, the magnitude of the challenges requires extensive environmental-friendly policies, justifying its ranking as the least clean country in the world per the EPI Report 2022.25 Cleanest Countries in the World in 202325 Cleanest Countries in the World in 2023Our Methodology To rank the 25 cleanest countries in the world in 2023, we relied on their air quality index, waste management system, and availability of wastewater treatment networks. To understand these crucial parameters, we referred to the Environmental Performance Index Report 2022 (collectively published by Yale and Columbia University), which analyzes 180 countries according to 40 environmental performance indicators. Our first step was to shortlist 25 countries with the best overall EPI score in 2022 (given that it is awarded based on extensive variables, these countries are doing well overall). Then, as solid waste management and wastewater treatment determine a country’s determination towards being ‘clean,’ we picked these two variables from the EPI Report and shortlisted 25 countries with the highest score in these categories. The report has awarded wastewater treatment scores to countries depending on what percentage of a nation’s wastewater undergoes at least some kind of treatment. For example, if a country’s whole population is connected to a sewerage system and all of the collected wastewater is treated, its score will be 100%. Similarly, the EPI Index measures a country’s waste management system according to its efforts to limit solid waste, recycling rates, and oceanic plastic pollution. So if a nation’s solid waste management score is 79%, it indicates its overall performance in these criteria collectively. For our 3rd key metric, i.e., air quality index, we referred to the IQAir World Air Quality Report 2022, which scores countries based on PM2.5 ranking. PM2.5 refers to atmospheric particulate matter (PM) with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers. So if a place’s air has particulate matter between 0-12 μg/m³ (micrograms per cubic meter), it is considered good. Likewise, AQI of 12.1-34.5 μg/m³ is moderate, while a μg/m³ score of 55.5-150.4 is unhealthy. In short, the lower the 2.5PM rating, the better a country’s air quality will be.After listing these three variables individually for the top 25 countries, we averaged their scores to get composite rankings to present a broader perspective of their cleanliness levels. Based on our findings, here are the 25 cleanest countries in the world in 2023: 25. Cyprus Composite Ranking: 25 Air Quality PM2.5 concentration (μg/m³): 15.6 Waste Management Score: 58.9%  Wastewater Treatment Score: 50%  Our list of cleanest countries in the world in 2023 starts with Cyprus, owing to its moderate wastewater treatment system and solid waste management efforts. Although the country's air quality index is 15.6 (PM2.5 μg/m³ being the best score), its moderate waste system is commendable. Also, stringent regulations on emissions combined with a transition towards renewable energy have significantly improved the country's air quality.24.

In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at DaVita HealthCare (DVA), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. DaVita HealthCare currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if DVA is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this kidney dialysis provider holds up.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor DVA, shares are up 3.4% over the past week while the Zacks Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare industry is down 2.56% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 6.15% compares favorably with the industry's 0.07% performance as well.Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of DaVita HealthCare have risen 24.23%, and are up 24.97% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 9.19% and 20.46%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to DVA's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. DVA is currently averaging 599,421 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with DVA.Over the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost DVA's consensus estimate, increasing from $6.50 to $6.70 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that DVA is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep DaVita HealthCare on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This company, which is in the Zacks Technology Services industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This manufacturer has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 8.50%.For the most recent quarter, Trane Technologies was expected to post earnings of $1.33 per share, but it reported $1.41 per share instead, representing a surprise of 6.02%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.64 per share, while it actually produced $1.82 per share, a surprise of 10.98%.For Trane Technologies, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Trane Technologies has an Earnings ESP of +1.20% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on August 2, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.Story continuesAndrew Philip WittyThank you, and good morning, and thank you all for joining us. As we discussed a number of weeks ago, during the quarter, we saw a somewhat higher than usual range of movement in certain areas of care activity. As you'd expect, this inevitably impacted some elements of our business, but we overcame these dynamics with strength in other areas. Our second quarter performance reflects the capabilities, agility and dedication of our people as they responded to the changes. As a team, we're confident in our ability to robustly grow in this fluid health care environment. Indeed, as I hope you saw in our release today, revenue growth in the quarter was strong and well balanced across our enterprise, increasing by more than $12 billion to nearly $93 billion. Let me provide a few highlights of our growth. First, the number of patients served by Optum Health under fully accountable value-based care arrangements grew by more than 900,000 over this time last year. Among the new patients we welcomed, a significant number have complex needs. These people have serious health challenges, limited economic resources and often living in communities where it can be difficult to access high-quality care. Our ability to support their needs is distinctive and a direct result of the investments we have made to provide coordinated and comprehensive medical, pharmacy and behavioral care, foundational capabilities that will help the patients we serve live healthier lives and drive growth far into the future. Optum Rx and Optum Insight revenue grew double digits on expanded capabilities and products that are generating new sales and opportunities. UnitedHealthcare's growth was strong and diversified as well. Today, we're serving nearly 1.6 million more people in our commercial and public sector program offerings than we did last year. This durable growth, driven by our colleagues relentless focus on quality and execution, enabled us to achieve second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $6.14 and and to strengthen our full year outlook to between $24.70 to $25 per share. We know there is great interest in understanding the recent care activity I just mentioned. So I'll give you an overview of how we're seeing care progress and how we're responding. I do want to underscore the most critical point first. Making high-quality care more affordable and accessible is at the core of our mission. Having more people obtaining the care they need is a positive trend for individuals and our health system and society. As we discussed several weeks ago, during the second quarter, we observed increased care patterns, notably in outpatient surgeries for seniors and especially with certain orthopedic procedures which may have been postponed. John will provide some additional detail on this later. As we look to 2024, we have developed compelling Medicare Advantage offerings. Our teams were of course thoughtful, both in our response to the CMS rate notice and in incorporating these care activity trends into our June benefit filings. Even in this challenging funding environment, we continue to prioritize the stability and affordability our members have come to rely on from UnitedHealthcare. We're confident that next year, we will once again grow at a pace exceeding that of the broader market. While at a much lesser impact than senior outpatient care, we also are seeing increased care activity in behavioral. Over the past few years, behavioral care patterns have been accelerating as people increasingly feel comfortable seeking services. Just since last year, the percentage of people who are accessing behavioral care has increased by double digits. From our perspective, it's an encouraging sign that more people are seeking help, yet the ongoing shortage of qualified care providers has caused significant access challenges. To address the issue, Optum Health has expanded its network by tens of thousands of care professionals this year, and we are developing our benefit offerings, assuming demand for behavioral care services will continue to rise. Optum Health's value-based care models are continuing to deliver especially strong and measurable results for people, today, serving more than 4 million patients and dozens of payers. Optum Health and the patients and payers it serves share a common desire to seek improved health outcomes and experiences while ultimately lowering the cost of care. And we're pleased to see more evidence supporting the efficacy of value-based care. Last month, researchers at Yale Medicine, working in collaboration with Optum, published a peer-reviewed study about in-home visits, an important element in our value-based care approach. The study found patients who received our in-home preventative wellness assessments compared with those who hadn't made fewer emergency department visits and spent fewer nights in hospitals across 4 common conditions: depression, hypertension, coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes. They also experienced reduced wait times for follow-up primary care. Yale Medicine's research follows another peer-reviewed study published in [Journal] in December, which found Medicare Advantage patients in Optum's fully accountable care model showed significantly better health outcomes compared to people in Medicare fee-for-service. OptumHealth patients fared better on each of 8 key metrics, including hospital readmissions and emergency department visits. We see these results as compelling validation of the value-based care approach and signal more strongly its promise and potential as we expand these care models to many millions more patients in the years ahead. I'll now turn it over to UnitedHealth Group President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon, to elaborate on how we're focusing on affordability, transparency and simplicity for the people we serve. Dirk?Dirk C. McMahonThanks, Andrew. Making high-quality care more affordable and more accessible is what we do. So it is really great to see people getting the care they need, especially as our teams are working to build more capacity and our benefit networks and care delivery resources to accommodate consumers' evolving needs. Affordability is vital. For far too many people, cost remains the most significant barrier to high-quality care. We are leaning in hard on behalf of consumers, employers and health plans to lower out-of-pocket costs and drive greater affordability throughout the system. As you heard from Andrew, recently we've seen an uptick in outpatient surgeries. Finding the most appropriate site of service is crucial because the cost of those procedures can differ dramatically depending upon where they are performed. Overall, evidence shows that comparable procedures performed in ambulatory surgery centers cost about half as much as traditional settings with comparable outcomes. For consumers, that translates into many hundreds of dollars in out-of-pocket cost savings for just a single procedure. And the patient satisfaction levels at our centers are among the highest in health care with NPS approaching 90%. Also high on our affordability agenda is continuing to lower the cost of prescription drugs. Our customers, including employers, unions, health plans and governments, count on us to help them access the most effective medicines at the lowest possible cost. In fact, pharmacy benefit managers like ours are the only link in the drug supply chain, whose main purpose is to improve affordability for everyone. We go further by recommending benefit designs and providing tools to help consumers navigate their options and find the best value for their prescriptions. A recently launched feature called Price Edge, which provides the lowest cost option for a patient's medication, already has delivered millions of dollars in consumer out-of-pocket savings. Specialty drug costs continue to be a focus of every customer Optum Rx works with. Our differentiated approach to specialty is designed to serve the unique needs of patients, payers, providers and pharma partners and has allowed us to greatly expand our access to limited distribution drugs. We work to tailor our programs with individualized, single point of contact care for rare disease and clinical excellence programs for conditions such as MS, autoimmune diseases and cancer. Clients working with Optum Rx to implement all our specialty medication management programs can save up to 20% on their specialty drug costs. Mostly related to specialty, biosimilars are another area where we are helping drive affordability in consumer choice. Earlier this year, we began offering AMGEVITA, a biosimilar to HUMIRA at parity, ensuring patients and their doctors have more options to choose from when deciding on a course of care. Recently, Optum Rx and UnitedHealthcare announced the addition of 2 new HUMIRA biosimilars: Cyltezo and Hyrimoz to our standard prescription drug list also at parity. This increased competition for the innovator drug will result in double-digit savings for our customers. You might also recall that a year ago, we announced our initiative to offer life-saving drugs at no cost to our customers. This benefit is available to everyone in UnitedHealthcare's Group fully insured commercial plans and has been adopted by more than 500 of our self-funded customers, increasing adherence and saving people millions of dollars. Finally, another important customer innovation that is making the health system simpler is Optum Financial's integrated card, which enables seamless access to benefits, programs and rewards for more than 13 million consumers who have issued the card since we broadly rolled it out at the start of the year. Adoption and satisfaction levels have been very strong, making it much simpler for seniors to navigate the system and understand their benefits and creating a more satisfying consumer experience. These and many other results are validating our strategic approach to health care. I know from my many meetings with customers that these affordability, transparency and simplicity initiatives are resonating. They are a key reason for our continued growth in a highly competitive environment and for our confidence in maintaining our momentum as we look ahead. With that, let me hand it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.John F. RexThank you, Dirk. Adaptability and delivering greater value for the people we serve continue as foundational elements for our enterprise. These last few months are a good example, identifying evolving market trends, moving quickly to help people get the care they need, incorporating our broad and multifaceted insights into planning and, importantly, delivering on our commitments to you, our shareholders. These traits underpin our confidence not only in achieving our goals for '23, but also as we look toward '24 and beyond. Before reviewing our business results, let me elaborate on the care patterns Andrew described earlier. To illustrate, in the second quarter, outpatient care activity among seniors was a few hundred basis points above our expectations. As we've highlighted, specific orthopedic and cardiac procedures had increased far above that level of variation. And as we developed and filed our 2024 Medicare Advantage offerings, we assume that these levels of heightened care activity will persist throughout next year. Overall care activity among our Medicaid and commercial populations is consistent with our expectations. As always, we continue to intensely analyze trends that may indicate more severe disease progression, which could point to rising acuity. For example, in areas such as cancer, cardiovascular disease. We see no such evidence while continuing to monitor closely. With that, let's turn to our second quarter results. Revenue of $92.9 billion grew by nearly $12.6 billion or 16% over the prior year with double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Optum Health revenues grew by 36% to $23.9 billion, driven by an increase in the number of patients served, a growing mix of patients with more complex needs and the expanding scope of care services we can offer. Operating margins reflect the higher care activity patterns we have discussed with seniors comprising a significant majority of value-based patients served. Optum Rx revenues grew by 15%, surpassing $28 billion, driven by continued new customer wins and strong double-digit growth across specialty, infusion and community pharmacies. [Strip] growth of nearly 7% reflects continued demand for our affordable solutions that gives customers choice and simplify the pharmacy experience, such as biosimilar access and digital pharmacy tools. Partway into the '24 selling season, this momentum continues with strong client additions. Optum Insight revenues grew 42% to nearly $4.7 billion. The revenue backlog reached over $31 billion, an increase of $8 billion over last year, in part due to the addition of Change Healthcare. The integration and investment activities discussed on previous calls have gone well and are setting the stage for the next phase of growth for Optum Insight. Turning to UnitedHealthcare. Our commercial business added nearly 500,000 people in the first half and continues its growth with the '24 selling season indications tracking favorably. Within our public sector programs, we continue to expect growth of over 900,000 Medicare Advantage members this year. And our Medicaid performance remains strong as we continue to support states as they initiate redeterminations. Comprehensive outreach efforts to help individuals retain coverage are underway, though it is still early as most states began this work only recently. Our capital capacities are strong, Adjusted cash flows from operations were at $10.4 billion or nearly 2x net income in the second quarter and $15.6 billion or nearly [1.4x] net income in the first half. In the first 6 months of this year, we returned $8.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And in June, our Board of Directors increased the dividend by 14%. As Andrew mentioned, based upon our growth outlook and the trends discussed, today we were able to strengthen and narrow our full year '23 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $24.70 to $25 per share. Within this, we expect a relatively balanced pacing in the second half. Now I'll turn it back to Andrew.Andrew Philip WittyJohn, thank you. Overall for UnitedHealth Group, looking to the second half of the year and into 2024 and beyond, we're confident that we're capturing the current landscape in our planning decisions which, in turn, gives us confidence in our ability to sustain the growth momentum shown in our first half and continue to demonstrate the adaptability, performance and mission-driven purpose of this enterprise, especially in evolving environments. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.Albert J. William RiceMaybe -- I appreciate the comments about what you're seeing in the care demand. Maybe on the Optum Health side, you guys, obviously top line continues to be very strong there. There's a little bit of margin degradation from first quarter to second quarter. How much of that relates to what you're describing around senior utilization? I know you've got a capitated component and you've got a fee-for-service component. But I think last quarter, you also said that the growth in membership would be something that would pressure margins short term but obviously be a long-term positive. And then there's a lot of other things in Optum Health. Are they helping or hurting margin? Give us a little bit of flavor for what's happening underneath the aggregate number.Andrew Philip WittyA.J., thanks so much for the question. So first off, let me start off. I'm super pleased with the performance of Optum Health overall. And when you look at the growth of that business and particularly the expansion of the number of patients who are now looking after in value-based arrangements now about 4 million folks, not just from UHC, but of course, from many other payers as well, really strong validation of the model that we've been building, and you can continue to see us extend that. In terms of the margin compression during the Q, really, I'd say there are a couple of dynamics to that. One is trend. And you very much echo in the senior trend comments you've heard us make earlier in the quarter and I think is well understood. A second element of that, which specifically affects Optum Health, is the behavioral growth. And I mentioned that in my prepared comments, A.J., around continued strong growth in behavioral. That certainly has played its part within Q2 for Optum Health. And then the third area is a kind of a good news story, but with short-term implications. So that's really the growth of the membership that's coming this year. As you know, we've grown very strongly this year, actually a little ahead of our expectations. We've also brought in a very significant number of complex patients. As we invest in helping those folks manage their care better, that puts a little pressure on the margin in the short run. But that's really laying super strong foundation stones, not just for as we move through the year but into '24, '25, '26. So those 3 elements, the senior trend piece, the behavioral piece and then the effect of the strong growth is really what explains what goes on. We're going to continue to lean into that growth very assertively. A.J., thanks so much.OperatorWe'll go next to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.Lisa Christine GillI just want to understand, when I think about the guide to the upper end for the full year MLR, how much of that is driven by this MA outpatient trend versus behavioral? And when I think about behavioral utilization, is that being driven by a particular population? Or is it more broad-based? And how do I think about behavioral as a percentage of your cost?Andrew Philip WittyLisa, thanks so very much for that. Let me ask John to just context for you a little bit the balance between the senior and behavioral and then maybe ask Dr. Decker to just give you a little bit of commentary around the type of consultation that we're dealing with in terms of the growth.John F. RexLisa, it's John. So in terms of your question, the majority of the guide to the upper end of the full year is driven by what we've described in terms of the activity, the care activity we're seeing among seniors in outpatient. So that's a core there. In terms of behavioral, what we've noticed in behavioral is an increase in the number of people accessing care. Andrew had this in his comments, but a very, very significant increase, even just since a year ago in terms of the number of people that are looking to access care. It's a great thing. We are planning on that continuing. We don't see why that trend slows down. So we're designing our benefits for that to continue. As you recall, I know, Lisa, behavior resides within Optum Health. And so that's kind of an impact that we'd see in that component. And Wyatt, maybe some other commentary?Wyatt W. DeckerYes, absolutely. Thank you, Lisa. So you asked about the types of consultations and care being provided within behavioral. And we're seeing across the board increasing utilization. But what's encouraging from a public health perspective is it isn't strictly young people. It's across the board. We're seeing 30-, 40-, 50-year-olds accessing behavioral health care for needed care for conditions like anxiety, depression, substance use disorder. And our commitment is to make sure that they have access to that care. So as you heard from Andrew earlier, we've expanded our behavioral health care network. And we also, a couple of years ago, very thoughtfully launched a behavioral care provider services. And we now have ambulatory services available in 37 states, and we have self-paced modules for things like anxiety and depression and we add a therapist as appropriate. So you'll see us continuing to make sure our members have access as well as providing innovative, scalable solutions for behavioral health care needs across the age spectrum.Andrew Philip WittyYes. Wyatt, thank you so much. So Lisa, I think you've got it there. Overall, it's very much around the senior trend phenomena. Within Optum Health, the behavioral piece plays its part. We see that very much as an area where we will continue to step up and make sure that we're delivering the care in the way that Wyatt just described to you.OperatorWe'll go next to Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.Nathan Allen RichJohn, you mentioned the balance piecing of EPS in the back half of the year between 3Q and 4Q. Could you talk about your expectations for MCR, specifically between the 2 quarters? And how are you thinking about the trend of care activity as we head into the back half of the year given what you're seeing with respect to demand as well as some of the supply bottlenecks that [to care] being delivered maybe being removed? And do those factors differ significantly between Medicare and the commercial or Medicaid lines of business?John F. RexNate, thanks for the question. Yes, in terms of the balance pacing, the way I describe that is -- and MCR and how that feeds in, we'd expect the MCR to be a little bit lower in the 3Q than we saw in the 2Q, some of that seasonality, as you would fully expect. So within the contexting of balance, expect earnings to be a little bit higher marginally in 3Q than 4Q because of that typical factor in there, and thinking of an MCR somewhere in the zone of between kind of what we saw in the 1Q and 2Q just by seasonality factor. Important in that is we expect the kind of general pacing of care activity to remain consistent. That's what we've actually been seeing here. So since we've talked about this and as we've looked at the level of care activity across the company, these elements we talked about in terms of senior outpatient care are really remaining stable at the levels we talk to. And our expectation is it continues in that level. So as you look out to the second half of this year, our expectation, it continues at those levels that we've been seeing with the -- I mentioned a few hundred basis points above our expectations in the senior business, that continues. The only underlying factor is a little bit of seasonality that you would see occurring there.OperatorWe'll go next to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. .Justin LakeMy question is on commercial trend. You mentioned it's in line with expectations. I wanted to delve a little bit deeper. I think you might have said previously that you'd priced for commercial trend to be all normal this year, so some conservatism. So does that mean that it's running above normal but in line with your pricing at this point? If it's above normal, can you tell us how Q2 emerged versus Q4, Q1, meaning that an uptick versus -- in 2Q versus 1Q or 4Q? And then just lastly, any insight on the commercial components, is outpatient of pressure here as well?Andrew Philip WittyJustin, thanks so much for the question. I mean, so really not much to see here in all honesty, first off. Where we came into the year, we -- as you alluded to, we priced for some anticipation of unit cost inflation. We've seen some of that come through. Within that, everything is tracking very much within our expectations. So we set the year anticipating a little bit of price/cost growth, if you will. But beyond that, really nothing to note and we feel good about where we sit here.OperatorWe'll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research.Joshua Richard RaskinDo you think any of the increased utilization you're seeing on the MA side was self-inflicted in the sense that you've really augmented benefits dramatically in the last year -- really last 2 years, and perhaps that's encouraged or even catalyzed sort of an overutilization of trends relative to historical patterns and expectations? And then how did you address the utilization trends in your benefit designs for '24? I know there's sensitivity about saying something on a public call, but maybe just broad changes that you'd expected?Andrew Philip WittyJosh, thanks so much for the question. I'm going to ask Tim Noel to give you a little bit more commentary. But I think bottom line, I don't really think the benefits are driving this. I think this is -- when you look at the concentration of what we're seeing in terms of the outpatients, the orthopedics, in particular, those sorts of areas, it looks very much more like a kind of deferment of care. Super interesting when you look at maybe what's changed a little bit within that. We've seen a shift in the fraction of people who, once they have been essentially recommended for surgery, actually go through and complete the procedure. Arguably, what might drive that change is, one, more supply. So actually, it's more possible to go get it done; but two, maybe a little less reticent from an individual to go into a facility in a post-COVID environment versus a COVID environment. That feels like the thing that's shifted. And maybe ask Tim to just add a little bit to that as well, Tim.Timothy John NoelYes. Thanks, Josh. Consistent with what Andrew said, when we look at potential drivers everything from acuity to benefits added to mix of membership. Everything is really tracking very normally and in line with what we would expect. So nothing to call out there, but certainly something that we look at closely and carefully each and every year, and this year being no different. With respect to your question regarding benefits, so I think one thing to keep in mind is that the more important driver to our benefit decisions this year were the changes to the risk model. Certainly, we've been talking a lot about care patterns, but that has far less of an impact on the benefits filed and is really one of many assumptions that we make inside of our bids. But we feel very confident in our ability to provide stability to the benefits that seniors value most, things like zero co-pays for primary care visits, zero co-pays for Tier 1 drugs. Keeping zero monthly planned premiums where we had them in the past and keeping level out of pocket maximums are very important things for benefits for stability.And we are able to preserve those, so we're really happy about that. So on balance, combined with the great momentum we see in our value proposition, the great partnerships we have and confidence from the broker community, we feel really good about the benefits we filed. And also, as we talked about in our opening remarks, really confident in seeing that momentum pull through into some great growth results next year.OperatorWe'll go next to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein.Lance Arthur WilkesA question on the commercial side of the business. Can you talk a little bit about membership and in the fee-based business being down? And also maybe related to that and your outlook going forward, in Medicaid redetermination, are you seeing any trends with respect to recapture of those sorts of members? Or anything that's driving the opportunity for either growth in membership or maybe you're seeing any account attrition due to weakness in the economy?Andrew Philip WittyLance, thanks so much for the question. Before I hand it to [Dan Kite], who looks after our E&amp;I business, I just want to make a couple of kind of high-level comments. We're seeing overall a very strong performance from our commercial business this year and also setting up, it feels like very well for the '24 season. We've seen fantastic overall growth, as I mentioned, in terms of membership. And that's been led very much by a lot of the product innovation that the team have been putting together and into the marketplace. And we see that continuing pretty assertively as we roll into '24. Just with that kind of backdrop, maybe, Dan, if you could respond to Lance's specific questions, that would be great.Unidentified Company RepresentativeYes, Lance, thanks for the question. Growth is on track for the full year. And what you see in Q2 really is represented by the contraction of 1 large customer in our fee-based business. Your question about attrition and redeterminations, the outcome of those, which will be some puts and takes, will probably determine where within our range we will fall. But the punch line is, we're on track to hit our range for this year. Good question, Lance.Andrew Philip WittyThanks, Dan. Thanks so much, Lance, for the -- and just to be super clear as well that client loss that Dan just referred to, we knew about that about a year ago, but with our expectations, forecast plan. It was something we were anticipating and makes no impact at all to our full year expectation. But thanks so much for the question.OperatorWe'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. .Kevin Mark FischbeckI just want to follow up on the Optum Health because the margin there was obviously pressured in the quarter. And I just want to understand how the margin normalization should we think about that over the next couple of years. I mean, you can -- on the MA side, you can reprice for things. It sounds like you saw it in time for your bids and costs have come in line with the way that you price. Maybe just confirm that piece first. But then since within Optum Health, you're also relying on other providers and how they price for 2024, how are you thinking about the market? If you're below target this year? Is this something you can get back to next year or just a multiyear thing depending on how others price? Or the leverage within your control? Or is this kind of a longer-term normalization?Andrew Philip WittyKevin, thanks so much for the question. So first off, as I mentioned earlier, the pressure is really coming from those 3 sources, the senior trend phenomenon that we a lot about, the very specific Optum piece around behavioral and then the growth in the book. And within that, very much a complex care patient, which, as I'm going to repeat again, is an extremely positive element of our growth going forward. That's going to be an extraordinarily important foundation stone for the future of the company. We're going to continue to lean into that growth, first and foremost. We do expect to see margins continue to strengthen, particularly as you roll through into '24. You're absolutely right. We believe we've caught this in our pricing for next year. But more importantly, the longer time we have to look after folks and wrap around care, we can deliver much better outcomes for them, as we talked about earlier. and we can also make the economic proposition better. It really builds much more sustainable capability. So all of that will kick in as well as we roll through subsequent quarters and years. This is going to be a continuing building pressure. I feel very good about that range we've laid out for Optum Health over the next several years. And actually, I think if I had the choice on a slightly suppressed margin in Q2 or the very significant growth that we've taken in, I'll take the growth all day long. And I'll take that growth because it's going to underpin years of growth going forward. Appreciate the question, Kevin.OperatorWe'll go next to Gary Taylor with Cowen.Gary Paul TaylorI just want to talk about some of the -- or ask about some of the levers and offset because it is a little counterintuitive to hear the commentary intra-quarter about higher MLR and then seeing your largest profit segment, Optum Health, with lower margin. So this quarter, obviously, investment income was far stronger The Street was looking for, at least versus our model G&amp;A, was better. But I know moving into the back half, I think you believe there's more time potentially to pull some of those G&amp;A levers. So could you just talk about investment income G&amp;A or what other offsets there might be in the back half? And how much of that is carrying forward into your '24 thinking at this point?Andrew Philip WittyYes. Very much appreciate the question. Let me ask John to make some comments to that. John?John F. RexGary, it's John. So yes, you're right. The investment income has frankly, been growing strongly over the past number of quarters and continues to grow. Some of that is the backdrop of the rising interest rate environment, as you know, very well. Some of that is also a result of very active management by our treasury teams in terms of deploying more and more cash balances into interest-bearing accounts and such as they've been working hard at that over the past few quarters and advancing the productivity of that cash. That's after coming off of a period of many years of a zero interest rate environment. So a lot of elements in that. In any given quarter, we can experience some gains from our -- in our investment portfolio. So that can be gained from -- anything from our regular fixed income investments to anything from our diverse venture holdings. And so those come in -- they come in at different points in time. And perhaps sometimes they're a little bit less predictable, but kind of are typically in a similar zone frankly, not outside. I don't expect those kind of things -- I don't count on those kind of things. frankly, every quarter. That's not the thing we look at. But there are elements that we've seen over time in kind of the zones that we're experiencing even now, too.Andrew Philip WittyThanks, John. And maybe I'll ask Dirk to also comment a little bit. As you think about the G&amp;A side of the equation going forward, maybe reflect a little bit on the work you're leading around technology and other interventions as we look to drive down our overall costs.Dirk C. McMahonYes. Gary, what I would say is much of the focus -- we've really been applying a lot of artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing. Long term, we think there's great hope for those. And some of the short-term things that we're working on in those areas, like using generative AI to help more efficiently write medical appeal letters, things like optimizing our provider search and all of our digital properties with natural language processing and AI, doing a lot of work, improving our payment integrity models, using AI to detect waste, fraud and abuse. And then a lot in the G&amp;A world to answer basic questions in our call centers, like leveraging our benefit bots to reduce the number of calls and the labor associated with that, for simple questions like is XYZ disease covered or have I met my deductible. From long range perspective, however, I'm really optimistic about our significant data sets. Our ability to take advantage of whatever new technology comes down the pipe to improve health care, I'm really excited about it. So thanks for the question.Andrew Philip WittyYes, Dirk, thanks so much. And I think, Gary, overall, and I think I tried to allude at the very beginning, Obviously, when you see a movement in care activity like we saw in the quarter, it's been great to see the range of levers that we have within the organization to respond. And you've seen what we've been able to do in the very short run. And as you would that we have more and more of those levers as you roll through into the medium and longer-term outlooks as both John and Dirk have described both in the financial side of the company but also critically in the core operating cost structure of the company, which we're going to continue to bear down on very, very assertively. Consequence of all of that is that even with the backdrop of some of the fluidity we've seen, We're able to continue to commit to the investment behind growth and the investment behind looking after patients as well as we possibly can and giving people a fantastic experience, which is what we think builds super sustainable shareholder value. So that's very much the priority that we're focused on.OperatorWe'll go next to George Hill with Deutsche Bank.George Robert HillI guess, John, I want to talk a little bit more about your expectations for the senior book in '24. You guys kind of talked about that you expect the current elevated trend to continue and price for it when you think about the MA bids. I guess, kind of talk about like what drives the visibility there from what you see now in ortho, like looking all the way out to '24. And should we think of the pricing is just kind of conservatism on UNH's part? Or like I'm kind of interested in the data that drives the visibility.Andrew Philip WittyGeorge, thanks for the question. I'm actually going to ask Tim Noel, who leads the Medicare business to respond to that, Tim?Timothy John NoelThanks, George, for the question. So I'll start by reiterating one thing as an important point. The biggest item though shaping this year has been -- thinking was around the risk model changes. The outpatient care patterns plays a far smaller role there. But that said, having the ability to incorporate the latest data, anything we've learned recently into our Medicare Advantage bids is extremely important in each and every year especially given how we see both key revenue and medical elements firm up inside of Q2, being able to incorporate the latest thinking that we have in our bid filings is really, really important. And because of that, we've designed a bid process that is very nimble and able to accommodate late changes. This year, out of respect for a developing trend, we made the assumption that some of these early indications that we are seeing in the outpatient (inaudible) have talked about would remain durable. And as we sit here today, as John has talked about, these assumptions have validated and they've also stabilized. And we feel confident that we've made the appropriate accommodations inside of our 2024 bids for all of this.OperatorWe'll take our last question from Scott Fidel with Stephens.Scott J. FidelI was hoping maybe you could drill a little bit just into the announcement of the Amedisys acquisition. And maybe in particular, just talk about sort of strategy for ramping up the exposure here given the tough near-term reimbursement environment for home health. And then maybe some early thoughts around some of the integrations or synergies that you could generate from integrating Amedisys in LHCG together.Andrew Philip WittyScott, thanks so much for the question. Well, first of all, we're obviously very pleased to have come to an agreement on the transaction with Amedisys, so we appreciate that. But as you'd expect, it's -- we're now in the very early stages of that process. It wouldn't be appropriate to talk about anything specific in that regard. If I just take it maybe a level higher, it's no secret that we are very strong believers in the value of home health and no secret that we believe that value -- home health capabilities, when combined with other activities in terms of wrapping care around patients, is a really important element of future value-based care, particularly as you speak towards complex patients, many of whom maybe struggle to get out of the home, maybe don't have quite the same kind of relationship with the clinic as you might often expect. So we do think that the general area is an important area. As I said, as far as the specifics are concerned, I think we're now -- we'll go through our -- the regular kind of process, and we'll update you as appropriate, but probably not much more to say today. Thanks so much, Scott, for the question. And thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning. We very much appreciate your time. And we hope you take away from this call our confidence in our ability to continue to perform and grow strongly while we pursue our mission and build the foundations for continued growth in 2024 and beyond. And we are very much looking forward to sharing more on our progress with you again in October. Thanks so much for your time this morning.OperatorThis does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.]"

JPMorgan and Wells Fargo were the first of the bank stocks to report their earnings, both boasting beats this morning. Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Jared Blikre checks out stock action surrounding bank stocks, semiconductor manufacturers, and health care company UnitedHealth after the closing bell.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: All right, taking a look at some of the individual movers, it certainly was a big day for banks. JP Morgan, Citi, Wells Fargo kicking off earnings season with a beat in earnings here for the second quarter. However, there were some things to be a little bit concerned about within these reports and digging into what Citigroup saw profits fall amid slower corporate spending. Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre here to weigh in. And as you can see, JP Morgan one of the only big banks here holding onto gains today.JARED BLIKRE: The fortress balance sheet. What can you say about that that hasn't been said before? They tend to win, and the First Republic acquisition looks like it's working in their favor. You can see they're one of the few if not the only one up today, up 64 basis points.Wells Fargo, now they started out the day in the green. They were up 2 or 3 percentage points, have sunk into the red over the last few years. The really big year for banks was 2021, and they've just been kind of flagging ever since.Here's Citigroup intraday down 4%, but I just want to show you a chart, Seana, to argue against zombie banks, because guess what, this was before the global financial crisis, the great financial crisis, and this is after. Basically, 12 years of doing nothing there, so that is the downside.SEANA SMITH: Certainly the downside. All right, Jared, let's also talk about some of the chip makers. Truist was out with a note, raising their price targets for NVIDIA and Broadcom. Now, the company's citing that the two chip makers have, quote, ""meaningful upsides right now amid high demand"". Certainly, obviously--Story continuesJARED BLIKRE: Meaningful?SEANA SMITH: NVIDIA by far the-- yeah, what are we looking-- we're looking at losses today.JARED BLIKRE: Yeah, well, I mean, we're looking at some losses today, but that chart is from the lower left to the upper right here, so if they're still seeing meaningful upside here, hey, I hope-- I want to be part of that. Let's not forget, a lot of this huge rally that we've seen here in this market concentration has been on the backs of some of this AI. Not on some of it, a lot of it on the AI hype, so that does need to continue. But up 200% for the year. That is just incredible.Take a look at Broadcom here, who they're also commenting about. Up about 60% year to date. The stock is just flagging in the upper end of its range. Well, that's a very bullish chart right there. We'll have to see what happens, but this consolidation that we're seeing here, that's healthy.SEANA SMITH: All right, Jared, well, another name that's on the move today, UnitedHealth Group rallying in today's trading session after beating second quarter expectations. The company also raising the low end of its profit outlook for 2023. Obviously, that's adding to some of the boost that we did see today, and it's helping some of its competitors as well.JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. We can see kind of a mixed board here. I would say, overall, healthcare has not been one of the best performers this year. It has not been about defense. They did tend to do well last year, especially in the back half, and you just take a look at the year to date performance, you're going to see kind of a bifurcation. You're going to see some winners here, but for the most part, a lot of them are losers.We know healthcare is a very difficult business to be in. One of the items that caught my mind with respect to United was they were-- a bunch of the states are getting together and finally clamping down on Medicaid and kicking out people who committed fraud or were not eligible over the pandemic. It does not seem to be having an appreciable effect just so far, but I think that's an interesting data point that could be important going forward.SEANA SMITH: All right, Jared Blikre, thanks so much for breaking that down.]"

Net income attributable to the bank's May purchase of embattled regional lender First Republic was $2.4 billion.Higher interest rates and loan growth helped Wells Fargo report a 20.5% year-over-year jump in its top line to $20.5 billion, while earnings surged 66.7% to $1.25 per share.""The bottom-line impact here is that the overall health of the banking system is better than feared, at least for the largest banks in the system,"" says Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. One major area of pushback against the Fed is that higher rates will cause more banks to fail, but after this morning's results, it seems less likely to happen, Mulberry notes, adding that if strong results from banks continue, ""there will be much less worry if the Fed needs to raise rates again in September.""UnitedHealth earnings impressDespite the impressive results, JPM managed a 0.6% gain, while WFC slipped 0.3%. UnitedHealth Group, on the other hand, popped 7.2% after earnings, easily making it the best Dow stock today. The insurance company reported higher-than-expected Q2 earnings of $6.14 per share and revenue of $92.9 billion, and lifted its full-year forecast.At more than $480 a share, UNH has the greatest weighting of all 30 stocks in the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average, which helped it finish up 0.3% at 34,509. Meanwhile, the broader S&amp;P 500 (-0.1% at 4,505) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (-0.2% at 14,113) suffered modest losses.

But on a positive note, low expectations create a low bar for companies to clear, which could result in upside surprises, the CEO notes.Earnings from financial firms will remain in focus next week, but results from several other sectors, including communication services and consumer discretionary, will start to filter in as well.

The report affirms American's focus on the sustainability issues most important to its business and stakeholders, including climate change, customer and team member safety, human capital and customer service.""Over the past year, American has worked tirelessly to fly more and bring people together again,"" American's CEO Robert Isom said. ""I'm deeply proud of our team for building back our airline, developing a pipeline of new and diverse talent and advancing our climate goals - all while remaining steadfastly committed to our why: caring for people on life's journey.""American's strategy for reaching net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 is focused on running a more fuel-efficient operation, with more fuel-efficient aircraft increasingly powered by low-carbon fuel. Over the past several years, American has undertaken the most extensive fleet renewal effort in the history of its industry - giving the airline the youngest mainline fleet among U.S. network carriers. In 2022, American took meaningful steps forward across its strategy - from adding new-generation aircraft to its fleet and finalizing its most significant sustainable aviation fuel offtake agreement to date to announcing investments in two companies focused on the development of low-carbon, hydrogen-powered aviation.In 2022, American became the first airline globally to receive validation from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) that its intermediate 2035 GHG reduction targets comply with the criteria in the SBTi's first aviation pathway. The company's Sustainability Report also includes a detailed discussion of American's risks and opportunities related to climate change, as recommended by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.Story continuesEmbedding diversity, equity and inclusion across American gives its culture a competitive advantage and underpins American's quest to be the best airline for its customers. The report describes the company's efforts to create opportunities for people from all backgrounds, including diverse groups historically underrepresented in the airline industry, and to increase awareness, access and opportunity for everyone interested in exploring a career in aviation.The team at American is the engine behind the high level of service it provides to customers. Even as the company rapidly ramped up operations in 2022, it maintained its focus on offering the reliability, dependability and world-class experience its customers expect. Thanks to the hard work of the American team, the company recorded its best-ever customer satisfaction scores, as measured by Likelihood to Recommend, for the year. The company also continues to have an uncompromising commitment to customer and team member safety.The airline's progress toward its sustainability goals continues to receive accolades. American was named 2023 Air Transport World Eco-Airline of the Year, and in 2022 remained the only passenger airline to be included in the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index for a second consecutive year.About American Airlines GroupTo Care for People on Life's Journey®.

299,b29ff793-810f-3a7a-ac47-109deb52acc1,AAL,2023-07-15,Is a Beat in Store for American Airlines (AAL) in Q2 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/beat-store-american-airlines-aal-142800991.html,1689344880,STORY,['AAL'],"[American Airlines AAL is scheduled to report  second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 20 before market open.The company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters (missed once), the average beat being 12.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings has been revised 32.56% upward over the past 60 days.Given this backdrop, let's delve deeper into the factors that are likely to have influenced AAL’s second-quarter 2023 performance.We expect upbeat air-travel demand, particularly on the domestic front, to have boosted American Airlines’ top-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Passenger revenues, which account for the bulk of the top line, are likely to have been high, in turn, boosting total revenues.  Our estimate for passenger revenues is pegged at $12.52 billion, indicating a 2.5% rise year over year.Driven by the uptick, AAL expects second-quarter 2023 adjusted operating margin in the range of 12.5-14.5%. Our estimate is pegged at 12.9%. The carrier projects total revenue per available seat miles (a measure of unit revenue) to decline 1-3% from second-quarter 2022 actuals. Our estimate hints at a 2.9% decline.Driven by upbeat traffic, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) is likely to have been impressive in the June quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 85%.However, high fuel cost might have affected the bottom-line performance in the quarter under review. Fuel cost per gallon in second-quarter 2023 is anticipated in the $2.55-$2.65 band. Our estimate is pegged at $2.61. Even though fuel price has come down from the highs witnessed earlier, it still remains at an elevated level.Non-fuel unit costs are likely to increase 3.5-5.5%. Our estimate hints at a 4.1% increase. High labor costs are likely to have pushed up the non-fuel unit costs in the to-be-reported quarter. Our estimate for expenses on salaries, wages and benefits indicates a 10.4% increase from second-quarter 2022 actuals.Story continuesAAL projects adjusted earnings per share (excluding net special items) to be between $1.45 and $1.65. The mid-point of the revised guidance ($1.55) is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.71.What Our Model SaysOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for AAL this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.American Airlines has an Earnings ESP of +2.69% (the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at $1.76 per share at present, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents) and presently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Highlights of Q1American Airlines’ first-quarter 2023 earnings (excluding 3 cents from non-recurring items) of 5 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny despite higher costs. In the year-ago quarter, AAL incurred a loss of $2.32 per share. Operating revenues of $12,189 million increased 37% year over year, reflecting upbeat air-travel demand. However, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12,198.9 million.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other stocks from the Zacks Airline industry that investors may also consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to beat on their second-quarter 2023 earnings.United Airlines UAL has an Earnings ESP of +3.89% and a Zacks Rank #3. UAL will release results on Jul 19. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Given the buoyant scenario with respect to air-travel demand, passenger revenues are likely to have been high, in turn, aiding UAL’s results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings has been revised 6.91% upward over the past 60 days.JetBlue Airways JBLU has an Earnings ESP of +12.50% and a Zacks Rank #3. JBLU will release results on Aug 1.We expect upbeat air-travel demand to aid JBLU’s results too.

This company, which is in the Zacks Automotive - Retail and Wholesale - Parts industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.When looking at the last two reports, this auto parts retailer has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 6.03%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, O'Reilly Automotive came out with earnings of $8.28 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8 per share, representing a surprise of 3.50%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $7.71 per share and it actually produced earnings of $8.37 per share, delivering a surprise of 8.56%.Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for O'Reilly Automotive lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesO'Reilly Automotive currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.10%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on July 26, 2023.When the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

NXST, Cadence Design Systems, Inc. CDNS, Atmos Energy Corp. ATO and O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. ORLY.4 Stocks with Remarkable Interest Coverage RatiosAn ill-informed investor can lose cash if he wagers on a stock only on the basis of the numbers flashing on a real-time stock screen. A critical analysis of the company's financial background is always required for a better investment decision, especially at a time when the stock market is juggling myriad issues.Often, investors evaluate a company's performance by simply looking at its sales and earnings, which sometimes do not reveal the real picture. To be more precise, they do not tell whether a company's fundamentals are sound enough to meet its financial obligations. Here, the coverage ratio comes into play — the higher the metric, the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?The interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial to financing operations for the majority of companies, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company. The company's creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest &amp; Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Interest Coverage Ratio suggests how many times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm has for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than one suggests that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. One should also track the company's past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.Story continuesNexstar Media Group, Inc., Cadence Design Systems, Inc., Atmos Energy Corp. and O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. boast impressive interest coverage ratios.Here are four of the 12 stocks that qualified the screening:Nexstar Media Group, a leading diversified media company that produces and distributes engaging local and national news, sports and entertainment content, carries a Zacks Rank #1 and has a VGM Score of B. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Nexstar Media Group has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 21.4%, on average.

Its expected EPS growth rate for three-five years is 19.5%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cadence Design Systems' current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 13.7% and 17.1%, respectively, from the year-ago period. Cadence Design Systems has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.3%, on average. The stock has rallied 51.2% in the past year.Atmos Energy, which is engaged in the regulated natural gas distribution, and pipeline and storage businesses, carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of B.

Regeneron (REGN), which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This biopharmaceutical company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 19.42%.For the most recent quarter, Regeneron was expected to post earnings of $9.25 per share, but it reported $10.09 per share instead, representing a surprise of 9.08%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $9.68 per share, while it actually produced $12.56 per share, a surprise of 29.75%.Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Regeneron lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Regeneron has an Earnings ESP of +6.50% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on August 3, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

We will also explore the current scenario of the job market in US with the context for teenager jobs and the companies that fully support teen employment with lucrative benefits. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to 10 Highest-Paying Summer Jobs for Teens.As reported by the Department of Labor in April 2023, with 9.8 million job openings and 5.7 million unemployed Americans, the labor scarcity has caused wages to rise, particularly for teenagers. In fact, teens have experienced a 7% increase in their median weekly summer pay between 2019 and 2022 and surpassed the other age groups.Interestingly, there has been also a shift in priorities among teenagers. In May, the percentage of US teens who were either employed or actively seeking employment stood at 36.8%, which is higher than the pre-pandemic low of 32.5% in 2014. However, it is still lower than the consistent 50% or more observed before 2001. Economists often attribute this decline to changes in priorities, such as a greater focus on education, unpaid internships, and participation in extracurricular activities.Teens Are Making a Comeback in SummersOne job area where these trends become particularly evident is at pools and beaches, where a shortage of lifeguards had resulted in limited job opportunities. For instance, the city of Seattle has been facing severe staffing shortages which led them to increase the starting wage for lifeguards to $21 per hour or higher. It's worth noting that different states have varied rates of teen employment during summer. In 2022, Nebraska had the highest teen employment rate of 65.9%, while Hawaii had the lowest, at 23.7%.In fact, according to Gusto, a payroll process for small businesses, teenagers is expected to account for nearly 1 in 5 summer hires this year. While many adults in the U.S. who were affected by the pandemic have returned to their jobs, teenagers have been quick to re-enter the job market, specifically for summer jobs. Experts attribute this trend to the attractively higher wages and a desire to break free from the routine of remote classes and other constraints they may have experienced due to Covid-19.Story continuesWhere Can Teens Work?Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX) provides an exceptional opportunity for teen jobs with its inclusive policies and commitment to education.

The copies were sold for $20 each, a hefty sum in 1864, to raise money for the Sanitary Commission - an organization which helped provide support services for soldiers returning from the Civil War. A small number of the signed copies are known to have survived.Holding the document that Lincoln referred to as ""…the great event of the 19th century"" was a moving, transformative experience for me.As Dr. Martin Luther King described during his 1963 ""I have a Dream"" speech ""…this momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope for millions of negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.""With this document and the stroke of a pen, President Lincoln declared that ""…all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free; and the Executive Government of the United States, including the military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons, and will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom.""On Juneteenth, we commemorate the emancipation of enslaved African Americans. We feel the gravity of the revelation that news of the proclamation was kept from so many - the last of whom learned that they were ""finally free"" in Galveston, Texas on June 19, 1865. We honor those who endured withering injustice and we celebrate the dignity, the perseverance, and the courage of the African American culture.Story continues""Holding the document that Lincoln referred to as ‘…the great event of the 19th century' was a moving, transformative experience for me.""I believe the best way to preserve the legacy of Juneteenth and the power of the Emancipation Proclamation is to continue to shine that ""great beacon light of hope"" on the next steps of our journey.The power of proclamation is something I reflect on every day in my work as Cisco's Chief Social Impact Officer. Proclamations are more than words. They have the power to change the course of history. Cisco's purpose - to Power an Inclusive Future for All - is a proclamation. So are our Social Justice Beliefs and the 12 actions we're taking to drive lasting, generational change by addressing inequities, breaking down barriers, and creating more inclusive opportunities for people to thrive. Our actions are making substantial impact. Now, we're exploring new ways to go further - faster.""I believe the best way to preserve the legacy of Juneteenth and the power of the Emancipation Proclamation is to continue to shine that ‘great beacon light of hope' on the next steps of our journey.""Many of Cisco's leaders are sharing their perspectives on ""Freedom Day"" - including Maria Martinez on Empowering Historically Black Colleges and Universities through our Social Justice commitments and the impact we're making at Clark Atlanta University.Here's wishing Cisco - the African American community - and the country a Happy Juneteenth.View original content hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/768068/Cisco-Reflections-on-the-Significance-of-Juneteenth-and-the-Power-of-Proclamation]"
