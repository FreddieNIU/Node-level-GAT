It has amassed assets over $45.19 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueCompanies that find themselves in the large cap category typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.Carrying lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, value stocks also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Considering long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets; however, they are more likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.CostsWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.06%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.76%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsETFs offer a diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector--about 17.50% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Consumer Staples round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Abbvie Inc (ABBV) accounts for about 4.34% of total assets, followed by Pepsico Inc (PEP) and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO).The top 10 holdings account for about 41.77% of total assets under management.Story continuesPerformance and RiskSCHD seeks to match the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index before fees and expenses. The Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index is designed to measure the performance of high dividend yielding stocks issued by U.S. companies that have a record of consistently paying dividends, selected for fundamental strength relative to their peers, based on financial ratios.The ETF has lost about -6.32% so far this year and is down about -6.59% in the last one year (as of 05/18/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $66.43 and $79.12.The ETF has a beta of 0.88 and standard deviation of 17.37% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 104 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, SCHD is a great option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $49.11 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $99.90 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.18% and VTV charges 0.04%.Bottom-LinePassively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency. They are excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares have lost about 7.2% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is The Charles Schwab Corporation due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Schwab Q1 Earnings Beat, Revenues &amp; Costs RiseSchwab’s first-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of 93 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 90 cents. The bottom line also grew 21% from the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for adjusted earnings was the same as the consensus number.Results benefited from higher rates, which led to a rise in net interest income. Thus, revenues improved despite lower bank deposit fees and higher volatility hurting trading income. Also, the absence of fee waivers and solid brokerage account numbers acted as tailwinds during the quarter. However, higher expenses were an undermining factor.Results excluded acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangibles. After considering these, net income (GAAP basis) was $1.6 billion or 83 cents per share, up from $1.4 billion or 67 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. We had projected earnings per share (GAAP basis) of 80 cents.Revenues &amp; Expenses RiseNet revenues were $5.12 billion, which grew 10% year over year. The increase was mainly driven by a 27% surge in NII, while a 49% plunge in bank deposit fees was the major offsetting factor. The top line, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.15 billion. Our estimate for the metric was $5.3 billion.Total non-interest expenses (GAAP basis) increased 6% to $3 billion. We had projected this metric to be $3.18 billion. Excluding non-recurring items, expenses were $2.77 billion, up 7%.The company recorded no fee waivers in the quarter compared with $54 million in the prior-year quarter.Pre-tax profit margin increased to 41.2% from 39.4% in the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for the metric was 40%.At the end of the first quarter, Schwab’s average interest-earning assets decreased 20% year over year to $504.6 billion.Annualized return on equity, as of Mar 31, 2023, was 23%, up from 12% in the prior-year quarter.Story continuesOther Business MetricsAs of Mar 31, 2023, Schwab had total client assets of $7.58 trillion (down 4% year over year). During the reported quarter, net new assets — brought by new and existing clients — were $150.7 billion.Schwab added 1.04 million new brokerage accounts during the quarter. As of Mar 31, 2023, the company had 34.1 million active brokerage accounts, 1.7 million banking accounts and 2.4 million corporate retirement plan participants.OutlookBecause of higher cost of funding, second-quarter 2023 total revenue is expected to decline by mid-to-upper single digit percentage points on a year-over-year basis.Based on the current forward curve, the company’s NIM is expected to improve steadily in 2024 and could reach 3% by the end of 2025.Update on TDA DealThe company expects to incur total acquisition and integration-related costs and capital expenditure of $2.4-$2.5 billion.Total synergies are estimated to be $4.3 to $4.8 billion. The company anticipates achieving $1.8-$2 billion in run-rate expense synergy by the end of 2024.Further, strong volume growth and newly identified opportunities strengthen the company’s outlook for revenue synergies. The company remains on track to achieve its run-rate revenue synergy target of $2.5-$2.8 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.The consensus estimate has shifted -8.91% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, The Charles Schwab Corporation has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise The Charles Schwab Corporation has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

CF has collaborated with CHS Inc. to accelerate quantifiable and certifiable greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions in the agriculture and food systems by manufacturing and distributing low-carbon nitrogen fertilizer. This initiative was created as part of the United States-United Arab Emirates Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate program, which aims to drive global innovation in climate-smart agriculture.Fertilizer production, which is critical to crop yields, contributes significantly to the global food production lifecycle GHG footprint. To address food production's GHG footprint, both firms will capitalize on CF Industries' investments to manufacture ammonia, the building component of nitrogen-based fertilizer products, with lower Scope 1 carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. They will also use CHS' vast distribution network to connect producers with low- and zero-carbon fertilizers. The companies are keen on working together to promote the use of low-GHG nitrogen fertilizer to assist farmers and crop end users, such as consumer product goods companies and ethanol manufacturers, in reducing agriculture's overall carbon footprint.A major advantage of incorporating decarbonized fertilizer is that it can quantify the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions related to its production and communicate this attribute to the farmer, who can then provide products with a quantifiably lower GHG footprint to their customers. This will enable the company to establish a certifiable decarbonized agricultural value chain, CF noted.Price PerformanceShares of CF have plunged 40.1% over the past year compared with the decline of 39.6% of its industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCF Industries noted on its first-quarter earnings call that it expects production economics in Europe to remain difficult. Full ammonia capacity production rates are not likely to restart in the region until 2023, with some plants still preferring to import ammonia in order to generate enhanced products.  CF forecasts urea exports from China to be 2-3 million metric tons for 2023 under current measures, with annual exports returning to 3-5 million metric tons if government export restrictions are lifted.Energy inequalities between North America and marginal producers in Europe and Asia are projected to be much greater than in the past. According to the company, the global nitrogen cost curve will continue to favor low-cost North American producers with significant margin potential.Story continuesCF Industries Holdings, Inc.

Joining us now, we want to bring in Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer. And, Josh, when you take a look at the reaction in the stock today, clearly the Street very excited about what they heard from Barclays. Why are they so bullish?JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Seana, so it's all about that Macau resurgence. And this is something that we heard from Wynn going back to their earnings call a couple of weeks ago, basically saying that Macau is coming back at a faster pace than they had expected and now at a faster pace than Wall Street had expected. So when you take a look at what that Macau segment has done for Wynn, they've reported $600 million in operating revenue in the first quarter. That's the most they've had in Macau since the fourth quarter of 2019.Now, Barclays coming out today and essentially saying they think that Wynn is headed for adjusted EBITDA in comparison to 2019 at a quicker pace than initially anticipated. So they think they're going to get to about 80% of what they were at in 2019 by the end of this year. And then you can see on the chart on your screen, they think they can get to 100% of what they were doing in 2019 by 2024. So into next year.And, Akiko, when we think about casinos as a whole, of course, this is a massive story because Macau used to be more than half of Wynn's overall revenue. And it is obviously a big player for something like Las Vegas Sands as well. It's a huge space or region for casinos.AKIKO FUJITA: Well, yeah. And certainly, with China reopening, that's-- the activity picking up in a big way. How is this affecting other casinos?Story continuesJOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, so Las Vegas Sands you saw take a big jump today as well. I think it was up about 3% at one point. Yeah, up about 3% right now. And really, that's also because Las Vegas Sands is actually the biggest player over Macau. They have the most market share. So it's Las Vegas Sands, then Wynn, then MGM Resorts. And what's been interesting to see in commentary-- and Barclays was pointing this out today as well-- is travel still isn't all the way back to Macau.So they've started to see more travel from inside China. But those surrounding countries, if you take a look at visitation from surrounding countries, it actually has not picked up really anywhere close to the levels it was in 2019. So there's still a lot more visitation to come. And so essentially, the argument here from the Street is, you can get out ahead of this because it's not really priced into the stock yet. And those revenues are going to keep going up and keep coming back. And that's obviously bullish overall for the space.SEANA SMITH: Josh, what about the outlook here for Las Vegas? Because you and I have talked a number of times over the last several months that Las Vegas, the numbers of travelers that they are seeing day in and day out, the rates that they are charging for the hotels are at a record levels.JOSH SCHAFER: And Wynn is winning that battle, which I think is fascinating too. There was a chart in that note pointing out that Wynn is actually getting the most per table, the most per slot, the most per room of anyone right now in Vegas. And Barclays came out and said that they think that that's going to be sticky. They think that Vegas travel overall is going to stay resilient. And they think Wynn is the winner in that space. Now, of course, when we talk overall slowdown, the question is, does that continue, right? Do people keep traveling to Vegas over the course of the year? Right now, we haven't seen any indicators that that won't keep happening.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, and you wonder if that's going to pick up going into the summer. We keep hearing domestic travel staying closer to home. Vegas kind of the perfect opportunity. Although, I don't think I want to stay there in that weather.JOSH SCHAFER: Not a far flight from LA, right, Akiko?SEANA SMITH: I was going to say, you could even drive there.AKIKO FUJITA: It's not a far drive.JOSH SCHAFER: Akiko might be telling us about her vacation plans, I think.AKIKO FUJITA: You might find me in Vegas in a few months. We'll see. All right, thanks so much for that, Josh.]"

MAT is likely to benefit from digital initiatives, strong demand for Hot Wheels and cost-saving program. Also, the emphasis on licensing agreements bodes well. However, inflationary pressures are a concern.Let us discuss the factors that highlight why investors should retain the stock for the time being.Factors Likely to Drive GrowthMattel has been undertaking efforts on the digital front and focusing on better execution of marketing and promotional initiatives. The company formed a brand development framework to unlock the scale and profitability of its brands and modernize them for the digital world. The company is making significant progress to transform Mattel into an IP-driven high-performing toy company.During the first quarter of 2023, the company stated progress on capturing the full value of its IP in its business verticals outside the toy aisle. During the quarter, the company announced a licensing agreement for Disney's Wish (releasing in November 2023). It also announced the Hot Wheels ultimate challenge primetime show on NBC and the Barbie Dreamhouse challenge (a new home makeover competition series) on HGTV. The company emphasized on licensing agreements with Disney (with respect to Little Mermaid dolls) and Hasbro to drive growth.The company has been witnessing an improving sales trend for Hot Wheels and is quite confident about the brand’s long-term prospects. During first-quarter 2023, gross billings at the Hot Wheels brand rose 1% (on a reported basis) and 2% (at constant-currency basis) year over year. In International, sales at Hot Wheels rose 4.6% year over year to $125.2 million.Mattel is also focused on cost-saving efforts to boost the bottom line. Through its current cost-saving program, the company is focused on expanding margins. It simplifies its organization structure, optimizing processes and supply chain to generate savings across operations. The program contributed $21 million of incremental savings to the cost of goods for the first quarter of 2023. The company anticipates the program to deliver additional savings of $300 million by 2023.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of Mattel have gained 11.6% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 5.2% growth.ConcernsMattel has been continuously incurring increased expenses, which have been detrimental to margins. During the first quarter of 2023, adjusted gross margin contracted 660 basis points year over year to 40%. The downside was mainly caused by inventory management efforts, including higher close-out sales and inventory obsolescence expenses, cost inflation and unfavorable fixed cost absorption. The company anticipates the challenging macroeconomic environment to persist for some time.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksMattel currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are MGM Resorts International MGM, Marriott International, Inc.

The firm is bullish on the casino operator thanks to a resurgence in Macau coupled with growth in Las Vegas.Shares of Wynn popped more than 6% on Wednesday while fellow Macau operators, Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and MGM (MGM), also traded higher.Barclays is now overweight all three major Macau operators, including Wynn, Las Vegas Sands, and MGM Resorts International“Evidence is accruing that WYNN’s Macau business is heading for 2019 EBITDA generation faster than we (or we think anyone) thought, and soon we could be talking about 'how much above 2019' Wynn Macau can recover to,” Montour wrote in a note to clients.In the first quarter of this year, Wynn reported $600.1 million in operating revenue for its Macau segment, the highest quarterly report since the fourth quarter of 2019. Las Vegas Sands more than doubled its Macau revenues from 2022, posting first-quarter revenue of $1.28 billion in the region. Similarly, MGM Resorts China segment saw quarterly revenue increase 140% from the year prior.""Macau is coming back quickly,"" Wynn Resorts CEO Craig Billings said during the company's earnings call on May 9.But the closely watched region that's lagged due to COVID-19 disruptions in China isn't back to normal yet. MGM noted its first-quarter adjusted EBITDAR [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and restructuring or rent costs] represented an 88% recovery to where it was prior to the first quarter in 2019.Part of that could be attributed to travel numbers. First-quarter mainland flights to Macau were below 77% of 2019 levels while visitation from surrounding countries remains below pre-pandemic levels, according to Barclays.Story continuesThat's been reflected in revenue numbers, too. Despite Las Vegas Sands' growth from 2022, the first quarter Macau revenue of $1.28 billion is still a far cry from the $2.33 billion in the first quarter of 2019.""[Macau] is in its infancy as far as a return to a more normal operating environment,"" Las Vegas Sands CEO Rob Goldstein told investors during the company's earnings call on April 19. ""It's not even — I think we're — it's still early days there. This first quarter is still not a representation of what can happen in Macau or will happen. So, I wouldn't call it normal operating mode. And as you referenced, the acceleration in revenues is clearly there and that will accelerate margins.""People wait to get in outside Wynn Palace, U.S. casino tycoon Steve Wynn's newest resort, during its opening in Macau, China August 22, 2016. REUTERS/Bobby Yip (Bobby Yip / reuters)The growing anticipation for a strong return of Macau comes as Las Vegas traffic has boomed following pandemic lockdowns. Barclays believes the region may be ""more resilient,"" than pre-pandemic, and Wynn is strategically benefitting more than other players in the region. Wynn is outpacing other Vegas operators in room rates, table spend, and slot play, per Barclays research.""We increasingly believe WYNN will be able to hold onto recent property performance in Las Vegas in spite of macro conditions worsening, or at least hold in better than we think current investor expectations assume, based on a certain level of scarcity value for WYNN’s high-end product that should keep it relatively insulated,""Josh is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Severe volatility that hit U.S. stock markets in early 2022, continued till the first quarter of this year. However, investors sailed smoothly in April as weakness in several key economic metric raised hope that the Fed would stop its interest rate hike regime anytime soon.Volatility erupted in May following the fear of a recession in the U.S. economy later this year. In the past month, Wall Street remained rangebound on concerns stemming from the regional banking turmoil.  In its recently concluded May FOMC meeting, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 5-5.25%, making it the highest Fed Fund rate since August 2007.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the ongoing rate hike cycle is perhaps reaching its end, although it will depend on the outcome of economic data. The Fed Chair acknowledged that the current banking turmoil in the United States has led to tighter credit conditions, and is likely to impact economic activities.In the first half of May, the large-cap centric Dow and S&amp;P 500 indexes closed in negative territory. The mid-cap specific S&amp;P 400 Index and the small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 also ended in a negative zone. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is the sole index that managed to gain marginally in the same period.At this stage, investors should be prepared to minimize fluctuations in their portfolio and consequently rebalance it with suitable financial assets to maintain stability. It would be prudent to pick value stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank to cushion the portfolio as well as make some gains from the upside potential. These stocks could prove to be valuable once the rally resumes.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five value stocks. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of A. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Story continuesThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGeneral Motors Co. GM has a compelling portfolio with strong demand for its quality full-size pickups and SUVs. GM’s hot-selling brands in America like Chevrolet Silverado, Equinox and GMC Sierra are driving the top line. We expect General Motors' total revenues to inch up 2.8% in 2023.General Motors will have nine electric vehicle models in the North America market this year, which will buoy top-line growth. GM’s Ultium platform and battery plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Lansing are set to scale up its e-mobility prowess. GM’s strides in autonomous vehicle development also augur well for long-term growth.The forward P/E of General Motors for the current financial year is 4.61X, lower than the industry average of 9.84X. It has a PEG ratio of 0.47, lower than the industry average of 1.20. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.1% over the last seven days. United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL is seeing steady recovery in domestic and international air-travel demand. Owing to robust air-travel demand, UAL expects revenues for the June quarter to grow 14-16% year over year. Our second-quarter total revenue estimate indicates a 14.7% year-over-year increase.For second-quarter 2023, United Airlines expects capacity to improve almost 18.5% from the year-ago reported figure. UAL's focus on cargo revenues is encouraging. UAL's fleet-upgrade efforts are commendable as well.The forward P/E of United Airlines for the current financial year is 4.16X, lower than the industry average of 9.74X. It has a PEG ratio of 0.09, lower than the industry average of 0.28. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 6.3% over the last 30 days. Unum Group’s UNM conservative pricing and reservation practices have contributed to overall profitability. Sustained increase in premiums is being fueled by high persistency levels in core business and strong sales volume along with solid benefits experience. The geographic expansion of UNM is paying off as acquired dental insurance businesses are growing in the United States and the U.K.We believe strong operating results have led to a solid level of statutory earnings and capital, boosting financial flexibility. UNM has continually enhanced shareholders’ value. For the long term, it estimates premium from core business to increase 3-5%. UNM estimates 45-55% growth in adjusted operating EPS by 2024.The forward P/E of Unum for the current financial year is 8.67X, lower than the industry average of 11.75X. It has a PEG ratio of 0.81, lower than the industry average of 1.49. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.7% over the last seven days. MGM Resorts International MGM is benefiting from increased business volume and travel activity, primarily at MGM China and Las Vegas Strip Resorts. The removal of COVID-related travel restrictions in Macau resulted in high contributions from the MGM China segment.MGM Resorts is also planning to expand its footprint in New York. MGM is optimistic regarding BetMGM operations as it anticipates revenue contributions of $1.8 -$2 billion in 2023.The forward P/E of MGM Resorts for the current financial year is 6.77X, lower than the industry average of 20.71X. It has a PEG ratio of 0.39, lower than the industry average of 2.12. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved more than 100% over the last 30 days. U.S. Silica Holdings Inc. SLCA is likely to gain from expansions in the Permian Basin. The Sandbox and EP Minerals buyouts are also expected to make significant contributions. SLCA’s focus on increasing its footprint and product offerings in specialty end markets is also likely to boost margins.The forward P/E of SLCA for the current financial year is 8.36X, lower than the industry average of 9.46X. It has a PEG ratio of 0.60, lower than the industry average of 2.17.

18,1138e2fd-c505-350b-8b36-51c023bcce2c,MET,2023-05-18,A Look at Insurance ETFs Post a Mixed Bag Q1,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-insurance-etfs-post-mixed-152303009.html,1684336983,STORY,['MET'],"[The insurance sector is among the prime beneficiaries of a rate hike. This is because the sector players are able to earn higher returns on their investment portfolio of longer-duration bonds. But these firms incur losses as the value of longer-duration bonds goes down with a rise in interest rates. Nevertheless, since insurance companies have long-term investment horizons, they can hold investments until maturity and hence no actual losses are realized.With the Fed slowing down the pace of rate hike and expectations of a pause in further hikes coupled with mixed results of the leading players in the industry, insurance ETFs struggled to find a footing over the last month. SPDR S&amp;P Insurance ETF KIE and iShares U.S. Insurance ETF IAK are down more than 1% each (read: 4 ETFs Zones to Benefit as Fed Pushes Rate to Above 5%).Insurance Earnings in FocusThe U.S. life insurance behemoth MetLife MET missed both earnings and revenue estimates. MetLife reported earnings of $1.52 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 33 cents and declined 25% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues declined 7.7% year over year to $16.13 billion and were below the consensus estimate of $16.81 billion. The second-largest U.S. life insurer and Prudential Financial PRU missed on earnings but beat on revenues. Earnings per share of $2.66 lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.02 and decreased 16.1% from the year-ago earnings. Revenues grew 10.5% year over year to $15.1 billion and edged past the consensus mark of $13.24 billion.One of the leading property and casualty insurers, Chubb Corp CB surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share by 174 cents and topped the revenue estimate by $429 million. Earnings per share improved 15.1% year over year. Another property and casualty insurer, Allstate ALL incurred a loss per share of $1.30, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.94. The company reported earnings of $2.58 in the year-ago quarter. Revenues grew 9.3% year over year to $13.8 billion, well above the consensus mark of $12.82 billion.Earnings per share of $1.55 reported by Aflac AFL, a seller of supplemental health insurance, trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17 cents and improved 7.6% from the year-ago earnings. Revenues dropped 7.2% year over year to $4.8 billion and beat the consensus mark of $4.6 billion (see: all the Financial ETFs here).Personal property and casualty insurer Travelers TRV posted earnings per share of $4.11, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 47 cents but declining 2.6% from the year-ago earnings. Revenues grew 10% year over year to $9.7 billion but missed the consensus mark of $9.8 billion.Story continuesETFs in FocusSPDR S&amp;P Insurance ETF (KIE)SPDR S&amp;P Insurance ETF follows the S&amp;P Insurance Select Industry Index, holding well-diversified 49 stocks in its basket.

China is the second-largest equity market globally, and is one of the broadest and deepest growth markets outside the United States.After the removal of ownership restrictions in 2018, China’s financial market has been open to foreign firms. Several global banks, including some of the Wall Street giants, including The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS, Morgan Stanley MS and JPMorgan JPM, tried to capitalize on the lucrative prospect.However, China’s business climate has deteriorated significantly and because of the increasing restrictions in the region, the private sector has been negatively impacted. Deal-making has also been curbed, hampering investment banking business growth. Thus, like others, GS and MS are scaling back their expansion plans in the country.Over the past decade, the biggest revenue driver for Wall Street firms has been taking China firms public in New York. However, after the tightening of listing rules to keep companies at home and the United States’ crack down on China firms over accounting, initial public offerings have been put on hold. This revenue source has almost dried up for U.S. giants.Given the drastic change in China’s business environment, Goldman Sachs, which was ahead of targets in 2021, has revised its projections on its five-year plan.Likewise, Morgan Stanley is planning not to build an onshore brokerage in the region. Notably, it is planning to make a smaller bet of $150 million on derivatives and futures businesses. MS is planning another round of job cuts, which will likely affect 7% of its Asia-Pacific investment bankers.With this move, MS will join JPM in cutting jobs in the country.The present job cuts in China are the biggest in many years and are relatively deeper than the rest of the world. Post Covid, China’s economy has been struggling to get back on its feet.Since September 2022, at least 100 China-focused jobs have been lost. Goldman Sachs has removed more than one-tenth of its workforce in China after almost doubling its headcount to above 600.Story continuesConclusionFor banks like JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and others, this comes as a harsh reality check. China’s markets have long been considered the generator of huge fees, including everything from mergers to stock sales and trading.The above-mentioned banks have spent billions of dollars in recent years trying to increase their stakes or acquire controlling interest in their securities and asset management joint ventures in China in the hope of future growth.While China remains a massive opportunity, these firms will have to rethink their growth plans in the region because of a more fractured geopolitical landscape.Because of the huge sums of money already spent, the Wall Street giants may not pull back completely. But, it will be more difficult for them to maintain good standing with both sides.These firms may see some contraction in profitability, which is already under pressure because of the expectations of a recession.Currently, MS carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

This is part of the broader 3,000 IB job cuts the company announced recently. The development was first reported by Bloomberg News.Of the total cuts, China is likely to take the biggest hit as slowing economic growth in the country is curbing dealmaking.  Last year, the company had slashed roughly 50 IB jobs in the Asia-Pacific region, with a large number being China-focused positions.  Amid the challenging economic environment, a slowdown in dealmaking has prompted MS to consider its headcount.Similar to 2022, the overall IB business performance was weak in the first quarter of 2023. A host of factors, such as geopolitical tensions, inflation, rising interest rates and fears of a global recession, acted as headwinds for mergers and acquisitions. Thus, deal volume and total deal value numbers crashed in the quarter. For the same reasons, IPOs, follow-up equity issuances and bond issuances dried up.Due to these headwinds, Morgan Stanley’s equity underwriting fees decreased 22% year over year and fixed-income underwriting declined 6%. Advisory fees were down 32%. So, total IB fees dipped 24% year over year.The outlook for the Asia-Pacific IB business looks bleak in the near term. The company’s chief finance officer, Sharon Yeshaya, on the first-quarter conference call, said that “expense management” was a priority, given the broader market uncertainty and elevated inflation.Over the past six months, shares of MS have declined 8.2% compared with the industry’s fall of 17%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently, Morgan Stanley carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Morgan Stanley is not the only one that is trimming workforce. Many other Wall Street firms, including Bank of America BAC and Citigroup C, have been taking similar steps in their IB and wealth management divisions.This March, Citigroup initiated a round of job cuts, slashing hundreds of jobs across the firm, which accounted for less than 1% of its total workforce. According to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified, the company’s IB division, its operations and technology organization, and the U.S. mortgage-underwriting division were among those affected.In its IB division, Citigroup was struggling because of the industry-wide slowdown in dealmaking. In its mortgage division, the company was grappling with reduced mortgage demand because of rising prices and a rapid increase in mortgage rates.Similarly, in February, it was reported that Bank of America was planning to cut jobs in its investment bank. The cuts are expected to have affected less than 200 bankers globally.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The move comes as deteriorating relations between China and the U.S., as well as weaker economic growth, have curbed dealmaking. The final figure could be higher, given that Morgan Stanley has already cut 50 roles in the region last year.The bank has struggled this year as M&amp;A has plummeted amid macroeconomic headwinds, but the worsening relationship between the U.S. and China is also to blame. The Asia-Pacific region had contributed 13% of the bank’s net revenue over the last five years, hitting $6.7 billion in 2022. However, global dealmaking has ground to a halt in the face of unfavorable economic conditions and escalating tensions between China and the West.The cuts are part of Morgan Stanley's plan to reduce around 3,000 jobs globally by the end of the second quarter of 2021. The bank has employed a larger China team in Hong Kong than most of its rivals, making it vulnerable as deal activity slows.In addition to the geopolitical challenges faced by Morgan Stanley, the banking sector as a whole is grappling with an uncertain economic outlook due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Banks are bracing for a wave of loan defaults as businesses struggle to stay afloat amid lockdowns and social distancing measures. This uncertain environment has led many financial institutions to tighten their belts and assess their workforce needs.If Morgan Stanley goes ahead with these layoffs, it will join several other major banks that have resorted to job cuts in recent months. HSBC (LON:HSBA) announced plans to cut 35,000 jobs worldwide earlier this year, while Deutsche Bank (ETR:DBKGn) is in the process of cutting 18,000 jobs as part of a major restructuring effort.Story continuesThe banking industry is facing an increasingly challenging environment, with low interest rates, economic uncertainty, and geopolitical tensions all contributing to a slowdown in deal activity. As such, it is likely that more banks will consider layoffs and other cost-cutting measures to weather the storm.--This article was written with the assistance of AIRelated ArticlesMorgan Stanley mulls reducing Asian investment banking staffUber's annual product showcase includes new family, fun and travel productsCrude Inventory Data Shows Surprise Build of 5 Million Barrels]"

""Utility poles are the backbone of the distribution system, and this work should enhance the reliability of electric service for our customers in these rural communities for years to come.""Penelec crews from Clearfield, Johnstown and Somerset are working cooperatively to rehabilitate this power line. They started the work in February, and it is expected to be completed in June.As part of the project, crews are replacing one pole, 12 crossarms, 15 fuses and 12 devices that protect the wire from lightning strikes along a 34.5-kilovolt (kV) line that starts at an electric substation near the Grier School in Birmingham and heads northwest along Route 453 where it meets Pennington Road. Crews are working to replace 26 poles, 26 crossarms, numerous fuses and insulators along Pennington Road to Warriors Mark and then for several more miles along Ridge Road on a lower-voltage section of the line.Story continuesAdditionally, crews have replaced 17 poles on a different spur of the same line running from the substation in Birmingham northwest through woods toward Ironville and continuing in the area of State Route 1015 through Sinking Valley. The remaining six poles to be set are located in fields near Elk Run and will require a track digger machine that can navigate hard-to-access spots to erect poles.The Warriors Mark - Franklin Volunteer Fire Department allowed Penelec to stage material on its property, providing convenient access to the various work locations.

(NYSE: FE), is now offering electric vehicle (EV) drivers the option to enroll in a program that can help them save money by charging their EV during off-peak hours. The program is also designed to benefit the entire region by taking some pressure off the electric grid during periods of heavy use, particularly in the hot summer months.Potomac Edison Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)Under Potomac Edison's new Electric Vehicle Time-of-Use (EV TOU) rate approved by the Public Service Commission of Maryland, EV drivers can save two cents per kilowatt-hour off the Electric Supply Charge portion of their bill for EV charging usage during off-peak hours. On-peak hours are Monday through Friday from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. excluding holidays. Off-peak hours are all hours not identified as on-peak.Beginning May 15, eligible residential customers can opt in to receive the EV TOU rate. While customers who choose to enroll will be able to charge at a lower rate during off-peak hours, the EV TOU rate for charging during peak hours will be two cents higher than the Electric Supply Charge. Customers should consider their charging habits to determine if the program would be suitable for them.The new rate option replaces the company's former EV Credit Rider. Now, instead of periodically receiving an off-bill rebate in the form of a gift card for charging during off-peak hours, the customer will pay a lower rate during off-peak hour charging.""The new EV TOU rate within Potomac Edison's EV Driven program gives customers the opportunity to see immediate savings on their electric bill, and we are able to offer it to more customers,"" said Linda Moss, president of FirstEnergy's Maryland operations. ""We are proud to be a part of making electric vehicle adoption more accessible, convenient and affordable in Maryland.""Story continuesUnlike the previous EV Credit Rider program, in which only 500 residential customers could subscribe, there is no cap on the number of residential customers who can sign up for the new EV TOU rate.Through Potomac Edison's EV Driven pilot program, the company plans to complete the installation of 59 charging stations, including 20 fast-charging stations, across its seven-county Maryland territory.

Median rent across the top 50 metros was up just 0.3% year-over-year, the lowest growth rate since the onset of the pandemic. The median asking rent was $1,734, up by $4 from last month, but down by $43 from the peak.""In April, we continued to see rising rent prices and a moderating growth rate. This is promising news for renters, suggesting that the pandemic peaks are behind us, and that the challenging affordability picture may begin to improve,"" said Realtor.com® Chief Economist Danielle Hale. ""We've seen record-high new construction occurring in the multi-family space, which is creating more units, helping to reduce competition and in turn helping to ease prices.""Affordability improves, but prices are still highOne major factor contributing to lower rent prices is a significant increase in multi-family construction. This has helped the vacancy rate reach its highest level (6.4% in Q1 2023) in two years. As more new rental properties are added to the market, the vacancy rate could inch back toward the norms we saw in 2013-2019 (about 7.2%) and would improve affordability for renters. Despite more available rentals and slowing rent growth, average rent still costs $348 (25.1%) more than it would have at this time in 2019.Save money by staying putRenters who renew their lease tend to pay less than those who sign a new lease. A 2022 survey from Avail, a Realtor.com® business, found that renters signing a new lease reported a price increase of nearly 27% – about double what people who have been in their rental for 1-2 years experienced (13%). To avoid paying this premium, renters are renewing leases at record-high levels, contributing to a stickier CPI Shelter Index.Story continues""Realtor.com® monthly data is based on median asking rents rather than survey responses, which are used in the CPI Index, so CPI data lags behind what we're seeing. The data suggest that easing in the cost of shelter is ahead in future CPI reports. While this could take until 2024 to play out significantly, it will be welcome news for renters and for overall inflation,"" said Hale.For more information on what landlords and renters are experiencing, read the latest Avail quarterly survey.Rental Data – 50 Largest Metropolitan Areas – April 2023MetroMedian Rent 0-2 bedroomYOY 0-2 bedroomRent Vacancy Rate (2023 Q1)Homeownership Rate (2023 Q1)Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell, Ga.$1,672-1.4 %9.8 %66.6 %Austin-Round Rock, Texas$1,730-4.8 %7.3 %63.4 %Baltimore-Columbia-Towson, Md.$1,8210.4 %12.8 %72.9 %Birmingham-Hoover, Ala.$1,2333.6 %11.9 %67.0 %Boston-Cambridge-Newton, Mass.-N.H.$2,8424.2 %2.7 %61.1 %Buffalo-Cheektowaga-Niagara Falls, N.Y.$1,230-1.1 %3.8 %72.0 %Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia, N.C.-S.C.$1,557-2.4 %4.5 %63.4 %Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, Ill.-Ind.-Wisc.$1,8350.9 %4.7 %68.8 %Cincinnati, Ohio,-Ky.-Ind.$1,2189.9 %5.9 %68.4 %Cleveland-Elyria, Ohio$1,144-3.6 %2.5 %65.0 %Columbus, Ohio$1,2708.4 %6.4 %59.3 %Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, Texas$1,538-3.1 %10.8 %61.5 %Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, Colo.$1,957-2.0 %4.1 %69.7 %Detroit-Warren-Dearborn, Mich.$1,3908.9 %8.3 %73.0 %Hartford-West Hartford-East Hartford, Conn.$1,650-2.1 %5.0 %67.3 %Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, Texas$1,4383.2 %12.3 %60.9 %Indianapolis-Carmel-Anderson, Ind.$1,3368.1 %10.9 %69.2 %Jacksonville, Fla.$1,466-0.4 %7.5 %72.9 %Kansas City, Mo.-Kan.$1,2823.5 %8.7 %64.3 %Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise, Nev.$1,509-5.7 %5.5 %59.1 %Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, Calif.$2,875-2.1 %3.5 %46.1 %Louisville/Jefferson County, Ky.-Ind.$1,2186.0 %1.2 %65.9 %Memphis, Tenn.-Miss.-Ark.$1,341-2.6 %5.3 %63.1 %Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach, Fla.$2,503-0.3 %7.0 %55.5 %Milwaukee-Waukesha-West Allis, Wisc.$1,5836.8 %3.7 %62.6 %Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, Minn.-Wisc.$1,5151.8 %10.1 %67.6 %Nashville-Davidson–Murfreesboro–Franklin, Tenn.$1,599-1.7 %9.9 %71.4 %New Orleans-Metairie, La.$1,270-15.4 %9.6 %60.4 %New York-Newark-Jersey City, N.Y.-N.J.-Penn.$2,9148.0 %4.1 %50.7 %Oklahoma City, Okla.$1,0147.0 %9.4 %66.8 %Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford, Fla.$1,8100.9 %4.5 %65.5 %Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, Penn.-N.J.-Del.-Md.$1,8343.6 %4.5 %66.5 %Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, Ariz.$1,646-5.2 %5.2 %67.5 %Pittsburgh, Penn.$1,4647.1 %6.8 %75.7 %Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro, Ore.-Wash.$1,691-0.1 %5.6 %66.1 %Providence-Warwick, R.I.-Mass.$1,8721.8 %4.6 %67.8 %Raleigh, N.C.$1,535-2.2 %10.9 %64.6 %Richmond, Va.$1,4384.8 %8.6 %66.5 %Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, Calif.$2,123-10.9 %4.9 %70.5 %Rochester, N.Y.$1,243-3.6 %2.5 %63.9 %Sacramento–Roseville–Arden-Arcade, Calif.$1,871-1.6 %4.6 %65.3 %San Antonio-New Braunfels, Texas$1,2870.2 %8.2 %68.3 %San Diego-Carlsbad, Calif.$2,877-1.0 %3.3 %52.5 %San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, Calif.$2,829-2.5 %4.7 %58.3 %San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, Calif.$3,3293.2 %5.9 %53.3 %Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, Wash.$2,117-0.2 %3.3 %61.7 %St. Louis, Mo.-Ill.$1,3335.7 %6.9 %68.8 %Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Fla.$1,776-4.1 %8.7 %61.1 %Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, Va.-N.C.$1,4641.8 %6.8 %68.9 %Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, D.C.-Va.-Md.-W.V.$2,2134.9 %5.5 %64.5 %Methodology Rental data as of April for studio, 1-bedroom, or 2-bedroom units advertised as for-rent on Realtor.com®. Rental units include apartments as well as private rentals (condos, townhomes, single-family homes).

Realtor.com® began publishing regular monthly rental trends reports in October 2020 with data history stretching back to March 2019.With the release of its April rent report, Realtor.com® incorporated a new and improved methodology for capturing and reporting more comprehensive rental listing trends and metrics. The new methodology is expected to yield a cleaner, more representative and more consistent measurement of rental listings and trends at both the national and local level. The methodology has been adjusted to better represent the true cost of primary housing for renters. Most areas across the country will see minor changes with a smaller handful of areas seeing larger updates. As a result of these changes, the rental data released since April 2023 will not be directly comparable with previous releases and Realtor.com® economics blog posts.

Welcome to the Altigen Communications Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note, this conference is being recorded.I will now turn the conference over to your host, Carolyn David. You may begin.Carolyn DavidThank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Altigen Communications Earnings Call for the Second Quarter Fiscal 2023. Joining me on the call today is Jerry Fleming, President and Chief Executive Officer; and I'm Carolyn David, Vice President of Finance.Earlier this afternoon, we issued an earnings release reporting financial results for the period ended March 31, 2023. This release can be found on our IR website at www.altigen.com. We have also arranged a replay of this call, which may be accessed by phone. This replay will be available approximately 1 hour after the call's completion and remain in effect for 90 days. The call can also be accessed from the Investor Relations section of our website.Before we begin our formal remarks, we need to remind everyone that today's call may contain forward-looking information regarding future events and future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are just predictions and actual results may differ materially due to certain risks and uncertainties that pertain to our business. We refer you to the financial disclosures filed periodically by the company with the OTCQB over the market, specifically the company's audited annual report for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, as well as the safe harbor statement in the press release the company issued today. These documents contain important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the company's projections or forward-looking statements. Altigen assumes no obligation to revise any forward-looking information contained in today's call.During this call, we will also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not superior to or a replacement for the comparable GAAP measures, but we believe these measures help investors gain a more complete understanding of results. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures and additional disclosures regarding these measures are included in today's press release.Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Jerry for opening remarks. Jerry?Story continuesJeremiah J. FlemingThank you, Carolyn, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us for today's call. So I'll begin the call today with a brief review of our second quarter results, followed by a brief update highlighting each of our lines of business. I'll then turn the call back to Carolyn for a detailed review of our financials.So earlier today, we reported revenue of $3.4 million for our fiscal second quarter, a 32% increase compared to our fiscal 2022 second quarter revenues. From a P&amp;L perspective, we recorded a GAAP loss of $140,000 for the quarter and a non-GAAP net income of $96,000. Compared to the prior quarter, revenues for software assurance and services decreased by approximately $180,000 while software and cloud revenues increased by about $96,000. Perhaps most importantly, our cloud revenues increased by approximately 4% quarter-over-quarter, which is reflective of our new solutions beginning to make a contribution.And let me correct that $96,000 in session -- $93,000. I can't read, so I apologize. But based on my intro, I'm going to now provide a more detailed update on each of Altigen's 4 lines of business. The first line of business is our legacy Altigen business, which consists of our MaxCS PBX, which we deliver as both an on-premise and hosted PBX solution along with our SIP Trunk or Voice over IP services. As we discussed in prior calls, we are in the early stages of upgrading our MaxCS customers to our new MaxCloud platform.MaxCloud introduces a complete new suite of unified communications features, including real-time presence, instant messaging, desktop sharing, HD video conferencing and new mobile unified communications applications, none of which are available in our legacy MaxCS hosted or on-premise solution, and all of which are required by today's modern businesses.Now as a reminder, we have over 300 MaxCS legacy PBX customers, totaling approximately 10,000 cloud subscribers. We also have more than 500 on-premise MaxCS PBX customers, which total more than 30,000 users. We are targeting all of these users for conversion to our new MaxCloud platform.Now the largest revenue opportunity is for our MaxCS PBX on-premises customers, for which today, we are recognizing approximately $700,000 in software assurance or software maintenance annually. However, the incremental revenue potential by migrating these customers to our new MaxCloud platform is $3.5 million to $4 million per year.Now to be sure, we must approach each customer on a one-by-one basis to sell them on the benefits of the cloud in general and MaxCloud in particular. However, as we migrate the on-premise customers to MaxCloud, plus add net new MaxCloud customers, I am estimating that the Altigen legacy PBX business will grow by 5% to 10% on an annualized basis.Now of course, we also want to make sure we protect our current base of hosted MaxCS PBX customers. Again, these are the legacy customers that are hosted in the cloud, and we want to prioritize as well migration of these customers to our new MaxCloud UCaaS platform based on their desire to add the UC functionality. The primary benefit here is not so much revenue but it is to retain these customers and avoid churn. From a metrics perspective, as of the end of March, we had approximately 20 new cloud customers split evenly between legacy migrations and net new cloud customers.Our second line of business is financial services, which also consists of our legacy PBX solutions; our interactive voice response platform, which I'll refer to as IVR and which you may know as a Bank by Phone application; our SIP Trunk services; and the FrontStage Contact Center as a Service or CCaaS solution.As an Altigen business partner, Fiserv is our #1 partner, and they're unique in that they host the Altigen solutions in their data centers and market them under the Fiserv brand to their bank and credit union customers. Today, Fiserv has approximately 90 legacy Altigen PBX customers. About 1/3 of those are hosted and about 2/3 are on premises. All of them are targeted for conversion to our new MaxCloud platform. In addition, Fiserv has approximately 1,500 IVR customers on the Altigen platform. In this case, approximately 2/3 of them are hosted and about 1/3 still on-premise, which are also their primary targets to add MaxCloud and FrontStage to the IVR platform.Fiserv plans to migrate their approximately 30 hosted MaxCS customers to the new MaxCloud UCaaS platform because these customers need to be moved to a new Fiserv data center by the end of the year as the current data center is going to be shut down. In the second wave, they would be targeting their base of 60 or so legacy on-premise MaxCS PBX customers also to migrate to the new MaxCloud platform.Out of these 90 or so customers, about 30 of them between the premise and the cloud customers also have the Altigen legacy contact center platform. They will also be targeted for conversion to our new FrontStage CCaaS, Contact Center as a Service platform. All of these customers on-premise and in the cloud represent incremental revenue to Altigen in terms of additional UCaaS revenue, CCaaS revenue or, in some cases, both.Our new FrontStage CCaaS platform has now been deployed for 3 Fiserv customers with additional 3 customer deployments scheduled later this year. The pipeline and prospects for FrontStage remains strong with Fiserv.In addition to the MaxCloud UCaaS, Unified Communications as a Service, and FrontStage CCaaS, Contact Center as a Service platforms, Fiserv's 1,500 IVR customers are also now being targeted with Altigen's new secure SIP solution. For those of you not familiar with this service, it is a secure VoIP phone service designed to prevent fraud by verifying both the caller's device and the voice print of the callers calling in to access their accounts and then preventing unauthorized access to those accounts. Because the secure SIP service requires integration of multiple Fiserv core processing systems, which runs the bank or credit union, we will be doing a phased rollout as each core system is supported. Ultimately, the plan is for this service to be available for all Fiserv customers.To give you an idea of the opportunity at hand, approximately 4 million minutes of phone calls flow through the Altigen Fiserv IVR systems today. We expect this to increase to approximately 6 million minutes as new IVR customers and features are added. The revenue potential to Altigen for this new secure SIP service, assuming 100% adoption, is over $10 million per year. The top 50% of the IVR customers represent over $7.5 million annually in new incremental revenue.All of these solutions, MaxCloud in UCaaS, FrontStage CCaaS and secure SIP continue to be rolled out to Fiserv customers, and we do expect to see increasing cloud revenues as traction is gained. Ultimately, we believe our Fiserv revenues have the potential to grow at a rate of 75% to 100% annually.Our third line of business, Microsoft Team Solutions, which primarily consists of our CoreInteract platform, FrontStage for Teams and our direct routing SIP Trunk services for Teams. Today, the majority of our Teams solutions revenue is derived from our direct routing SIP Trunk service, which also continues to grow. We also expect to see increasing contributions from the FrontStage CCaaS platform and CoreInteract as these products hit the market and gain traction.Now FrontStage, which is the same CCaaS platform that we're selling to Fiserv with MaxCloud, is being adapted for use of Microsoft Teams. While FrontStage is not yet available for Teams, we do expect to see the inaugural Teams release sometime in calendar Q3. At which time, we can start marketing that to our Microsoft Teams customers.Now as many of you know, we do view CoreInteract as our flagship offering in our Microsoft Teams solutions business. Over the past 2 years, AltiGen has invested over $7.5 million in research and development with much of that investment being in CoreInteract. This has enabled us to introduce the first true digital customer engagement platform specifically designed for Microsoft Teams. And unlike any other vendor that I'm aware of, we are really pushing the envelope with our extensive and pervasive native Teams integration with CoreInteract, which has resulted in a solution generating quite a bit of interest from resellers and customers alike.However, pushing the envelope has also caused CoreInteract to be at the forefront of uncovering, what I'll call, anomalies in Teams that has simply not been anticipated or planned for by Microsoft. As a result, we've had to focus an undue amount of attention on responding to issues primarily due to these anomalies.So our recent focus has been on supporting these customers and creating workarounds where necessary to make up for those Teams anomalies or deficiencies as customer satisfaction is critical to the success of CoreInteract. I can tell you that our customers remain excited about CoreInteract and are looking forward to continuing their rollouts as the Teams-dependent functions become available or workarounds are otherwise introduced.As an example, in the second quarter, we deployed CoreInteract for a customer in the media business. In this case, we actually had a number of new capabilities to CoreInteract to support the customer's business requirements and also had to develop quite a few workarounds for Teams functionality not working, what I'll call, as documented. This customer has 45 agents and is taking upwards of 1,000 calls daily and is continuing the rollout to additional agents.As the issues that I mentioned with Teams are resolved, which will allow for a much smoother operations, we expect to be able to attract many other customers having similar requirements to the company I just mentioned. More importantly, once we get this rolling, this will enable us to achieve our target of 100% annual revenue growth.Our fourth line of business is services, which consists primarily of the ZAACT Consulting business and project-based services as well as the Altigen professional services group, which has been merged in with the ZAACT group. As evidenced this quarter, the services business will experience ups and downs as project deliverables and associated milestone payments don't necessarily align with financial quarter ends.We do expect to see moderate growth from this services line of business as we extend our custom development work and as new project opportunities such as ChatGPT come into focus.So with that, I will now turn the call back to Carolyn to discuss our financial results. Carolyn?Carolyn DavidThank you, Jerry. We reported total revenue of $3.4 million for our 2023 fiscal second quarter, up 32% compared to the same period a year ago. Total cloud services revenue for Q2 was $1.9 million, the same for Q2 last year. Professional and other services revenue increased 729% to $1 million compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting the ZAACT acquisition. Our legacy on-premises license and software assurance revenue was $451,000, down 19% on a year-over-year basis.Gross margin was 63% compared to 70% in Q2 last year, representing a decrease of approximately 700 basis points. This decrease was primarily the result of a mix shift towards higher professional services revenue resulting from the ZAACT acquisition.GAAP operating expenses for the quarter totaled $2.3 million, 32% higher than the comparable period last year. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses totaled $2.2 million for Q2 compared to $1.7 million last year, representing an increase of roughly 33%. Excluding the impact of ZAACT, both our GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses totaled roughly $1.8 million. This represents an increase of 5% and 6%, respectively, compared to Q2 last fiscal year. This increase was primarily the result of higher headcount-related expenses in connection with the launch of our new products.GAAP net loss for Q2 was $140,000 or negative $0.01 per share compared to GAAP net income of $65,000 or $0.00 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. GAAP net loss included $197,000 in depreciation and amortization and $30,000 in stock-based compensation expense that was adjusted out of our non-GAAP net income of $96,000 or breakeven diluted EPS.Now let's turn to the balance sheet. We ended Q2 with $3.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, up 17% compared to the preceding quarter. Our working capital was $2.1 million, consistent with the prior quarter. This concludes the financial summary.I will now turn the call over back to Jerry. Jerry?Jeremiah J. FlemingThanks, Carolyn. Okay. So as we see it, we're now finally close to exiting our heavy investment phase and are beginning to enter a new growth phase. The investment phase refers to the substantial investments we've made in our new UCaaS and CCaaS platforms, our new digital customer engagement solution, and the new secure SIP service offering. This also includes investments we made in our new ordering and provisioning online portal and new integrated billing platform, both of which were required to scale our business.Most of those things are behind us now, and we're really coming to the end. But as evidenced this quarter, we are now in the early stages of demonstrating incremental revenue growth with our new solutions, which we expect to build upon going forward. Understand, these are not earth-shattering numbers, but we've got to start somewhere. And of course, we will continue to update you on our progress on each of our quarterly calls.So I'll now turn the call back to the operator for Q&amp;A. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) The first question is from Neil Cataldi with Blueprint.Neil CataldiJerry, nice quarter. Cloud services growing 4% sequentially is definitely a good sign of, hopefully, what's coming. A few questions, if I may, to dig a little deeper. Regarding Fiserv, you mentioned the customers who've deployed your solution thus far. Can you talk about engagement size? What is the largest active customer generating per month in terms of revenue? And are they fully deployed today?Jeremiah J. FlemingYes. That's good questions, Neil. And like you said, hey, 4%, that's a start, right? And we expect that to continue to improve. Regarding Fiserv, it ranges based on the size of the customer. Actually, the size of the deployment maybe is a better answer. And so the good revenue is really driven by the contact center. So we probably have a low end of around $5,000 a month, and our largest to date, of these 3, not a penny more, is around $25,000 a month in revenue. And that would be based (inaudible)Neil CataldiOkay. So your largest -- yes. So your largest customer with the contact center today is generating $25,000 a month. That's great. And then sort of same question but on the TRUSTID side, how should we think about that? And what are the customers there already generating?Jeremiah J. FlemingYes. Well, this is definitely just getting started, okay? So as I mentioned, we've got 1,500 IVR customers to target. Finally, the -- we've delivered on our capabilities and Fiserv has delivered on the integration they need on their side. So we have 2 customers live on the platform today. The one -- now the first customer that uses only TRUSTID, not the voice biometrics but only TRUSTID, that revenue is $5,000 a month. The customer that we've newly signed -- actually, this is only -- this solution doesn't have the contact center, by the way. They have both the TRUSTID as well as the voice biometrics, and that's about $8,000 a month just for that secure SIP service. These are -- so that's the first 2 of 1,500.Neil CataldiGot it. That's great. So those are good case studies. It sounds like we finally got some customers fully paying, and it's really just a question now of when, not so much if. One more question regarding Fiserv. Do they have any personnel dedicated to the sales operation? And maybe for those newer to the story that might be listening, since the Altigen products are white labeled to them, are they only selling your unified communications product? I mean they're not selling anyone else. It's just you, correct?Jeremiah J. FlemingCorrect. Yes, I can provide a little more color on that. So Fiserv does have -- as a result of their merger with First Data several years ago, they do have an outsourced group, and they do offer contact center and IVR and a couple of pieces for the very large customers, not for our target market. And they view us -- and I'm saying very large customers, I'm talking about Wells Fargo and Bank of America. So their target with the Altigen solutions is the other 90% of the customers, right, that aren't those guys. And so yes, in that group, we are -- they exclusively sell our UCaaS platform. It's hosted in their data center, so they exclusively host us as well. They exclusively sell our contact center solution hosted in their data center, and they exclusively sell our IVR solution hosted in their data center. And their sales reps are commissioned on our solutions just as if they were Fiserv products.So yes, we have a tremendous opportunity with them. And as I'll just add before you ask, because you might, why don't we sell more? We're in the passenger seat, and we are trying but Fiserv will dictate when they roll things out. But I believe that we've proven to them now with these new solutions -- and they're all new. Everything we're talking about has been released very recently. Now they're starting to get on it, and I think we're going to see some different results going forward.Neil CataldiOkay. Great. One more on Fiserv with the migrations you touched on. Is there any way you can quantify what the up-sell revenue opportunity is with the 30 that need to be migrated by the end of this year?Jeremiah J. FlemingIt really depends. That's a good question. On those 30, it's going to be -- when they migrate from our legacy PBX to the new UCaaS platform, that cost will be about the same. Those customers that have contact center on the legacy platform, we do voice only. So hopefully, I won't get too technical here. The new platform is omni-channel. So what that means for everyone is omni-channel adds to voice, right? In other words, you can make a phone call and then talk to an agent.Omni-channel means that you can also e-mail or instant message or come into the website or come in through social media and also connect with an agent that way. The new FrontStage platform has that omni-channel capabilities -- capability. All of those customers want that. So it's somewhat dependent upon when they adopt that where we'll see that incremental revenue, Neil. So it's hard to say.On the on-premise side, and there's roughly 60 customers on-premise, there will be a market increase. And again, I don't know how much contact center they'll add, but it will be a marked increase in revenue because they will be going from just paying us software assurance today and roughly 5x or more of that number in revenue to Altigen when they migrate those customers to the cloud. So I can't quantify it because I don't know what features they're going to select. But it's going to be -- it will be material.Neil CataldiIs it a similar range to the other contact center customers you were just discussing, $5,000 to $25,000?Jeremiah J. FlemingYes. For those customers, yes. For those customers that choose, yes, the contact center, the full omni-channel, absolutely because the $5,000 is basic. The $25,000, yes, they've got the full boat. So yes, to the extent that those customers choose the full boat. And again, it depends. It's not like a one size fits all, so it depends how many agents as well are utilizing the solution. So -- and the customers vary in size. But yes, we'll see that same range, that roughly the 30-plus contact center customers that I mentioned that will be migrating out of the 90, 30 have contact center. Yes, then I would expect to see that $5,000 to $25,000, I'm sorry, range monthly once those customers are fully deployed in the cloud.Neil CataldiOkay. Great. And then one last one, different topic. You talked a little bit about ZAACT and new opportunities for them. I just wanted to clarify, do you mean opportunities specific to Altigen products? Or are they pursuing other professional services development projects unrelated to what we might call the regular Altigen growth initiatives?Jeremiah J. FlemingRight. No, good question. Very good question because that's what they were doing, obviously, before we acquired them. So they are continuing to pursue those opportunities for their essentially Microsoft stack, so all Microsoft product-based custom development projects. And they've got a couple of very nice customers, so they are continuing to pursue that. The new in terms of extending current projects as well as new projects, it's on -- and that's what they do, if you will.On the Altigen side, yes, we are responsible for pulling them into the new opportunities, which would include systems integration, for example, integrating the Altigen products into CRM products that the ZAACT's personnel would perform. And then the biggest project that we're sizing up right now and hoping to launch in the financial services sector is ChatGPT with Microsoft, and the ZAACT folks will be doing that as well.OperatorThe next question is from Maj Soueidan with Geoinvesting.Maj SoueidanThank, Jerry, for taking this question. A real quick one. I just have one question regarding resellers. I think when you were in Vegas with our chat, you had talked about looking to bring on some new resellers to help you sell some of your products. I was wondering if you could get more specific in terms of what these resellers -- how they're different than what the resellers you may have right now and what you're hoping to gain from them in terms of product deployment.Jeremiah J. FlemingAbsolutely. Well, let's keep in mind in Vegas, I was sitting right next to you, and I think you were holding the microphone over my head, so I had to answer it. So I'll do my best here, Maj. Yes. And yes, we are working on some very large resellers. And we have some very nice resellers now. Most of the resellers we have, I'll call them regional providers, and they're typically Microsoft and providing Microsoft services to regional customers. We have -- and it takes a while, but we have been pursuing some very large resellers. And I think we're very close to closing at least one, if not more. And I'll just -- I can at least tell you that these resellers are some of the world's largest service provider companies or telcos as you might consider them.So I can't disclose because I don't -- I've got contracts signed, but I don't have their permission yet to announce at least in one case. But yes, absolutely going for that because that's where the real volume comes from. And I think we're getting very close to that point. And the nice thing is when I can land one and we show that success, we'll be able to land more. And yes, so it's exciting opportunity. I just can't quite quantify it or disclose at the moment, Maj.Maj SoueidanThat's fine. I mean, have they given you any kind of feedback on the products and how they -- the advantages they might have? I mean, do they kind of confirm what you're talking about? And then when you do sign them up, can you give me an idea of how long it might take for them to get like a runway where they could start getting the product out there?Jeremiah J. FlemingSure. And it probably depends. Each one may be different, so I'll just give you the one that we're really close on. And I was actually in a meeting with them over in Europe 6 months ago. And they sell -- I'll just give you an idea. They sell all the usual suspects in the contact center side. So Genesys and Five9, Avaya, Cisco, right? And for those of you that may not be familiar in this call, I mean, those -- Avaya and Cisco are the long-time telephony players with contact center. And Genesys and Five9 are 2 of the long-time very successful hosted contact center players.And their specific comment to us, we sat in an all-day meeting with them, CoreInteract is exactly what our customers are looking for, okay? So that's -- this is the validation that I talk about. Yes, for those customers that want the big expensive giant 10 people that have to be full time to maintain a contact center because that's all the company does, that's what those other vendors' work are for. Where we come in is this enterprise contact center, right, that they don't have those extreme requirements, 24/7 contact center like an -- I'll say, airline reservation-type center requirements, and they want to sell a solution to deliver what they need, and they're not going to pay and they can't afford to pay the ridiculous amounts of money that the big boys charge in those cases. So yes, that one. And I'll tell you how quickly they ramp up. They've got a bunch of customers. We had a meeting with them 6 months ago. A month ago, we did a training to have 50 salespeople focused on this particular area as overlay people. We did the training session for them. They're actively bringing us into customers now. Now they don't all work the same way, but that will give you the idea when we get in front of them, they get what we're talking about.Maj SoueidanExcellent. I guess good to hear. And I have one more question. Just doing some research around the industry and talking to other companies in the industry. Some of the -- there's a trend that's kind of been brought up to me, where you're seeing some maybe of the larger players in the industry maybe not taking -- paying too much attention maybe to the second and third tier kind of their own clients and maybe paying more attention to their top bigger clients? Are you seeing that same trend? And do you see that an opportunity you guys can pursue at all? I mean I wonder if you're just seeing the same thing.Jeremiah J. FlemingWell, so many of these -- we really focus on the larger -- by the way, when I say enterprise customers for us, I'm talking about an organization of 500 to 5,000 people, okay? Not the General Motors of the world, right? But these are still very large companies whose operations are predominantly in the U.S. and then if they're not in the U.S., in the U.K., where we can properly support them. But the smaller customers that maybe second and third tier, those are brought to us by resellers, so that's not our outward push. We do secure a number of those and that, I don't know, Maj. I really can't -- I haven't seen it. It doesn't mean it's not happening, but I don't -- what Microsoft has done that helps us out a little bit, they've made some discounts on their licensing for those smaller companies, so those customers can get into Teams' phone system. And that does create additional opportunities for us to then sell our applications on top of Teams' phone system, so that's probably the biggest benefit that we would see.Maj SoueidanOkay. And then one last question. I mean at what point do you say to yourself, hey, you have some traction here. The stock is trading at $0.50, $0.60. Where do you -- when do you make the decision as a company to say, hey, we got to go on there and do something with the stock and do a tender offer, buy some stock or something? Because I mean it's getting to the point, I think, where I think the market needs to see that, to some degree, that you're serious about what's going on here and you back it up, right? So I'm wondering if you can talk about that a little bit.Jeremiah J. FlemingWell, I know you're a large shareholder. You know I'm a large shareholder. And of course, that is never far from top of mind. What I'll tell you right at the moment, and we've had questions about this, and I've had conversations with the Board of Directors. At the moment, we've made -- really, our first job, in my opinion, and the director's opinion, job one, get these products out the door, get them working, build the momentum, right? Let's put our investment in that. If we do not get rewarded for our performance, let's take some shares out of the market. That's the general feeling.Operator(Operator Instructions) We have one question coming from Chris Schreiber with Taglich.Chris SchreiberI just had a couple of real quick questions and a follow-up to Maj's. How many employees do you have right now in the company?Jeremiah J. FlemingCarolyn, can I defer to you on that? Around 70. But Carolyn might give a...Carolyn DavidThat is correct. We're right around 70.Chris SchreiberAnd the 70 -- so you have 4 business lines. Do they interchange business lines? Or is there a specific number towards one business?Jeremiah J. FlemingYes, that's a good question. So let me try to answer it as best as I can. So we have -- there's a kind of a wide big group of, I'll call, shared services, right, that includes G&amp;A and support services and deployment services that cuts across all the businesses, and they're cross-trained. And then we have specific areas of focus mostly on the sales and marketing side and then on the development side as well. So sales and marketing, on one hand, for those lines of business, plus development because the developers are specialized in those -- each of those 4 lines of business. And so that's how we're able to accomplish that. And specifically, let me address Fiserv. For example, we don't have a tremendous number of resources on Fiserv because they have a tremendous number of resources on our solutions, so it does vary on how much we put into a particular LOB.Chris SchreiberOkay. And then I have one other question. Just following up on what Maj's comments were. I see that you -- I assume you don't have an IR consultant anymore. What are you doing? I'm sorry. Go ahead.Jeremiah J. FlemingGo ahead. Sorry, I thought you were done. I apologize.Chris SchreiberSo what are you doing to go out and tell the story? I understand you were at that Vegas conference. But do you have anyone to plate inside or outside that's dedicated to getting out and telling the story?Jeremiah J. FlemingWell, we don't at the moment. But I will have to tell you, there is a method to the madness and I'm not sure if you're affiliated with IR firms. But the money we were spending with the IR firm, there was not the return on the investment. And so we have to make decisions. I'm not going to put money into an IR firm to not bring any new shareholders into the fold. Are we going to put that money into the business to grow it? At which time, we're going to start attracting new shareholders as a result of our business performance, and that was the decision that I made.Chris SchreiberOkay. Well, respectfully, it doesn't hurt to get out on the road, whether you're hiring an IR guy or you just getting out into conferences and talking to investors.Jeremiah J. FlemingI hear you. I would -- not sure I agree with you, but I hear you.Chris SchreiberOkay. Well, Jerry, let me just -- let me touch upon this. Like if you look at all the old transcripts, I think this is the first time in probably 3 years you've had more than 1 or 2 perhaps. This is the first time in 3 years, I think, that you've had 3 guys on the call.Jeremiah J. FlemingSo [lease] question. So you're absolutely correct. Yes. But is there a question there?Chris SchreiberYes. But I mean -- so it's like -- I think you guys have got to look at that, right?Jeremiah J. FlemingOkay. I'm not sure what the comment is. We have more than 3 people on the call, so I'm not sure what the comment is.Chris SchreiberWell, guys that ask questions. If you look at the old transcripts, you can see that. And I'm just telling you, I just really believe you need to go out and find new investors. And if you don't have a good IR firm, find somebody. Just this is my...Jeremiah J. FlemingWe're well aware of that. I'm not sure -- I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be argumentative. I'm not sure what the argument is. So we don't have an IR firm, yet we have more people asking questions. I'm not sure how that ties in with the argument that we should have an IR firm. Sorry, I don't understand.Chris SchreiberI'm friends with Neil. That's why I'm in the stock, okay?Jeremiah J. FlemingOkay. Neil is a good IR man.Chris SchreiberAnd I know [Brett], and I'm just being very direct with you. Like I've been buying stock and I'm very frustrated as an investor. And if you just look at all the last transcripts and all the acquisitions and all of the -- hey, we're going to do this, this and this, it's extremely frustrating. If you're an investor for -- you've been there for 15 years, I think. You guys have got to get out and tell the story. I'm just being very -- I'm trying to be respectful. It's just very frustrating. It's kind of like (inaudible)Jeremiah J. FlemingI hear you. Can we have a one-on-one call? I think that might be more productive, if you don't mind. I'm certainly interested in your perspective, yes. But I would love to have that with you.Chris SchreiberOkay. Thank you.Jeremiah J. FlemingAnd I don't disagree with you. Don't get me wrong. I don't disagree. What I was trying to say is that at the moment, right, while we're building this market, that we still have to make the decision where the best use of our expenses are. And that my decision what the best use wasn't at this moment on IR. Now this is a temporary situation. I'm not expecting -- we're not going to -- we'll never have an IR firm. I'm just saying at the moment. But well, you and I can talk about that and more than happy to hear your input.OperatorOkay. We have no further questions in queue. I'd like to turn it back to management for any closing remarks.Jeremiah J. FlemingOkay. Well, thank you, operator. And yes, so apparently, guys, we will take a look at the IR situation. I'll say that. It sounds like tongue in cheek, but I'm serious about that. And we certainly do appreciate your participation. I just want to reiterate at the moment, we are focused, heads down, get these solutions out the door, start building momentum, that everyone can see that's demonstrated in terms of revenue. That is what we're focused on. And so we certainly look forward to giving you guys updates on our subsequent calls and hopefully demonstrating that performance. So thank you very much, everyone, for participating.Carolyn DavidThank you, everyone.OperatorThis concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.]"

This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home ""The most important lever for almost all our employees' compensation upside is the stock price,"" Capossela wrote in a chat with employees last week on an internal social networking tool called Yammer. ""So great quarterly results contribute to making the stock attractive which in turn drives everyone's total compensation up.""Microsoft told employees earlier this month that, due to economic conditions, the company will not provide raises for full-time salaried employees. This comes after the company announced it would layoff 10,000 employees through the end of March (thought some some reports are finding Microsoft is still making cuts past its self-mandated deadline).""Our current employee count is around 250k people which is a large increase year over year. So the painful job eliminations and the difficult decision to not increase salaries this year has the effect of slowing down a large increase in our people investments,"" Capossela wrote in another message to staff on Yammer on Tuesday (A Microsoft spokesperson told Fortune that the most recent disclosed headcount is actually 221,000). ""We are still investing heavily in our people as well as in our data center capacity to hopefully position us well for the Al transformation.""With company morale bruised by cost cutting, internal criticism of Microsoft management is growing, particularly among employees who feel the burden is not being shouldered equally between workers and executives. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella received a 10% pay raise in 2022, raising his total compensation to $55 million.Story continuesLast week, Capossela sold $2.85 million worth of stock, adding to the $1.55 million worth of shares that he sold the week prior, MarketWatch reported. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the CMO sold a total of 5,000 shares last Tuesday at an average price of $308.705 and on Wednesday, he sold another 4,177 shares at an average price of $312.905. None of the stock sales were through pre-arranged stock trading plans, which Microsoft does not require of its executives in contrast to many other companies.A Microsoft spokesperson said that Capossela was not available for comments, and said that Capossela's ""holdings significantly exceed the holding requirements set by the Microsoft Board of Directors. This sale is part of Chris’ personal planning and does not reflect any change in his dedication to the company's success.""According to screenshots of the conversation viewed by Fortune, an employee asked leadership what the rationale was behind not providing raises for employees given that Microsoft's net income in the most recent quarter increased 9% year-over-year. Microsoft is also pouring massive amounts of money into A.I. technology and on acquisitions such as the pending $69 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard.""The same principles apply to the senior leadership team and me. This will be reflected both in the absence of salary increases and in the level of annual performance-based bonuses for the SLT [senior leadership team], which will be substantially lower than last year,"" Capossela wrote in response to one questioner in the chat. ""Of course, I'm not asking you to agree with the decision (these are tough calls being made during a very turbulent macro-economic environment), but I hope this helps explain a little of the rationale as to why.""This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

    Wednesday, May 17, 2023Senators want to regulate AI before it gets too big. They're running out of time.If the senators gathered for the Senate Judiciary Committee’s hearing on AI on Tuesday seem to agree on one thing, it’s that they don’t want to miss the opportunity to regulate AI like they did social media.Throughout the hearing, which included testimony by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, IBM (IBM) Chief Privacy and Trust Officer Christina Montgomery, and NYU professor Gary Marcus, senators repeatedly pointed to Congress’ failure to regulate social media or pass any kind of meaningful data privacy legislation.The gist of the legislators’ warnings came down to the potential for AI being used to influence consumers, generate disinformation, or reinforce bias.“We had the same choice when we faced social media. We failed to seize that moment,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said. “Now we have the obligation to do it on AI before the threats and risks become real.”Fears that AI will be misusedDuring the hearing, Altman, Montgomery, and Marcus each told the gathered senators that Congress should put at least some kind legislation into place to govern the use of AI. Altman and Marcus in particular called for a new regulatory body that could provide the appropriate licenses for companies to deploy different types of AI.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks before a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law hearing on artificial intelligence, Tuesday, May 16, 2023, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Without those, the witnesses said, AI could present its own unique set of problems.“Fundamentally, these new systems are going to be destabilizing,” Marcus said in his opening testimony. “They can and will create persuasive lies at a scale humanity's never seen before. Outsiders will use them to affect our elections. Insiders to manipulate our markets and our political systems. Democracy itself is threatened.”Altman, for his part, said he has his own set of fears about AI. “I think if this technology goes wrong, it could go quite wrong,” he said. “And we want to be vocal about that. We want to work with the government to prevent that from happening.”Story continuesSen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), meanwhile, questioned whether AI could be used to influence public opinion.Calls for social media regulation but no actionFor years members of Congress have called for stricter regulations over social media content.Politicians have called for companies like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to be stripped or depleted of their Section 230 protections. Others have pushed for the establishment of comprehensive data privacy legislation to protect users’ online information.There’s a handful of reasons social media has avoided regulations, including a lack of consensus on just how to do it. Section 230, which serves as the backbone of the modern internet, is a frequent target of both Democrats and Republicans. But neither side can agree on why.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks during a keynote address announcing ChatGPT integration for Bing on February 7, 2023. (Photo by Jason Redmond / AFP) (JASON REDMOND via Getty Images)Democrats say they want to hold sites accountable for what their users post, especially when it comes to disinformation, while Republicans say they want to go after sites for over-moderating content.Privacy regulation, meanwhile, has been in the works for years, but here we are in 2023 and there’s no true national data privacy law.There’s potentialWhile Congress hasn’t been able to pull anything together with regards to social media or privacy, it looks as though there might be hope for AI regulation.In addition to Altman and Montgomery calling for regulation, senators were largely open to ideas about how to deploy AI responsibly. And unlike hearings about social media when lawmakers have been hostile to witnesses such as Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg or former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, the senators were generally calm and thoughtful in their comments.Still, it’ll likely be some time before any kind of regulation sees the light of day. Blumenthal himself said that Tuesday’s hearing was the first of a number to come. But with the pace at which AI is advancing, that could be too long for Congress to wait.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

34,3cc1190a-5982-3b2d-ba38-9c415d60ff39,ADM,2023-05-18,Investors Heavily Search Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-archer-daniels-130001580.html,1684328401,STORY,['ADM'],"[Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this agribusiness giant have returned -11.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Agriculture - Operations industry, which ADM falls in, has lost 8.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.ADM is expected to post earnings of $1.58 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -26.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -6.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.83 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -13%. This estimate has changed +1.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.18 indicates a change of -9.5% from what ADM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.9%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, ADM is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ADM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of ADM, the consensus sales estimate of $25.13 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -7.9%. The $97.95 billion and $98.13 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -3.8% and +0.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryADM reported revenues of $24.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.8%. EPS of $2.09 for the same period compares with $1.90 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.48 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.52%. The EPS surprise was +22.22%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.ADM is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ADM. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Hunt Transport Services, Archer-Daniels-Midland, NVIDIA, Tractor Supply and AmerisourceBergen",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-com-featured-highlights-j-120712007.html,1684325232,STORY,"['TSCO', '^GSPC', 'NXT', 'LGND', 'IDCC', 'TMHC', 'ADM']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – May 17, 2023 – Stocks in this week’s article are J.B. Hunt Transport Services JBHT, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. ADM, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Tractor Supply Co. TSCO and AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC.Load Up on These 5 Exceptional Relative Price Strength StocksLately, the market has been spooked by concerns of a near-term recession. The S&amp;P 500 index fell 1.1% last week, marking its second consecutive weekly decline. Weak economic data also dented investors' confidence in risky assets like equities.In particular, consumer sentiment slumped to a six-month low in May. This is not good news for the American economy, as weak sentiment may result in a contraction in consumer spending going forward. Investors should know that consumer spending is the biggest driver of the U.S. economy, constituting more than 2/3 of its GDP.On the other hand, the specter of inflation appears to be waning. However, we should avoid painting an overly optimistic picture by overstating the improvements. While we are well off the peaks we saw in 2022, we have apparently hit a bed of resistance. In other words, inflation is indeed coming down, but slowly. It means that another small rate hike cannot be ruled out.We believe that more visibility regarding the future market direction will only be available post first-quarter 2023 earnings season, along with management guidance and business outlook.Till then, investors who want to stay exposed to the equity setup should focus on good investment opportunities. One of the ways such potential plays could be identified is to look for signs of relative price strength.Relative Price Strength StrategyEarnings growth and valuation multiples are indeed important for investors to determine a stock's ability to offer considerable returns. But these are also essential for determining whether a stock's price performance is better than its peers or the industry average. If a stock's performance is lacking that of the broader groups, despite impressive earnings growth or valuation multiples, then something must be wrong.Story continuesIt's always advisable to stay away from these stocks and bet on those that are outperforming their respective industry or benchmark. This is because betting on a winner always proves to be lucrative.Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&amp;P 500 for 1 to 3 months at least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter's (Q1) earnings to our screen. When a stock undergoes an upward revision, it leads to additional price gains.Here are five of the 14 stocks that made it through the screen:InterDigital, Inc.: This is a pioneer in advanced mobile technologies that enables wireless communications and capabilities.

Continued demand for vehicles and robust product line-up is set to fuel sales volumes of Toyota. To capitalize on the accelerated global shift to green cars, the auto giant is deepening focus on manufacturing electric and fuel-cell vehicles, which will bolster the company's product competitiveness.Toyota Motor's commitment to return capital to shareholders and upbeat fiscal 2024 view spark confidence. However, commodity cost inflation is expected to weigh on gross margins. Supply-chain disruptions and a tough labor market will play spoilsports.Unfavorable foreign currency translations and high R&amp;D expenses are also likely to limit profits. Also, elevated leverage of the firm may restrict its financial flexibility to tap onto growth opportunities. Thus, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.(You can read the full research report on Toyota Motor here &gt;&gt;&gt;)NextEra Energy shares have outperformed the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry over the past year (+8.3% vs. -7.3%).

The merger of Gulf Power and FPL strengthens NextEra's position in Florida. FPL's customer base is expanding as Florida's economy improves and continues to boost demand for its services.NextEra has ample liquidity to meet its near-term debt obligations and efficient debt management acts as a tailwind. NEE is expanding its operation in water space through acquisition.  However, due to the nature of its business, it is subject to complex regulations.

The Zacks analyst expects the top line to grow 3.9% year over year in 2023.Multiple buyouts aided it in increasing patient volumes, enabled network expansion, added hospitals to its portfolio and boosted business scale. It has been gaining from its telemedicine business line. HCA resorts to prudent capital deployment via buybacks and dividends. As of Mar 31, 2023, it had $3.7 billion left under its buyback authorization.However, the company's escalating operating expenses have been weighing on the margins.

With this, GS underreported the credit risks associated with its RWAs for eight straight quarters from 2019 to 2021.Particularly, RWAs are measures of the riskiness of a bank and are used to calculate a bank’s capital requirements. Hence, by underestimating risk-weighted assets, GS reported higher-than-actual capital ratios.""The bank reported wrongly calculated figures to the ECB, therefore preventing the ECB from having a comprehensive view of its risk profile,"" it added in a statement.The lapse and the bank’s inability of detecting this mistake also highlight deficiencies in its internal controls.Goldman said in a statement that it had ""closely cooperated with the ECB"" and ""taken all necessary steps"" to address the issue.Last week, Goldman reached a settlement deal by agreeing to pay $215 million in a class-action lawsuit alleging that the firm underpaid women.Goldman continues to face many investigations and lawsuits from investors and regulators. Though the company resolved certain litigations related to the sale of risky mortgage-backed securities, many of the cases are yet to be resolved. All these are expected to lead to increased expenses and litigation provisions in the near term.Over the past six months, shares of GS have declined 15.4% compared with the industry’s fall of 17%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Currently, GS carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

40,e66e076f-6e5b-35ca-bef8-7db85d601647,GPN,2023-05-18,David Einhorn’s 2023 Portfolio: Top 15 Stock Picks,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/david-einhorn-2023-portfolio-top-111717150.html,1684408637,STORY,"['GLRE', 'GPK', 'THC', 'CEIX', 'LIVN', 'CPRI', 'SWN', 'ODP', 'BKI', 'GPN']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the top 15 stock picks of David Einhorn's 2023 portfolio. For more stock picks, head on over to David Einhorn's 2023 Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks. After the unexpected beating that investors and the stock market took in 2022, 2023 is turning out to be a relatively stable year. Last year was an absolute bloodbath that reminded many of the stock market crash in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. Major stock market and high growth sectors crashed as investors rushed to the safety of bank deposits due to a high inflationary and interest rate environment.Fast forward to 2023 and the general feeling in the market is to simply wait for a recession and get it over with. The Federal Reserve's fight against inflation which saw it rapidly increase interest rates is starting to make its impact. Inflation has broken a consistent upward trend and the labor market might be slowing down as well. On the latter, the unemployment rate which as consistently been dropping since 2021 has finally started to change this trend as well. The latest data from the Labor Department shows that for April 2023, the unemployment rate remained static at 3.4% showing that the labor market might finally be slowing down in the pain of interest rate hikes.In this environment, it makes sense to take a look at what investment professionals are doing. Hedge funds recently disclosed their Q1'2023 holdings data. One such fund whose filings just hit the web is David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital. The hedge fund, set up in 1996, has a portfolio worth $1.8 billion as of the first quarter of this year. Like several other hedge fund managers, Mr. Einhorn set up the fund on his own and had significant help from his parents who lent him nearly half a million dollars for the startup capital. His fund was so successful that it did not post an annual loss for more than two decades since being set up. However, Mr. Einhorn, like many others, failed to foresee the 2008 financial crisis and ended up losing 23% during the year. Yet, he was quick to recover and ended up reversing these losses in just a year in 2009.Story continuesThe hedge fund's see-saw with the financial markets has continued since then. As the markets crashed due to the pandemic, Greenlight ended up losing 21.5% in 2020. Yet, in 2022, as the broader markets tumbled, the hedge fund worked its magic and returned investors a whopping 36.6% at a time when nearly everyone else was bleeding. The returns highlighted his prudent stock picking approach, as he correctly read market sentiment and plowed into value stocks right when they were about to take off.While Mr. Einhorn did set up a hedge fund without having any experience in the stock market, he nevertheless also had exposure to the financial world from an early age. This is because his father had set up his own venture capital fund and his brother also worked in the finance industry. Safe to say, the Einhorns is a financially astute family that knows the ins and outs of the industry.Despite this, the hedge fund boss's career is not without mistakes. For instance, Einhorn sold his Apple stake in 2018 after worries about a Chinese retaliation in response to U.S. tariffs. However, as we know, Apple's shares have tripled in value since then, and Greenlight Capital has missed out on hundreds of millions of dollars in potential gains.Recalling the decision years later, he called it the worst mistake of his career and shared:That's probably the worst sale of my entire career. If we just kept that Apple stock at that value — because we were literally talking about a $1 billion company or something like that, we probably owned a couple percent of it — that would have been really awesome if we had just kept that.While he might have exited Apple, investors still trust him with billions of dollars in investment. Today, we'll look at some top stock picks of Greenlight Capital, out of which the top three picks are CONSOL Energy Inc. (NYSE:CEIX), Green Brick Partners, Inc. (NYSE:GRBK), and Brighthouse Financial, Inc.

41,f5f8dddd-bd7d-3b48-8c9f-16a97b43da74,GPN,2023-05-18,Global Payments' (NYSE:GPN) Dividend Will Be $0.25,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-payments-nyse-gpn-dividend-110721047.html,1684408041,STORY,['GPN'],"[The board of Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 30th of June, with investors receiving $0.25 per share. This payment means the dividend yield will be 1.0%, which is below the average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Global Payments Global Payments Is Paying Out More Than It Is EarningIf it is predictable over a long period, even low dividend yields can be attractive. Global Payments is not generating a profit, but its free cash flows easily cover the dividend, leaving plenty for reinvestment in the business. In general, cash flows are more important than the more traditional measures of profit so we feel pretty comfortable with the dividend at this level.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 117.5%. If the dividend continues on its recent course, the company could be paying out several times what it earns in the next 12 months, which could start applying pressure to the balance sheet.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityWhile the company has been paying a dividend for a long time, it has cut the dividend at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.04 total annually to $1.00. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 38% per annum over that time. Despite the rapid growth in the dividend over the past number of years, we have seen the payments go down the past as well, so that makes us cautious.The Dividend Has Limited Growth PotentialGrowing earnings per share could be a mitigating factor when considering the past fluctuations in the dividend. Global Payments' earnings per share has shrunk at 24% a year over the past five years. This steep decline can indicate that the business is going through a tough time, which could constrain its ability to pay a larger dividend each year in the future. However, the next year is actually looking up, with earnings set to rise. We would just wait until it becomes a pattern before getting too excited.Story continuesThe Dividend Could Prove To Be UnreliableOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. The payments haven't been particularly stable and we don't see huge growth potential, but with the dividend well covered by cash flows it could prove to be reliable over the short term. This company is not in the top tier of income providing stocks.Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

Also, its favorable growth estimates are confidence boosters for investors.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceGPN currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). In the past six months, the stock has gained 2.5% compared with the industry’s rise of 9.4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOptimistic Growth ProjectionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for GPN’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $10.35, indicating an 11.1% increase from the year-ago reported figure of $9.32. The same for GPN’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $8.6 billion, indicating a 6.7% increase from the year-ago reported figure of $8.1 billion.Growth DriversGlobal Payments is a Fortune 500 leading payments technology company providing software and services to financial institutions across 170 countries. GPN has been witnessing growth in revenues over the last few years, banking on improving cross-border, domestic corporate travel and transaction volumes.Merchant Solutions contributed 69.1% to the total revenues in 2022, and this figure is expected to grow further as transaction fees will boost on the back of volume growth. Adjusted net revenue growth in the Merchant Solutions segment is estimated to stay at the higher end of the 15-16% range in 2023. The segment is set to benefit from strength in technology-enabled businesses and the recovery of Asia-Pacific business.The company expects to deliver 5-6% net revenue growth in the Issuer Solutions segment in 2023, owing to exceptional first-quarter performance and a solid conversion pipeline. MineralTree and Netspend B2B business will grow at low double digits, benefiting the segment. Global Payments has signed multi-year extensions with M&amp;T Bank and has nine letters of intent, which will fuel growth in the future.The company does not hesitate to boost its global footprint with ambitious acquisitions. It acquired EVO Payments, Inc. in August 2022, a leading payments and services provider offering a plethora of solutions to merchants in the United States and Europe. This acquisition expands GPN’s geographic presence, supplements its business-to-business and most importantly, supports its technology-based payments strategy.Story continuesGlobal Payments divested the consumer portion of its Netspend business, aiming to focus on its core corporate customers. The company also entered into a definitive agreement to sell its gaming business. This highlights the company’s unwavering focus on building up its core operations. These moves should lead to lower expenses and improve the bottom line in future.GPN focuses on top-tier strategic partnerships to grow its business. It has partnered with AWS to deploy cloud-based analytics and data platform for financial institutions. The company has also inked a deal with Mondu to serve financial services customers across use cases, like prepaid cards, lending solutions and credit cards. GPN has also collaborated with leading parks and entertainment companies to provide beverage and Xenial food solutions.The company’s financial flexibility enables it to invest in technology, strategic partnerships and return capital to shareholders. GPN exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2,001.7 million, way above the current portion of long-term debt of $1,185.3 million. It bought back shares worth $200 million in the first quarter of 2023.An increase in the capacity of the company’s share buyback program was made to bring the total authorization amount to $1,295.7 million. Hence, a strong financial position remains an additional tailwind for Global Payments. This should instill confidence in shareholders.The company has a VGM Score of B.Key ConcernsHowever, there are a few factors that have been impeding the stock’s growth lately.Rising operating expenses are also harming the company’s margins. Despite cost management efforts, operating expenses rose 25.6% year over year. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive growth in the long term.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the Financial Transaction Services space are Paysafe Limited PSFE, Remitly Global, Inc.

MAT is likely to benefit from digital initiatives, strong demand for Hot Wheels and cost-saving program. Also, the emphasis on licensing agreements bodes well. However, inflationary pressures are a concern.Let us discuss the factors that highlight why investors should retain the stock for the time being.Factors Likely to Drive GrowthMattel has been undertaking efforts on the digital front and focusing on better execution of marketing and promotional initiatives. The company formed a brand development framework to unlock the scale and profitability of its brands and modernize them for the digital world. The company is making significant progress to transform Mattel into an IP-driven high-performing toy company.During the first quarter of 2023, the company stated progress on capturing the full value of its IP in its business verticals outside the toy aisle. During the quarter, the company announced a licensing agreement for Disney's Wish (releasing in November 2023). It also announced the Hot Wheels ultimate challenge primetime show on NBC and the Barbie Dreamhouse challenge (a new home makeover competition series) on HGTV. The company emphasized on licensing agreements with Disney (with respect to Little Mermaid dolls) and Hasbro to drive growth.The company has been witnessing an improving sales trend for Hot Wheels and is quite confident about the brand’s long-term prospects. During first-quarter 2023, gross billings at the Hot Wheels brand rose 1% (on a reported basis) and 2% (at constant-currency basis) year over year. In International, sales at Hot Wheels rose 4.6% year over year to $125.2 million.Mattel is also focused on cost-saving efforts to boost the bottom line. Through its current cost-saving program, the company is focused on expanding margins. It simplifies its organization structure, optimizing processes and supply chain to generate savings across operations. The program contributed $21 million of incremental savings to the cost of goods for the first quarter of 2023. The company anticipates the program to deliver additional savings of $300 million by 2023.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchShares of Mattel have gained 11.6% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 5.2% growth.ConcernsMattel has been continuously incurring increased expenses, which have been detrimental to margins. During the first quarter of 2023, adjusted gross margin contracted 660 basis points year over year to 40%. The downside was mainly caused by inventory management efforts, including higher close-out sales and inventory obsolescence expenses, cost inflation and unfavorable fixed cost absorption. The company anticipates the challenging macroeconomic environment to persist for some time.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksMattel currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are MGM Resorts International MGM, Marriott International, Inc.

The continued integration of TSI Healthcare also looks promising for the stock.However, NextGen’s year-over-year decline in Support and maintenance revenues was worrying.

The optimism, led by a solid first-quarter 2023 performance and its focus on patient monitoring, is expected to contribute further. However, concerns regarding overdependence on Masimo SET and stiff competition persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 24.5% compared with the industry’s 4.7% rise and the S&amp;P 500's 5% growth.The renowned global provider of non-invasive monitoring systems has a market capitalization of $8.99 billion. The company projects 3.7% growth for 2023 and expects to maintain its strong performance. Masimo has delivered an earnings surprise of 9.9% for the past four quarters, on average. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Let’s delve deeper.Strong Q1 Results: Masimo’s solid first-quarter 2023 results buoy our optimism. The company recorded a robust uptick in the top line, its healthcare business and order shipments in the reported period. The expansion of the company’s installed base was also seen. On the first-quarter earnings call in May, Masimo’s management confirmed having new customers in its pulse oximetry business, and witnessed increasing traction for rainbow and advanced parameter products, which strengthened the healthcare revenues in the quarter.Product Pipeline: We are upbeat about Masimo’s product pipeline. In May, it announced the launch of Stork, a home baby-monitoring system. The system offers parents insights into their baby’s health data, thereby helping them learn more about and be better connected with their baby.In March, Masimo unveiled the newest addition to its wearable product line, the Masimo Freedom smartwatch.Patient-Monitoring in Focus: On the first-quarter 2023 earnings call, Masimo’s management confirmed that its Healthcare revenues in the quarter were driven by a strong performance from Masimo’s rainbow blood constituent monitoring, SedLine and O3 brain monitoring, and Nomoline capnography and gas monitoring products.Story continuesIn January, Masimo announced the limited market release of Visual Clinical Activity Monitoring, a video analysis system that uses artificial intelligence to help facilitate compliance with hospital hand hygiene protocols.DownsidesOverdependence on Masimo SET: Masimo currently derives the majority of its revenues from its primary product offerings like the Masimo SET platform, Masimo rainbow SET platform and related products. Thus, the company’s business is highly dependent on the continued success and market acceptance of its primary product offerings.Stiff Competition: Masimo operates in an intensely competitive medical device industry and is significantly affected by product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. The Masimo SET platform faces additional competition from companies developing products for use with third-party monitoring systems and from companies currently marketing their pulse oximetry monitors.Estimate TrendMasimo has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings per share has moved 8.9% north to $4.76.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $556.9 million, suggesting a 1.5% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

HOLX recently teamed up with the NFL draft cornerback (CB) Kelee Ringo, and his mother, Tralee Hale, a breast cancer survivor. The partnership is set to educate women on the importance of prioritizing annual mammograms and other key health screenings.The collaboration, scheduled to begin during National Women’s Health Week (May 14-20, 2023), will also see the launch of The Tralee &amp; Kelee Ringo Family Foundation. The establishment will strive to eradicate triple-negative breast cancer, a particularly aggressive form of breast cancer that disproportionately affects women of color.This latest collaboration is expected to publicize the company’s Breast Health division product line.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNews on the PartnershipIn the United States, breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed among women. In its news release, HOLX cited recent studies which show that the rate of routine breast cancer screenings has not fully recovered after sharp declines during the pandemic. Per a report, black women in the United States are almost 40% more likely to die from breast cancer than non-Hispanic white women despite having a similar incidence rate of this disease.Speaking of the collaboration, Hale recalled the story of not prioritizing her preventive care screenings amid family commitments and other responsibilities. Per a representative at the company, the NFL rookie and his mother will be sharing their personal story to make women aware of the critical importance of annual breast cancer screenings and making their health a priority.Recent UpdatesDuring the fiscal 2023 second-quarter earnings call, Hologic mentioned that the strategic addition of growth drivers across the company throughout the pandemic is contributing to its top line. Per HOLX, innovative products and services are accretive to the company’s overall strength within markets, forging strong relationships with customers.Hologic’s Breast Health division reported strong growth in the fiscal second quarter, after a consistent decline in the last four quarters. The demand for Hologic’s clinically differentiated mammography instruments remains remarkably high, ending the quarter with a strong order backlog.Story continuesThe interventional side of the Breast Health business grew, backed by HOLX’s disposable portfolio, including Brevera biopsy needles and Somatex Tumark markers. The semiconductor chip availability continues to improve, allowing the delivery of more gantries in the quarter than planned.Within Hologic’s Diagnostics business, Molecular Diagnostics continues to lead the way. The expanded global installed base of Panthers represents the catalyst for the division's sustained growth. Panther’s superior workflow combined with the broad menu of nearly 20 FDA-approved assays across the Panther and Panther Fusion systems differentiates HOLX from others.Industry ProspectPer a research report, the global breast cancer market size was valued at $31.89 billion in 2022 and is expected to witness a CAGR of 10.4% by 2030.Price PerformanceIn the past six months, Hologic has mostly outperformed the industry.

CRL is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by strategic acquisitions and the robust performance of the Discovery and Safety Assessment (“DSA”) segment. The company’s recently released 2023 first-quarter results instill investors’ optimism. However, the nonhuman primate (NHP) supply situation and foreign exchange headwinds do not bode well for the Charles River.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 16.4% compared with the 19.1% fall of the industry and a 5.6% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.Operating as a full-service, early-stage contract research organization, Charles River has a market capitalization of $9.84 billion. The company has an earnings yield of 5.33% compared with the industry’s 1.99%. CRL surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an average earnings surprise of 5.39%.Let’s delve deeper.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUpsidesImpressive Q1 Performance: Charles River exited the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Revenues improved 12.6% year over year, while organic revenues grew 15.4%. This was driven by the robust DSA performance and solid RMS growth.Based on the strong first-quarter performance, Charles River narrowed its 2023 guidance for organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share.Strategic Acquisitions Drive Growth: Charles River broadens the scope of products and services across the drug discovery and early-stage development continuum through focused acquisitions.The acquisition of Cognate in March 2021 is highly complementary to the company’s Biologics business. The buyout established Charles River as a premier scientific partner in cell and gene therapy development, testing and manufacturing.Within RMS, the company acquired Explora Biolabs in April 2022. San Diego-based Explora has a similar focus like Charles River Accelerator and Development Lab. It is currently operating more than 15 preclinical vivarium facilities with a greater presence on the West Coast.Story continuesDSA Arm Continues to Thrive: The segment reported a 23.6% organic revenue rise in the first quarter of 2023. The increase was driven by broad-based growth in the Safety Assessment business on favorable base pricing, with NHP pass-throughs and higher study volumes.DownsidesNHP Supply Issue: On Feb 17, Charles River received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice over an investigation into the supply of NHPs from Cambodia, which are part of the animal research services the company offers to drug developers.Compelled by the heightened focus and ongoing investigations, the company decided to voluntarily suspend its planned future shipments of Cambodian NHPs. This will continue until the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service can develop and implement new procedures to reinforce confidence that NHPs it imports from Cambodia are purpose-bred. This will take time to implement, and the duration of which is unknown.Foreign Exchange Translation Affects Sales: Foreign exchange is a major headwind for CRL due to a considerable percentage of its revenues coming from outside the United States. The strengthening of the Euro and some other developed market currencies has been constantly hampering the company’s performance in international markets. The impact of foreign currency translation reduced reported revenue growth by 2.1% in the first quarter.Estimate TrendCharles River has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 9.9% up to $10.25 in the past seven days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $4.10 billion, suggesting a 3.1% decline from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Zimmer Biomet ZBH, Penumbra PEN and Hologic, Inc. HOLX.Zimmer Biomet, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present, has an earnings yield of 5.42% compared to the industry’s -1.86%.

Plus, the $6.99 plan, which launched with 720p video quality and just single-device viewing, recently got an upgrade that includes higher 1080p video quality and allowance for two concurrent streams.Netflix’s ad-supported plan, by the digits6: Months since the ad-supported plan launched12: Number of countries “Basic with Ads” was made available in when it launched, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Spain, the UK, and the US34: Median age of Netflix’s monthly active usersDoubled: Growth in ads member base since early this yearMore than a quarter: Share of Netflix sign ups that now choose the ads plan in countries where its available, according to co-CEO Greg Peters80%: Share of ad-supported members’ viewing that happens through a TV70%: Share of ad-supported members between the ages of 18 and 49Four times: How much more likely viewers are to engage with an ad on Netflix, versus other streamers, according to TV outcomes measurement platform EDO, Inc.Four and a half times: How much more likely viewers are to engage with an ad on Netflix compared to linear TVStory continuesQuotable: Netflix’s ads are handled with care“We treat our ads with the same care we treat our incredible content: serving them locally; seamlessly transitioning between shows and ads with no latency; and implementing industry-leading frequency caps with an ad load of four to five minutes per hour.”—Jeremi Gorman, president of worldwide advertising at Netflix, speaking at the Upfront eventThe Netflix advertising opportunity for brandsAt Upfront, Netflix announced brands are getting two new sponsorship opportunities to get in the game, including sponsoring “some of Netflix’s most popular series on Netflix at launch,” as well as “featuring their campaigns within local holidays (e.g. Valentine’s Day) and key brand moments (e.g. Sustainability Stories).” The opportunities will be available first in the US, with other countries to follow.Netflix also said its platform offers opportunities to get more creative with ads. For instance, co-CEO Ted Sarandos suggested that a 30-minute commercial could be created, playing out over several days in short bursts as viewers start and stop viewing. “You can’t do that on linear TV because people don’t live on one channel. Now, this isn’t going to happen next week, maybe not even next year. And it’s just one idea,” he said at the event. One more thing: Netflix’s password-sharing crackdownSince multiple users can share the same Netflix account, the monthly average user count is not an exact number, as TechCrunch points out. Netflix’s crackdown on password-sharing could not only boost numbers, but also tilt the scales in favor of the most affordable ads plan while doing so. Since “Basic with ads” launched, there’s not been a lot of switching from premium tiers but the offering has still gained traction.The crackdown isn’t a priority right now, though. The giant is busy scrapping overall deals and canceling shows as the writers’ strike threatens to bring Hollywood to its knees.Related stories📺 Netflix is betting $2.5 billion on the South Korean culture machine💿 Netflix is hitting the stop button on the DVD rental business that started it all💰Disney+ is introducing ads but its plans aren’t getting any cheaperMore from QuartzThe world’s biggest banknote printer said the demand for cash hit a two-decade lowEvery fifth car sold worldwide this year will be electricSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

They now fear other potential deals in the drug sector - where many smaller firms are bought up by sector giants - may be imperiled.The FTC may also struggle to convince the judge hearing the case, Judge John Kness, who was nominated to the court by former President Donald Trump. While it is uncertain how Kness will view the case, judges appointed by Republican presidents are generally seen as more business-friendly in their approach.To be sure, some antitrust experts said they needed to see the FTC's evidence and how well it would stand up its complaint before guessing at the outcome.In its lawsuit the FTC said it believed Amgen could leverage its big selling drugs to pressure insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers to favor Horizon's two key products - the fast-growing thyroid eye disease treatment Tepezza and gout drug Krystexxa - over potential competitors.Story continuesThe FTC said it filed the lawsuit on behalf of patients who needed costly treatments for serious conditions who may be hurt by the deal. ""Our complaint is firmly rooted in longstanding antitrust law and we look forward to making our argument in court,"" an FTC spokesperson said.AMGEN OFFERS REMEDYAmgen said on Tuesday it had made an offer to the FTC in hopes of resolving the issue. ""We committed that we would not bundle the Horizon products raised as issues,"" Amgen said in a statement.That sort of commitment, often called a behavioral remedy, has fallen out of favor with antitrust enforcers who do not view such agreements as effective.The difficulty for the FTC is that the negotiations between pharmacy benefit managers and drug makers often result in lower prices for the drugs, said Andre Barlow of Doyle, Barlow and Mazard, PLLC.""The FTC will have a high hurdle to overcome with this complaint,"" he said. ""The antitrust laws do not condemn lower prices, rather they embrace them.""Seth Bloom of Bloom Strategic Counsel agreed that the FTC's theory was novel but said it was unclear how the case would be decided.""These are valid concerns that FTC has raised but what a court will do about it is uncertain,"" he said. ""The fact that it's a judge appointed by Trump who you would expect to be more conservative suggests that the FTC will have a more difficult road here.""(Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Sonali Paul)]"

For that, we want to bring in Kevin Mahn. He's Hennion &amp; Walsh Chief Investment Officer. It's great to see you here, Kevin.KEVIN MAHN: Seana.SEANA SMITH: I guess your big takeaway from the results that we're getting so far, the fact that we are seeing consumers pull back with their discretionary spending-- what that signals for what lies ahead.KEVIN MAHN: Yeah. What stood out to me was the forward looking guidance that both Walmart and Target provided, striking a very cautious tone about their outlook for consumer spending in the second, third, and fourth quarter. If the consumer does, in fact, start to curtail their spending, not only will it affect the earnings of retailers, but also the economy as a whole, remembering that 70% of GDP growth comes from consumer spending.However, there is a silver lining, though. If, in fact, the economy continues to slow due to a slowdown in earnings, the Fed is going to have to stop. I believe they hiked in May and will go away. And in all likelihood, by the end of this year, we'll start talking about cutting rates. And if, in fact, they're cutting rates during an economic slowdown, which could be a recessionary period, well, that creates opportunities for investors.AKIKO FUJITA: And, Kevin, we'll get some more of your thoughts on the Fed in just a bit. But going back to where retailers are right now, I do wonder what you make of the Street's reaction today. I mean, Target certainly giving a more cautious outlook. We are still seeing that stock up.I mean, is it at the end of the day about some of these big box names that are still able to offer sort of a diversified experience as opposed to some other retailers that are a lot more focus and could get hit further from a cautious consumer?Story continuesKEVIN MAHN: Yeah, absolutely. You have to look at those retailers that don't have as much of their revenue derived from discretionary items, much more in the staples items, the grocery items that you alluded to earlier. We also have to remember that during periods of economic slowdowns leading up to and through recessions, consumer staples stocks generally fare well.Walmart is an excellent example of a consumer staple based upon their large majority of their revenue that does come from staples related items such as groceries. So we would anticipate consumer staples companies, less so consumer discretionary, faring well, just as we would anticipate health care companies faring well during periods of economic slowdowns leading up to and through recessions. And those two sectors, Akiko, they also tend to fare pretty well during periods of interest rate cuts as well.So if you're looking to position your portfolio to take advantage of an upcoming interest rate declining cycle in addition to an economic slowdown, look to your consumer staples. Look to health care, and even look to technology companies with strong balance sheets.SEANA SMITH: Kevin, when it comes to some of the opportunities out there, we have really been stuck in this pretty tight trading range. And a lot of that has to do with the uncertainty that lies ahead. Earnings clearly has not been the catalyst to get us out of that range. What will be?KEVIN MAHN: I believe once we have confirmation that we've reached the end of this rate hike cycle, which I believe I already heard-- apparently some on Wall Street don't believe they have already heard, with the 25% probability of still yet another rate hike in June-- I believe that provides the catalyst to start looking for opportunities.And where do you look? Look for some of those names that were really beaten up in 2022 that should rebound and benefit the most from an end to this rate hike cycle. Earnings, we've had the second consecutive quarters now of negative earnings growth. Even according to the Fed's own projections, they believe the economy is only going to grow by 4/10 of 1% this year.Everything that they wanted to do with this massive and aggressive rate hiking campaign is now coming to fruition. The economy is slowing. Inflation is slowing, but still remaining well above their target. Now, we're going to get to see all the damage that all those rate hikes have actually inflicted on the economy.AKIKO FUJITA: So, Kevin, a potential pause that you're looking at. I also heard you say positioning yourself for an interest rate declining cycle. I mean, is that what you anticipate, at least in the near term future?KEVIN MAHN: Not in the near-term future. In fact, at the beginning of this year, I suggested that, in all likelihood, they were going to raise rates by 75 basis points during their first three meetings of 2023. Fortunately, I got that one right. At that point in time, once they hit that terminal rate of around 5% to 5.25%, I believed that they were going to stop, sit back, and reflect upon all the damage that they've done to the economy, and in all likelihood, wouldn't consider starting to cut rates until early 2024.That may have to take place at the end of 2023 at this point, depending upon how much the economy does slow and how much the consumer starts to rein in spending. Of course, on the other side, if inflation stays rampant or actually goes in the opposite direction and doesn't continue to moderate, well, the Fed may need to step back in. I do not believe that they will. I don't believe they're going to cut anytime soon. But by the end of this year, I believe that in all likelihood, they're going to start considering rate cuts.SEANA SMITH: Kevin, what about when it comes to rate hikes versus the pause here? The other side of the argument would be that a lot of the economic data has remained extremely strong, even what we've gotten out so far this week when it comes to housing, when it comes to yesterday's retail sales number-- that coming in better than expected. Do you think that, though, is going to give the Fed a little bit of pause just in terms of the headway that they have made on inflation?KEVIN MAHN: The Fed has been driven 100% to curtail inflation since March of last year, essentially telling investors that they were going to continue to raise rates, cut the size of their balance sheet until something broke. Well, now, something has broken-- certainly in the regional banking system.We've seen it impact the housing market. And now, it's trickling through to earnings. So what's really holding up this particular economy right now is the strength of the labor market. But, now we're starting to see some dents in the armor of the consumer.Just yesterday, we learned that we've hit an all time record in terms of consumer debt-- $17 trillion. Consumers are now dipping more into their personal savings, putting more on their credit cards to help keep up with these inflated prices. How much longer can that last?AKIKO FUJITA: So let's talk about some of the opportunities that you see in the market. Two names that stand out to me, both big pharma. What do you see there?KEVIN MAHN: Well, historically, based upon the research we've done at Smart Trust, the three sectors that perform best during periods of economic slowdowns accompanied by declining interest rates are health care, number one, consumer staples, and information technology. But there's two ways to play health care, right?One is through your traditional large cap pharmaceutical companies that are generally more defensive in nature. One name that we hold and happen to like is Merck-- pays an attractive dividend of over 2%, forward looking PE of just 17, and continues to be innovative in terms of the types of health care treatments they provide. Another way to play the health care sector is through smaller cap biotech companies. From an M&amp;A perspective, one name that we hold at smart trust is Rocket Pharmaceuticals-- about a $1.4 billion smaller cap biotech company that's using genetic therapies, such as gene editing, gene splicing, to cure rare and chronic diseases-- really at the cutting edge of health care innovation in our country right now.That's a little bit more growth oriented. Obviously, the larger cap pharmaceuticals are a little bit more defensive oriented. But the combination of those two should fare well over the next two years.SEANA SMITH: Kevin, you mentioned M&amp;A there. And the FTC blocking Amgen's deal to buy--KEVIN MAHN: Very aggressive.SEANA SMITH: --to buy Horizon Therapeutics. How do you look at a move like that as an investor given the fact that the Biden administration has been very critical of M&amp;A activity and what exactly that would mean here for competition?KEVIN MAHN: It reminds me you have to be a lot more targeted in identifying potential M&amp;A opportunities in the biotech space. What they seem to be focusing on are these larger names-- $30 billion and plus type of acquisitions. I just mentioned Rocket Pharmaceuticals-- about a $1.4 billion smaller cap biotech company.I believe you need to look for those smaller cap names that will stay out of the regulatory crosshairs and also have at least one drug in FDA level 2 or FDA level 3 approval status, because that's where the acquisition appeal comes in. And if, in fact, they have a revolutionary and innovative health care treatment, whether it's CRISPR, CAR-T, antibody treatments, these gene editing and gene splicing type of technologies-- well, large cap pharma is going to look to use their excess cash on their balance sheet to acquire those companies.AKIKO FUJITA: So, Kevin, let's go in the opposite direction. You gave us your three picks. What are sectors that you think investors should be a little more cautious on, stay away from right now?KEVIN MAHN: Well, obviously, very volatile sector always is energy. A large part of that, obviously, is driven by mandates coming out of Washington and also supply demand characteristics that are somewhat outside of our control with respect to OPEC. Other areas to be very leery of as we head into an economic slowdown, which we'll, all likelihood, enter a recessionary period as well is high yield. Any areas where you have companies with high debt on their balance sheet-- you want companies with strong balance sheets, a history of growing their earnings, dividend paying, and also an entrenched and committed management team on the stock side.On the bond side, look at investment grade municipal bonds or municipal bond closed end funds. We think there's a lot of upside potential based upon the difficult year they had last year and also the supply demand imbalances that exists for municipal bonds today.SEANA SMITH: It's great advice right there. Kevin Mahn, we got to leave it there. Thanks so much for hopping on and joining us here on set.]"

The acquisition will add a complementary portfolio of rare disease drugs like Tepezza, Krystexxa and Uplizna to AMGN’s diverse portfolio. The deal was the largest pharmaceutical transaction announced in 2022.Per the FTC, if the acquisition is allowed to go through, a large cap giant like Amgen could leverage its position with insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers to entrench the monopoly positions for two of Horizon's two key products — Tepezza (approved for treating thyroid eye disease) and Krystexxa (approved for treating chronic refractory gout). Per the agency, the drugs currently face little to no competition in the market and are sold at very high prices to patients.In response to the above lawsuit, Amgen issued a statement that it was disappointed by the FTC’s decision and does not believe that the merger poses any competitive issues. The firms plan to work with the court on a schedule that would allow the transaction to close before this year’s end, against the previously set target of June 2023-end.The FTC deciding to stop the transaction marks a change from its usual practice. Usually, the agency allows such transactions to move forward so long as the companies divest any overlapping drugs/medicines. In response, shares of Amgen and Horizon Therapeutics were down 2.4% and 14.2% on May 16.In the year so far, Horizon Therapeutics’ shares have declined 15.3% while Amgen’s shares have lost 13.2%. During the same period, the industry has dropped 5.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe announcement comes just days after several third-party articles had reportedly stated that the FTC was preparing to block the Amgen/Horizon Therapeutics deal.Story continuesSenator Elizabeth Warren wrote to the FTC in late January 2023 expressing her concerns about pharmaceutical deals including the Amgen purchase of Horizon Therapeutics. The Senator accused both Amgen and Horizon Therapeutics to have been engaged in “brazen price increases on drugs that face little or no competition”.Amgen Inc. Price Amgen Inc.

The bond sale is probably one of the largest debt offerings of all time.The debt offering, which will consist of eight tranches of notes, is expected to be closed on May 19. Pfizer said that BofA Securities, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan are acting as the joint lead managers and joint book-running managers.In March, Pfizer offered to buy Seagen for $229 per share in cash, which adds up to a total enterprise value of approximately $43 billion.In the past year, Pfizer’s stock has declined 26.6% against an increase of 12.6% for the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSeagen’s acquisition is expected to strengthen Pfizer’s portfolio of cancer drugs by adding a class of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). The addition of Seagen should strengthen Pfizer’s already leading oncology portfolio of 24 approved innovative cancer medicinesSeagen currently markets four cancer drugs — Adcetris, Padcev, Tukysa and Tivdak. All these drugs have witnessed strong uptake so far, with Adcetris being the majority contributor to Seagen’s top line. The drug has been approved by the FDA for six cancer indications.Several studies on Adcetris, Padcev, Tukysa and Tivdak are currently underway for expanded indications in earlier lines of therapy.The Seagen deal is expected to help Pfizer recover some of the $17 billion in sales, which the company expects to lose due to the expiration of some of its patents in the 2025-2030 period. Pfizer is also seeing a significant decline in sales of its COVID-19 vaccine and medicines. Pfizer expects Seagen to contribute more than $10 billion in risk-adjusted revenues in 2030. The acquisition aligns with Pfizer’s strategic goal of adding $25 billion in revenues by the end of 2030 by developing its business.The Pfizer/Seagen transaction is expected to close in late 2023 or early 2024, pending approval by Seagen shareholders and regulatory authorities.Story continuesThe debt offering comes on the heels of the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) latest challenge toa pharmaceutical merger. This week, the FTC sued to block Amgen’s AMGN $27.8 billion proposed acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics HZNP.Last December, Amgen announced that it will acquire Horizon Therapeutics for $116.50 per share in cash or $27.8 billion. The acquisition will help Amgen add a complementary portfolio of rare disease drugs like Tepezza, Krystexxa and Uplizna to its broad and diversified portfolio. The proposed acquisition was the largest M&amp;A deal announced in 2022.The FTC believes that the acquisition would allow Amgen to coax insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) to favor access to Horizon’s Tepezza, a thyroid eye disease treatment, and Krystexxa, a chronic refractory gout medicine. Both these products enjoy a monopoly-like situation in the market, facing limited competition, thus allowing Horizon to charge “extremely high prices” for these drugs. The FTC believes that if Amgen succeeds in entrenching the monopoly positions of Horizon’s drugs, it would increase revenues from Tepezza and Krystexxa and boost its top lineZacks RankPfizer currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

BNY Mellon Innovators ETF: There can be no assurance that a company identified as an innovation-driven company by Newton will ultimately introduce a new product or service or that such product or service may not be significantly delayed or have the affect Newton anticipated. The returns on a portfolio of securities that are viewed by Newton as innovation-driven companies may trail the returns of a portfolio that is not limited to securities of innovation-driven companies. Investing only in securities of innovation-driven companies may affect the fund's exposure to certain types of investments and may adversely impact the fund's performance depending on whether such investments are in or out of favor in the market. The fund may significantly overweight or underweight certain companies, industries or market sectors, which may cause the fund's performance to be more or less sensitive to developments affecting those companies, industries or sectors. BNY Mellon Women's Opportunities ETF: The fund's incorporation of Women's Opportunities considerations into its investment approach may cause the fund to make different investments than funds that invest principally in equity securities but do not incorporate Women's Opportunities considerations when selecting investments.  Under certain economic conditions, this could cause the fund to underperform funds that do not incorporate Women's Opportunities considerations.The funds are non-diversified, which means that the funds may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers. Therefore, performance may be more vulnerable to changes in the market value of a single issuer or group of issuers and more susceptible to risks associated with a single economic, political or regulatory occurrence than a diversified fund.ETF shares are listed on an exchange, and shares are generally purchased and sold in the secondary market at market price. At times, the market price may be at a premium or discount to the ETF's per share NAV. In addition, ETFs are subject to the risk that an active trading market for an ETF's shares may not develop or be maintained. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions. ETFs trade like stocks and are subject to investment risk, including possible loss of principal. The risks of investing in the ETF typically reflect the risks associated with the types of instruments in which the ETF invests. Diversification cannot assure a profit or protect against loss.ETFs will issue (or redeem) fund shares to certain institutional investors known as ""Authorized Participants"" (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of fund shares known as ""Creation Units."" BNY Mellon Securities Corporation (""BNYMSC""), a subsidiary of BNY Mellon, serves as distributor of the ETF funds.

We talked to researchers about two of those less obvious factors: strong networks and digital capacity.The hidden role of ""social capital""The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was the most notable federal support for small businesses to come out of the pandemic, but not all businesses benefited equally.In the initial round of funding for PPP, 42% of loans went to small businesses with 10-499 employees - even though those businesses accounted for only 4% of all U.S. small businesses. These loans were risk-free, positive net-present-value, and forgivable. So why didn't all small businesses take advantage of this opportunity?One likely contributor was that micro-businesses with fewer than 10 employees were less likely to have an established relationship with a bank, and later phases of PPP targeted other lenders, including CDFIs, to reach a more diverse set of businesses. In addition to the role of banking relationships, however, economist Vojislav Maksmovic of the University of Maryland says there could also be another, more subtle, answer to the disparity.He recently studied how social capital - essentially people's network of relationships in the society they run in - impacted who seized the opportunity of PPP loans. By measuring the uptake in PPP loans, Maksmovic found that four measures of social capital - civic capital, social connections, local pride and trust of banks - explain 25% of the variation of PPP uptake at the zip code level.Story continuesMaksmovic views the pandemic-spawned PPP loans as a natural experiment, or a real-life version of the ""helicopter drop"" economic thought experiment, which considers how a community responds when everyone is given a sudden, one-time opportunity to obtain funds that seemingly ""fell from the sky.""""The government is giving everyone these loans - but who takes them?"" asks Maksmovic. ""There are big differences across the country as to who takes them - at a county level, zip code level, and even a little at the neighborhood census block level.""While the PPP program has wrapped up, the study highlights the role of what some economists call civic capital: how engaged and collaborative residents, business owners, nonprofits and other community members contribute to the success of their community. Embracing inclusion, collaboration and a shared vision can have wide-reaching and economic effects for cities.""Civic capital breaks away from this idea that one side wins and the other side loses,"" Maksmovic says.How going digital impacts local economiesWe've long known that internet access is an equity issue, and cities ranging from NYC to Detroit to Colorado Springs have launched initiatives to bridge the digital divide. Small businesses with limited internet access and usage need to compete with those already taking advantage of online tools that increase discoverability, streamline communications, and collect data that can be used to inform business decisions.""Putting digital tools into the hands of small business owners is critical for unlocking the full potential of today's economy,"" says Shamina Singh, president of the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, whose Strive USA program invests in digital capacity building. ""Going digital can help small business owners gain timely insights to grow revenue, improve financial resilience, compete with larger businesses, and strengthen the economic foundation of the communities in which they operate.""A recent study on digital economic activity and resilience for small and micro-businesses during COVID-19 illuminates just how website presence in a region affects not only businesses' own resilience, but also that of the local economy as a whole. The study found that metropolitan areas ""with higher concentrations of businesses with an online presence"" saw ""more positive economic perceptions and outcomes from April to December 2020."" The study was conducted by Karen Mossberger, a researcher and professor at Arizona State University, who argues that broadband use is a form of digital human capital. ""Whether the community is online and connected makes a difference in terms of fostering an ecosystem of innovation,"" she says.The study mapped business website domains and broadband usage by zip code. Researchers were able to measure local economic impact using anonymized and aggregated commercial data on consumer spending and small business openings and revenue, as well as U.S. Census Bureau data. They found that lower-income areas had lower rates of internet use and that areas with a higher concentration of registered websites saw positive economic benefits. The presence of business websites in combination with broadband usage had an even more significant effect.The pandemic underscored the importance of businesses having an online presence, and digital access will become increasingly advantageous. For instance, ""technology can connect rural communities and tribal communities,"" Mossberger says. ""If someone has a niche business, you don't have to rely on the neighborhood. You can get customers from around the country.""Mosberger says developing digital skills and tools will become increasingly important for small business development programs. From the study: ""Local economic development strategies often focus on attracting technology firms when considering the digital transformation of the economy; but addressing the digital needs of small business may be one path toward a more inclusive and equitable recovery for communities.""Stepping into that gap is Strive USA, which aims to strengthen the ecosystem by enabling organizations that can support small businesses in accessing capital, growing their networks and know-how, and operating in a digital economy.""The pandemic taught us a lot about what small businesses need to survive and thrive, and the opportunities that come with inclusive digital transformation,"" Singh says. ""Now, we need to bring together knowledge and assets from across financial services, non-profit, government, and technology sectors to deliver equitable solutions at scale.""Continue reading here.Image courtesy of Next CityView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from The Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: The Mastercard Center for Inclusive GrowthWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/mastercard-center-inclusive-growthEmail: info@3blmedia.com SOURCE: The Mastercard Center for Inclusive GrowthView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/755691/The-Secret-Ingredients-to-Thriving-Small-Businesses]"

70,870f1dbd-2854-3262-ad95-8c50410883ed,LMT,2023-05-18,Northrop Grumman (NOC) Announces an 8% Hike in the Dividend,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/northrop-grumman-noc-announces-8-114011568.html,1684323611,STORY,"['NOC', 'LMT', 'RTX', 'CW']","[Northrop Grumman Corp. NOC recently announced that its board of directors approved a hike in its quarterly dividend to $1.87 per share, reflecting an increase of 8% from the prior payout. With the current hike, Northrop will now pay out an annual dividend of $7.48 per share. This represents an annual dividend yield of 1.72% based on its share price worth $435.63 as of May 16.NOC’s annualized dividend yield is higher than the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite’s yield of 1.53%. This signifies Northrop’s strength in the business to generate enough cash flow to reward shareholders with improved dividend payouts.Can Northrop Grumman Sustain Dividend Hikes?Northrop Grumman has been consistently boosting shareholder returns, as gauged by its payout of $953 million, $983 million and $1,052 million in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Such a solid distribution strategy is generally buoyed by the steady performance of a company in generating sales and stable cash flows from operations.NOC recorded a 6% increase in its sales in the last reported quarter. Meanwhile, its operating cash flow came in at $702 million at the end of the first quarter of 2023 compared with $488 million in the year-ago quarter.Going forward, Northrop Grumman expects to generate sales in the band of $38-$38.40 billion for 2023, which suggests an upside of 4.4% from the prior-year reported figure. Such an improvement in sales may allow the company to sustain dividend hikes in the days ahead.Moreover, Northrop Grumman’s business strength lies in the orders and new awards the company receives as one of the prime defense contractors, which converts into a robust backlog. NOC entered 2023 with a backlog of more than two times its annual sales, backed by increasing demand and rising global defense budget supports.Also, the U.S. Department of Defense budget request for fiscal 2024 reflects a funding proposal of $842 billion, which represents an increase of $25 billion or 3% over the FY23 enacted funding. Such enhanced defense funding should increase the demand for Northrop products, boosting prospects for a strong order inflow in the days ahead.Story continuesIn light of the aforementioned factors, one may conclude that NOC may continue to witness a strong revenue performance and order inflows. These may assist the company in undertaking such shareholder-friendly moves going forward.Peer MovesDefense companies that have been engaging in rewarding shareholders with impressive dividend payouts are as follows:In September 2022, Lockheed Martin LMT approved a hike in its quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share from the prior payout.LMT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.2%. Shares of Lockheed have delivered 1.6% in the past year.On May 10, 2023, Curtiss-Wright CW announced that the board of directors declared a 5% increase in the quarterly dividend to 20 cents per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Curtiss-Wright’s 2023 sales suggests a growth rate of 5.2% from the prior-year reported figure. CW shares have risen 14.2% in the past year.In April 2023, Raytheon Technologies RTX announced an increase of 7.3% over the prior quarter's dividend amount.RTX has a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.3%. Shares of Raytheon have increased 3.1% in the past year.Price MovementIn the past year, shares of Northrop Grumman have dropped 4.2% compared with the industry’s decline of 2.9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankNorthrop Grumman currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones. Paul Tudor Jones is one of the richest people in the world. According to Forbes Magazine, his current net worth sits at a cool $7.5 billion - making him rank among the top three hundred richest people in the world today. Like a lot of other billionaires and centi-millionaires, he attributes this unthinkable fortune to the world of investing. Mr. Jones set up the hedge fund Tudor Investment Corporation in 1980 and since then his fund has grown to have a portfolio worth a whopping $6.4 billion as of March 2023.Mr. Jones's entry into the investment world provided him with the perfect skill set to play the market conditions that have been in place for more than twelve months now. He started his career by trading cotton futures on the New York Stock Exchange - which provided him an opportunity to gain experience in trading commodities. A couple of years later he would set up his own hedge fund and its first investment would come from a commodities trading firm. He rose to fame in 1987, when he understood that a stock market crash was coming. This manifested itself in the form of the Black Monday crash of 1987, and the short bets that he placed enabled Tudor Investment to mark a whopping 200% gain while others bled losses.A couple of years later, Mr. Jones's genius would make its mark again when he would profit by holding options that enabled him to sell shares at high prices when they were plummeting during a stock market crash. His hedge fund leverages the experience that Mr. Jones gained during his earliest days in the financial market, and these days it focuses primarily on discretionary macro trading. This strategy takes a broader look at the global macroeconomic environment and crafts trading strategies accordingly. As you're likely aware, the global commodities market was upended last year as the Russian invasion of Ukraine shook oil prices and created grain shortages.Story continuesThis enabled Tudor Investment to take a crucial role in the market and once again make its market in a tumultuous environment. While there's little data available on how well the hedge fund performed last year, we can get a semblance of its fortune by taking a look at the portfolio size. Insider Monkey's research shows that Tudor Investment's portfolio was worth $6.5 billion as of March 2023. This marks a 30% growth since the fourth quarter of last year when the portfolio had stood at $5 billion. The portfolio was worth $4.2 billion in Q1 2022, enabling the latest figures to mark a whopping 55% gain. Looking at this, it appears as if Mr. Jones is definitely doing something right even as the stock market recovers from another historic bloodbath in less than five years.Jones has made some interesting statements recently which should be crucial for anyone looking to invest in the stock market. However, before we get to this, a brief stock of the current macroeconomic conditions is warranted. The Federal Reserve has been on an aggressive interest rate hiking spree to control inflation. This makes doing business harder and that is precisely the effect the Fed aims to have since lower output means a slower economy and in effect lower spending to usher in lower prices. The consequence of this is a potential recession, but the Fed chairman Jerome Powell believes that this might not be the case as he recently stated:So I think that—I think it’s still possible. I—you know, I think, you know, the, the case of, of avoiding a recession is, in my view, more likely than that of having, having a recession. But it’s not—it’s not that the case of having a recession is—I don’t rule that out, either. It’s, it’s possible that we will have what I hope would be a mild recession.However, Mr. Jones begs to differ from Chairman Powell. In a fresh interview given in May 2023, he outlined thatThen we have, in a more intermediate basis, we have the financial cycle. The financial cycle, which is what we kind of look at internally, is the combination of the historical debt and asset valuation boom-bust. So if you think about post covid, we had this massive increase in debt. Massive increase in equity valuation. It creates this boom in the financial cycle, that's happened in 1990, that happened in 2000. That happened 2008. Our financial cycle, the peak of total debt growth plus stock market valuation occurred in September of 2021. Historically, it's about a two year lag, when that really really bites and you go into recession. That would be third quarter this year; there's a good chance based on our most recent financial episodes, there's a really good chance that we're going to be on the verge of looking like, or, actually going into recession.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the top stocks that were on Mr. Jones's mind as he headed into what might be a recession year. Some top picks are Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), Horizon Therapeutics Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:HZNP), and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX).10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Paul Tudor JonesOur MethodologyTo compile our list of the best stocks to buy according to Paul Tudor Jones, we used his hedge fund's filings for the first quarter of 2023 with the SEC to sift out those stocks that had the largest investment in dollar terms.Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones10.

Legendary investor Paul Tudor Jones sees a recession coming and even has an idea of when it will hit.The Tudor Investment Corp founder and billionaire expects a recession will come into play this fall, mainly as a result of the surge in debt and asset prices in recent years. Such activities are usually followed by an economic downturn.“Historically, it’s about a two year lag when that really really bites, and you go into recession,” Tudor Jones explained. “That would be third quarter this year, there’s a good chance that – based on our most recent financial episode – there’s a really good chance that we’re on the verge of looking like or actually going into recession.”That’s not to say it’s time to walk away from the stock market. In fact, Tudor Jones has been padding the portfolio with the equites he sees as well-equipped to deal with an upcoming recession – he’s been pouring millions into several. We ran a couple of new additions to his stock collection through the TipRanks database to also gauge Street sentiment toward these names. Here are the results. Abbott Laboratories (ABT)During periods of economic downturn, healthcare stocks are often regarded as defensive investments due to their resilience and stability in the face of recessionary pressures. This holds true for Abbott Laboratories.Founded all the way back in 1888, Abbott is a multinational healthcare firm renowned for its extensive range of products and services in diagnostics, medical devices, nutrition, and branded generic pharmaceuticals. With a rich history, a global presence in more than 160 countries, approximately 115,000 employees, and a market capitalization of $189 billion, Abbott has earned a reputation for innovation and holds a significant position in the industry.Investors gave the thumbs up to the company’s latest quarterly results, despite the numbers showing a drop compared to the year-ago period. While revenue fell by 18.5% year-over-year to $9.7 billion, the figure just edged ahead of the consensus estimate. The company stated that the sales drop was due to an expected decline in COVID-19 testing-related sales compared to the previous year. On the bottom line, adjusted EPS declined by 40.5% from the same period a year ago to $1.03, but that figure exceeded the forecast by $0.05. Regarding the yearly outlook, the company maintained its forecast of adjusted EPS in the range of $4.30 to $4.50.Story continuesTudor Jones must like what’s on offer here. He opened a new position in ABT during the first quarter, with the purchase of 139,628 shares. These are now worth $15.13 million.The company also has a fan in Morgan Stanley analyst Cecilia Furlong. She says of the company: “Abbott possesses a strong balance sheet, supporting a faster organic growth profile in the base (ex-COVID Dx) business in 2023-2025, with 1Q results highlighting base business strength. Recent headwinds, including the infant formula recall, alongside macro pressures on supply and margins, continue to improve, and at current levels we remain constructive going forward on Abbott given its peer-leading organic growth profile (ex-COVID Dx), diversified business composition, continued core margin expansion opportunity post-COVID, and below-peer net leverage, creating optionality.”Quantifying this stance, Furlong rates ABT shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy) while her $133 price target suggests share will appreciation of ~23% for the year ahead. (To watch Furlong’s track record, click here)Elsewhere on the Street, the stock garners an additional 11 Buys, and 1 Hold and Sell, each, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. Going by the $123.79 average target, the shares will climb 14% higher over the coming months. As an added bonus, the company also has a dividend which it has regularly increased over the years. The current payout stands at $0.51 and yields 1.78%. (See ABT stock forecast)Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)From one healthcare giant to an even bigger one. With a market-cap over $411 billion, Johnson &amp; Johnson is one of the largest healthcare corporations in the world. The company operates through three business segments: pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer health.In the pharmaceutical sector, Johnson &amp; Johnson develops and markets a diverse portfolio of prescription drugs, with a focus on areas such as oncology, immunology, neuroscience, and infectious diseases.

Hailing a ‘beat and raise’ quarter, Cantor analyst Louise Chen sings the healthcare giant’s praises and believes the stock is undervalued.“The strength and durability of JNJ’s business segments remain underappreciated, in our view,” Chen said. “We continue to believe that upward earnings estimate revisions and multiple expansion to 15-20x 2023E EV/EBITDA now from ~13x, driven by above-market growth in its key franchises, should move JNJ shares higher.”These comments form the basis for Chen’s Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating, while her $215 Street-high price target implies shares will rise by 36% over the next year.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 10 most prescribed medication in the world.The advancements that the medical field has accomplished over the past century, and especially in recent decades, has exponentially raised our standard of living. Not only are people living longer, with the World Economic Forum stating that life expectancy at birth for both sexes has increased from 46.5 years in 1950 to 71.7 years in 2022, but the quality of living has improved dramatically too, with new innovations being implemented every year. Whether it's the Covid-19 vaccine that Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA), which are also among the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world, have come up with in record time to potentially save tens of millions of lives and reduce the burden on the global health structure, to companies such as Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) and ViiV (a majority-owned company by GlaxoSmithKline plc (NYSE:GSK)), which have dramatically improved the lives of people living with HIV and people susceptible to HIV, medication's importance cannot be understated.In most developed countries healthcare is free. Taxes and deductions from everyone's earnings ensure a social, universal healthcare system which allows everyone to afford the treatment. Furthermore, in most European, and other countries, drug prices are regulated by governments to make sure that they remain affordable for the general masses and maintain a balance between profits for the company and affordable healthcare for residents. The one major exception is, as you've probably guessed, the United States of America.25 most prescribed medication in the worldPhoto by Myriam Zilles on UnsplashEven though the United States is the biggest economy in the world, and has been for around a century now, healthcare has still remained mostly in private hands. While that has allowed businesses and R&amp;D to flourish as costs have been recouped through higher drug prices, this has had the consequence of making many types of medication unaffordable for people who desperately need it to survive. Most people are only afforded healthcare insurance through their employer, which means that if a person becomes unemployed, not only do they lose out on their income, healthcare becomes almost impossible to afford as well. Since there is no governmental oversight, prices for drugs can be increased massively, with RAND Corporation stating that prescription drug prices in the country are 2.56 times than those of 32 other countries. If the focus is only on brand prices, the discrepancy rises even further, with U.S. prices being 3.44 times higher than in other nations. According to a senior healthy policy research at RAND, Andrew Mulcahy: ""Brand-name drugs are the primary driver of the higher prescription drug prices in the United States. We found consistently high U.S. brand name prices regardless of our methodological decisions.” The only relatively positive fact for the U.S. is that generic drug prices are actually just 84% of those in other countries. The same study also found out that France, Italy and the United Kingdom had the lowest drug prices among G7 nations while Canada, Germany and Japan have the highest prices.Story continuesOne recent, glaring example is the price of insulin manufactured by pharma giant Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). The last two decades saw a 300% increase in the price of insulin, which led to many people in the U.S. being forced to hoard rations, even if they have insurance. Recently, after significant pressure and public discourse, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) announced a 70% reduction in price and capping patient out-of-pocket expenses at $35 a month. One of the primary reasons behind this decision was President Biden's announcement in January 2023 that insulin would be capped at $35 per month for seniors on Medicare. While the announcement has been welcomed almost universally, others have raised the practice of price-gouging, citing the fact that Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) could reduce prices by 70% and still turn a profit.To determine the most prescribed medication, we headed over to ClinCalc, which uses data provided by the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey for each year, and finds out the total prescriptions and total patients for a drug in a given year. There can be some variance in the two; for example, an HIV drug which has to be taken every single day will have more prescriptions than a drug which has to be taken once a month. Therefore, we have taken the average of both to come up with our ranking. So, let's now take a look at the drugs being consumed the most across the world, starting with:25. MeloxicamTotal prescriptions: 19,808,581Meloxicam is an anti-inflammatory medicine that is administered either orally or intravenously. It is generally used for pain treatment in rheumatic diseases and osteoarthritis.24. TamsulosinTotal prescriptions: 24,692,402Tamsulosin is used to treat symptoms of a large prostate and is sold under various brand names. Generally sold under the brand name Flomax, it is also often used to help a patient pass kidney stones.23. TrazodoneTotal prescriptions: 26,210,731Trazodone is an antidepressant sold under several brand names.22. PrednisoneTotal prescriptions: 19,044,926Prednisone is used for the replacement of steroids which are normally produced by the body. It suppresses the immune system and decreases inflammation in various conditions.21. BupropionTotal prescriptions: 28,889,368One of several antidepressant medications among the most prescribed medication in the world, Bupropion is sold under the brand name Wellbutrin, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline plc (NYSE:GSK).20. PantoprazoleTotal prescriptions: 26,604,040Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor used in the treatment of stomach ulcers, by reducing the amount of acid the stomach makes.19. FurosemideTotal prescriptions: 26,786,296Furosemide is a diuretic and is used in the treatment of high blood pressure and heart conditions. It can also help in peeing when the patient's kidneys are not working properly.18. FluticasoneTotal prescriptions: 24,777,490Fluticasone is a steroids medication used in the form of nasal spray and drops, and is used for the treatment of nasal symptom. Some of its popular brand names include Flixonase and Avamys, both of which are manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline plc (NYSE:GSK).17. EscitalopramTotal prescriptions: 30,605,646Escitalopram is used to treat anxiety as well as depression, and in a world where mental health is finally being given more importance than it received historically, it should come as no surprise that such medication is among the most prescribed drugs in the world.16. RosuvastatinTotal prescriptions: 30,605,646Rosuvastatin is a high cholesterol treatment medication and is sold under the brand name Crestor in addition to various other brand names.15. MontelukastTotal prescriptions: 29,750,488Montelukast is a drug used to fight against asthma, and is perhaps best known under the brand name Singulair, manufactured by Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK).14. Acetaminophen; HydrocodoneTotal prescriptions: 30,100,356Acetaminophen is also known as paracetamol, even more well-known by brand names Tylenol and Panadol, manufactured by Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Haleon plc (NYSE:HLN) respectively. It is generally used for the treatment of light pain such as headache and slight reduction in fever, even though ibuprofen has been proven to be more effective in this respect. Meanwhile, hydrocodone is an opioid. Together, a combination of these two drugs is used for the treatment of moderate to severe pain in patients.13. SertralineTotal prescriptions: 38,219,814You might not have heard of Sertraline, even though it is one of the most prescribed drugs in the world, but you will definitely have heard of Zoloft, perhaps the most consumed antidepressant brand named drug, which is manufactured by Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE).12. SimvastatinTotal prescriptions: 36,600,871Simvastatin, used to treat high cholesterol, is sold under the brand name Zocor, manufactured by Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK).11.

76,43e46fec-39fc-32c6-8598-c4fff299a606,MRK,2023-05-18,"Fed, labor market concerns showing 'some dents in the armor of the consumer': Strategist",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/fed-labor-market-concerns-showing-202659069.html,1684355219,VIDEO,"['RCKT', 'HZNP', 'WMT', 'MRK', 'AMGN', 'TGT']","[Hennion &amp; Walsh CIO Kevin Mahn joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the state of the consumer amid retail earnings, Target Q1 earnings, Walmart earnings preview, Fed rate hikes, inflation, and the impact on consumer spending.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: All right, well let's talk a little bit more about these retail earnings and the state of the consumer. For that, we want to bring in Kevin Mahn. He's Hennion &amp; Walsh Chief Investment Officer. It's great to see you here, Kevin.KEVIN MAHN: Seana.SEANA SMITH: I guess your big takeaway from the results that we're getting so far, the fact that we are seeing consumers pull back with their discretionary spending-- what that signals for what lies ahead.KEVIN MAHN: Yeah. What stood out to me was the forward looking guidance that both Walmart and Target provided, striking a very cautious tone about their outlook for consumer spending in the second, third, and fourth quarter. If the consumer does, in fact, start to curtail their spending, not only will it affect the earnings of retailers, but also the economy as a whole, remembering that 70% of GDP growth comes from consumer spending.However, there is a silver lining, though. If, in fact, the economy continues to slow due to a slowdown in earnings, the Fed is going to have to stop. I believe they hiked in May and will go away. And in all likelihood, by the end of this year, we'll start talking about cutting rates. And if, in fact, they're cutting rates during an economic slowdown, which could be a recessionary period, well, that creates opportunities for investors.AKIKO FUJITA: And, Kevin, we'll get some more of your thoughts on the Fed in just a bit. But going back to where retailers are right now, I do wonder what you make of the Street's reaction today. I mean, Target certainly giving a more cautious outlook. We are still seeing that stock up.I mean, is it at the end of the day about some of these big box names that are still able to offer sort of a diversified experience as opposed to some other retailers that are a lot more focus and could get hit further from a cautious consumer?Story continuesKEVIN MAHN: Yeah, absolutely. You have to look at those retailers that don't have as much of their revenue derived from discretionary items, much more in the staples items, the grocery items that you alluded to earlier. We also have to remember that during periods of economic slowdowns leading up to and through recessions, consumer staples stocks generally fare well.Walmart is an excellent example of a consumer staple based upon their large majority of their revenue that does come from staples related items such as groceries. So we would anticipate consumer staples companies, less so consumer discretionary, faring well, just as we would anticipate health care companies faring well during periods of economic slowdowns leading up to and through recessions. And those two sectors, Akiko, they also tend to fare pretty well during periods of interest rate cuts as well.So if you're looking to position your portfolio to take advantage of an upcoming interest rate declining cycle in addition to an economic slowdown, look to your consumer staples. Look to health care, and even look to technology companies with strong balance sheets.SEANA SMITH: Kevin, when it comes to some of the opportunities out there, we have really been stuck in this pretty tight trading range. And a lot of that has to do with the uncertainty that lies ahead. Earnings clearly has not been the catalyst to get us out of that range. What will be?KEVIN MAHN: I believe once we have confirmation that we've reached the end of this rate hike cycle, which I believe I already heard-- apparently some on Wall Street don't believe they have already heard, with the 25% probability of still yet another rate hike in June-- I believe that provides the catalyst to start looking for opportunities.And where do you look? Look for some of those names that were really beaten up in 2022 that should rebound and benefit the most from an end to this rate hike cycle. Earnings, we've had the second consecutive quarters now of negative earnings growth. Even according to the Fed's own projections, they believe the economy is only going to grow by 4/10 of 1% this year.Everything that they wanted to do with this massive and aggressive rate hiking campaign is now coming to fruition. The economy is slowing. Inflation is slowing, but still remaining well above their target. Now, we're going to get to see all the damage that all those rate hikes have actually inflicted on the economy.AKIKO FUJITA: So, Kevin, a potential pause that you're looking at. I also heard you say positioning yourself for an interest rate declining cycle. I mean, is that what you anticipate, at least in the near term future?KEVIN MAHN: Not in the near-term future. In fact, at the beginning of this year, I suggested that, in all likelihood, they were going to raise rates by 75 basis points during their first three meetings of 2023. Fortunately, I got that one right. At that point in time, once they hit that terminal rate of around 5% to 5.25%, I believed that they were going to stop, sit back, and reflect upon all the damage that they've done to the economy, and in all likelihood, wouldn't consider starting to cut rates until early 2024.That may have to take place at the end of 2023 at this point, depending upon how much the economy does slow and how much the consumer starts to rein in spending. Of course, on the other side, if inflation stays rampant or actually goes in the opposite direction and doesn't continue to moderate, well, the Fed may need to step back in. I do not believe that they will. I don't believe they're going to cut anytime soon. But by the end of this year, I believe that in all likelihood, they're going to start considering rate cuts.SEANA SMITH: Kevin, what about when it comes to rate hikes versus the pause here? The other side of the argument would be that a lot of the economic data has remained extremely strong, even what we've gotten out so far this week when it comes to housing, when it comes to yesterday's retail sales number-- that coming in better than expected. Do you think that, though, is going to give the Fed a little bit of pause just in terms of the headway that they have made on inflation?KEVIN MAHN: The Fed has been driven 100% to curtail inflation since March of last year, essentially telling investors that they were going to continue to raise rates, cut the size of their balance sheet until something broke. Well, now, something has broken-- certainly in the regional banking system.We've seen it impact the housing market. And now, it's trickling through to earnings. So what's really holding up this particular economy right now is the strength of the labor market. But, now we're starting to see some dents in the armor of the consumer.Just yesterday, we learned that we've hit an all time record in terms of consumer debt-- $17 trillion. Consumers are now dipping more into their personal savings, putting more on their credit cards to help keep up with these inflated prices. How much longer can that last?AKIKO FUJITA: So let's talk about some of the opportunities that you see in the market. Two names that stand out to me, both big pharma. What do you see there?KEVIN MAHN: Well, historically, based upon the research we've done at Smart Trust, the three sectors that perform best during periods of economic slowdowns accompanied by declining interest rates are health care, number one, consumer staples, and information technology. But there's two ways to play health care, right?One is through your traditional large cap pharmaceutical companies that are generally more defensive in nature. One name that we hold and happen to like is Merck-- pays an attractive dividend of over 2%, forward looking PE of just 17, and continues to be innovative in terms of the types of health care treatments they provide. Another way to play the health care sector is through smaller cap biotech companies. From an M&amp;A perspective, one name that we hold at smart trust is Rocket Pharmaceuticals-- about a $1.4 billion smaller cap biotech company that's using genetic therapies, such as gene editing, gene splicing, to cure rare and chronic diseases-- really at the cutting edge of health care innovation in our country right now.That's a little bit more growth oriented. Obviously, the larger cap pharmaceuticals are a little bit more defensive oriented. But the combination of those two should fare well over the next two years.SEANA SMITH: Kevin, you mentioned M&amp;A there. And the FTC blocking Amgen's deal to buy--KEVIN MAHN: Very aggressive.SEANA SMITH: --to buy Horizon Therapeutics. How do you look at a move like that as an investor given the fact that the Biden administration has been very critical of M&amp;A activity and what exactly that would mean here for competition?KEVIN MAHN: It reminds me you have to be a lot more targeted in identifying potential M&amp;A opportunities in the biotech space. What they seem to be focusing on are these larger names-- $30 billion and plus type of acquisitions. I just mentioned Rocket Pharmaceuticals-- about a $1.4 billion smaller cap biotech company.I believe you need to look for those smaller cap names that will stay out of the regulatory crosshairs and also have at least one drug in FDA level 2 or FDA level 3 approval status, because that's where the acquisition appeal comes in. And if, in fact, they have a revolutionary and innovative health care treatment, whether it's CRISPR, CAR-T, antibody treatments, these gene editing and gene splicing type of technologies-- well, large cap pharma is going to look to use their excess cash on their balance sheet to acquire those companies.AKIKO FUJITA: So, Kevin, let's go in the opposite direction. You gave us your three picks. What are sectors that you think investors should be a little more cautious on, stay away from right now?KEVIN MAHN: Well, obviously, very volatile sector always is energy. A large part of that, obviously, is driven by mandates coming out of Washington and also supply demand characteristics that are somewhat outside of our control with respect to OPEC. Other areas to be very leery of as we head into an economic slowdown, which we'll, all likelihood, enter a recessionary period as well is high yield. Any areas where you have companies with high debt on their balance sheet-- you want companies with strong balance sheets, a history of growing their earnings, dividend paying, and also an entrenched and committed management team on the stock side.On the bond side, look at investment grade municipal bonds or municipal bond closed end funds. We think there's a lot of upside potential based upon the difficult year they had last year and also the supply demand imbalances that exists for municipal bonds today.SEANA SMITH: It's great advice right there. Kevin Mahn, we got to leave it there. Thanks so much for hopping on and joining us here on set.]"
77,de5965ba-84de-3536-b290-7cc6495af7e1,BA,2023-05-18,30 Richest Cities in the United States in 2023,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/30-richest-cities-united-states-042754579.html,1684384074,STORY,['BA'],"[In this article, we will delve into the world of affluence and explore the 30 Richest Cities in the United States in 2023; if you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to 10 Richest Cities in the United States in 2023.For a place known for its economic prowess and entrepreneurial spirit, it is no surprise that the United States boasts several cities that stand out as beacons of wealth and prosperity. From bustling metropolises to tech hubs, these urban centers have attracted individuals and corporations alike. Thus, these cities have become known as some of the wealthiest in the country and globally. The current picture of the largest economyThe U.S. economy experienced a sharp slowdown in the first quarter, growing at an annual pace of only 1.1%. This deceleration was attributed to higher interest rates negatively impacting equity markets. The slowdown can be attributed to the Federal Reserve's aggressive drive to control inflation, with nine interest rate hikes in the past year. This surge in borrowing costs is expected to lead to a recession later in the year, according to various predictions.The economic slowdown and potential recession may impact the wealthy cities in the U.S., as they often have strong ties to the financial sector, real estate, and high-income industries, which can be sensitive to broader economic fluctuations.On the brighter side, however, the landscape of wealth distribution in the United States has witnessed a significant transformation over the years. While traditional financial powerhouses like New York City and Los Angeles have long dominated the rankings, the emergence of tech hubs and the diversification of industries have introduced a new era of wealth creation across the country. With a GDP per capita of $70,248, the country observes a remarkable rise in technology-driven cities.For instance, Phoenix, known as the ""Silicon Desert,"" is a burgeoning tech hub focusing on telecommunications, electronics manufacturing, and aerospace. Operational costs in Phoenix are 36% lower than in California, making it an attractive location for tech companies seeking affordable headquarters. Additionally, it ranks as the fifth-largest data center market in the U.S., offering advantages such as low natural disaster risk and a competitive colocation and cloud market. Story continuesMoreover, some cities have experienced notable transformations driven by innovative practices, highlighting the shift toward sustainable urban planning.For example, Detroit, known as the Motor City, due to its historical ties to the automobile industry, has attracted investors interested in creative enterprises. Major projects such as Ford's mobility district and Bedrock's reinvention of the former Hudson's department store have drawn over 250 businesses and created tens of thousands of new jobs. This has propelled Detroit to be recognized as the top emerging startup ecosystem globally, highlighting the city's potential in the innovation sector.Sustainability initiatives and wealth - hand in hand?One of the common trends observed is that the 30 richest cities in the U.S. from our list tend to emphasize sustainability strongly. On 12th May 2023, San Francisco launched the Commercial Reuse Program during Small Business Week to support restaurants in transitioning away from single-use disposable food ware. The program offers financial assistance, free technical support, and a $500 incentive for dine-in establishments to switch to reusable alternatives. Up to 200 restaurants annually can qualify for the program, helping to reduce waste and contribute to San Francisco's climate action goals.A study reveals Portland as the most sustainable city in the U.S., considering its low carbon footprint per person, high use of renewable energy, low light pollution, and proportion of sustainable hotels. It is also known for its progressive culture and proactive approach to addressing CO2 emissions. In another news, Seattle won an award for achieving sustainability in technology and environmentally responsible purchasing practices for the fourth time in six years.Key CompaniesIn the landscape of wealth creation and economic transformation, several publicly traded companies have played a significant role in the prosperity of these wealthy cities. One such company is JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), a financial powerhouse with a strong presence in cities like New York City and Los Angeles. With its robust banking and investment services, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) has been a catalyst for economic growth and job creation, contributing to the affluence of these cities. Moreover, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (NYSE:JPM) is expanding its presence in Florida due to the presence of wealthy clientele. The bank plans to open branches in Florida as clients and employees have flocked there since the pandemic began.Another notable company making an impact is Boeing Co (NYSE:BA), which has been instrumental in the transformation of cities like Seattle and Chicago. As a leading aerospace manufacturer, Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) has driven technological advancements, generating employment opportunities, and stimulated local economies. Recently, Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) has been hinting at the development of a new jet that it is currently testing in collaboration with NASA, suggesting it could replace the troubled 737 Max. On the other hand, Wells Fargo &amp; Co (NYSE:WFC) has been an active key player in cities like San Francisco. 30 Richest cities in The United States in 2023MethodologyThe methodology for creating a list of the 30 richest cities in the United States in 2023 is based on ranking these cities according to their GDP per capita. The analysis relies on data from the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), a trusted economic statistics and information source. It is important to note that while the list primarily comprises cities, it may also include certain large metropolitan areas or regions that exhibit significant economic activity and contribute to the overall wealth of the United States. The list is in ascending order.30. Baltimore-Columbia-Towson, MDGDP per capita: $78,556Its strategic location as a major port city fosters trade and commerce, while the region's diverse economy, including industries like healthcare, education, finance, technology, and manufacturing, contributes to its economic strength. Additionally, Baltimore's role as a prominent center for research, innovation, and higher education further drives economic growth and attracts investment.29.Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN-WIGDP per capita: $80,398The strength of the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin metropolitan area's economy can be attributed to several key factors. Firstly, its strategic location in the heart of the Midwest positions it as a major transportation and logistics hub, facilitating efficient trade.Moreover, the region's diverse economy provides it with a resilient foundation. The presence of world-class educational institutions and research facilities allows for innovation and the development of a highly skilled workforce.28.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Quigley. Please go ahead, sir.Thomas A. QuigleyThank you. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. Today, I'm joined by Dan Crowley, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim McCabe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Triumph. Let me review the financial results for the quarter, please refer to the presentation posted on our website this morning. We will be discussing our adjusted results. Our adjustments and any reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures are explained in the earnings press release and in the presentation.

Dan, I'll turn it over to you.Story continuesDaniel J. CrowleyThanks, Tom. Triumph ended fiscal 2023 in Q4 on an upswing with strong margins and positive cash flow, positioning the company for success in fiscal year 2024 and beyond as demand accelerates. We met or exceeded our full year financial targets, delivered organic sales growth, materially expanded profitability and in our fourth quarter, generated $52 million in positive free cash flow. Q4 was an encouraging finish to a solid fiscal year that marks year-over-year improvement in both earnings and free cash flow. Over the past 2 years, Triumph doubled our adjusted EBITDA margins from under 7% in our fiscal '21 to 14% in fiscal 2023. As we go forward, we expect this momentum to continue and are guiding to further margin expansion and top line growth in fiscal '24 as we seek to enhance shareholder value in a rapidly improving demand environment. Deleveraging remains a top priority as we continue to optimize our capital structure over time. We recently extended our debt maturities, providing additional liquidity and flexibility as Triumph returns to consistent cash flow generation in fiscal '24 and beyond. Our 4-point strategy remains on track. First, reposition the company as the systems and aftermarket company, which we've done; two, improve operations and grow our proprietary and aftermarket sales and margins; three, return to positive free cash flow to help delever the company; and four, generate the shareholder returns our investors expect. Triumph is a stronger company today as a result of our actions, allowing us to compete successfully in the market against larger and more valuable peers. Turning to Slide 3. I'll summarize the highlights for the quarter. First, we generated organic sales growth of 21% over the prior year quarter with increased sales reported across all our end markets. Year-over-year sales growth was 14%, driven by improving commercial OEM and MRO demand. Note that aftermarket accounted for 41% of our Q4 sales, while military programs account for 37%, both up from prior years. Key drivers for the increased Q4 revenue included higher volume on the Boeing 737 and 787, OEM and spares for military rotorcraft GE LEAP gearbox shipments and the cell overhauls, all tailwinds on growth platforms, which we expect to continue in fiscal '24. Profitability for the quarter materially exceeded prior year levels. On a fiscal year basis, we achieved our highest margin percentages since 2014 as a result of our strong execution and improved business mix. Key profitability drivers for the year included higher spare sales, cut in of previously negotiated price increases, development program transition to production, higher sales at our MRO sites and lower SG&amp;A and overhead costs. Our cost reduction results enhance our operating leverage. In other words, we won't have to add back support cost as volumes increase. What's encouraging here is we saw higher EBITDA margins across all our primary product lines year-over-year from actuators to engine controls, gearboxes to product support. We grew our backlog by 11% as Triumph continues to benefit from our broad representation across platforms, customers and end markets and as our differentiated solutions gained traction with our customers who are helping to fund our R&amp;D efforts. Our backlog improvements in size, diversity and profitability are rooted in our investments in new products and technology, portfolio changes and pricing initiatives. In addition to the long-term agreements, which we secured in recent years across all our businesses, backlog renewal is key to Triumph's sustained long-term growth. Beyond higher OEM rates and MRO receipts, new wins in the space market and for product support in the war in Ukraine enabled us to exceed our goal of generating 25% of our sales from new products and markets. Turning to cash flow. We generated strong positive free cash flow to end the year, benefiting from over $120 million in unlevered free cash flow in Q4 as we accelerated product shipments, cash collections and reductions in working capital. We are on track to generate positive free cash flow on a full year basis for fiscal '24 and beyond while expanding our CapEx investments and funding working capital in support of the commercial ramp. Taken together, the momentum in our end markets are operational and pricing improvements and expanding backlog lay the foundation for our fiscal '24 guidance. Triumph made great strides this year operationally across the enterprise, including achieving world-class safety levels with 12 or half of our sites recording 0 injuries in the last year, reducing [RED] programs by over 75%, which reduces financial risk establishing over 100 high-performance teams to streamline our execution, reducing quality defects by 20% with 11 sites achieving world-class levels of less than 1% cost of poor quality and improving supplier on-time delivery performance from the mid-70s percentages to the low 90s to free up captive inventory. We remain encouraged that both OEM and MRO markets continue to recover as commercial revenue levels are on track to exceed 2019 levels this calendar year. Triumph is benefiting from a 52% increase in global revenue passenger kilometers to 88% of pre-pandemic levels. The primary driver for both new aircraft orders, production rate increases and MRO spend. Similar growth in the international travel is benefiting our wide-body MRO sales. Robust commercial demand helped increase Triumph's fiscal year 2023 bookings 31%, including $171 million in new contracts in March alone, our highest of the year. Six of our 24 factories will benefit from Ryanair's recent order for 300 MAX 10s and those from United Airlines. Turning to Slide 4. New wins totaled $205 million for the quarter and $743 million for the year. Important military wins for the quarter included content on the CH-53 helicopter including the blade fold and blade damping system and engine oil coolers and an F-35 drag shoot actuator. We also received a large order for the M777 Howitzer magazine components. Increasing volume is our biggest enabler for top and bottom line growth. Boeing Airbus continue to forecast higher OEM production rates and recall that Triumph typically steps up all rates 8 to 10 months ahead of the OEMs due to product lead times. As shown on Slide 6, we anticipate the Boeing 737 MAX rate to step from the current rate 31 to rate 38 this summer and then rate 42 by March. The A320 family achieved rate 46 in March, with plans to move to rate 49 before the end of our fiscal year. Airbus also plans to increase the A220 rate from the current 7.5 per month to 9.2 and then to 10 within our fiscal year. Recall that Triumph supplies cabin installation, floors and mechanical controls on the A220. On or before Triumph's fourth quarter, the Boeing 787 will move from the current rate 4 to rate 5 while the Airbus A350 will move from rate 5.6 to rate 6. Triumph supplies the entire 787 landing gear hydraulic system, cargo door actuation system and interiors components. Regarding the military outlook, the U.S. defense budget rose approximately $60 billion in '23 and the 2024 request is up another $26 billion, signaling demand stability over the next 2 years. Triumph's total military sales were up 18% year-over-year and 34% sequentially with platforms such as the CH-53, helping to drive our fiscal '23 results. Finally, aftermarket inductions across military and commercial platforms for maintenance, repair and overhaul, are up 24% year-over-year to over 35,000 components. Together, these OEM and MRO increases across all our end markets support our fiscal '24 guidance and long-term business outlook. So overall, very good news on demand trends. I want to share an update relative to our proprietary product development efforts in the systems area and its importance to our value generation efforts. For fiscal '24, approximately 72% of our sales are for proprietary products, excluding our third-party MRO business. Our technical staff maintained robust product road maps so that intellectual property, technology and product development investments are directed towards emerging customer needs. We are targeting new starts as well as takeaways on existing programs. By partnering with our customer to solve their most difficult challenges, we received over $30 million in customer-funded contract research and development commitments in the last 12 months to augment our self-funded R&amp;D. Turning to Slide 7. You can see some of the positive results of these joint R&amp;D efforts. New applications include next-gen landing gear systems, military gearboxes, electric aircraft components, fuel pumps, fueldraulic actuators, thermal vapor cycle compressors and engine controls, all products with valuable aftermarket demand. I'm particularly happy to have content on GE's new LM25NX military engine and new solutions for 6 Gen fighters. This customer engagement was made possible by our customer-focused teams who are shaping future requirements and identifying takeaway opportunities to expand our backlog. Triumph's strong financial and operational close to fiscal '23, along with our proprietary products and end market growth are key enablers to enhancing our long-term value. None of this would have been possible without the Triumph team members whose engagement and accomplishments in fiscal '23 make it possible for the company to achieve its potential. Together, the culture we've created at Triumph helped us manage through the last 3 years and positioned the company to sustainably execute our profitable growth strategy in the years to come. Jim will now take us through the fourth quarter results and our detailed outlook for fiscal '24. Jim?James F. McCabeThanks, Dan and good morning, everyone. Triumph's fourth quarter results exceeded our expectations with significant revenue and margin growth over the prior year period. On Slide 8 are the consolidated results for the quarter. Revenue was $393 million, for the continuing business, excluding divestitures and exited programs, organic revenue increased 21% over the prior year quarter. We benefited from organic sales growth in our largest programs in all end markets. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $60 million, representing a 15% margin, an increase of over 400 basis points from 11% in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $68 million, representing a 17% EBITDA margin, which is a 500 basis point improvement over the prior year period. Increased demand in all our markets, especially the aftermarket was a key driver for the significant margin improvement over last year along with pricing and cost reductions. Triumph's full year results for fiscal '23 were also strong with higher operating income and higher margin. On Slide 9 are the annual consolidated results. Revenue was $1.379 billion. For the continuing operations, organic revenue increased 14% over the prior year. Adjusted operating income for the year was $159 million an 11% operating margin, up over 200 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the year was $196 million. That is a 14% EBITDA margin, which is a 200 basis point increase over the prior year. Our segment tables are attached to the press release, and please note that the segment formerly known as structures is now called interiors. This name change more accurately reflects the ongoing focus of that business, following the completion of our efforts to reposition the segment. We are encouraged by the progress we have made and would note that interiors is benefiting from a strong backlog and growth forecast. We also expanded our disclosures over the last year to include revenue by end market, including commercial and military and then OEM and aftermarket under each. Slide 10 shows our commercial market revenue. For the quarter, commercial revenue of $237 million was 60% of total revenue. Commercial OEM sales were $141 million and grew 35% in the continuing business. This growth was driven by increases in both volume and price in key programs, including the Boeing 737 and 787 programs. Commercial aftermarket sales grew 51% in the continuing business on strong demand as commercial air travel has continued to ramp. Slide 11 shows our military revenue. For the quarter, military revenue of $144 million was 37% of total revenue. Both military OEM and aftermarket revenue grew compared to last year as supply chain recovery benefited this market. The remaining 3% of our revenue was non-aviation, which is a growing and profitable business represented about $12 million of sales in the quarter. Our sales of exchange towards aftermarket is having a positive impact on margins and cash flow. In the quarter, total aftermarket sales represented 41% of our revenue, up from 31% in the prior year. Our portfolio actions and our growing aftermarket demand have both contributed to this positive mix change and we expect this trend to continue as we move through fiscal '24. Our free cash flow walk is on Slide 12. Our $52 million of cash generation this quarter included a $70 million reduction in our net working capital driven by the fourth quarter sales volume. As supply chains continue to improve, we have been able to reduce the inventory we've been carrying. We also incurred an additional $14 million in interest payments in the quarter due to the timing of our refinancing. On Slide 13 is our net debt liquidity. During the fourth quarter, we completed the refinancing of a substantial portion of our debt, issuing new 9% first lien notes and retiring 2 series of notes that were due to mature in '24. This transaction extended those maturities to 2028, providing additional liquidity and enhancing our financial flexibility, including the ability to prepay a portion of these new notes at a reasonable premium. At March 31, we had just under $1.5 billion of net debt, and our cash availability was approximately $287 million. Our next maturity is the $499 million of notes due over 2 years from now in August of 2025. These bonds are currently designated bonds that can be used to exercise our outstanding warrants for stock to reduce this debt. In the quarter, we received $4 million of proceeds from warrant exercises and retired $1 million of these designated bonds. Our fiscal '24 guidance begins on Slide 14. The bridge of our FY '23 to FY '24 revenue is at the top left. Adjusting for approximately $78 million in fiscal '23 sales from exited businesses and based on anticipated aircraft production rates, we expect organic growth of 7% to 10% in fiscal '24. Aftermarket volume is the largest component of the increase, followed by OEM volume, pricing and an increase in non-aviation revenue. The aftermarket is expected to grow at a solid 9% rate, driven by continued expansion of overall air travel domestically and internationally. Commercial OEM revenue growth is driven by production ramps on programs such as Boeing 737 and 787 and the Airbus A320 family. Non-aviation sales are expected to increase, driven by the previously announced work supporting Howitzer sustainment. The top right chart shows our EBITDAP growth over the last 3 years and guidance for FY '24. We're proud of this positive trend. Our adjusted EBITDA margin has improved from about 7% in fiscal '21 to 12% in fiscal '22 to 14% in fiscal '23 and our guidance indicates up to a 60% consolidated EBITDA margin in fiscal '24. This EBITDA margin expansion has been driven by a number of key factors, including the reshaping of our portfolio, increasing operational efficiencies and improving the pricing in terms of our contracts and from increased demand from higher OEM production rates and a ramping aviation aftermarket. The bottom left chart shows our improving quarterly free cash flow cadence for the last 2 years and the anticipated cadence in fiscal '24. We expect to generate positive free cash flow in fiscal '24, including normal seasonality with working capital growth using cash in the first half, to support higher deliveries and resulting cash generation in the second half. The bottom right chart is our unlevered free cash flow bridge from fiscal '23 to fiscal '24, which shows our free cash flow before interest. As previously noted, fiscal '23 included $24 million in nonrecurring cash uses and $32 million in net working capital increases. We anticipate a modest net working capital improvement over fiscal '24. And our largest driver is earnings growth, which is expected to drive just over half of the unlevered free cash flow improvement. Turning to Slide 15. You will find our detailed fiscal '24 guidance. We expect revenue of $1.39 billion to $1.42 billion, that's 7% to 10% growth in the continuing business and cash from operations of $60 million to $80 million. After $25 million to $30 million of capital expenditures, we expect to generate $35 million to $50 million of free cash flow in FY '24. That's up to $123 million improvement in free cash flow for fiscal '23. We expect $165 million to $180 million of operating income and $210 million to $225 million of adjusted EBITDA, representing up to a 16% EBITDA margin. Interest expense is expected to be $154 million, including $148 million of cash interest and we expect $7 million of cash taxes. Our pension funding focus is on Page 19. [$50 million] is the estimated required contribution in FY '24. We've used stock for required contributions in the past and may elect to do so in the future. We would note that estimates after the first year can change significantly as we have seen in the past few years. In summary, it was a strong finish to a solid year and with fewer onetime items in past years. We completed our portfolio actions and are clearly positioned as an aerospace systems and aftermarket company. We extended our debt maturities, grew revenue, expanded margins and improved free cash flow. For fiscal '24, we're focused on executing on our plan to continue to grow revenue, margins and cash flow and increase shareholder value. We are in the planning process for an Investor Day in the fall and look forward to sharing our multiyear targets and bridges at that time. Now I'll turn the call back to Dan. Dan?Daniel J. CrowleyThanks, Jim. Triumph's performance in our fourth quarter and fiscal '23 underscores that we're a stronger systems and aftermarket driven company. With a larger and more profitable backlog and financial results that are steadily improving year-over-year towards the targets we set in fiscal '21. We entered our fiscal 2024 with an optimized portfolio of businesses, programs and products at a time of accelerating customer demand. Our increasing mix of aftermarket and IP-driven OEM sales gives us confidence in our fiscal '24 guidance and long-term outlook. Jim and I are happy to take any questions you have.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) At this time, we will take our first question, which will come from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.Sheila Karin KahyaogluDan and Jim. First up, can I get the excel backup data behind Slide 14, that would be great if we could get that slide. So I appreciate those slides, so that's super helpful. I guess I wanted to go actually to the next slide because the supplementals. But in terms of the pension items you mentioned becoming a significant headwind in fiscal '25 with the contributions there. How do we think about those numbers in the context of your free cash flow generation? And maybe that's something you'll discuss in the fall?James F. McCabeYes. Thanks, Sheila, and I'll look for that excel spreadsheet and let you know. But I think pension is an interesting one because it's volatile in the out years. And as you know, last year, at the same time last year, we had only $1 million or so per year funding forecast. It's only the next year that really matters because after that, it can change dramatically based on market conditions, interest rates, returns. So what we're focused on is the $15 million in the coming year. If you look at the pension liability on the balance sheet, it went from up about $58 million only. So but the funding went up a lot more than that. And something has to do with elections, which we're going to revisit and consider before the next year. But in the fiscal '24, we have $15 million to deal with, which we're planning for.Sheila Karin KahyaogluGot it. Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on the interiors margins. This is like one of the -- as you guys mentioned, the best quarter you guys have had adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.6% in the quarter. Is that sort of the baseline we should be thinking that for profitability?James F. McCabeCould you repeat the number you just said?Sheila Karin KahyaogluOh, 7.6%, I believe, was the adjusted EBITDA margin.James F. McCabeLook, margins are going to continue to improve. And you've seen -- I went through the consolidated EBITDA margin, which doubled from 7% to 14%, and we're projecting up to 16% next year. The margins across the business are going to continue to improve from leverage on additional revenue, right? So we got gross margin falling through without increasing fixed expenses. So the trends are positive across the board in all the markets, including interiors.OperatorAnd our next question will come from Peter Arment with Baird.Peter J. ArmentJust on -- thanks on all the details you guys have given and congrats on finishing up on a strong note for the year. On the organic sales outbreak, you mentioned the aftermarket was up 9% -- 7% to 9% is the guide for the year or 7% to 10% for the year. Is it -- I'm surprised it's not stronger, just given the trends that you're seeing. Is there something that's offsetting that? Or maybe is it just timing or up against tough comps. Any color on that, Dan, would be appreciated.Daniel J. CrowleyYou bet. We track the inductions that come into all of our MRO sites month-over-month, and they steadily increased through the fiscal year, roughly started out the year below 2,000 a month, and they were hitting 3,000 by the time we got to March. So a 50% increase through the course of the year. So we're encouraged by the return to service of aircraft. Internationals opened up, as you know, China is going to expand. Our TASA site, which is in Thailand is seeing increased traffic. So aftermarket is going to continue to drive. Where we really want to extend our aftermarket is in spares. Spares came down in prior years as people just went to the boneyard and extended service intervals. Now sparing is starting to pick back up and spares carries a stronger margins than even overhaul. So we're optimistic about aftermarket, and we're hiring at those plants that support that. And we're continuing to do joint ventures with our partners in Air France. So we're excited about the future in aftermarket.Peter J. ArmentAppreciate that. And then Jim, just as a follow-up on kind of the free cash flow finally turning positive, which is great. It's about 2.5% to 3.5% of sales on kind of your guide. We have long talked about kind of getting that to mid- to high single digits. How do you think about that? Some of the bigger drivers. Is it just the cash interest coming down, working capital improvement or some of the things that you've looking for there?James F. McCabeYes. So you see the '24 guide, the $35 million to $50 million of free cash flow. That's just the beginning. Obviously, we're going to ramp and our goal is to be up in the high single digits on our free cash flow as a percentage of sales. And the cadence will be -- we're in the low single digits in '24, and then we'll move kind of into the mid-single digits in '25 and then higher single digits in '26.OperatorOur next question will come from Myles Walton with Wolf.Myles Alexander WaltonI was hoping you could maybe give us a couple of the moving parts from an EPS perspective. I think you've given us most of them, but when you put it all together, and obviously, you've got the warrant issue as well that I think has an interest adjustment. Is the EPS for fiscal '24, somewhere closer to $0.50. Is that about the right ballpark?James F. McCabeSo I think we're trying to give you the building blocks. The reason we didn't guide to EPS is because of the moving share count, as you mentioned. Share count skewed by pro forma warrant accounting, which has to assume that all of them have been exercised. And then there's exercises. So during the period, we had $5 million worth of warrant exercises, some of which increased shares and reduced debt. So we're going to give you all the components. And I think probably in the follow-up call, we can talk you through each of them and you can make your own assumptions about the number of shares outstanding. So that's the intent there. We're going to get back to EPS guiding as soon as the warrants exercise.Myles Alexander WaltonOkay. And what is the outlook for that -- sort of be realized at this point?James F. McCabeWell, warrants, in the quarter, there was $5 million worth exercised, about $1 million of that should be retired and that was tendered for shares and then $4 million of cash was raised. So the market will dictate when they transact. They expire in December.Myles Alexander WaltonOne of the slides I thought was interesting on Slide 3 is sort of implied what the margin guidance is between the OEM and the aftermarket and that 12%, I guess, implied OEM margin and the 25% implied aftermarket margin. Are those sort of improving in tandem. Is there more of an improvement you're seeing in one side or the other? Just more color there, both this year and into next year, if you can?James F. McCabeThey're both improving. Aftermarket's improving more than OEM. And our mix went from 31% to 41%. So the mix alone drove more profitability. But even within that 41%, we're seeing higher margins because there's just a flow-through from operating leverage as sales increase, and we don't increase fixed costs.Myles Alexander WaltonOkay. Okay. And then, Dan, you've had that $300 million EBITDA target out there for fiscal '25 is the trajectory you're putting up for '24 enough to maintain that for '25 at this point?Daniel J. CrowleySo we think so. It's a quarter-to-quarter measurement, although it's a multiyear goal, we're tracking the OEM rates so closely. As Jim mentioned, volume is our number one lever along with aftermarket to hitting that number. And the direct conversations I had with Boeing and Airbus in the last week, give us confidence that those rate step-ups that their advertising are going to happen. There's no doubt there's a lot of hand-to-hand combat on shortages. But as I mentioned in my script, the percentage of on-time delivery with suppliers has improved in the quarter to the low 90s. We want to get it to mid-90s or higher so that you're really only working shortages on an exception basis. As Spirit recovers on their repairs, Boeing's rate is going to ramp up their confidence in those step-ups and that's the biggest lever for us to hit the $300 million. So we'll continue to update you on that. At the Investor Day that Jim mentioned, we'll give more color in the bridges on both profitability, revenue and free cash flow.OperatorAnd our next question will come from Ron Epstein with Bank of America.Ronald Jay EpsteinSo we got the free cash flow positive, right? That's great. Check. The business cleanup is going. I guess a big picture question. Where to from here? When you think we've kind of gone through kind of the worst of the downturn and how disruptive it was on the company and so on and so forth. But when you look out 5 years from now, 10 years from now, I mean, what's your vision for where Triumph could be?Daniel J. CrowleyYes. Thanks, Ron. And you deserve to ask that question because you've been with us for the whole journey. I've looked at our product lines, and we've got great content, and we talked about the IP expansion in 5 to 10 years. What you're going to see is Triumph is a market leader in fuel pumps and heat exchangers, gear boxes and actuation. And as the fleet evolves towards more electric fleet, you're going to see us adapt our products to meet that need. And the reason I know this is happening is because our customers are funding us to do the R&amp;D right now for the platforms that will be fielded in that 5- to 10-year window. Whether it's Airbus doing an electric regional jet that requires a gearbox to transfer electrical power to the propellers or whether it's additive manufacturing that will replace the current castings on gearboxes, we're making those investments. We're helping on the next-gen variable bypass jet engines. I mentioned GE, the LM25NX. We've got key roles on those fuel pumps. So we can tell that the pipeline of technology and products is going to be transitioning into new starts and then production. So we don't have to guess what the future is going to look like because we're already working on it. And I think you'll see us in aftermarket expand our services, the FAA ATA chapters. So Triumph will continue to be supply as we do today, thrust reverser overhaul and engine accessories, but we'll branch into other products. And the investments we're making in partnerships will make us a more global company in 5 years, especially in Asia and the Middle East. So think of Triumph as a company that's even -- has a stronger portfolio than we had in 2010 when the -- when Triumph went down the path of structures. We're going to have a mix of business that's comparable to the Moogs, the Parkers, the Eatons with a much bigger footprint in terms of global markets.Ronald Jay EpsteinAnd then how much of the mix do you think will be defense. I mean, what's your goal for that between defense and commercial, like ultimately?Daniel J. CrowleySo when we started, we were 80%-20% commercial defense and we're now 37%. And we're getting to the point where there's enough balance and diversity in our mix of business, that we can be more selective on what we pursue based on its contribution to cash flow generation and debt reduction. So we have plenty of both now, and it's a good position to be in because as I mentioned, the budgets are strong on the defense side. So ultimately, we may level out at 40% to 45% defense, but that number is less important than the contribution of the individual programs to our financial goals. Everybody on the management team is focused on debt reduction and free cash flow generation. And you're already seeing top line is now starting to grow in the core and earnings are coming up. Now the focus is on cash.Ronald Jay EpsteinGot it. And if I may, just one quick follow-on. In the current market, I'm certain you guys are seeing this, there's virtually no usable spare part, the U.S., and parts that are out there. There's nothing out there. There's been a bigger push in the PMA because of airlines are just looking for parts. Is there anything medium term you guys can do to kind of grow the spares business?Daniel J. CrowleyIn our OEM businesses, we've got depots that are embedded in the production plants. And so recapturing our aftermarket tail is definitely a priority whether it's hydraulic fuses or all the consumable hold back bars for the military. Every time an F/A-18 goes off the deck, it's Triumph pull back bar. So we've got factories that are really focused on extending the aftermarket sale for the OEM products that we have. I understand your point on used serviceable materials. For us, it's the regional expansion in aftermarket. So Asia, Middle East, potentially Latin America, these are markets that we don't really play in to a great extent. So we'll see volume growth through regional expansion.OperatorOur next question will come from Michael Ciarmoli with Truist.Michael Frank CiarmoliCongrats on getting to the free cash flow here. Maybe, again, just to stay on that topic. I think it's been kind of 6 years or kind of Ron's original question on that topic, 6 years since you've been here. You've got the renamed interior structure. I mean is there any more portfolio shaping left? I mean, do you have the core businesses now? And I guess, specifically, do you think interiors has a long life in that 5- to 10-year look for Triumph?Daniel J. CrowleyYes. Thanks, Michael. First, remember that the structures business is less than 10% of our sales and metallic structures now is out of the portfolio entirely. So what's left is interiors. And remember, we posted these numbers for Q4 and fiscal '23 with our interiors business being largely breakeven. So we've got a lot of upside here. That business was a 20% business in the past. We expect the volume to double over our planning horizon. And it's a really good plan. We've consolidated all the work down into 2 factories in Mexico. It's very cost competitive, very lean. So we're bullish on interiors, and we think it's going to be a big tailwind to margin expansion and cash flow in the future. And it's a business that we do well. We are a market leader in that space, whether it's insulation or cabin floors, ducting those are all strengths for us. So we're excited about it. But overall, the 6 years we've been coming at Triumph has led to the portfolio we've got today, and although we may do some minor product line exits, we have the business we need now to deliver on the restructuring and transformation.Michael Frank CiarmoliGot it. Helpful. And then, Jim, just on that -- on the free cash flow, ultimately, grinding that to mid-single digits and then high single digits. Can you give us more color maybe behind the mechanics there? Is it going to be just managing that cap structure and kind of paring down that interest drag? Is there any more optimization of working capital. Should we even think about as you guys look at the cap structure and maybe the warrants come to a close here. Do you contemplate any sort of equity offerings to sort of manage that interest burden?James F. McCabeI think it's important to note that I'm not relying on capital structure improvements for the cash flow. This is really operating cash flow coming from volume increases from demand in OEM and aftermarket and it's our growing installed base, we're going to have a bigger percentage of aftermarket moving forward. But we're pretty conservative in our capital structure assumption. So that's only upside for us if we can find ways to optimize that, which we will work on. But we're not counting on that for our cash flow guidance. In terms of working capital, last year, we used, I think, $32 million roughly of working capital, and we're going to generate in the single digits of working capital in '24 is our plan. And that's because of stabilization of supply chain and really our own internal efficiencies as well. So that's going to contribute, but it will be a modest contributor because, of course, even though we're generating a little bit of cash by reducing working capital, we still are supporting growth with the remaining inventory and working capital. So it's operationally driven, not capital driven.Michael Frank CiarmoliPerfect. I'll jump back in the queue.OperatorOur next question will come from Jack Ayers with TD Cowen.Jack AyersThis is Jack on for Cai today. Congrats on the quarter. So yes, so I wanted to just start on Q4. Obviously, really strong improvement with margins growing sequentially. And I just wanted to just make sure we're calibrated here. I know you called out that IP transaction on the commercial OEM side. I'm not sure if that was from a previous quarter. Just any color there and just the associated earnings with that would be really helpful?James F. McCabeYes. Thanks, Jack. That was a couple of quarters ago. That was in Q2 that, that transaction happened. Fourth quarter was very clean. No material one timers.Jack AyersOkay. Got it. Got it. That makes sense. And then lastly, I just kind of wanted to ask about military and new programs you're watching here as we look out over the next few years. And I know Boeing called out the T7 sort of delays here for a couple of years. And I know you guys have pretty good content there. I just want to hear your perspective on that issue? And then just any broad color on new programs in military?Daniel J. CrowleySo we're focused on the mature programs that are in production now like F-35, and we've been approached by Lockheed Martin to develop content that would upgrade the aircraft in areas like cooling, heat rejection, actuation. So that's our first place to start. Then we're on the emerging programs like MQ-25. We do have a small content on T-7A. It used to be bigger when we had the structures, but we exited that. So T-7A is not a big driver. But on the 6 gen fighters that are now getting funded, we've got content across the different OEMs. And I mentioned GE's new military engine in the LM25NX, which has a lot of advantages and the benefits of 2 engine competitions are pretty well understood. So we're excited. I'd say rotorcraft is a very strong area for Triumph. So as CH-53K gets their LRIP awards, we go up in volume. We have significant shipset content on that platform. And then they're working on the Army's future vertical lift platforms. We're on both of those teams for FARA and FLRAA.And it's a time when our customers are also doing tech refresh to their existing fleets. So think Apache. We do a lot of heat exchanger work for the Apache. We do gearboxes for that as well. And even though the Army is starting modernization, they're going to operate their legacy fleet for a long time. And so they're putting fixes in the components that we do, especially at our engine control business to refresh them and increase their reliability. So for us, military is a broad, diverse set of platforms. One area that we've had more inquiries of late is in classified programs and whether it's Northrop Grumman or Lockheed Martin, we've had more inbounds on that. So we've been working with Lockheed on the digital thread capability, which they'd like to have all their suppliers put in place to provide improved data sharing whether it's engineering or manufacturing data, and we're collaborating with them on supply chain as well. So I feel like the defense business gives us all sorts of ancillary benefits. The cash terms are good, the customer funds a lot of the R&amp;D, and they're pulling us in, in the early phases. So I'm happy to have expanded our defense work and it's going to benefit us going forward.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our next question will be a follow-up from Myles Walton with Wolfe.Myles Alexander WaltonI did have just one quick one, I forgot to ask. I realize you had sold the 767 facility to Daher in the middle of last year. But I'm curious, is there any liability you all have to carry for the Boeing quality issues that were discovered in the 767 fuel tank. I don't know if there's anything that predated the sale that might be a liability you're carrying today?Daniel J. CrowleyNo, not at this time. Recall, we sold this business in July of last year. And at that time, we had Boeing consent, and there was no material issues that were outstanding -- material manufacturing issues related to any of the programs there. And we continue to support Boeing and Boeing -- both defense and commercial across the board. You know we've done 15 divestitures. We've not had reach back from prior asset sales, and we're committed to quality. I'm very proud of the performance that I mentioned in my comments about cost of poor quality. So we will support any inquiries that we've received in the future, and we'll update investors as appropriate. But right now, it's not a concern.OperatorOur next question will come from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.Noah PoponakI wanted to talk about or ask about Slide 6, where you've laid out the OEM rates. You had a slide like this for a little while now that maybe look a little bit more optimistic than some of the others in the space. I guess, there's been a lot of short-term noise and movement, but maybe the '24 and the '25 that you've had all along are we're getting closer to. So I don't know, I was just curious to hear your level of confidence in these. Is there 1 or 2 that look a little a bit more of a long put to you than the others. I guess, specifically the MAX, maybe has the most questions right now with the fittings issue, how confident are you in that 38 and 42 and then overall, Dan, I think you said -- I think you quoted an 8- to 10-month lead time. And so the right side of this chart is about 8 to 10 months from now. Are you at most of these rates now?Daniel J. CrowleySo it varies by factory. But yes, we're seeing pickups in our feeder plants to support it. And it's not just on airframe components. It's also on engines. After the quarter closed, we received the largest contract that's been awarded to Triumph on my watch over 8 years for a GE LEAP engine gearboxes, and we'll put out a press release on that tomorrow. But that's a signal of GE's confidence in demand for LEAP engines for both the MAX and for the A320 family. And if you recall, in the middle of fiscal '23, there was a bit of a slowdown as GE allowed the supply chain to catch up and we finished Q4 with a very high volume of output because demand is coming back. So there's leading indicators, not only with Triumph as a sub-tier supplier but also the engine providers that the rates are coming up. And I've been watching this space a long time. I remember touring Boeing's plant when the 777 was initially rolled out the first all-digital aircraft. I've been through their plants when they did the 787, which really broke the mold on composites and new supply chain approaches. And then the MAX line, I've been down many times, which is very automotive in its style. So they have the capacity to ramp up the line. Yes, part constraints are real. Boeing is putting tremendous amount of people out in the field to expedite any shortages and capacity that was underinvested in during the pandemic is starting to ramp up. So I have confidence in the rates. There seems to be no shortage of end market demand. You read about the orders for these. So the backlog is growing. And the step-ups on 787 from rate 4 to rate 5, we were at 14 on that before. And the demand for that platform is very high. If we can get that back to 10 as Boeing is advertised by 2025, 2026, that's a huge tailwind for Triumph, because we have a lot of content on the 787. So I agree it can't happen soon enough. But these sort of rates are achievable, and we believe will happen in the next 2 years. So as we lay out our multiyear forecast, which is key to hitting -- getting back to like $2 billion in revenue, and generating the kind of cash conversion that you all expect, these rates make that possible.Noah PoponakOkay. Can you estimate -- I know you explained it's different by facility, but can you estimate the enterprise-wide max rate that you're sending out of the company at this moment?Daniel J. CrowleySo why don't we take that as an action and we can address it offline. I don't want to do it from the hip, but we know it by plan. And because, as I mentioned, 6 of the 24 plants support the MAX. We have interiors content, actuation content, controls. So -- and engine gearboxes through GE LEAP CFM. So it's a broad array of plants, and I'd rather get it right and do it. But I can tell you, it's coming up. We've made significant CapEx investment in our gear manufacturing business to support the ramp. And that was key to winning this GE LEAP follow-on contract as it helped us support the volume and maintain pricing. So it's -- it's a coming attraction for sure.Noah PoponakOkay. And so then to follow-on on that, in your bridge on Slide 14 and kind of to Sheila's point about asking for the excel, that net OEM volume lever looks pretty small relative to Slide 6. Why is that? And could you also just say what that number is in that blue sliver there in millions of dollars?James F. McCabeSo Jim, I don't have that sliver quantified in front of me, but it is smaller than the aftermarket volume. And in fact, remember, OEM sales are not as profitable as aftermarket sales. So in terms of generating profit and free cash flow, the aftermarket are actually more important. The OEM volume has a lot of different programs. I think the best way to see what might be in there would be to look at our Slide 18, which is the top programs in backlog. And you'll see the mix of military and commercial. Now you'll see the [37%], which is 15% of our 2-year firm backlog, it's actually more like 10% or 11% of our total sales because all of our sales aren't backlog. There's a lot of book and ship. Diversity of the mix here is why the exact rates of any one program can be mitigated by rate changes in the other direction on another program. So it is a balanced growth with aftermarket leading it and right behind is the OEM volumes.Daniel J. CrowleyNo, you can appreciate, we're trying to be conservative here and not get ahead of the OEM rates or assume faster recovery than what they've advertised. So our guidance is consistent with that mindset.OperatorAnd our last question will be a follow-up from Michael Ciarmoli with Truist.Michael Frank CiarmoliI guess just -- I was kind of hone in on where (inaudible) is going there. But specifically on the A320 rate, in regards to what Airbus has said. I know they're dealing with some supply chain issues, but they're still targeting that kind of 60, 65 by the end of '24 and 75. So how do we think about that rate, 49, with that 8- to 10-month lead time?Daniel J. CrowleySo I'm going to refer you to Airbus because I don't want to speak for them, but if you saw their month-over-month deliveries, they came up very quickly in the month ending March. And so yes, they are also working supply chain issues, but they're -- you have to look at very timely data in order to project the future revenues -- the future build rates from there.OperatorAnd this concludes our question-and-answer session and also concludes today's conference call. We would like to thank you for attending and participating in today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.]"

(Photo: Shutterstock/Abdul N Quraishi - N Abs)A DHL regional cargo airline that operates a fleet of midsize Boeing 757 cargo jets from its base in Austria expects to add four Boeing 767 converted freighters this year for its European network but is seeking the option to fly them to the U.S.DHL Air Austria will deploy 767-300 cargo jets in September to deliver packages and freight in Europe, a spokesman said in an email message that didn’t mention a specific number of aircraft. A request to U.S. authorities to open U.S. routes is purely precautionary, he explained.In a filing last month, the express company’s Austrian airline asked U.S. authorities for a license to conduct scheduled and ad hoc charter operations to the U.S., as well as a two-year exemption from the requirement to have a foreign carrier permit so it can begin flying while the Department of Transportation processes its request. The document states the carrier plans to secure four 767-300s and fly them to and from the U.S.DHL officials declined to identify the source for the planes, but they are believed to be part of a November 2021 order with Boeing for nine passenger-to-freighter conversions of 767 aircraft for its intercontinental fleet. The 767 is a medium widebody freighter.DHL Air Austria is one of six airlines owned by Deutsche Post DHL (DXE: DPW) to support its parcel delivery network and is part of the DHL Aviation group, which includes several contract carriers. Based at Vienna International Airport, it was formed in 2021 when DHL transferred 18 B757 narrowbody freighters and pilots there from East Midlands Airport in the United Kingdom to operate intra-European routes. DHL Air UK was transformed into the group’s international long-haul wing with a mandate to fly long-haul aircraft. The U.K. air unit has 10 767s, three 777s and five 757s in service, according to database Planespotters.net.Airlines often ask for a foreign carrier permit as a placeholder so they have the authority in place if, or when, they are ready to launch a service, according to aviation attorneys. The airlines are under no obligation to use the permit. And sometimes airlines will obtain traffic rights so they are eligible for government contracts, such as for mail carriage, and can book the freight space on a partner airline’s flight that shares its designator code. Code sharing is a way for airlines to expand their market presence on routes they don’t serve.Story continuesAdding language referring to a specific start date can encourage regulators to stay focused on an application so it doesn’t languish even if the carrier doesn’t have concrete plans to begin operations.“In this case, just because we are asking for permission to theoretically serve transatlantic routes with our aircraft does not mean that there are concrete plans to do so. It’s about being prepared and not having to request the permit on short notice if this should ever change,” the DHL spokesman said.In related news, Mesa Air Group said in its second-quarter earnings presentation this month that it incorporated a 737-800 converted freighter to its fleet that operates for DHL Express out of its Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky airport hub. The plane was provided to Mesa by DHL. Mesa Air Group also flies three 737-400 converted freighters for DHL’s network.Click here for more FreightWaves/American Shipper articles by Eric Kulisch.Contact Eric: ekulisch@freightwaves.com RECOMMENDED READING:DHL launches intra-European airline to meet e-commerce demandDHL locks in freighter capacity with ATSG lease extensionCargojet to sell 777 aircraft, defer cargo conversions as demand slipsThe post DHL Air Austria seeks US access for incoming 767 freighters appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

Over the past year, the model has been improved so that users can project data out to 2050 instead of visualizing only a single point in time, the company said.Boeing officials believe it will take a ""collection"" of technology or process changes to move the needle on emissions, Boeing Chief Sustainability Officer Chris Raymond said on Wednesday during an event hosted by the U.S. planemaker and attended by airline and government officials.But Raymond added that sustainable aviation fuel provides the most immediate pathway for the aviation sector to cut its carbon footprint, as it can immediately be used by airlines while advances in electric or hydrogen-powered aircraft may not be mature enough to meaningfully reduce emissions ahead of 2050.The public launch of Cascade comes just days after U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg met with counterparts from Canada, the United Kingdom and Singapore at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to discuss investments in sustainable aviation fuel.On Tuesday, Reuters reported that European Union countries are set to finalize SAF targets for airports despite some pushback from airlines.SAF – which is derived from waste feedstocks like cooking oil – remains expensive and scarce, with total SAF production in the United States in 2022 making up less than 0.1% of the total jet fuel used by major U.S. airlines, according to the Government Accountability Office.Story continues“Our intent is to scale SAF and help it scale by first ... examining what has to change in an airplane to be 100% compatible with (SAF),” Raymond said. “We have to help advocate for the policies that will help the industry scale up (production).”Boeing announced plans in February to double its SAF purchases in 2023, buying 5.6 million gallons of fuel from Neste.(Reporting by Valerie Insinna in Washington; Editing by Matthew Lewis)]"

Data modeling also measures airplane fleet renewal, operational efficiency, renewable energy sources, future aircraft and market-based measures as pathways to decarbonization.""We created Cascade to serve as an industry tool that creates a common framework among aviation, energy, finance and policy,"" said Boeing Chief Sustainability Officer Chris Raymond. ""By putting data first and sharing this model with the public, we are enabling collaboration, feedback and alignment across industry, government and others who work together to achieve a more sustainable aerospace future.""Key findings from Cascade's assessments include:The journey to net zero is dependent on the overall energy transition. Whether using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), hydrogen or electricity, the energy and emissions associated with the production, distribution and storage of fuels must be minimized to achieve the most sustainable outcome.SAF will be the biggest contributor to reducing carbon emissions because it can be used in commercial airplanes flying today – both new and old. Since many jets flying today will be in service into and even beyond the 2040s, it is imperative to abate their emissions with SAF.While electric- and potentially hydrogen-powered aircraft will emerge in future decades, their contribution to emissions reduction will likely be limited through 2050 due to long timeframes for development and deployment and the magnitude of related infrastructure changes for airports and pipelines.Renewing fleets with best-in-class, fuel-efficient airplanes will significantly reduce emissions in coming years.Story continues""Cascade helps airline operators, industry partners and policymakers see when, where and how different fuel sources affect their sustainability goals,"" said Neil Titchener, Cascade Program Leader. ""Our industry has really hard questions ahead of us, we're going to have to make difficult choices.

The first quarter was difficult for the fund, as it failed to participate in the broader market rally and declined 3.69% compared to the 3.27% decline for the benchmark Russell 3000 Health Care Index and a 7.50% increase for the S&amp;P 500 Index. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2023.Baron Health Care Fund highlighted stocks like The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) in the first quarter 2023 investor letter.

The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) has a market capitalization of $78.648 billion.Baron Health Care Fund made the following comment about The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) is a leading provider of health care services and benefits. Like UnitedHealth, Cigna’s shares were down alongside other managed care companies during the quarter, primarily on sector rotation. Cigna reported a fourth quarter beat and inline 2023 guidance driven by strong enrollment across all products; continued growth in established business (60% of revenue); and outsized growth in Cigna’s accelerated segments comprised of specialty pharmacy, Evernorth Health Services, and its U.S. Government business. Despite these positive results, investors stepped to the sidelines on concerns about proposed changes to the Medicare audit program, preliminary 2024 Medicare Advantage rates, the impact of Medicaid recertification, and heightened scrutiny of pharmacy benefit managers. While we believe that, over the long term, Cigna is a well-run, well-positioned managed care player with solid growth opportunities, we reduced our position to lower overall exposure to the managed health care segment.”Story continuesThe Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

The outlook of the Long-Term ICRs has been revised to stable from positive while the outlook of the FSR is stable.Additionally, AM Best has affirmed the FSR of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term ICRs of ""a"" (Excellent) of Cigna HealthSpring Companies (HealthSpring). The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable. In addition, AM Best has upgraded the Long-Term ICR to ""a+"" (Excellent) from ""a"" (Excellent) and affirmed the FSR of A (Excellent) of Medco Containment Insurance Company of New York (Troy, NY) and Medco Containment Life Insurance Company (Warrendale, PA). The outlooks of these ratings are stable.Concurrently, AM Best has upgraded the Long-Term ICR to ""bbb+"" (Good) from ""bbb"" (Good) and the Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings (Long-Term IRs) of Cigna. AM Best also has affirmed the Short-Term Issue Credit Rating of Cigna. At the same time, AM Best has upgraded the Long-Term IRs of Cigna Holding Company (headquartered in Bloomfield, CT). The outlook of the Long-Term ICRs and Long-Term IRs has been revised to stable from positive. (Please see link below for a detailed listing of the companies and ratings.) The majority of Cigna’s core U.S. operating entities are collectively referred to as Cigna Life &amp; Health Group.The ratings of Cigna Life &amp; Health Group reflect its balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as strong, as well as its strong operating performance, favorable business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM).Story continuesThe Long-Term ICR upgrade for Cigna Life &amp; Health Group reflect its sustained strongest level of risk-adjusted capitalization, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR), and no weakening of balance sheet metrics at the parent, Cigna. Cigna Life &amp; Health Group’s risk-adjusted capitalization has strengthened and remained at the strongest level over the past few years, supported by favorable earnings, despite sizeable annual dividends from the insurance operations. Additionally, the sale of the group insurance business at year-end 2020 removed long-tail risk from the balance sheet and contributed to the group’s improved BCAR score. The balance sheet strength assessment takes into account the elevated investment risk due to higher exposure to alternative assets, commercial mortgages and below investment grade fixed income compared with peer companies.The ratings of Cigna Life &amp; Health Group also reflect Cigna’s elevated financial leverage of approximately 40% at year-end 2022 and the high level of goodwill largely relating to the Express Scripts merger. However, the financial leverage has moderated considerably since 2018 and Evernorth non-insurance operations built around Express Scripts have become a major contributor to revenue, cash flows and earnings for the enterprise. In addition, the integration of vertical capabilities into insurance products led to better cost structure and an improved competitive position for Cigna’s insurance offerings.While the leverage may fluctuate depending on timing of new debt issuances and maturities pay downs, management has repeatedly indicated that it remains committed to managing the financial leverage at approximately 40%. Cigna’s debt service is supported by its strong earnings and dividends from the group’s insurance entities, as well as solid non-regulated earnings from its Evernorth segment. Insurance earnings have been supported by market-leading positions in the self-funded and stop-loss segments. Cigna’s insurance operations are less exposed to government programs compared with peers resulting in higher margins, and the organization has demonstrated profitable growth in the commercial segment over the past several years.The ratings of HealthSpring reflect its balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as adequate, as well as its adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate ERM.HealthSpring is comprised of Medicare Advantage business, however growth in that segment has been below projections for several years. The organization has focused on margin improvement rather than membership growth in this segment, and earnings strengthened in 2022.The ratings of Cigna Life Insurance Company of Europe S.A.-N.V. (CLICE) (Belgium) reflect its balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate ERM. Additionally, the company benefits from rating enhancement from Cigna.The ratings of CIGNA Global Insurance Company Limited (CGIC) (Guernsey) reflect its balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its adequate operating performance, limited business profile and appropriate ERM. Additionally, the company benefits from rating enhancement from Cigna.A complete listing of The Cigna Group and its subsidiaries’ FSRs, Long-Term ICRs and Long- and Short-Term IRs also is available.This press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best’s website.

88,c2afb39e-d238-306c-88d6-9113e7b07de9,CI,2023-05-18,Cigna Group (CI) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cigna-group-ci-trending-stock-130001319.html,1684328401,STORY,['CI'],"[Cigna (CI) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this health insurer have returned -1.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.5% change. The Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry, to which Cigna belongs, has lost 3.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Cigna is expected to post earnings of $6.07 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.4%.The consensus earnings estimate of $24.78 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +6.5%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.27 indicates a change of +14.1% from what Cigna is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Cigna.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CI _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Cigna, the consensus sales estimate of $47.18 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.8%. The $188.61 billion and $225.88 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.4% and +19.8%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCigna reported revenues of $46.48 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.4%. EPS of $5.41 for the same period compares with $6.01 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $45.52 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.11%. The EPS surprise was +3.44%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cigna is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cigna. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $34.7 million, the contract is expected to be completed by February 2026. Per the terms of the contract, Lockheed will provide program management, software engineering, software engineering transformation and cyber support to develop the Beyond Line-of-Sight F-35 Capability.Majority of the work related to this deal will be executed in Fort Worth, TX.Importance of F-35 for LMTLockheed enjoys a dominant position in the global military aircraft space with its F-35 fleet. The stealth aircraft boasts features that make it an ideal choice for many nations. The company’s constant efforts to modernize and upgrade the aircraft using advanced technologies to meet current warfare needs, boost demand significantly.The F-35 program remained the largest revenue generator for the Aeronautics business unit. It also accounted for 66% of the segment’s net sales in 2022.Lockheed has delivered 894 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, with 345 jets in backlog till December 2022. This, along with the latest contract win, boosts sales expectations for the abovementioned segment.LMT expects to deliver 147-153 jets per year in 2023 and 2024, and 156 jets in 2025 and beyond. This should bolster the company’s revenues from the military aircraft field.Growth ProspectsPer Mordor Intelligence projections, the global military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of more than 4% during 2022-2031. Such projections indicate immense opportunities for Lockheed to reap the benefits of military aircraft market expansion.Other prominent defense majors involved in the manufacturing of military aircraft are Northrop Grumman NOC, Airbus Group EADSY and Textron TXT. These stocks are also expected to gain from the aforementioned market’s growth opportunities.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft. From fighter jets and stealth bombers to surveillance and electronic warfare, it has been providing manned solutions to customers worldwide. The company has built some of the world’s most advanced aircraft, ranging from the innovative B-2 Spirit stealth bomber to the game-changing E-2D Advanced Hawkeye.Story continuesIts Aeronautics Systems unit is engaged in the design, development, production, integration, sustainment and modernization of advanced aircraft systems. The Mission Systems segment, on the other hand, offers advanced mission solutions and multifunction systems like Airborne Early Warning &amp; Control, LONGBOW Fire Control Radar and Scalable Agile Beam Radar.Airbus Group’s military aircraft consists of the A400M, the C295 tactical transporter, the new-generation A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport and the Eurofighter, the most advanced swing-role fighter ever conceived.The company has been providing its aircraft customers with an extended portfolio of services for more than 40 years, ranging from the training of flight and ground staff to live firing exercises anywhere around the world.Textron’s military aircraft includes the Beechcraft T-6 training aircraft and the Beechcraft AT-6 light attack aircraft. The company also manufactures the Beechcraft Model 18 light bomber, the T-44 and T-34 training aircraft, and the T-1A jet trainer.Its subsidiary, Able Aerospace Services, provides component and maintenance, repair and overhaul services in support of commercial and military fixed and rotor-wing aircraft.Price MovementShares of Lockheed have gained 1.6% in the past 12 months against the industry’s decline of 6.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankLockheed currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

90,870f1dbd-2854-3262-ad95-8c50410883ed,NOC,2023-05-18,Northrop Grumman (NOC) Announces an 8% Hike in the Dividend,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/northrop-grumman-noc-announces-8-114011568.html,1684323611,STORY,"['NOC', 'LMT', 'RTX', 'CW']","[Northrop Grumman Corp. NOC recently announced that its board of directors approved a hike in its quarterly dividend to $1.87 per share, reflecting an increase of 8% from the prior payout. With the current hike, Northrop will now pay out an annual dividend of $7.48 per share. This represents an annual dividend yield of 1.72% based on its share price worth $435.63 as of May 16.NOC’s annualized dividend yield is higher than the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite’s yield of 1.53%. This signifies Northrop’s strength in the business to generate enough cash flow to reward shareholders with improved dividend payouts.Can Northrop Grumman Sustain Dividend Hikes?Northrop Grumman has been consistently boosting shareholder returns, as gauged by its payout of $953 million, $983 million and $1,052 million in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Such a solid distribution strategy is generally buoyed by the steady performance of a company in generating sales and stable cash flows from operations.NOC recorded a 6% increase in its sales in the last reported quarter. Meanwhile, its operating cash flow came in at $702 million at the end of the first quarter of 2023 compared with $488 million in the year-ago quarter.Going forward, Northrop Grumman expects to generate sales in the band of $38-$38.40 billion for 2023, which suggests an upside of 4.4% from the prior-year reported figure. Such an improvement in sales may allow the company to sustain dividend hikes in the days ahead.Moreover, Northrop Grumman’s business strength lies in the orders and new awards the company receives as one of the prime defense contractors, which converts into a robust backlog. NOC entered 2023 with a backlog of more than two times its annual sales, backed by increasing demand and rising global defense budget supports.Also, the U.S. Department of Defense budget request for fiscal 2024 reflects a funding proposal of $842 billion, which represents an increase of $25 billion or 3% over the FY23 enacted funding. Such enhanced defense funding should increase the demand for Northrop products, boosting prospects for a strong order inflow in the days ahead.Story continuesIn light of the aforementioned factors, one may conclude that NOC may continue to witness a strong revenue performance and order inflows. These may assist the company in undertaking such shareholder-friendly moves going forward.Peer MovesDefense companies that have been engaging in rewarding shareholders with impressive dividend payouts are as follows:In September 2022, Lockheed Martin LMT approved a hike in its quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share from the prior payout.LMT boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.2%. Shares of Lockheed have delivered 1.6% in the past year.On May 10, 2023, Curtiss-Wright CW announced that the board of directors declared a 5% increase in the quarterly dividend to 20 cents per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Curtiss-Wright’s 2023 sales suggests a growth rate of 5.2% from the prior-year reported figure. CW shares have risen 14.2% in the past year.In April 2023, Raytheon Technologies RTX announced an increase of 7.3% over the prior quarter's dividend amount.RTX has a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.3%.

    Wednesday, May 17, 2023Senators want to regulate AI before it gets too big. They're running out of time.If the senators gathered for the Senate Judiciary Committee’s hearing on AI on Tuesday seem to agree on one thing, it’s that they don’t want to miss the opportunity to regulate AI like they did social media.Throughout the hearing, which included testimony by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, IBM (IBM) Chief Privacy and Trust Officer Christina Montgomery, and NYU professor Gary Marcus, senators repeatedly pointed to Congress’ failure to regulate social media or pass any kind of meaningful data privacy legislation.The gist of the legislators’ warnings came down to the potential for AI being used to influence consumers, generate disinformation, or reinforce bias.“We had the same choice when we faced social media. We failed to seize that moment,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said. “Now we have the obligation to do it on AI before the threats and risks become real.”Fears that AI will be misusedDuring the hearing, Altman, Montgomery, and Marcus each told the gathered senators that Congress should put at least some kind legislation into place to govern the use of AI. Altman and Marcus in particular called for a new regulatory body that could provide the appropriate licenses for companies to deploy different types of AI.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks before a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law hearing on artificial intelligence, Tuesday, May 16, 2023, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Without those, the witnesses said, AI could present its own unique set of problems.“Fundamentally, these new systems are going to be destabilizing,” Marcus said in his opening testimony. “They can and will create persuasive lies at a scale humanity's never seen before. Outsiders will use them to affect our elections. Insiders to manipulate our markets and our political systems. Democracy itself is threatened.”Altman, for his part, said he has his own set of fears about AI. “I think if this technology goes wrong, it could go quite wrong,” he said. “And we want to be vocal about that. We want to work with the government to prevent that from happening.”Story continuesSen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), meanwhile, questioned whether AI could be used to influence public opinion.Calls for social media regulation but no actionFor years members of Congress have called for stricter regulations over social media content.Politicians have called for companies like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to be stripped or depleted of their Section 230 protections. Others have pushed for the establishment of comprehensive data privacy legislation to protect users’ online information.There’s a handful of reasons social media has avoided regulations, including a lack of consensus on just how to do it. Section 230, which serves as the backbone of the modern internet, is a frequent target of both Democrats and Republicans. But neither side can agree on why.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks during a keynote address announcing ChatGPT integration for Bing on February 7, 2023. (Photo by Jason Redmond / AFP) (JASON REDMOND via Getty Images)Democrats say they want to hold sites accountable for what their users post, especially when it comes to disinformation, while Republicans say they want to go after sites for over-moderating content.Privacy regulation, meanwhile, has been in the works for years, but here we are in 2023 and there’s no true national data privacy law.There’s potentialWhile Congress hasn’t been able to pull anything together with regards to social media or privacy, it looks as though there might be hope for AI regulation.In addition to Altman and Montgomery calling for regulation, senators were largely open to ideas about how to deploy AI responsibly. And unlike hearings about social media when lawmakers have been hostile to witnesses such as Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg or former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, the senators were generally calm and thoughtful in their comments.Still, it’ll likely be some time before any kind of regulation sees the light of day. Blumenthal himself said that Tuesday’s hearing was the first of a number to come. But with the pace at which AI is advancing, that could be too long for Congress to wait.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

Welcome to Lightning eMotors First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'll turn the conference over to Brian Smith, Vice President of Investor Relations. Brian, you may now begin.Brian SmithThank you, operator, and thank you for joining us. On the call today are Lightning's Co-Founder and CEO, Tim Reeser; Chief Revenue Officer, Kash Sethi; and CFO, David Agatston. Ahead of this call, Lightning issued its first quarter 2023 earnings press release and presentation deck, which we will reference today. These could be found on the Investor Relations section of our website at lightningemotors.com. On this call, management will be making statements based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements due to risk factors that are listed in today's earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. We assume no duty to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Today's presentation also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the information contained in today's earnings press release for definitional information and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures. With that, let me turn it over to Tim.Story continuesTimothy Richard ReeserThank you, Brian, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. I'll start off on Slide 4 with today's agenda. I will begin with the first quarter summary; followed by an overview of key products, supply chain progress and conclude with a short discussion on product positioning and the incentive landscape. Kash will then provide an update on products and markets, and David will wrap up with a financial summary and discuss the agreement we announced today with Yorkville Advisors to provide growth capital. Moving to Slide 5. First, the ZEV4 transition to the GM platform is now complete. The transition had to be expedited because the Romeo recall on the legacy ZEV4 product forced us to accelerate the sunsetting of our E-450 platform. While the gap in our product offerings during the transition period caused our financial results in the previous 2 quarters to be disappointing, the investment we made in this new platform was clearly the right decision. In the quarter, Lighting produced 53 vehicles in powertrains. And of those, 13 were ZEV4s on the new GM platform and the rest was ZEV3 vehicles. In addition to completing the manufacturing transition in Q1, we took steps to support our customers through this recall, which I will discuss in more detail. The combination of not having enough new ZEV4 vehicles ready to replace the legacy vehicles in early Q1, plus the expense we are incurring to provide customer refunds and replacement vehicles for impacted customers, muted revenue. The relatively complex accounting to correctly reflect the recall transaction in our financial statements is what caused the delay in our 10-Q filing and earnings release. Now that this transition to the new platform is in our rearview mirror, we can look ahead. And I am pleased with the strong order book we have built for our ZEV4 school bus and public transit shuttle bus business. In many cases, the orders we have been receiving for the ZEV4 school buses and public transit shuttle buses have been the direct result of the new incentive landscape. As we've previously highlighted, Class 4 electric school buses and public transit shuttle buses are uniquely positioned to receive the $40,000 IRA incentive, that's on top of EPA or FDA incentives that can then be added to state incentives. In addition to the bus momentum, Kash will talk more about the new 126-unit order from Macnab EV sales that we announced last Friday and that we expect to revenue in the second and third quarters of this year. On the funding side, I'm pleased to announce a new agreement with Yorkville Advisors that we believe will help provide us the capital we need to continue our growth trajectory. David will provide more detail and discuss our commitment from Yorkville. Moving to Slide 6. I will provide more detail on the impact we experienced from Romeo's battery quality issues in Q4 2022 and Q1 2023. We were forced to recall all Romeo batteries due to defects we identified, but those fixes required Romeo support, which we expected to receive. They have not agreed to provide support or honor their battery warranty, and we filed suit against Nickel and Romeo on March 9. We chose to do the right thing for our customers, and we are buying back the full vehicles containing Romeo batteries. As highlighted, this battery issues significantly impacted Q4 and Q1 sales. Furthermore, we booked the majority of the cost of the vehicle buyback against revenue in Q1. The relatively small remainder of the buyback costs will be amortized against future 2023 revenue and recognition of the commitment made by our customers to purchase new ZEV4 vehicles to replace the vehicles under the recall. In addition, we've been able to recover value from the vehicles we repurchased through sales of chassis and other components in the secondary market. This resale value is also factored into the net impact to our financials. While the situation has certainly been difficult, given the impact to Q4 2022 and Q1 '23, the good news is that our customers appreciated our support and holistic solution. We are working with them to convert their original orders from the legacy Class 4 platform with Romeo batteries to the new GM platform with Proterra batteries. Many of our customers have already made the switch, and some have already received their new ZEV4 vehicles. Moving to Slide 7. Unlike many of our peers, we have mature offerings that include a full range of fleet electrification solutions from vehicles and service to powertrain technology, charging, finance and incentives; and finally, our Lightning Insights' telematics and analytics offerings, which provide fleet intelligence, including driving efficiency, charging optimization and predictive maintenance. Lightning now has over 500 vehicles spread throughout the U.S. and Canada, supported by a spare parts and service infrastructure and a talented service team already in place. Combined with our robust manufacturing capabilities, we are ready to scale. Moving to Slide 8. I want to elaborate on our new streamlined product development focus for 2023. Our near-term focus is on our ZEV4 vehicles. which includes Class 4 school and shuttle buses and Class 4 trucks built on the GM platform, plus our mobile DC fast charger and best-in-class telematics and charging systems. We shipped the platform vehicles in Q1 and are delivering our first revenue units of the Mobile DC fast charger in Q2. Although we don't know what the sales cycle will be on the DC fast charger, given the newness of the product and the high ASP, we are working to accelerate it by helping customers rent or lease the product to our finance and lease partners. Customers are showing strong interest in our school buses, public transit shuttle buses, trucks and the mobile DC fast charger, and we expect all 4 to drive strong revenue growth in the second half of this year. Moving to Slide 9, let's discuss the supply chain landscape. On the chassis side, our work with GM is providing a sufficient and consistent supply of chassis to serve our targeted markets, but expect timing of deliver -- but exact timing of deliveries can still impact quarterly revenue. The GM chassis is preferred by most Type A school bus providers and we are currently the only OEM with an electrified solution on this platform. We are continuing to work on our purpose-built Lightning eChassis, and we expect to begin initial testing in the second half of this year and move into production next year. On the battery front, we have sufficient quantities of high-quality batteries from Proterra and CATL for our near-term needs. Beyond chassis and batteries, we continue to work to diversify our supply chain with new higher production, lower cost suppliers to help reduce the cost of lead times we are seeing for components such as electric power steering, high-voltage gears, high-voltage air conditioners and thermal management parts. Turning to Slide 10. You can see how the North -- how the new North American U.S. incentive programs match our current product offerings, and our customers are very excited to use these incentives to help fund a large portion of the purchase price of their vehicles. Most of these programs have launched recently, so we are beginning to see increased order activities we help customers navigate the application process and obtain needed approvals. And now I'll turn it to Kash to provide an update of our products, markets and sales momentum.Kash SethiThank you, Tim. I'll begin on Slide 12. I'm glad to share that we continue to deploy zero-emission vehicles with customers in real-world environments across multiple market verticals and commercial vehicle applications. Our deployed fleet of over 540 zero-emission vehicles has accumulated an impressive 4.2 million miles on the road, a number growing rapidly every week. Although deploying new technologies isn't easy and some bumps are expected, we continue to improve our product reliability and are receiving repeat orders from an expanding customer base. This positions us nicely in a marketplace where many of our competitors are still in their prototype development and testing phase. Moving on to Slide 13 summarizes our current product lineup that we expect to drive our business in 2023: zero-emission cargo vans, delivery trucks, passenger vans, shuttle buses, school buses and the second-generation Lightning Mobile DC Fast Charger. We have strong distribution partners in place for these products. Additionally, we're exploring new partnerships that have strong growth potential in 2024 and beyond. Moving to Slide 14. I want to highlight our next-generation ZEV4 platform built in collaboration with General Motors. As a reminder, we signed an agreement with GM last year, which gives us direct access to GM chassis supply and facilitates strong technical collaboration between our engineering teams. This includes software development, testing and validation and data gathering from a GM-specified crash test. The depth of this effort helps ensure we deploy OEM-level quality products. Lightning is the only commercial EV company to have such a relationship with General Motors as of today. The ZEV4 comes with high-quality, thermally managed Proterra batteries, Thanks to the versatile nature of this platform, we'll be building a wide variety of vehicles on the ZEV4, including school buses, public transit shuttle buses, delivery trucks and work trucks. Deployments have already begun, and we expect to ramp up in the coming quarters. Now turning to Slide 15. We're excited about the tremendous response that our second-generation Lighting Mobile DC Fast Chargers received, which is now operational and in production. We've developed this product based on over 2 years of testing and customer feedback on our first-generation Lightning Mobile. It can pack up to 420-kilowatt hours of energy and can fast-charge up to 5 vehicles at a time. The impressive array of use cases range from fleet managers needing short- to medium-term charging solutions, as they wait for their long-term charging infrastructure of brakes to be done; to event planners who want to provide passenger car charging at concerts, sporting events and music festivals; to tow-truck companies who would use it to rescue EVs that may be stranded after running out of juice. To showcase this product, we demonstrated a working unit at the recent ACT Expo in Southern California, where the Lighting Mobile charged a wide variety of electric vehicles at the show's ride-and-drive section. We also displayed a unit at our booth, where over 100 potential customers engage with us, and feedback was very positive. We already have orders on the books and are on track to deliver the first units this quarter.Turning to Slide 16. I'm pleased to report that we received a large order for 126 zero-emission vehicles from Macnab EV sales, a leading distributor in trucks and buses in Canada. The order is for a mix of ZEV3 and ZEV4 cargo vans, passenger vans and shuttle buses. Deliveries have already begun, and we expect to fulfill the order across Q2 and Q3. And with that, I'll turn it over to David to provide an update on Lightning's financial results and outlook.David AgatstonThank you, Kash. I will now provide some commentary on our first quarter results, followed by our 2023 outlook. Beginning on Slide 18. For the first quarter, we generated GAAP revenues of $1.3 million. On an adjusted basis, our revenue was $3.6 million on sales of 29 units. The difference between adjusted and GAAP revenue is the charge we took for buying back some vehicles with Romeo batteries, as Tim explained previously. In the quarter, Lightning produced 53 vehicles and powertrains. The adjusted EBITDA loss for the first quarter was $19.7 million compared to a $14.8 million loss in the prior year period. The change is primarily related to higher operating expenses in the current period. A reconciliation of net income to the adjusted EBITDA loss can be found on Slide 23, and the revenue reconciliation can be found on Slide 24. Turning to Slide 19. We have been upfront about our need to raise additional capital to fund our operations until we reach cash flow positive. We are pleased that, despite extremely challenging market conditions, we have options. First, we have an existing equity line of credit with Lincoln Park, which is currently untapped and could provide us additional capital. Today, we announced an agreement with Yorkville Advisors to provide up to $50 million through a prepaid advance agreement. We are excited about this agreement and partnership with Yorkville, which should help us accelerate our growth. Turning to Slide 20. Here are some more details about the deal with Yorkville. The prepaid advances will come in $2 million tranches and will be used for general corporate purposes. The agreement provides us great flexibility in terms of the timing and number of advances over the 18-month term of the agreement, and Yorkville is willing to increase tranche sizes if market conditions improve. Turning to Slide 21. Lightning ended the first quarter with $35 million in cash and cash equivalents, and we believe this cash, plus initial tranches drawn against the Yorkville facility, is sufficient to fund our operations for the next several quarters. Additionally, we have yet to draw on our equity line of credit, but we have the ability to do so if needed. We continue to explore additional opportunities to raise sufficient capital to fund operations to free cash flow positive, and we remain confident we will succeed. Net inventory at the end of the first quarter was $47 million, about flat with last quarter. We expect to draw down our inventory over the course of the next several quarters, which will help improve our cash flow. The deal with Macnab that Kash highlighted will be fulfilled in large part with existing finished goods inventory and generate cash. Early in Q2, we took actions to reduce our expenses. Despite the capital we can raise with the Yorkville agreement, we may still take further actions to reduce expenditures if we feel they are warranted to further preserve cash. Turning to Slide 22. I will reiterate our outlook for the year. Based on current business conditions, we continue to expect for 2023, revenues to be in the range of $35 million to $50 million, vehicle and powertrain system sales to be in the range of 300 to 400 units, vehicle and powertrain production to be in the range of 400 to 450 units. Now I will turn it back over to Tim for closing remarks.Timothy Richard ReeserThank you, David. I remain very excited about the outlook for Lightning eMotors as we continue to execute our strategy. While we are certainly disappointed with the results over the last 2 quarters, we feel we are now through the issues resulting from the Romeo recall and see significant opportunity to leverage the tailwinds created by the alignment of our new products with the incentive and mandate landscape. The order momentum we see gives us confidence that we will realize the sales volumes and mix required to achieve positive gross margin within the next 12 months. The commitment from Yorkville provides a new source of funding to help us achieve the goals we have for the business. I would like to finish by thanking all of our customers for their confidence in Lightning, our partners for their contributions to our company's success and our shareholders for their support. I especially want to thank our employees who are executing at a high level through a challenging operating environment. And with that, thank you, everyone, and I appreciate your time today. Operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question is from the line of Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer.Colin William RuschCould you just talk a little bit about the customer dynamics? I mean, obviously, having trucks on the road is a huge deal relative to a lot of peers. But working through some of these service issues, can you just speak to the tone of the relationships? And what you're seeing beyond the orders with those customers?Kash SethiYes. So Colin, obviously, when we had the quality issues with Romeo batteries, it's not a good situation because our ideal method is people buy 5 vehicles, 10 vehicles and that leads to hundreds. And if the deployment of 5 or 10 stumbles because of a battery quality issue, that delays them buying hundreds. So it's painful for the customer and it's painful for us. Having said that, the resolutions we have offered have got us a lot of goodwill with customers. So broadly speaking, most of our customers are understanding that technology is new and some bumps are expected. And they're very appreciative of the solutions we've given them. Combined with that, we have a very strong service network that covers across U.S. and Canada, including a combination of our own technicians and our partners. And on many levels, customers really appreciate having a service team that shows up to site when something goes wrong and helps troubleshoot them, instead of some other EV companies that we've heard about where, if an issue happens, it's weeks and weeks before they even see anybody. So the customer dynamic generally is positive. And given the amount of funding that's coming in, it's getting positive every week. Tim, please feel fee to add to that.Timothy Richard ReeserThat was great, Kash. Thank you.Colin William RuschAnd then from a cash management position, I guess, have you thought through and can you communicate just kind of what your expected cash use is for the year as you work through this ramp into some of these bigger numbers as the supply becomes available to build more vehicles?David AgatstonYes. I mean I think, Colin, we expect that -- the cash burn to drop from kind of current levels, just especially because of the inventory we're working through. So we've got a lot of the inventory, whether it's in finished goods or raw materials that we need to build out, what we're forecasting in terms of the order book. And so that's going to be helpful. I mean we've built up inventory in Q4 last year and Q1 of this year. And a lot of batteries have chassis, have some finished goods inventory that we're going to used to fulfill this Macnab order that Kash talked about. So we expect that to help us significantly in terms of cash burn. And from a net perspective, obviously, having this Yorkville cash is also incredibly helpful.Colin William RuschThat makes a lot of sense.OperatorThe next question is from the line of Mike Shlisky with D.A. Davidson.Michael ShliskyI wanted to ask about the Class 4 market and kind of where things stand right now with respect to that market going electric. There are other players trying to go into Class 4 right now over the next couple of years. Most of them seem to be looking at the EV cargo space, not necessarily the shuttle buses and school bus part of that market. But I always thought that school bus, shuttle bus are basically the -- almost the entire classroom market, there's a small cargo space, but it's almost entirely shallow bus and school bus. So can you maybe just give us a feel for how important the shuttle and school bus is to your Class 4 business? And at this point, are you pursuing that smaller cargo piece as well? And how that piece is going for you right now?Timothy Richard ReeserKash, do you want to take that one?Kash SethiYes, sure. So Mike, you're right that you look at Class 4, there's multiple segments. There's cargoes, delivery trucks, work trucks. There are school buses, and there is shuttle buses, public travel shuttle buses. The cargo space is sizable. But when you look at the incentive landscape, it does not have the same incentives. It's got some state incentives. It's got some of the IRA money. But school buses and shuttle buses have FDA and EPA money, a lot of money that's been reserved for many years to come. So while in the gasoline space, the Class 4 cargo market is sizable, when you look at EV adoption and EV markets, we strongly believe that school buses and transit buses will lead the way. And we are very nicely positioned there with already products on the road and more importantly, vehicle body partnerships in place. We do think the cargo space will get some adoption, especially as time goes on, cost drops and more mandates kick in that require customers to go electric. And that's the beauty of our ZEV4 platform. It's the same underlying platform that goes underneath multiple vehicle types, and we can take our investment and look for return across multiple markets. So we believe in our strategy. I agree with you. If you only went after the cargo van space, ignoring the bus space within Class 4, I would make that business case a little hard to justify.Michael ShliskyGreat. That's great color. And I want to follow up on what you just commented on about, mandates. We are starting to hear about the California advanced clean fleet rules that are coming out here. And it looks like a lot to be -- you have to be 10% EV by the end of next year. That's what it seems like for most fleets. That's what it'll have to be next year. Are you already selling California -- certainly, we've seen some of your shuttle buses out there and other vehicles. You discussed the 2024 opportunity in California, just that 1 state alone for your business. Is that a sizable number that could easily beat this year?Kash SethiYes, I believe so. Historically, California has led the way anyway. Going forward, we see a lot of zero-emission vehicles going across the country and across Canada as well, but California will continue being a sizable chunk of the EV market for both reasons, the carrot and the stick. They've got a lot of incentives that can stack on top of the federal incentives. And they've got the stick coming, as you described. So we are already talking with customers who are eager to learn about what the stick means to them next year and how should they start deploying a small number of units now, so they can ramp up as the mandates ramp up. So we do believe it's a sizable market opportunity for us in '24 or '25 and beyond.David AgatstonAnd I would say, Mike, anecdotally, just sitting at the ACT booth for a little bit. A couple of weeks ago, there were a lot of folks that came buy from California government agencies, which I think is part of that and other companies that were located in California because of that mandate.Michael ShliskySo I guess I'm trying to get more of a feel for it. Do you feel better about 2024 now than you did on April 27, before the rules were kind of released? Or were you already feeling that it was going to be strong next year because it's just California in general? Kind of want to get a feel for your pipelines and your sentiment.Kash SethiYes, I think marginally better, but only because we already knew the rule was coming. This rule has been in development for many years, right? It started with rule that manufacturers must sell EVs into California, and we knew they were going to match it up with a rule that fleets must purchase EV. So we have baked in some of the opportunity into our plans, but it's certainly promising to see the rule coming into play and plans actually being executed by the government.Michael ShliskyGreat. One last one for me. Are you currently pursuing any platforms other than GM and your own eChassis, other brands out there that we maybe haven't heard much about in recent quarters?Timothy Richard ReeserAt the moment, Mike, it's -- go ahead, Kash.Kash SethiYes, I was going to say, we are exploring it. We're focused a lot on the ZEV4 on the GM and our own eChassis. I think that will lead the way for us. But we're always looking out for new opportunities, whether in our core markets today or adjacent markets like Off-road, where they could be a good fit for us.Michael ShliskyOff-road. Great. Interesting. I appreciate it.OperatorOur next question is from the line of Abhi Sinha with Northland Capital.Abhishek SinhaThe financial support that you guys got from Yorkville, that's certainly addresses the street that Lightning is here to stay. But if you could provide any color like how you guys thought internally about various other options you have on the table, the dilution and everything that came with it and why this made the most sense?David AgatstonSure, Abhi. I mean, obviously, in this market, it's not like there were tons of awesome opportunities. And so you know that our convert prevents us from any additional debt. So we really had to look at equity. And so anything was going to be somewhat dilutive. What we really like about the way Yorkville was able to structure this facility is that we have these small tranches and that we control when we take them, how many we take, when we need them, et cetera. And so it gave us, we thought, the most flexibility in terms of matching our cash needs with the way they were structuring the facility.Timothy Richard ReeserAnd Abhi, I'd add to that, the -- a couple of things. One of them is they are -- it's a very covenant-light agreement. So we felt that was key, obviously, to give us a lot of flexibility. And the second thing you'll notice, it doesn't have a lot of overhangs. It doesn't have warrants, that sort of thing. So we do feel it's clean capital and is a great option for us for all the reasons we're talking about here.Abhishek SinhaGot it. Sure. And then if you could remind us how many units were recalled? And if I look at still the non-GAAP sales, the delta between the production and the sales is still high. So what else is going on there?Timothy Richard ReeserDavid, I'm thinking -- correct me if you remember more. I think the recall affected 15 to 20 vehicles. Is that accurate?David AgatstonI think a little more than that, probably 20 to 30.Timothy Richard ReeserOkay, so in that range. We were still -- on the other side, to your question, obvious, still -- in the quarter, building some inventory and knowing that we were working on this Macnab deal and a few others, that by having that, those vehicles on the ground ready to go, gave us a leg up in the sales process with those customers. Because as you can imagine, if you're a customer looking for a vehicle right now, if you have a choice of buying a vehicle that you have to wait a long time for or one that's ready to go right now, you often will choose the ones you can get right now. So we did continue. As you look at the last several quarters, we built more than we sold. And now we have an opportunity to reverse that trend here with this large order with Macnab.OperatorThe next question is from the line of Sherif El-Sabbahy with Bank of America.Sherif Abdul-Fattah El-SabbahyJust wondering if you can touch on that recall impact, just taking the difference of vehicles produced versus vehicles sold. At the end of Q1, it looks like differential was about 187 units. So with that 20 or 30 units that you mentioned being the impact, would that be stripped out of the 187? Is that how we should think about units on hand?David AgatstonI'm not sure I'm following the math, Sherif. So sorry, you're saying -- so you -- based on your math, we have 180-or-so -- units in inventory. What was the tie to the recall?Sherif Abdul-Fattah El-SabbahyOnly taking the difference between the vehicles produced and the vehicles sold.David AgatstonYes. And then what was the tie to the recall, sorry?Sherif Abdul-Fattah El-SabbahyI believe you said it was 20 or 30 units?David AgatstonYes. I'm sorry. I'm missing your question around what the recall number...Sherif Abdul-Fattah El-SabbahyMy question would be is, those 20 or 30, would that be coming out of that 187 that are on hand? Or were some of them sold and kind of bought back and wouldn't be kind of in the units on hand?David AgatstonYes. No, I mean we -- so we bought the vehicles back. We're kind of taking them into inventory and reselling components from them. So those would not be part of the units on hand that we would now have to resell because, obviously, we have to strip the batteries which are no longer working out of them. So they're not working vehicles, and we didn't have other batteries that we could put into those 4 chassis.Sherif Abdul-Fattah El-SabbahyAnd then just looking at average selling price, it dipped a little bit sequentially. Is that mostly just mix? Or is there sort of a changeover in pricing when we think about the ZEV3 and 4 products?David AgatstonYes, it's mix. We certainly like -- the pricing on the ZEV4 is certainly stronger, especially because they are qualified for more incentives. So you can keep the price a little higher with customers, because they're getting the discount via the incentives where they're much smaller in the ZEV3s.OperatorThe next question is from the line of Michael Ward with Benchmark.Michael Patrick WardJust to follow up a little bit more on the Yorkville agreement. So this is a straight equity agreement, and it goes out for 18 months. And then you have 2 million tranches. Is the price determined? Is there a minimum? How is it going to work?David AgatstonYes. We followed the docs and have all the details. It's a bit complicated, but they're certainly out there. With each tranche, there's a price that's set with a bit of a discount that determines how the shares convert, but all the details are in the docs that were filed.Michael Patrick WardOkay. The price has already been set upfront though.David AgatstonWith each tranche, yes.Michael Patrick WardWith each tranche. Okay. Is it cumulative? So if you don't exercise a tranche, do you still have the ability to exercise that tranche?David AgatstonYes. I mean it's $50 million over the 18 months, and we choose kind of how we take those, it would be up to 25 tranches.Michael Patrick WardOkay. Is there a minimum you have to take?David AgatstonNo.Michael Patrick WardOkay. David, on one of your charts, you talked about cost cutting. And just was that, you said cost actions to reduce expenses by $5 million to $10 million. Is that operating cash? Or is that capital?David AgatstonCombination.Michael Patrick WardOkay. Can you give some color on that?David AgatstonYes. I mean in terms of operating, we've reduced headcount. Obviously, we're taking a look across consulting, travel, we've reduced. You can -- pretty much any category you can find. We just renewed our D&amp;O insurance and got a lower cost than that and then have really scrubbed any CapEx projects that we're doing this year and only doing the things that were most critical for the business. And then we'll keep looking at those as we go each month to see if there are other things that we should cut further.Michael Patrick WardOkay. So what are you looking at for CapEx for the year?David AgatstonWe would expect it to be around 5%.Michael Patrick WardWow. Okay. And so then the rest of the -- and then -- so you have about $5 million in operating cost reduction, that's what we're looking at?David AgatstonYes. Yes.OperatorThank you. At this time, I show no additional questions. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for joining us today. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.David AgatstonThanks, everyone.Kash SethiThank you, everyone.]"

Edmunds’ data scoured from dealer retail pricing finds that the average used vehicle transaction price in Q1 slipped 6.4% year-over-year, but is still up 44% from five years ago.“After experiencing a meteoric rise in value, used-vehicle prices have slightly inched back toward Earth with the return of price drops and seasonal depreciation but remain significantly higher than they were pre-pandemic,” Edmunds Analyst Ivan Drury wrote in the research report.Edmunds.com used vehicle average transaction price by quarter (Edmunds.com)At $28,381, the average transaction price in Q1 is considerably higher than the $19,657 level five years ago. Even more troubling for buyers looking for used cars is that the available pool of cheap vehicles is dwindling. Edmunds says the share of used vehicles sold for under $20,000 was only 30.6% in Q1, compared to 60.5% in the same period five years ago.Edmunds cites factors like low lease volume in general, which means fewer off-lease cars coming to market, low trade-in volume compared to 5 years ago, and fewer off-rental vehicles being turned over and sold in used market as reasons why the pool of used vehicles has been shrinking.A truck is shown for sale at a car lot in National City, California , U.S., June 15, 2022. REUTERS/Mike Blake (Mike Blake / reuters)With used cars being the primary way for most buyers to get into the entry-level car market, it seems most people earning at the lower end of the pay scale will have a tough time getting a car.“Not long ago, $20,000 was seen as an acceptable amount to spend on a used car to get an optimal blend of miles and age,” Drury writes. “In today’s market $20,000 puts consumers into a much older vehicle or a piece of inventory that is approaching the 100,000-mile mark.”The only bright spot in the report for consumers is that those shoppers who currently own a used car, even those that have gotten older and incurred more miles, haven’t lost that much value as compared to pre-pandemic. An an example, Edmunds finds that the average mileage on a 2018 Toyota Camry has risen by 130% between Q1 2020 and Q1 2023, but stunningly the average transaction price has also increased by 8.0%.Story continuesAnd for those looking to get into a used car in the not too distant future, there might be some relief via the new car market. Edmunds says if new car sales stall out this year, automakers will have to use incentives to move new cars off of dealer lots, which would then but pressure on the used market.But even that may be unlikely, as the automakers have learned a lesson from the pre-pandemic era and are no longer flooding dealer lots with inventory. Instead they have been attempting to “align supply and demand,” meaning they’re making fewer vehicles, making more built-to-order vehicles, meaning heavy incentives may become a thing of the past.—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) took an interesting turn by including advertising in its strategy. A disruptive automotive parts player, Worksport Ltd (NASDAQ: WKSP) made another important step towards launching its promising solar-powered equipment. Meanwhile, traditional automakers such as General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Volkswagen AG (OTC: VWAGY) are facing increasing pressure to accelerate their EV progress.Tesla 2023 Shareholder MeetingDuring its annual meeting in Austin Texas, Musk revealed that Tesla will be trying a little advertising after all. This decision is quite a turnaround as its CEO Elon Musk was saying for years that there is no need for advertising as demand exceeded supply, adding that those funds are being used to make Tesla’s product great.After receiving a positive reaction, Musk also warned of tough economic times that he expects to be around for at least the following 12 months, saying Tesla is not immune to a worsening economy. Musk also stated that Tesla Roadster which was due for production in deliveries back in 2020 is expected to get on the production line in 2024, while its competition Rivian R1T, Ford F-150 Lightning and Ford Mustang Mach-E have already hit the road. Putting aside the fact that Ford is known for producing America’s most beloved pickup, Tesla has no time to waste. Ford also stated that it will be doubling the production of Lightning’s older all-electric sibling, the Mustang Mach-E, this year.Worksport Reaches Another MilestoneAfter having embarked on a journey of becoming a positive economic force in Western New York, Worksport Ltd (NASDAQ: WKSP) has now hired new staff to operate its U.S. facility. The highly skilled staff bring Worksport another step closer to starting U.S. assembly of its hard folding tonneau covers in Western N.Y.Worksport will soon be providing an update regarding the production launch of its improved COR advanced hot-swap battery system. After testing and completion, Worksport will be able to produce its eagerly anticipated SOLIS solar-powered tonneau covers.Story continuesGeneral Motors And Volkswagen Face Threat Of Largest Idled Capacity In ChinaOn Tuesday, Greenpeace warned that Volkswagen and General Motors could have considerable unused production capacity for internal-combustion-engine powered automobiles in China by 2030 if they do not speed up their EV transition. Chinese EV startup BYD Company Limited (OTC: BYDDY)  has been luring away Volkswagen’s customersas it followed Tesla’s price discounting strategy, with General Motors revealing it will be converting more than half of its manufacturing footprint in China to be EV-capable by the end of the decade.General Motors, Toyota And Volkswagen State Biden’s EV Goals Are Too Ambitious To MeetAccording to Reuters, The Alliance for Automotive Innovation that represents General Motors, Volkswagen, Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE: TM), Hyundai, Kia, BMW, Ferrari, Honda Motor Co Ltd (NYSE HMC), McLaren, Subaru, Porsche, believes the goals posed by Biden’s administration are too challenging to meet with building blocks to realize this future not being available due to a restricted supply chain. The new standards aim for 60% of all vehicles sold in the U.S. to be fully electric by the end of the decade, rising from prior goal of 50%. AccConsidering that even Tesla decided to change its strategy that seemed to be ‘written in stone’, it’s safe to say that anything can happen as automakers accelerate their progress towards realizing an all-electric future.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

98,54364b27-f348-3efd-9028-59bc28ba6925,GM,2023-05-18,Here is What to Know Beyond Why General Motors Company (GM) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-general-motors-130001319.html,1684328401,STORY,['GM'],"[General Motors Company (GM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this company have returned -10.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which General Motors Company falls in, has lost 9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.General Motors Company is expected to post earnings of $1.64 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +43.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.4%.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.68 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -12%. This estimate has changed +7.6% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.44 indicates a change of -3.6% from what General Motors Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +7.6%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, General Motors Company is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for GM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of General Motors Company, the consensus sales estimate of $41.7 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +16.6%. The $163.85 billion and $165.96 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.5% and +1.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGeneral Motors Company reported revenues of $39.99 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.1%. EPS of $2.21 for the same period compares with $2.09 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.68 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.38%. The EPS surprise was +34.76%.Over the last four quarters, General Motors Company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.General Motors Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Motors Company. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

99,7c2349d8-33c9-3d8e-a4c0-8e9530313434,GM,2023-05-18,Top 5 Value Stocks to Buy Amid Recession Threats,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-5-value-stocks-buy-112111023.html,1684322471,STORY,"['MGM', 'GM', 'UAL', 'UNM', 'SLCA']","[We are in the middle of a volatile May after a solid April. Severe volatility that hit U.S. stock markets in early 2022, continued till the first quarter of this year. However, investors sailed smoothly in April as weakness in several key economic metric raised hope that the Fed would stop its interest rate hike regime anytime soon.Volatility erupted in May following the fear of a recession in the U.S. economy later this year. In the past month, Wall Street remained rangebound on concerns stemming from the regional banking turmoil.  In its recently concluded May FOMC meeting, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 5-5.25%, making it the highest Fed Fund rate since August 2007.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the ongoing rate hike cycle is perhaps reaching its end, although it will depend on the outcome of economic data. The Fed Chair acknowledged that the current banking turmoil in the United States has led to tighter credit conditions, and is likely to impact economic activities.In the first half of May, the large-cap centric Dow and S&amp;P 500 indexes closed in negative territory. The mid-cap specific S&amp;P 400 Index and the small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 also ended in a negative zone. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is the sole index that managed to gain marginally in the same period.At this stage, investors should be prepared to minimize fluctuations in their portfolio and consequently rebalance it with suitable financial assets to maintain stability. It would be prudent to pick value stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank to cushion the portfolio as well as make some gains from the upside potential. These stocks could prove to be valuable once the rally resumes.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five value stocks. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of A. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Story continuesThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGeneral Motors Co. GM has a compelling portfolio with strong demand for its quality full-size pickups and SUVs. GM’s hot-selling brands in America like Chevrolet Silverado, Equinox and GMC Sierra are driving the top line. We expect General Motors' total revenues to inch up 2.8% in 2023.General Motors will have nine electric vehicle models in the North America market this year, which will buoy top-line growth. GM’s Ultium platform and battery plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Lansing are set to scale up its e-mobility prowess. GM’s strides in autonomous vehicle development also augur well for long-term growth.The forward P/E of General Motors for the current financial year is 4.61X, lower than the industry average of 9.84X. It has a PEG ratio of 0.47, lower than the industry average of 1.20. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.1% over the last seven days. United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL is seeing steady recovery in domestic and international air-travel demand. Owing to robust air-travel demand, UAL expects revenues for the June quarter to grow 14-16% year over year. Our second-quarter total revenue estimate indicates a 14.7% year-over-year increase.For second-quarter 2023, United Airlines expects capacity to improve almost 18.5% from the year-ago reported figure. UAL's focus on cargo revenues is encouraging. UAL's fleet-upgrade efforts are commendable as well.The forward P/E of United Airlines for the current financial year is 4.16X, lower than the industry average of 9.74X. It has a PEG ratio of 0.09, lower than the industry average of 0.28. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 6.3% over the last 30 days. Unum Group’s UNM conservative pricing and reservation practices have contributed to overall profitability. Sustained increase in premiums is being fueled by high persistency levels in core business and strong sales volume along with solid benefits experience. The geographic expansion of UNM is paying off as acquired dental insurance businesses are growing in the United States and the U.K.We believe strong operating results have led to a solid level of statutory earnings and capital, boosting financial flexibility. UNM has continually enhanced shareholders’ value. For the long term, it estimates premium from core business to increase 3-5%. UNM estimates 45-55% growth in adjusted operating EPS by 2024.The forward P/E of Unum for the current financial year is 8.67X, lower than the industry average of 11.75X.

100,c0ef7401-0d94-32a3-8651-f59d8edcac67,MKC,2023-05-18,4 Consumer Staples Stocks to Buy on a Jump in Retail Sales,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-consumer-staples-stocks-buy-112111860.html,1684322471,STORY,"['CAG', 'MKC', 'MKC-V', 'DNUT', 'LW']","[U.S. retail sales rose in April as consumer spending continued to increase in the face of economic headwinds, including higher commodity prices. This comes as inflation has lately been showing signs of easing.However, economic uncertainties prevail, and markets remain volatile. Naturally, people are spending cautiously and primarily on necessities. Given this situation, it would be prudent to invest in consumer staple stocks.Retail Sales ReboundThe Commerce Department said on May 16 that retail sales grew 0.4% in April after an upwardly revised decline of 0.7% in March. Although the figures came in below analysts’ expectations of a rise of 0.7%, the good sign is that the sector is trying to bounce back from its recent lows.Core retail sales, which exclude autos and gasoline, jumped a solid 0.6% in April. Seven of the 13 retail categories recorded growth in April. These included solid advances at general merchandise outlets, online merchants and auto dealers.People also spent more at restaurants. However, sales saw a decline at sporting goods, hobby stores, furniture retailers and appliances and electronics outlets.One of the major reasons behind the jump in sales is the low employment rate and steady growth in wages. Higher wages are helping consumers spend more freely. Solid job additions to the economy in April helped in the revival of the retail sector.Also, inflation has been showing signs of easing. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading for April showed that consumer prices increased 4.9% year over year compared to 5% recorded in March. This is also the lowest annual rate in two years.Month over month, CPI increased 0.4% in April compared to a rise of 0.1% in March.Separately, the Producer Price Index (PPI) reading showed wholesale prices growing 0.2% in April on a month-over-month basis, after declining 0.4% in March. However, it was lower than analysts’ expectations of a rise of 0.3%.Core PPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy prices, climbed 0.2%.Story continuesDespite inflation showing signs of easing, it is still a lot higher than the Fed’s target level of 2%. Moreover, consumers have been spending more lately, but the purchases are primarily basic necessities.The ideal thing to do in this situation would be to invest in defensive sector stocks, like consumer staples.The consumer staples sector is fundamentally sound and mature, given that consumer demand for staples typically remains resilient to fluctuations in the economic cycle. The consumer staples sector includes companies that essentially trade in daily necessities. The sector is therefore considered defensive in nature.Our PicksThe non-cyclical nature of consumer staples’ businesses protects them from the market's vagaries. Additionally, these companies pay out dividends, indicating the strength of their businesses and capacity to weather market volatility.Krispy Kreme, Inc.

UNP, CSX Corp. CSX and Norfolk Southern Corp. NSC.Industry: RailroadLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2095621/3-railroad-stocks-to-watch-amid-the-industry-weaknessProspects of Zacks Transportation - Rail industry's participants are being dented due to challenges like inflation-induced high interest rates, elevated fuel price and supply-chain woes. Most industry players are looking to drive their bottom line amid the headwinds through cost reduction.Despite the challenges surrounding the industry, Union Pacific Corp., CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. appear better-placed to tide over the challenges.About the IndustryThe Zacks Transportation - Rail industry includes railroad operators transporting freight (such as agricultural products, industrial products, coal, intermodal, automotive, consumer products, metals and minerals), primarily across North America. These companies focus on providing logistics and supply-chain expertise services.While freight constitutes a significant chunk of revenues, some of these companies also derive a small portion of their top line from other rail-related services, including third-party railcar and locomotive repairs, routine land sales and container sales, among others. A few companies offer service to multiple production and distribution facilities. Besides locomotives, some of these companies own equipment of leased locomotives, railcars etc.Factors Relevant to the Industry's FortunesFocus on Cost Cuts to Drive the Bottom Line: The industry has been experiencing significant levels of inflation, including higher prices for labor, freight and fuel. The industry players are focusing on cost-cutting measures and making efforts to improve productivity and efficiency to mitigate high expenses and the effects of a weaker-than-expected demand scenario.Story continuesEconomic Uncertainty: Despite a strong performance by major indices lately, the fact remains that we are by no means out of the woods, especially with respect to inflation-related woes. The recent production cut by the OPEC+ oil cartel, which includes OPEC members plus Russia, has led to a surge in oil prices. This may aggravate inflationary pressure and result in heightened economic uncertainty and market volatility. The turmoil in the banking sector — popularly known as the engine of economic growth — also does not bode well.Weak Freight Demand: Risks associated with an economic slowdown, geopolitical tensions and supply-chain woes dampen the prospects of stocks belonging to this industrial cohort. Due to the uncertainty, the Cass Freight Index declined 1% on a month-on-month basis in March. In fact, the index has declined month on month in six out of the last seven months. The slowdown in freight demand does not bode well for railroad operators.Zacks Industry Rank Signals Glum ProspectsThe Zacks Rail industry, housed within the broader Zacks Transportation sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #173. This rank places it in the bottom 31% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The industry's position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group's earnings growth potential. The industry's earnings estimates for 2023 have moved down 7.6% since May 2022.Despite the gloomy outlook, there are a couple of stocks worth watching in the industry. But before we present them, it is worth looking at the industry's shareholder returns and current valuation first.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 But Outperforms SectorOver the past year, the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry has declined 2.4% against the S&amp;P 500 composite's gain of 3%. The broader sector has declined 3.4% in the said time frame.Industry's Current ValuationBased on the trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B), a commonly used multiple for valuing railroad stocks, the industry is currently trading at 6.97X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 5.51X. It is also above the sector's P/B ratio of 4.14X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 10.86X, as low as 5.69X and at the median of 8.08X.3 Stocks to Keep a Tab OnAll three stocks mentioned below carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereUnion Pacific: Based in Omaha, NE, Union Pacific provides rail transportation services across the United States. Union Pacific's efforts to reward its shareholders, even in the current uncertain scenario, are impressive. In 2022, UNP bought back shares worth $6,282 million. The railroad operator paid dividends worth $3,159 million in 2022.UNP's strong free cash flow generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities. The uptick in overall volumes (up 2% year over year in 2002) is an added positive. Union Pacific has an encouraging track record with respect to earnings surprises, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the past four quarters (missing the mark in the other one). The average beat is 2.28%.CSX: Based in Jacksonville, FL, CSX offers rail-based freight transportation services like traditional rail service, transport of intermodal containers and trailers apart from rail-to-truck transfers.CSX is trying to drive growth in this challenging environment by reducing operating expenses. Efforts to reward its shareholders also bode well. CSX has a stellar track record with respect to earnings surprises, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the past four quarters, by an average of 7.76%.Norfolk Southern: We are impressed with Norfolk Southern's efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In January 2023, the company's board announced a 9% uptick in its quarterly dividend payout to $1.35 per share. NSC's strong free cash flow generating ability supports NSC's shareholder-friendly activities.Norfolk Southern has an encouraging track record with respect to earnings surprise, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the past four quarters by an average of 4.66%.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. To wit, the Analog Devices share price has climbed 99% in five years, easily topping the market return of 44% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 20% , including dividends .The past week has proven to be lucrative for Analog Devices investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance. See our latest analysis for Analog Devices While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Analog Devices achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 25% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 15% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Analog Devices has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Analog Devices the TSR over the last 5 years was 119%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Analog Devices has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 20% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 17%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Analog Devices   you should know about.We will like Analog Devices better if we see some big insider buys.

108,7e306263-b211-3ffc-bf00-f94af80d0081,MAR,2023-05-18,Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) Has Announced That It Will Be Increasing Its Dividend To $0.52,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marriott-international-nasdaq-mar-announced-111211784.html,1684408331,STORY,['MAR'],"[Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 30th of June to $0.52. Despite this raise, the dividend yield of 0.9% is only a modest boost to shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Marriott International Marriott International's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsEven a low dividend yield can be attractive if it is sustained for years on end. However, Marriott International's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 33.5% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 12% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityThe company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.52 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.60. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 12% per annum over that time. Despite the rapid growth in the dividend over the past number of years, we have seen the payments go down the past as well, so that makes us cautious.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowGiven that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. We are encouraged to see that Marriott International has grown earnings per share at 17% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio and decent growth suggests that the company is reinvesting well, and it also has plenty of room to increase the dividend over time.We Really Like Marriott International's DividendOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Marriott International is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. For instance, we've picked out 2 warning signs for Marriott International that investors should take into consideration.

110,605c42ad-aff7-318d-b5f9-285bd4602e50,NWSA,2023-05-18,Realtor.com® April Rental Report: Rent Growth Slows to its Lowest Rate Since the Onset of the Pandemic,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/realtor-com-april-rental-report-100000151.html,1684404000,STORY,"['NWS', 'NWSA', 'NWSAL']","[Record-high construction of multi-family homes helps to ease housing shortagesSANTA CLARA, Calif., May 18, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The Realtor.com® April Rental Report found that the U.S. rental market experienced single-digit growth for the ninth month in a row after 15 months of slowing. Median rent across the top 50 metros was up just 0.3% year-over-year, the lowest growth rate since the onset of the pandemic. The median asking rent was $1,734, up by $4 from last month, but down by $43 from the peak.""In April, we continued to see rising rent prices and a moderating growth rate. This is promising news for renters, suggesting that the pandemic peaks are behind us, and that the challenging affordability picture may begin to improve,"" said Realtor.com® Chief Economist Danielle Hale. ""We've seen record-high new construction occurring in the multi-family space, which is creating more units, helping to reduce competition and in turn helping to ease prices.""Affordability improves, but prices are still highOne major factor contributing to lower rent prices is a significant increase in multi-family construction. This has helped the vacancy rate reach its highest level (6.4% in Q1 2023) in two years. As more new rental properties are added to the market, the vacancy rate could inch back toward the norms we saw in 2013-2019 (about 7.2%) and would improve affordability for renters. Despite more available rentals and slowing rent growth, average rent still costs $348 (25.1%) more than it would have at this time in 2019.Save money by staying putRenters who renew their lease tend to pay less than those who sign a new lease. A 2022 survey from Avail, a Realtor.com® business, found that renters signing a new lease reported a price increase of nearly 27% – about double what people who have been in their rental for 1-2 years experienced (13%). To avoid paying this premium, renters are renewing leases at record-high levels, contributing to a stickier CPI Shelter Index.Story continues""Realtor.com® monthly data is based on median asking rents rather than survey responses, which are used in the CPI Index, so CPI data lags behind what we're seeing. The data suggest that easing in the cost of shelter is ahead in future CPI reports. While this could take until 2024 to play out significantly, it will be welcome news for renters and for overall inflation,"" said Hale.For more information on what landlords and renters are experiencing, read the latest Avail quarterly survey.Rental Data – 50 Largest Metropolitan Areas – April 2023MetroMedian Rent 0-2 bedroomYOY 0-2 bedroomRent Vacancy Rate (2023 Q1)Homeownership Rate (2023 Q1)Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell, Ga.$1,672-1.4 %9.8 %66.6 %Austin-Round Rock, Texas$1,730-4.8 %7.3 %63.4 %Baltimore-Columbia-Towson, Md.$1,8210.4 %12.8 %72.9 %Birmingham-Hoover, Ala.$1,2333.6 %11.9 %67.0 %Boston-Cambridge-Newton, Mass.-N.H.$2,8424.2 %2.7 %61.1 %Buffalo-Cheektowaga-Niagara Falls, N.Y.$1,230-1.1 %3.8 %72.0 %Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia, N.C.-S.C.$1,557-2.4 %4.5 %63.4 %Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, Ill.-Ind.-Wisc.$1,8350.9 %4.7 %68.8 %Cincinnati, Ohio,-Ky.-Ind.$1,2189.9 %5.9 %68.4 %Cleveland-Elyria, Ohio$1,144-3.6 %2.5 %65.0 %Columbus, Ohio$1,2708.4 %6.4 %59.3 %Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, Texas$1,538-3.1 %10.8 %61.5 %Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, Colo.$1,957-2.0 %4.1 %69.7 %Detroit-Warren-Dearborn, Mich.$1,3908.9 %8.3 %73.0 %Hartford-West Hartford-East Hartford, Conn.$1,650-2.1 %5.0 %67.3 %Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, Texas$1,4383.2 %12.3 %60.9 %Indianapolis-Carmel-Anderson, Ind.$1,3368.1 %10.9 %69.2 %Jacksonville, Fla.$1,466-0.4 %7.5 %72.9 %Kansas City, Mo.-Kan.$1,2823.5 %8.7 %64.3 %Las Vegas-Henderson-Paradise, Nev.$1,509-5.7 %5.5 %59.1 %Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, Calif.$2,875-2.1 %3.5 %46.1 %Louisville/Jefferson County, Ky.-Ind.$1,2186.0 %1.2 %65.9 %Memphis, Tenn.-Miss.-Ark.$1,341-2.6 %5.3 %63.1 %Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach, Fla.$2,503-0.3 %7.0 %55.5 %Milwaukee-Waukesha-West Allis, Wisc.$1,5836.8 %3.7 %62.6 %Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, Minn.-Wisc.$1,5151.8 %10.1 %67.6 %Nashville-Davidson–Murfreesboro–Franklin, Tenn.$1,599-1.7 %9.9 %71.4 %New Orleans-Metairie, La.$1,270-15.4 %9.6 %60.4 %New York-Newark-Jersey City, N.Y.-N.J.-Penn.$2,9148.0 %4.1 %50.7 %Oklahoma City, Okla.$1,0147.0 %9.4 %66.8 %Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford, Fla.$1,8100.9 %4.5 %65.5 %Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, Penn.-N.J.-Del.-Md.$1,8343.6 %4.5 %66.5 %Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, Ariz.$1,646-5.2 %5.2 %67.5 %Pittsburgh, Penn.$1,4647.1 %6.8 %75.7 %Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro, Ore.-Wash.$1,691-0.1 %5.6 %66.1 %Providence-Warwick, R.I.-Mass.$1,8721.8 %4.6 %67.8 %Raleigh, N.C.$1,535-2.2 %10.9 %64.6 %Richmond, Va.$1,4384.8 %8.6 %66.5 %Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, Calif.$2,123-10.9 %4.9 %70.5 %Rochester, N.Y.$1,243-3.6 %2.5 %63.9 %Sacramento–Roseville–Arden-Arcade, Calif.$1,871-1.6 %4.6 %65.3 %San Antonio-New Braunfels, Texas$1,2870.2 %8.2 %68.3 %San Diego-Carlsbad, Calif.$2,877-1.0 %3.3 %52.5 %San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, Calif.$2,829-2.5 %4.7 %58.3 %San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, Calif.$3,3293.2 %5.9 %53.3 %Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, Wash.$2,117-0.2 %3.3 %61.7 %St. Louis, Mo.-Ill.$1,3335.7 %6.9 %68.8 %Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Fla.$1,776-4.1 %8.7 %61.1 %Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, Va.-N.C.$1,4641.8 %6.8 %68.9 %Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, D.C.-Va.-Md.-W.V.$2,2134.9 %5.5 %64.5 %Methodology Rental data as of April for studio, 1-bedroom, or 2-bedroom units advertised as for-rent on Realtor.com®.

The methodology has been adjusted to better represent the true cost of primary housing for renters. Most areas across the country will see minor changes with a smaller handful of areas seeing larger updates. As a result of these changes, the rental data released since April 2023 will not be directly comparable with previous releases and Realtor.com® economics blog posts.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones. Paul Tudor Jones is one of the richest people in the world. According to Forbes Magazine, his current net worth sits at a cool $7.5 billion - making him rank among the top three hundred richest people in the world today. Like a lot of other billionaires and centi-millionaires, he attributes this unthinkable fortune to the world of investing. Mr. Jones set up the hedge fund Tudor Investment Corporation in 1980 and since then his fund has grown to have a portfolio worth a whopping $6.4 billion as of March 2023.Mr. Jones's entry into the investment world provided him with the perfect skill set to play the market conditions that have been in place for more than twelve months now. He started his career by trading cotton futures on the New York Stock Exchange - which provided him an opportunity to gain experience in trading commodities. A couple of years later he would set up his own hedge fund and its first investment would come from a commodities trading firm. He rose to fame in 1987, when he understood that a stock market crash was coming. This manifested itself in the form of the Black Monday crash of 1987, and the short bets that he placed enabled Tudor Investment to mark a whopping 200% gain while others bled losses.A couple of years later, Mr. Jones's genius would make its mark again when he would profit by holding options that enabled him to sell shares at high prices when they were plummeting during a stock market crash. His hedge fund leverages the experience that Mr. Jones gained during his earliest days in the financial market, and these days it focuses primarily on discretionary macro trading. This strategy takes a broader look at the global macroeconomic environment and crafts trading strategies accordingly. As you're likely aware, the global commodities market was upended last year as the Russian invasion of Ukraine shook oil prices and created grain shortages.Story continuesThis enabled Tudor Investment to take a crucial role in the market and once again make its market in a tumultuous environment. While there's little data available on how well the hedge fund performed last year, we can get a semblance of its fortune by taking a look at the portfolio size. Insider Monkey's research shows that Tudor Investment's portfolio was worth $6.5 billion as of March 2023. This marks a 30% growth since the fourth quarter of last year when the portfolio had stood at $5 billion. The portfolio was worth $4.2 billion in Q1 2022, enabling the latest figures to mark a whopping 55% gain. Looking at this, it appears as if Mr. Jones is definitely doing something right even as the stock market recovers from another historic bloodbath in less than five years.Jones has made some interesting statements recently which should be crucial for anyone looking to invest in the stock market. However, before we get to this, a brief stock of the current macroeconomic conditions is warranted. The Federal Reserve has been on an aggressive interest rate hiking spree to control inflation. This makes doing business harder and that is precisely the effect the Fed aims to have since lower output means a slower economy and in effect lower spending to usher in lower prices. The consequence of this is a potential recession, but the Fed chairman Jerome Powell believes that this might not be the case as he recently stated:So I think that—I think it’s still possible. I—you know, I think, you know, the, the case of, of avoiding a recession is, in my view, more likely than that of having, having a recession. But it’s not—it’s not that the case of having a recession is—I don’t rule that out, either. It’s, it’s possible that we will have what I hope would be a mild recession.However, Mr. Jones begs to differ from Chairman Powell. In a fresh interview given in May 2023, he outlined thatThen we have, in a more intermediate basis, we have the financial cycle. The financial cycle, which is what we kind of look at internally, is the combination of the historical debt and asset valuation boom-bust. So if you think about post covid, we had this massive increase in debt. Massive increase in equity valuation. It creates this boom in the financial cycle, that's happened in 1990, that happened in 2000. That happened 2008. Our financial cycle, the peak of total debt growth plus stock market valuation occurred in September of 2021. Historically, it's about a two year lag, when that really really bites and you go into recession. That would be third quarter this year; there's a good chance based on our most recent financial episodes, there's a really good chance that we're going to be on the verge of looking like, or, actually going into recession.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the top stocks that were on Mr. Jones's mind as he headed into what might be a recession year. Some top picks are Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), Horizon Therapeutics Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:HZNP), and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX).10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Paul Tudor JonesOur MethodologyTo compile our list of the best stocks to buy according to Paul Tudor Jones, we used his hedge fund's filings for the first quarter of 2023 with the SEC to sift out those stocks that had the largest investment in dollar terms.Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones10.

By integrating ChatGPT with Marvis, the industry's only virtual network assistant (VNA) driven by Mist AI, Juniper customers and partners can now easily access public-facing knowledgebase information using ground-breaking Large Language Models (LLM). In addition, new Marvis integrations with Zoom enable superior video conferencing experiences while significantly reducing troubleshooting costs. With these enhancements, plus a new Wi-Fi 6E access point, Juniper is expanding its leadership in AIOps and building upon a rich history of industry-firsts to drive real business value while minimizing IT costs.  ""AI is the next step in automating tasks that typically require a human IT domain expert, improving how IT teams operate the network with AI-driven tools like Marvis and its conversational interface,"" said Bob Friday, Chief AI Officer at Juniper Networks. ""Juniper Mist has always been a pioneer in utilizing proven AIOps to deliver assured user experiences from client to cloud, and with these latest LLM enhancements, Marvis will provide even more actionable knowledge and be an even more valuable member of the IT team.""Expanded Marvis Conversation Interface with ChatGPTThe Marvis VNA and its conversational interface were first introduced on June 7, 2018, as an essential part of IT, delivering proactive troubleshooting, predictive actions and exceptional insight into user experience via natural language processing and understanding (NLP/NLU). This enabled Juniper customers to easily delve into the network, user and application experiences (in real time) via simple langue queries.Story continuesWith the recent launch of LLM tools like ChatGPT, Juniper has been able to expand the conversational interface (CI) capabilities of Marvis to deliver even more human-like conversational capabilities, particularly with respect to documentation and support issues. Specifically, Marvis now leverages a LLM API to respond to user queries for technical documentation and other publicly available historical knowledge base information. For example, customers can ask Marvis ""What do the Access Point LED lights mean?"" or ""List steps to configure Juniper campus fabric"" and receive an accurate and direct response in the typical ChatGPT style in addition to a list of relevant documents.Assured Video Experiences with Zoom IntegrationJuniper's AIOps has always stood out for the quality of data that feeds a common Mist AI engine, including rich telemetry and user state information from routers, switches, firewalls and Access Points.  Now Juniper has taken this even further by leveraging 3rd party user-experience data from the Zoom cloud.By joining gigabytes of user experience Zoom data with gigabytes of network feature data, Marvis now has a deep learning model that can accurately predict user experience performance, allowing Marvis to use advanced AI/ML explainability techniques to quickly identify the root cause of video conferencing problems. In addition to real-time proactive troubleshooting (and self-driving corrective actions, if possible), Marvis learns trends to quickly detect and correct anomalies as well as predict future issues. This insight gives IT teams an edge in reducing Zoom support tickets and the time to repair issues.Users can now leverage the Marvis conversational interface to easily access Zoom data insights via simple language queries, like ""What was wrong with John Smith's Zoom call?"" or ""List users with a bad Zoom experience.""A Complete AI-driven Wi-Fi 6E PortfolioWi-Fi 6E is a new wireless standard that expands network capacity by making a larger amount of RF spectrum available in the 6 GHz range to add to the existing 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. To take full advantage of Wi-Fi 6E, Juniper is announcing a new AP24 Access Point. This 2.4 GHz/5 GHz/6 GHz tri-band capable device (dual band concurrent) supports up to 3.6Gbps throughput. It also features the standard Juniper Mist dedicated scanning radio for data collection and intelligent Radio Resource Management (RRM) capabilities to intelligently choose the best band to use. The AP24 comes in a compact 7"" by 7"" form factor and delivers exceptional performance and capabilities for cost-conscious customers. As it allows 2.4 GHz radios to be converted to 6 GHz, the AP24 is also perfect for customers looking to migrate to Wi-Fi 6E at their own pace.The AP24 complements other Wi-Fi 6E access points recently announced by Juniper, which include the AP45 (2.4 GHz/5 GHz/6 GHz quad-radio, 4x4:4SS, vBLE array) and AP34 (2.4 GHz/5 GHz/6 GHz quad-radio, 2x2:2SS, omni BLE)The Juniper Wi-Fi 6E Access Points complement the existing 2.4- and 5-GHz APs currently in the Juniper Mist portfolio, which support both 802.11ac and 802.11ax protocols. Unlike competing solutions, the Juniper Mist solution incorporates rich client insights and AIOps to deliver optimized configurations, maximum performance and optimized packet scheduling for increased capacity. This is all achieved without sacrificing performance for older 2.4- and 5-GHz clients for maximum investment protection.Supporting Quotes""LLM is the perfect complement to an existing virtual network assistant like Marvis. LLM enhances a VNA's ability to accurately generate natural language text, particularly in more complex and nuanced scenarios. This combination improves customer experiences by providing easy to understand answers that reduce time spent looking for specific details. The combination of LLM and VNA demonstrates how these technologies are truly better together when done right.""-Maribel Lopez, Founder and Principal Analyst, Lopez Research LLCAdditional Resources: The Feed: Expanded Marvis Conversation Interface with ChatGPTBlog: What Do ChatGPT and Zoom Have in Common?

An ongoing Hollywood writers' strike may lead them to cut back even more.Disney (DIS) CFO Christine McCarthy said at MoffettNathanson's Inaugural Technology, Media and Telecom conference on Wednesday that the entertainment giant's content spending will hit around $30 billion this year, but she warned the strike could impact spending for the remainder of the fiscal year: ""We'll update that if it's appropriate,"" she said.The comments come as Disney aims to cut $5.5 billion in costs, $3 billion of which stems from savings on content.Meanwhile, Netflix's (NFLX) content spending was already down in the first quarter of this year from the year-earlier period. While the company expects total spending for the year to come in flat at $17 billion, the writers' strike adds further risks as some of the streamer's top-performing shows, including ""Stranger Things"" and ""Cobra Kai,"" have paused production in the face of the shutdown.Earlier this month, Hollywood writers began a strike in protest of higher wages and other demands amid the streaming boom. That set off a production shutdown across the entire industry.While Moody's has warned that some media companies could see credit ratings suffer as a result of the strike, others point out that cutting content costs is a good thing for the industry as investors increasingly focus on profitability.""A production work stoppage or even a slowdown that simply utilizes scripts on-hand could lead to far less content being delivered to subscription streaming services in 2H 2023,"" Rich Greenfield, analyst at Lightshed Partners, wrote in a note last month. ""If content is not delivered to a streaming service, the expense is not borne by the streamer. In turn, multi-billion dollar operating losses could come in significantly better than expected with free cash flow also ending up being far greater than expected (remember how Netflix free cash flow came in far better than expected during the pandemic).""Story continuesNetflix's reduction in spending in the first quarter — $2.5 billion this year, down from $3.6 billion a year ago— helped improve overall free cash flow, which hit $2.1 billion in Q1 compared to just $802 million in the year-ago period. The company also raised its full-year free cash flow projection to ""at least $3.5 billion,"" up from the previous $3 billion.Strike poses other risksFran Drescher, left, president of SAG-AFTRA, and Meredith Stiehm, president of Writers Guild of America West, pose together during a rally by striking writers outside Paramount Pictures studio, Monday, May 8, 2023, in Los Angeles. The ongoing writers' strike could impact content spend, as well as revenue and subscriber upticks, at big companies like Netflix and Disney. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)That doesn't mean the strike is necessarily good for media companies.Paramount (PARA) CEO Bob Bakish said on the company's latest earnings call that the impact of the strike depends on how long it goes on.""In terms of financial impact, it really ultimately depends on duration of strike,"" he said at the time. ""But at this point, we think it's probably slightly dilutive to revenue, flat on [operating income before appreciation and amortization] and accretive [to cash spend.]""JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in a note on Tuesday that Netflix could be weighing a delay of its password sharing crackdown in the US amid the strike — a decision that will likely impact revenue, subscribers, and the growth of its ad-supported tier.""Paid sharing is effectively a price increase, w/paid members sharing their password receiving less value for the same price, or potentially paying more to add an extra member. And for borrowers who currently do not pay, paid sharing means either activating their own subscription or being added as an extra member, or losing access to NFLX,"" Anmuth said.As a result, he argued, ""It’s possible that NFLX may not like the optics of implementing paid sharing while 11,500 WGA writers are on strike, w/production suspended or writing paused across at least a handful of NFLX titles including Stranger Things S5 &amp; Emily in Paris S4, among others.""Netflix, which did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment on the impending rollout, previously said 100 million users have shared accounts. Anmuth estimated at least 30 million within that bucket could be converted to paying users whether as add-on members or new subscribers.Therefore, an ongoing strike ""could further postpone revenue &amp; subscriber acceleration.""Anmuth also warned of a ripple effect to Netflix's recently launched ad-supported tier, writing: ""Ultimately, advertising is closely tied to paid sharing, w/borrowers likely viewing a $6.99 Standard w/Ads plan as a compelling low-priced option. Therefore, ramp of the ad tier is also delayed if paid sharing is delayed.""Advertising, already under pressure amid macroeconomic headwinds, has been further complicated by the ongoing strike.As Anmuth pointed out, Netflix's first-ever Upfront presentation shifted from an in-person event to a virtual one. The analyst surmised the shift was ""tied to the risk of heavy picketing &amp; protesting at an in-person event, as well as less availability of star talent."" Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and NBCUniversal (CMCSA) also dealt with more subdued Upfront presentations amid a lack of acting and writing talent.Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

But while Japanese companies continue to control key steps in the chip supply chain, the country’s efforts have fallen far short of subsidies offered by the US.The Japanese government plans to provide financial support for Micron’s plan to invest as much as ¥500 billion ($3.6 billion) to fabricate next-generation memory chips at its existing DRAM facility in Hiroshima. Nishimura declined to specify an amount. Micron is expected to get about $1.5 billion from Japan, Bloomberg reported earlier.Micron’s investment would help it install advanced EUV chipmaking equipment from ASML Holding NV to fabricate what the US memory maker calls one-gamma production, a more advanced technology planned for launch in late 2024.“The breakthrough one-gamma partnership between Micron and Japan will enhance our two countries’ competitiveness and make our semiconductor supply chain less vulnerable to disruption and economic coercion,” said US Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel in an emailed statement.Story continuesKishida’s meeting took place just before the convening of the Group of Seven summit in Hiroshima. The agenda includes shoring up and diversifying global supply chains, as the world’s richest economies seek to build tech self-sufficiency and reduce dependence on China.Intel is looking to partner with local materials makers to promote sustainable development, while IBM is looking for opportunities to cooperate in quantum computing, Nishimura said. Samsung is considering building a research site in Japan to explore cutting-edge packaging technologies, officials added.Japan’s government is already spending billions of dollars to encourage TSMC to add production capacity in the country, and to finance its own chip venture Rapidus Corp., with aspirations to make 2-nanometer chips by 2027. The Micron deal will bring Netherlands’ EUV equipment to Japan for the first time, a step toward leading-edge manufacturing the government has sought.The world’s third-largest economy is aging rapidly, giving rise to new chip and AI applications to meet demand in pharmaceuticals and life sciences, said Masoud Mirgoli, an executive vice president at Belgian nanoelectronics and digital tech developer imec. His organization also plans to build a research site in Japan and work with Rapidus, Mirgoli said.

That military action has also raised fears among Japanese that China could be emboldened to take action against neighbouring, self-ruled Taiwan unless Russia is stopped.TIGHTEN SANCTIONSThe G7 will aim to tighten sanctions on Russia to prevent it skirting measures already in place, Germany's leader, Olaf Scholz, said on Thursday.The U.S. will have a package of sanctions associated with a G7 statement that will centre on such an issue of enforcement of Russian sanctions, U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on board Air Force One.Story continuesKishida later said he and Biden had agreed to continue ""strict sanctions against Russia as well strong support for Ukraine"".Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will join one G7 session via teleconference on Sunday, Kishida said. There had been some speculation he might travel to Hiroshima but Kishida said while he was aware of such talk, the schedule ""is as announced"".Kishida and Biden also shared understanding on the importance of protecting strategic technologies, a Japanese government spokesperson said.Earlier on Thursday, Kishida met with the heads of some of the world's top chip companies, asking them to invest more in Japan and sending a clear sign of the deepening security importance of advanced technology and supply chains at the G7.Kishida told the executives, including those from Micron Technology Inc, Intel Corp and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), that stabilising supply chains would be a topic of discussion.""I am very pleased with your positive attitude towards investment in Japan, and would like the government as a whole to work on further expanding direct investment in Japan and support the semiconductor industry,"" Kishida said.An industry ministry official later said Kishida wanted to foster cooperation to strengthen semiconductor supply chains, while Industry Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said Japan would use 1.3 trillion yen ($9.63 billion) of the supplementary budget from the last fiscal year to support its chip business.

(Nasdaq: MU) announced today it will be introducing extreme ultraviolet (EUV) technology to Japan, tapping this sophisticated patterning technology to manufacture its next generation of DRAM, the 1-gamma (1γ) node. Micron will be the first semiconductor company to bring EUV technology to Japan for production, with its Hiroshima fab playing a critical role in the company’s development of the 1-gamma node. Micron expects to invest up to 500 billion yen in 1-gamma process technology over the next few years, with close support from the Japanese government, to enable the next wave of end-to-end technology innovation such as rapidly emerging generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications.With each successive advancement in process technology to scale memory cells and advance performance, Micron enables increased memory density, improvement in power efficiency and lower cost per bit, helping to unlock new opportunities for digitization, sustainability and green transformation, and automation. The introduction of 1-gamma follows the development of Micron’s 1-beta (1β), the industry's most advanced DRAM node today, which Micron mass produces in its Hiroshima fab. Micron continues to make progress on its EUV integration plans and expects to ramp EUV into production on the 1-gamma node in Taiwan and Japan from 2025 onwards.“Micron’s Hiroshima operations have been central to the development and production of several industry-leading technologies for memory over the past decade,” Micron President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said. “We are proud to be the first to use EUV in Japan and to be developing and manufacturing 1-gamma at our Hiroshima fab. Our plans reflect our continued commitment to Japan, strong relationship with the Japanese government and the exceptional talent of our Micron Hiroshima team.”In recent years, Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has extended significant investment support and established long-term strategies aimed at laying a strong foundation for leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing, a resilient supply chain and a digital economy in the country.Story continues“Today’s announcement between Micron and Japan to produce 1-gamma memory in Hiroshima is a major step forward to secure semiconductor supply chains,” said Rahm Emanuel, United States Ambassador to Japan. “This partnership demonstrates how allies, when working together, can create economic opportunity and security in cutting-edge technologies.”EUV lithography is the most sophisticated semiconductor manufacturing process in the world. Micron’s integration of EUV into its next node will play a key role in allowing the node to deliver faster, more power-efficient and higher-performance memory products and will enable the company to further its relentless pursuit of industry-first memory innovation.“Micron is the only company that manufactures DRAM in Japan and is critical to setting the pace for not only the global DRAM industry but our developing semiconductor ecosystem,” said Satoshi Nohara, METI Director-General of the Commerce and Information Policy Bureau. “We are pleased to see our collaboration with Micron take root in Hiroshima with state-of-the-art EUV to be introduced on Japanese soil. This will not only deepen and advance the talent and infrastructure of our semiconductor ecosystem, it will also unlock exponential growth and opportunity for our digital economy.”Micron’s 1-gamma node follows the company’s industry-leading 1-beta node which Micron began shipping samples of last November to mobile manufacturers. Cementing this industry-first leadership, the company has now started shipping its 1-beta-based LPDDR5X memory made in Hiroshima to industrial, automotive and consumer customers across Asia, the U.S. and Europe. The memory delivers low power and performance for AI, intelligent vehicles and virtual reality.Micron’s multiple sites in Japan, including its fab in Hiroshima, are central to its research and development roadmap — and mass production — for Micron’s cutting-edge DRAM technology across its product lines. With more than 4,000 engineers and technicians in Japan, Micron is committed to advancing workforce development and the semiconductor ecosystem in Japan and, over the past five years, has hired more than 1,500 new employees in Japan. Micron supplies approximately one-third of the DRAM Japan uses in critical industries ranging from automotive to medical equipment, data centers and 5G infrastructure. With the smallest cell size in the world, the forthcoming 1-gamma technology will pave the way for mass production of sophisticated products required in complex applications from critical infrastructure to image processing networks.About Micron Technology, Inc.We are an industry leader in innovative memory and storage solutions transforming how the world uses information to enrich life for all.

This two-platform strategy helps to balance out seasonality-related risks that adversely impact demand.The utility’s planned separation of Knife River Corporation, a wholly-owned construction materials business, to be completed on May 31, 2023, will unlock great value for the existing shareholders. Of the issued and outstanding shares, 90% are to be distributed to stockholders. The split will create two entities - one focusing on regulated energy delivery and the other on the construction materials and contracting business.Steady earnings enable the company to distribute regular dividends to its shareholders.

You can skip our detailed analysis of Ray Dalio's hedge fund and recent developments, and go directly to read Billionaire Ray Dalio's Top 5 Dividend Stock Picks. Ray Dalio founded Bridgewater Associates in 1975. Today, it is one of the world’s largest and most successful hedge funds due to its distinctive approach to investing. Dalio’s investment philosophy emphasizes radical transparency, meritocracy, and the importance of understanding and managing risk. Dalio's approach combines macroeconomic analysis with fundamental research to identify investment opportunities and manage portfolio risk. Under Dalio's leadership, Bridgewater Associates has achieved remarkable success and has been recognized as one of the top-performing hedge funds in the world. The firm manages assets for a wide range of clients, including institutional investors, pension funds, and sovereign wealth funds.Currently, Nir Bar Dea is serving as the chief executive officer of Bridgewater Associates, as Dalio gave up control of the hedge fund to a new generation of investors in 2022. However, he has kept his seat on the firm’s board. Following his decision to retire, Dalio has recently announced to set up his family office branch in Abu Dhabi, as reported by Bloomberg.  Previously, he had a business relationship with Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA).As an influential investor and market commentator, Dalio often provides his perspectives on various economic topics and trends through interviews, public speeches, and his writings. The recent Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) failure has created a new uncertain environment across the stock market and Dalio has also shared his insights on this matter. In his interview with Business Insider, he shared that this bank fallout would have larger implications for the stock market in the coming years. Dalio has also given a skeptical outlook for the market. Here are some comments from the billionaire investor:Story continues“Markets will see more borrowing in the coming years as the federal government grapples with massive budget deficits, he said. In order to fill the deficit hole, the government must borrow money by selling debt, such as US Treasurys, but debt investors need to have a high enough real return.”As of the end of Q1 2023, Bridgewater Associates’ 13F portfolio had a value of $16.3 billion, down from $18.3 billion in the last quarter. The hedge fund had widely invested in dividend stocks such as Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK). In this article, we will further discuss the top dividend stock picks of billionaire Ray Dalio.Billionaire Ray Dalio's Top 12 Dividend Stock PicksRay Dalio of Bridgewater AssociatesOur Methodology:For this list, we selected top dividend-paying stocks from the latest 13F portfolio of Bridgewater, where Dalio remains a mentor, board member, and investor. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their stake value.12. Mondelez International, Inc.

(NASDAQ:MDLZ) is an Illinois-based multinational food company that also produces snacks and beverages. At the end of the first quarter of 2023, Bridgewater Associates owned over 2.2 million shares in the company, worth over $155.7 million. The company represented 0.95% of the firm's 13F portfolio. It is among the top dividend stock picks of billionaire Ray Dalio alongside some other dividend stocks like Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK).Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.385 per share for a dividend yield of 1.98%, as of May 17. The company has been growing its dividends consistently for the past nine years.Mizuho appreciated the Q1 upside and stronger volume of Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) and raised its price target on the stock to $86 in May. The firm also maintained a Buy rating on MDLZ.At the end of December 2022, 46 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ), compared with 52 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a collective value of over $1.5 billion.Here’s what Coho Partners said about Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Analysts’ bottom-up estimates for both 2022 and 2023 for the S&amp;P 500 Index are beginning to decline. Coho is not immune to the earnings pressure exerted by a strong USD, although the portfolio on the whole has modestly less foreign revenue exposure relative to the S&amp;P 500 Index. The two most impacted Coho stocks includes Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ), which gets about 75% of its revenues outside the U.S.”11. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $183,825,849 Dividend Yield as of May 17: 3.61%CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is an American healthcare and pharmacy company that is one of the top dividend stock picks of billionaire Ray Dalio. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.605 per share with a dividend yield of 3.61%, as of May 17. It has raised its dividend for the past two years in a row.In May, Wells Fargo maintained an Equal Weight rating on CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) with a $76 price target. The firm mentioned that the company's recent quarterly earnings were modestly ahead of expectations.At the end of Q1 2023, Bridgewater Associates owned over 2.4 million shares, with a total value of over $183.8 million. The hedge fund has been investing in the company since the third quarter of 2012. During the most recent quarter, the firm reduced its position in the company by 10%, which represented 1.12% of its 13F portfolio.Insider Monkey's Q4 2022 database shows that 70 hedge funds owned stakes in CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), up from 67 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a total value of $2.13 billion.Vltava Fund mentioned CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years.We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt.This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”10. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $218,590,165 Dividend Yield as of May 17: 1.86%Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American multinational medical devices and healthcare company. It holds one of the longest dividend growth streaks in the market, having raised its payouts for 51 years. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.86%, as of May 17. It is among the top dividend stock picks of billionaire Ray Dalio.Bridgewater Associates first initiated its position in Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) during the fourth quarter of 2010 with shares worth over $4.8 million. In the most recent quarter, the hedge fund owned ABT stakes worth nearly $218.6 million. The company accounted for 1.33% of the firm's 13F portfolio.Appreciating the strong earnings and organic growth of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in the most recent quarter, Street analysts gave positive ratings to the stock. In April, both UBS and Barclays raised their price targets on the stock to $130 and $127, respectively.At the end of December 2022, 60 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), worth collectively $3.2 billion.Polen Capital mentioned Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“As stated below in the portfolio activity section, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is expected to see roughly $6 billion in COVID test sales evaporate this year, creating a headwind for margins and underlying earnings per share. As long-term owners of the business, these test sales were never part of our original investment case. The core business, our primary focus, has a clear path of growing high single digits in 2023 with durable growth beyond, in our view. We believe the current price of 23x NTM P/E , while reasonable, is also misleading considering earnings this year will be artificially depressed because of the drop in COVID testing sales. On normalized earnings, the price is lower. We anticipate underlying EPS growth of at least low-teens over the next three to five years.Lastly, we trimmed Abbott Laboratories, bringing it back to a more average position size and to also fund our increase in Thermo Fisher. Abbott is entering a year in which the company is expected to see approximately $6bn in COVID-19 test sales disappear, thus, creating a headwind for margins and EPS. That said, the core business has a clear path to growing high single digits in FY23. EPS grew at a 20% CAGR from 2019-2022, far beyond our expectations when we initiated our investment. Now, we expect a more normal growth rate of low teens EPS beyond this year. Further, management’s adeptness at allocating capital continues to impress us. We expect Abbott to drive top line growth without heavily investing in R&amp;D and SG&amp;A this year— management effectively “front-loaded” those investments in 2021 and 2022 when COVID test sales created a bolus of cash. We believe this should allow for leverage on the operating margin going forward. Combined, Abbott and Thermo Fisher now represent 7% of the Portfolio.”9. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $223,390,052 Dividend Yield as of May 17: 0.78%During the first quarter of 2023, Bridgewater Associates boosted its position in Visa by 19%, ending the quarter with stakes worth $223.4 million. The company made up 1.36% of the firm's 13F portfolio.Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) has been rewarding shareholders with 16 years of consecutive dividend growth. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $0.45 per share for a dividend yield of 0.78%, as of May 17.As per Insider Monkey's database, 177 hedge funds owned stakes in Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) in Q4 2022, up from 165 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a collective value of over $26.4 billion.Polen Capital mentioned Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We trimmed Mastercard and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) to equal weights of the Portfolio. Mastercard and Visa operate as a duopoly in a large and growing market. Over the last 50 years, global personal consumer expenditures (PCE) has grown 7-9% annualized. We expect 4-5% long-term PCE growth going forward. Additionally, the shift from cash to credit continues unabated, with a total credit penetration of only approximately 50% globally.3 This shift provides Visa and Mastercard with another ~4-6% of growth. When combined with PCE, this gives both companies high-single-digit to low-double[1]digit revenue growth opportunities. This growth estimate is before accounting for growth amplifiers like the acceleration of e[1]commerce, the shift from offline to online, and additional services. Both companies enjoy extremely strong network effects that provide strong competitive advantages.We have trimmed Visa and Mastercard because their combined weight grew to over 12% of the Global Growth Portfolio because of their recent performance and to fund our increase in Amazon’s position size. We added to both positions when their prices were depressed due to cross-border transactions deteriorating materially from the pandemic. Cross-border volumes came roaring back when travel corridors reopened, and although we are several quarters removed from the cross-border nadir, Visa still grew volumes &gt;30% in 1Q23. Total cross-border volumes are now 132% of 2019 levels. At 4.5% each, both companies remain high conviction positions for Global Growth.”8. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $259,065,131 Dividend Yield as of May 17: 2.01%Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is a Washington-based multinational chain of coffeehouses that also specializes in a wide range of other beverages. In May, Wells Fargo raised its price target on the stock to $125 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares, appreciating the company's impressive quarterly earnings.On April 3, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend. The company has been growing its dividends consistently for the past 12 years. The stock's dividend yield on May 17 came in at 2.01%.Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is one of the top dividend stock picks of billionaire Ray Dalio. At the end of Q1 2023, Bridgewater Associates owned over 2.4 million shares in the company, worth roughly $260 million. The company represented 1.58% of the firm's 13F portfolio.Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) was a popular stock among hedge funds in Q4 2022, according to Insider Monkey's database. 61 hedge funds owned stakes in the company in Q4, up from 54 in the previous quarter. The total value of these stakes stood at over $2.65 billion.Polen Capital mentioned Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We also liquidated our remaining position in Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX). While the company remains a unique and resilient franchise, China is a very important growth market for the company, and zero-COVID policies have made it challenging for the company to operate in this important market. While we expect China to return to more “normal” operation at some point, any COVID flare-ups, in China or other markets, present a very real headwind to Starbucks’ profitability. L’Oreal, Estée Lauder, and other holdings continue to have meaningful exposure to China, but in each of these cases, our research indicates they’re able to better adapt to these operating challenges and realize the growth opportunity in China through their online businesses. In short, we think there are better risk-reward opportunities.”7. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $393,706,835 Dividend Yield as of May 17: 1.52%Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) owns grocery stores and department stores across the country. In 2023, the company achieved its Dividend King status after raising its payouts for 50 consecutive years.

Here is what the firm has to say:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT), has recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6%[2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”6. Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST)Bridgewater Associates’ Stake Value: $427,957,112 Dividend Yield as of May 17: 0.82%Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is an American big-box retail company.

The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins. Costco commented that they are not seeing trade-down but private label penetration has increased modestly. Traffic continues to be positive, and Costco remains well-positioned in a more challenging macro environment due to its strong value proposition.” Click to continue reading and see Billionaire Ray Dalio's Top 5 Dividend Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:Analysts Are Cutting Price Targets of These 10 Stocks12 Best Information Technology Services Stocks to Buy10 Best Gold Royalty Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure.

Based on the notable challenges and events detailed below, Buttigieg has learned a lot on the job. And it has not come without controversy or criticism.Robert Mann, an airline industry analyst and consultant, believes Buttigieg was tapped for his role because of his ability to communicate, noting that Buttigieg, in a way, has become a spokesperson for the Biden administration on ""a whole series of issues which are not even tangential to transportation.""""He’s a well-spoken individual,"" Mann told Yahoo Finance. ""He can carry a tune very, very well, often when it has nothing to do with his daytime job. As one of my former bosses used to say, 'Pioneers get arrows in their heads.' If you’re going to go out there and lead something, you’re gonna get shot at.""Challenge #1: Air travel in wake of the pandemicOne of Buttigieg's first tasks in his new role was to tackle the transportation issues that arose during the coronavirus pandemic, particularly in the airline industry.The American Rescue Plan — a $1.9 trillion bill that provided financial support to federal agencies, local governments, and citizens — allocated $43 billion worth of resources toward Department of Transportation (DoT) efforts to protect and maintain aviation and transit jobs and the overall transportation and logistics economy.Story continuesWhen the pandemic disrupted the travel industry, airlines were struggling. Consumer complaints were higher than pre-pandemic levels as flight cancellations, delays, baggage mishandling, and oversold tickets tarnished the image of many domestic and international airlines, according to a report from the Department of Transportation.Before Buttigieg took office as part of President Joe Biden's cabinet, the department had enforced a new rule for airlines to refund passengers for cancellations or significant schedule changes made by the airline. Air Canada refused to refund cash to their customers.The department filed an official complaint seeking $25 million against Air Canada, whose customers had been waiting between five months and a year for refunds. The parties eventually settled in November 2021 with a $4 million agreement. Out of that, $2 million went to the US Treasury, but customers eventually got their refund.""I think any time you sell a ticket and collect revenue in exchange for a promise to get somebody from point A to point B, you need to be prepared to actually do that,"" Buttigieg told Yahoo Finance in an interview in July 2022. ""And that's a conversation we've been pressing the airlines a lot.""As travel demand rebounded and consumer complaints skyrocketed again, Buttigieg continued to fine airlines for consumer violations and tarmac delays. The department also introduced more consumer protections by providing more resources and flexibility to help it prioritize hearing procedures against unfair practices like deceptive fares of airlines and ticketing agents.During the 2022 winter holiday season, Southwest Airlines (LUV) canceled more than 16,000 flights, stranding millions of passengers across the country. Southwest had been slow to embrace technological updates to their system, which resulted in staff shortages as they could not reassign crews from canceled flights and had to do so manually.In response, Buttigieg vowed the DoT would ""mount an extraordinary effort"" to hold the airline accountable for the disruptions and lost baggage. Southwest Airlines is currently under investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).Along with shortages of pilots and other staff, political issues arose: GOP politicians have proposed cutting federal funding for programs by 22%-30%, according to Democratic estimates, including slashing discretionary spending by DoT. The House Democrats Appropriations Committee asserted that those cuts could lead to the closure of 125 air traffic control towers, which would affect one-third of all US airports, impact infrastructure investments, and interfere with other FAA operations.Travelers wade through the line to drop off bags at the Southwest Airlines check-in counter at Denver International Airport, Dec. 27, 2022. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)""These GOP budget cuts would reduce our ability to hire air traffic controllers,"" Buttigieg told Yahoo Finance (video above). ""I would argue that air traffic control is not optional. It's a very important part of our economy.""More recently, Biden and Buttigieg proposed new rules that would require airlines to compensate passengers under certain circumstances.""We think that the right way forward is to establish requirements across the board so that any passenger flying on an airline in the US knows what they can expect and knows that the airline can't change the rules on them,"" Buttigieg told NPR.Challenge #2: 'We don't want to waste money'The Department of Transportation under Buttigieg has enjoyed a budget boom, thanks to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), as the Biden administration has put more money into the department than any prior administration.The $1.2 trillion bill provided funding for improving and building more roads, bridges, railways, air travel, public transit, internet connections, and electric vehicles as well as for increasing environmental protections.That funding is provided to individual infrastructure projects in each state via grant programs. For example, in March 2022, a total of $409 million was allocated to 70 projects in 39 states over the next five years with the sole purpose of remodeling bus systems and shifting them toward electric public buses.So far, all states received a minimum of 30% in transportation funds out of the infrastructure bill, according to data from the General Services Administration (GSA). Texas and California received the most amount of funding with $12 billion and $14 billion, respectively. After the money reaches the local and state administrations, it is up to each state to decide how and where they spend the funding.""I think the challenge is communicating a real vision for what the future of these investments should be,"" Andy Winkler, director of housing and infrastructure projects at the Bipartisan Policy Center, told Yahoo Finance. ""We don't want to waste money. We don't want to just put band-aids on projects. There is a real opportunity to transform American infrastructure.""Buttigieg recently noted that he wanted to spend some of that budget to help ailing city transit systems, particularly in D.C.""There are flexibilities in the budget that we’re putting forward right now on Capitol Hill to help transit agencies weather the current circumstances they’re in and get to the other side, where there can be a better future for everybody,” Buttigieg said in April.Challenge #3: Supply chain woesThe chaos within Buttigieg's Transportation Department stretches internationally through supply chain issues.The pandemic led to the Great Supply Chain Disruption in 2020 as lockdowns, labor shortages, and online shopping sprees led to heavy backlogs and delays at ports and terminals. This was still prevalent when Buttigieg took control of the Transportation Department.In 2021, the department invested a total of $491 million in ports and small shipyards through two grant programs: the Port Infrastructure Development Program (PIDP) and the Small Shipyard Grant Program. The department stated that the investments were to go directly to improve port facilities and ease the supply chain pressure. The PIDP investment came via the infrastructure bill that allotted $17 billion for ports and waterways.Evergreen Lineâs Ever Forward container ship is being taken to an anchorage south of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. (Jerry Jackson/The Baltimore Sun/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) (Baltimore Sun via Getty Images)Some local port disruptions also occurred in March 2022. A 1,095-foot cargo ship called Ever Forward got stuck in the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. (Last year, the Port of Maryland was also able to receive $15 million in federal funding.)Overall, however, things have largely calmed since the supply chain disruptions of the pandemic era.""Right now, at worst, the amount of ships waiting in anchor at the ports of Long Beach is in the single digits, and we’re often seeing that backlog completely gone,"" Buttigieg said during his tour of the UPS Worldport facility in Louisville, Kentucky, in December 2022. ""At the same time, we saw record sales on Black Friday and Cyber Monday.""As of 2023, supply chains gradually returned to normalcy as freight rates fell from record highs.Challenge #4: A near-strike and train derailments in OhioAt the end of 2022, rail workers prepared to go on a nationwide strike after being unable to reach a labor agreement with rail carriers until Biden signed a bill to ban rail strikes.More than 400 groups, including the US Chamber of Commerce, lobbied for Biden to prevent those strikes. It was projected by the railroad industry that a rail worker strike would cost the US economy $2 billion per day, according to CNBC.Railroad unions had been negotiating with railway carriers since 2019. A Biden- and Buttigieg-backed proposal included a 24% increase in wages and allowed workers to go to medical appointments without being reprimanded, but lacked paid sick leave.This came at a time when the railroad industry wrestled with employment decline. Less than 3% of the nation's total transportation workforce comprises railway workers, compared to the increasing employment in warehouses and courier services.The strike was ultimately averted by Congress stepping in, but railroad workers continue to pressure Congress and the White House to address working conditions, while railway carriers have reported record profits and expenses this past year.And then came a high-profile accident: On Feb. 3, 2023, a Norfolk Southern (NSC) train carrying toxic materials derailed in East Palestine, Ohio. Residents were evacuated due to public health concerns from the chemicals and a ""drastic change in temperature in one of the rail cars"" that could have led to an explosion.Barely a month later, a second Norfolk Southern train had 28 cars derail in Springfield, Ohio, though there was no imminent public harm.""Until the number of derailments is zero and rail workers are confident in being fully equipped to do their jobs safely, everyone involved in our rail system must make safety improvements a priority,"" Buttigieg wrote in a letter to Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw.Michael McCormick, a former top FAA official, told The Independent that he would give Buttigieg a failing grade for his response to the train derailments in Ohio.“He just hasn’t been fast enough and assertive enough in terms of addressing public concerns around these areas,” McCormick said.Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg tours the site of the Norfolk Southern train derailment on Feb. 23, 2023 in East Palestine, Ohio. (Allie Vugrincic/The Vindicator via AP, Pool) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)After the East Palestine derailment, both Democrats and Republicans criticized Buttigieg, and the Transportation Secretary admitted that he should have visited East Palestine sooner.At the same time, Buttigieg is the first Transportation Secretary to visit a derailment site. He stated that he wanted the investigators of the National Transportation Safety Board to first finish their evaluation before he responded and stressed that the people of East Palestine take priority. He also said he is now seeking tougher train safety rules.""As I watch the news coverage, it looks like every politician, from the local level to the federal level, is trying to jump in front of the camera and say, 'I'm gonna save your lives,'"" Joseph Schofer, professor emeritus of civil and environmental engineering at Northwestern University told Yahoo Finance at the time. ""But we really don't have a good sense of the scope of the problem and whether what we're seeing, particularly the several events in Ohio, are in any way connected.""On average, there are three derailments per day across the US, even though, overall, railway operations have gotten safer in the past two decades. In comparison, there are more hazardous material fatalities on highways than on railroads, according to data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.Facing pressure, Buttigieg again argued that proposed GOP budget cuts would hinder the department's ability to regulate the freight industry.""A lot of times, they talk about our budget, our spending, as if just anything that wasn't defense was optional,"" Buttigieg told Yahoo Finance. ""I would argue that freight railroad safety inspections are not optional. Lives depend on it.""Challenge #5: Building bridges With the 2024 presidential race heating up, President Biden is currently on a tour to highlight the ""manufacturing boom"" of investments in bridges, along with affordable electric vehicles.The number of bridges needing repairs has remained at 223,000 since 2021. Projections from the American Road and Transportation Builders Association show that it could take 68 years to repair all of America's bridges, while the American Road &amp; Transportation Builders Association is projecting it to take nearly 30 years.As of 2022, the states with the most number of ""structurally deficient"" bridges were Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Iowa, all with more than 2,000 ""structurally deficient"" bridges. In January 2022, a bridge in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, collapsed as a bus and some cars were crossing.Even the bridge close to Buttigieg's office in D.C. is considered ""structurally deficient.""""We have changed the trajectory of infrastructure in the US,"" Buttigieg told Yahoo Finance on February 1. ""This is the most funding we’ve put into roads and bridges since the interstate highway system was created in the first place.""Despite the criticisms Buttigieg has garnered since taking office, Mann, the airline industry analyst, said the job comes with the territory.""The No. 1 issue is these are folks who need to understand the degree to which transportation is at large,"" Mann said. ""This is more than just air transportation issues. This is rails. It’s surface transportation. It’s maritimes, it’s pipelines. It’s all forms of transportation, which potentially provide significant economic growth, but need to be constructively regulated and in some cases reformed.""He added: ""You’re always fighting the battle between doing the right thing from an economic perspective, a trade perspective, [and] an environmental perspective in addition to the transportation perspective. These things are all interlinked.”—Tanya is a data reporter for Yahoo Finance.

UNP, CSX Corp. CSX and Norfolk Southern Corp. NSC.Industry: RailroadLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2095621/3-railroad-stocks-to-watch-amid-the-industry-weaknessProspects of Zacks Transportation - Rail industry's participants are being dented due to challenges like inflation-induced high interest rates, elevated fuel price and supply-chain woes. Most industry players are looking to drive their bottom line amid the headwinds through cost reduction.Despite the challenges surrounding the industry, Union Pacific Corp., CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. appear better-placed to tide over the challenges.About the IndustryThe Zacks Transportation - Rail industry includes railroad operators transporting freight (such as agricultural products, industrial products, coal, intermodal, automotive, consumer products, metals and minerals), primarily across North America. These companies focus on providing logistics and supply-chain expertise services.While freight constitutes a significant chunk of revenues, some of these companies also derive a small portion of their top line from other rail-related services, including third-party railcar and locomotive repairs, routine land sales and container sales, among others. A few companies offer service to multiple production and distribution facilities. Besides locomotives, some of these companies own equipment of leased locomotives, railcars etc.Factors Relevant to the Industry's FortunesFocus on Cost Cuts to Drive the Bottom Line: The industry has been experiencing significant levels of inflation, including higher prices for labor, freight and fuel. The industry players are focusing on cost-cutting measures and making efforts to improve productivity and efficiency to mitigate high expenses and the effects of a weaker-than-expected demand scenario.Story continuesEconomic Uncertainty: Despite a strong performance by major indices lately, the fact remains that we are by no means out of the woods, especially with respect to inflation-related woes. The recent production cut by the OPEC+ oil cartel, which includes OPEC members plus Russia, has led to a surge in oil prices. This may aggravate inflationary pressure and result in heightened economic uncertainty and market volatility. The turmoil in the banking sector — popularly known as the engine of economic growth — also does not bode well.Weak Freight Demand: Risks associated with an economic slowdown, geopolitical tensions and supply-chain woes dampen the prospects of stocks belonging to this industrial cohort. Due to the uncertainty, the Cass Freight Index declined 1% on a month-on-month basis in March. In fact, the index has declined month on month in six out of the last seven months. The slowdown in freight demand does not bode well for railroad operators.Zacks Industry Rank Signals Glum ProspectsThe Zacks Rail industry, housed within the broader Zacks Transportation sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #173. This rank places it in the bottom 31% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The industry's position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are pessimistic about this group's earnings growth potential. The industry's earnings estimates for 2023 have moved down 7.6% since May 2022.Despite the gloomy outlook, there are a couple of stocks worth watching in the industry. But before we present them, it is worth looking at the industry's shareholder returns and current valuation first.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 But Outperforms SectorOver the past year, the Zacks Transportation - Rail industry has declined 2.4% against the S&amp;P 500 composite's gain of 3%. The broader sector has declined 3.4% in the said time frame.Industry's Current ValuationBased on the trailing 12-month price-to-book (P/B), a commonly used multiple for valuing railroad stocks, the industry is currently trading at 6.97X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 5.51X. It is also above the sector's P/B ratio of 4.14X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 10.86X, as low as 5.69X and at the median of 8.08X.3 Stocks to Keep a Tab OnAll three stocks mentioned below carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereUnion Pacific: Based in Omaha, NE, Union Pacific provides rail transportation services across the United States. Union Pacific's efforts to reward its shareholders, even in the current uncertain scenario, are impressive. In 2022, UNP bought back shares worth $6,282 million. The railroad operator paid dividends worth $3,159 million in 2022.UNP's strong free cash flow generating ability supports its shareholder-friendly activities. The uptick in overall volumes (up 2% year over year in 2002) is an added positive. Union Pacific has an encouraging track record with respect to earnings surprises, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the past four quarters (missing the mark in the other one). The average beat is 2.28%.CSX: Based in Jacksonville, FL, CSX offers rail-based freight transportation services like traditional rail service, transport of intermodal containers and trailers apart from rail-to-truck transfers.CSX is trying to drive growth in this challenging environment by reducing operating expenses. Efforts to reward its shareholders also bode well. CSX has a stellar track record with respect to earnings surprises, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the past four quarters, by an average of 7.76%.Norfolk Southern: We are impressed with Norfolk Southern's efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In January 2023, the company's board announced a 9% uptick in its quarterly dividend payout to $1.35 per share. NSC's strong free cash flow generating ability supports NSC's shareholder-friendly activities.Norfolk Southern has an encouraging track record with respect to earnings surprise, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the past four quarters by an average of 4.66%.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

ZIM Integrated Shipping, which went public in February 2021, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters (missed once). The average beat is 14.38%.Against this backdrop, let’s look at the factors that might have shaped ZIM’s March-quarter performance.We expect the company’s bottom-line performance to have been hit by escalated voyage operating expenses. High fuel costs are also likely to have played spoilsport.Supply-chain disruptions, lower shipments and slowdown in freight demand might have dented ZIM’s performance in the quarter under review.On a brighter note, the positive sentiment surrounding the containership market is a tailwind for ZIM Integrated Shipping and might have aided its top line in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for ZIM Integrated Shipping this time around.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Dividend Stocks with 10%+ Yield. Dividend investing is gaining popularity on the back of increasing market volatility and investors' hunger for regular income. According to a report by CNBC, yearly dividend payouts of the S&amp;P 500 companies have grown from $420 billion in 2017 to $483 billion in 2020. The dividend payments finally hit their all-time high of $561 billion last year, as reported by Wall Street Journal.Dividend yields are an important aspect of dividend investment as it measures the income generated by an investment in the form of dividends. Additionally, as companies increase their dividends over time, the yield on the original investment may also increase, which makes high-dividend yield stocks valuable for long-term investors. That being said, analysts consider dividend yields between 2% to 6% healthy as high dividend yields can sometimes be a signal of risk. If a company offers an unusually high yield compared to its peers, it could indicate financial instability or other issues. For this reason, seasoned investors always carry out meticulous research and consider the respective company’s financials before investing.Some industries, such as real estate investment trusts (REITs) and utilities, offer high yields to investors while maintaining strong dividend policies. This means that companies with strong dividend growth track records and high yields could be reliable options for investors. This conforms to the historical returns of high-dividend stocks. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we mentioned the S&amp;P Global’s data which revealed that the S&amp;P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats outperformed the S&amp;P Composite 1500 by a wide margin from December 1999 to June 2019. The S&amp;P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index tracks the performance of companies with over 20 consecutive years of dividend growth.Story continuesAlso read: 10 Monthly Dividend Stocks with over 5% YieldIn addition to dividend yield, dividend growth track record is also a key factor when it comes to gauging a company's dividend safety and reliability. Dividend increases are usually a reflection of a company's confidence in its future earnings prospects and cash flow generation. In this regard, companies like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) are favored by investors. These companies have decades-long dividend growth streaks and healthy dividend yields.Dividend Stocks with 10%+ YieldPhoto by Dan Dennis on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we selected dividend stocks with yields above 10%, as of May 16. Though the companies mentioned below have higher-than-average yields, they have been making regular dividend payments to shareholders.

More often than not, we'll see a declining return on capital employed (ROCE) and a declining amount of capital employed. This combination can tell you that not only is the company investing less, it's earning less on what it does invest. In light of that, from a first glance at Mohawk Industries (NYSE:MHK), we've spotted some signs that it could be struggling, so let's investigate.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Mohawk Industries:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.08 = US$914m ÷ (US$15b - US$3.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).So, Mohawk Industries has an ROCE of 8.0%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Consumer Durables industry average of 17%. See our latest analysis for Mohawk Industries roceIn the above chart we have measured Mohawk Industries' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Mohawk Industries.What Does the ROCE Trend For Mohawk Industries Tell Us?There is reason to be cautious about Mohawk Industries, given the returns are trending downwards. Unfortunately the returns on capital have diminished from the 15% that they were earning five years ago. On top of that, it's worth noting that the amount of capital employed within the business has remained relatively steady. Since returns are falling and the business has the same amount of assets employed, this can suggest it's a mature business that hasn't had much growth in the last five years. So because these trends aren't typically conducive to creating a multi-bagger, we wouldn't hold our breath on Mohawk Industries becoming one if things continue as they have.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Mohawk Industries' ROCEAll in all, the lower returns from the same amount of capital employed aren't exactly signs of a compounding machine. It should come as no surprise then that the stock has fallen 55% over the last five years, so it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. That being the case, unless the underlying trends revert to a more positive trajectory, we'd consider looking elsewhere.One more thing to note, we've identified   1 warning sign  with Mohawk Industries and understanding this should be part of your investment process.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for DaVita Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$735.5mUS$827.0mUS$928.0mUS$978.0mUS$1.02bUS$1.05bUS$1.07bUS$1.10bUS$1.13bUS$1.15bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x2Analyst x2Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.03%Est @ 2.75%Est @ 2.56%Est @ 2.42%Est @ 2.33% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.0% US$675US$696US$717US$693US$660US$623US$588US$553US$520US$488(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$6.2bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.2b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.0%– 2.1%) = US$17bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$17b÷ ( 1 + 9.0%)10= US$7.2bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$13b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$98.5, the company appears quite undervalued at a 34% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at DaVita as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.160. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for DaVitaStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For DaVita, we've compiled three additional items you should consider:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

(NASDAQ:GEHC) have had a wonderful week after share price increased 5.8%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-ge-healthcare-technologies-110049455.html,1684407649,STORY,"['GEHC', 'GE']","[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, GE HealthCare Technologies' stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsThe top 6 shareholders own 53% of the company Recent sales by insiders To get a sense of who is truly in control of GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 61% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).As a result, institutional investors were the biggest beneficiaries of last week’s 5.8% gain.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of GE HealthCare Technologies, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for GE HealthCare Technologies ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About GE HealthCare Technologies?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in GE HealthCare Technologies. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see GE HealthCare Technologies' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in GE HealthCare Technologies. General Electric Company is currently the company's largest shareholder with 20% of shares outstanding. With 10% and 7.9% of the shares outstanding respectively, Capital Research and Management Company and The Vanguard Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesWe also observed that the top 6 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of GE HealthCare TechnologiesThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$7.4m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 19% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over GE HealthCare Technologies. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Public Company OwnershipIt appears to us that public companies own 20% of GE HealthCare Technologies. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Robust consumer demand is driving orders in the segment. Substantial LEAP engine deliveries and shop visit growth drove orders and revenues in the segment. While orders climbed 14% in the first quarter of 2023, revenues increased 25%.After months of softness, a rebound in demand at the Power segment augurs well for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. Strength in GE Gas Power heavy-duty gas turbine transactional services and aero derivatives is aiding the Power segment. The company expects low single-digit revenue growth for the Power segment in 2023 driven by Gas Power services. The acquisition of Nexus Controls (April 2023), which allows the creation of a single, full-service controls business line for further development of GE’s proprietary Mark Vle controls systems platform, should bolster the segment’s growth. The acquisition is aligned with GE’s commitment to invest in leading controls technology and expertise to enhance customer experience.Despite weaknesses due to lower onshore wind deliveries and other factors, the Renewable Energy segment has lately been showing signs of progress, thanks to higher equipment demand at Grid and Onshore Wind in North America.With market demand remaining strong, General Electric’s raised earnings and free cash flow guidance for 2023 holds promise. The company now expects adjusted earnings of $1.70-$2.00 per share compared with $1.60-$2.00 anticipated earlier. It expects a free cash flow of $3.6-$4.2 billion for 2023 compared with $3.4-$4.2 billion estimated earlier. The company continues to expect high-single-digit revenue growth for the current year.General Electric’s commitment to rewarding its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks is noteworthy. In March 2022, the company’s board of directors authorized the share repurchase program of up to $3 billion. GE bought back approximately 13 million shares for $1 billion in 2022 under this authorization. In 2022, the company paid out dividends worth $639 million to shareholders, up 11.1% year over year. In the first quarter of 2023, the company paid dividends of $203 million and repurchased 3.2 million shares for $0.3 billion.Amid these positives, shares of General Electric have rallied 21% in the year-to-date period against the industry’s 7.3% decline.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for GE’s 2023 earnings has been revised upward by 3% in the past 60 days.Key PicksHere are some better-ranked stocks for your consideration.ABB Ltd ABB presently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

159,55be8a35-c11f-329f-8fc7-ec3d5e2b7865,GE,2023-05-18,General Electric Company's (NYSE:GE) Stock Is Going Strong: Is the Market Following Fundamentals?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-electric-companys-nyse-ge-130030781.html,1684328430,STORY,['GE'],"[General Electric (NYSE:GE) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 19% over the last three months. Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to General Electric's  ROE today.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for General Electric How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for General Electric is:25% = US$8.4b ÷ US$33b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.25.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.General Electric's Earnings Growth And 25% ROEFirst thing first, we like that General Electric has an impressive ROE. Further, even comparing with the industry average if 27%, the company's ROE is quite respectable. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the impressive five year 51% net income growth seen by General Electric was probably achieved as a result of the high ROE.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared General Electric's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 37%.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is GE worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether GE is currently mispriced by the market.Is General Electric Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?General Electric's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 5.9%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 94% of its profits. So it looks like General Electric is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.Additionally, General Electric has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 6.2% of its profits over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that General Electric's future ROE will drop to 14% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with General Electric's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future.

(NYSE:FCX) should definitely note that insider Sara Lewis recently paid US$34.90 per share to buy US$140k worth of the stock. That's a very decent purchase to our minds and it grew their holding by a solid 29%. View our latest analysis for Freeport-McMoRan Freeport-McMoRan Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when insider Ryan Lance bought US$988k worth of shares at a price of US$31.88 per share. We do like to see buying, but this purchase was made at well below the current price of US$35.82. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 38.00k shares worth US$1.2m. But they sold 3.68k shares for US$159k. In the last twelve months there was more buying than selling by Freeport-McMoRan insiders. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFreeport-McMoRan is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Insider Ownership Of Freeport-McMoRanAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Freeport-McMoRan insiders own about US$240m worth of shares (which is 0.5% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Freeport-McMoRan Tell Us?Our data shows a little insider buying, but no selling, in the last three months. That said, the purchases were not large. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. With high insider ownership and encouraging transactions, it seems like Freeport-McMoRan insiders think the business has merit. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Freeport-McMoRan.

At the request of Cisco, today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. Now I would like to introduce Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.Marilyn MoraWelcome, everyone, to Cisco's Third Quarter Fiscal 2023 Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. This is Marilyn Mora, Head of Investor Relations. And I'm joined by Chuck Robbins, our Chair and CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. By now, you should have seen our earnings press release. A corresponding webcast with slides, including supplemental information, will be made available on our website in the Investor Relations section following the call. Income statements, full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information, balance sheet, cash flow statements and other financial information can be found in the Financial Information section of the Investor Relations website. Throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, and we'll discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer results in terms of product orders, unless stated otherwise. All comparisons made throughout this call will be made on a year-over-year basis. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, including the guidance we will be providing for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2023. They are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. With respect to guidance, please also see the slides and press release that accompany this call for further details. Cisco will not comment on its financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit public disclosure. With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck.Story continuesCharles H. RobbinsThank you, Marilyn, and hope you all are doing well. This was another strong quarter for us, and I'm proud of what our teams have achieved. In Q3, we delivered our strongest ever revenue, non-GAAP income, non-GAAP EPS and operating cash flow. We also continued to successfully execute on our strategy, driving solid growth in ARR to nearly $24 billion and posting double-digit growth in subscription and software revenues. Based on our strong Q3 performance, we are once again raising our fiscal 2023 outlook for revenue and earnings per share, which Scott will cover shortly. As we look ahead to fiscal year '24, we expect to see modest revenue growth even with the tough compare of double-digit growth in fiscal year '23. Now before I go through our Q3 performance, I'd like to discuss 3 key areas that will help drive our long-term growth. First, we are pleased with continued success in our movement towards more subscriptions and recurring revenue. In Q3, we delivered 18% growth in software revenues. We also have $32 billion in remaining performance obligations, and we expect to see this momentum accelerate. Second, security continues to be an enormous opportunity for us. As you've heard me say, we've revamped our strategy, put a world-class team in place and made this a top priority for the company. Over the coming quarters, you will see new innovations in this space, building on our strong Cisco Security Cloud strategy, including at Cisco Live next month. Based on the rapid progress we are making, we are optimistic about our opportunity in this fast-growing market. And third, Generative AI and cloud. At Cisco, we already use predictive AI extensively across our portfolio. In addition, our core networking technology is already powering some of the leading AI models run by hyperscalers around the world. We have also moved rapidly to leverage Generative AI capabilities in our own products, which you'll hear more about in the next few weeks and beyond, starting at Cisco Live. Now let me discuss our quarterly performance. As I mentioned, in Q3, we delivered our highest ever quarterly revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. We saw healthy margins and record non-GAAP net income, which reflect our strong operating discipline. All of this contributed to record operating cash flow in Q3. As we expected, the actions we took to mitigate supply constraints have continued to pay off. Price realization, as a result of the actions we put in place last year, helped to offset inflationary pressures. Our disciplined cost management enabled us to continue to expand gross margins as well as prioritize our strategic investments to drive long-term growth. As it relates to customer demand, it is being shaped by a few factors that we believe are impacting the entire industry. First, our increase in product shipments is often leading customers and partners to absorb these shipments prior to placing new orders. Second, the significant reduction in product lead times reduces the need for extensive advanced ordering by our customers. And third, macroeconomic conditions. With this said, in our discussions with customers, such as the ones we had at our most recent Global Customer Advisory Board event earlier this month, they continue to invest in key technologies that are core to their overall strategies. As we previously shared, given the unprecedented demand for our technology during the pandemic, we believe sequential order rates are far more informative than year-over-year rates. Just like the prior 2 quarters, our sequentials in Q3 were in general alignment with historical ranges coming in 1 point below the historical range. In addition, our order cancellation rates also remained well below historical levels, indicating the strength of our backlog and portfolio. In terms of our backlog, we continue to expect that we will end the fiscal year with roughly double our normal product backlog. Now let me share a bit more detail about some of our newest innovations. Regarding our webscale customers, they are currently consuming and implementing their prior significant technology investments. There remains a huge growth opportunity across all these customers, enabled by our portfolio of hardware, software, silicon and systems. We already see early design wins in AI infrastructure and continue to see other wins and competitive displacements, leading to continued share gain in this space. In our networking business, we remain focused on building solutions that drive a higher return on investment and sustainability. In March, we introduced 800-gig capability to our Cisco 8000 platform with the industry's first 28.8 terabit line card, powered by Cisco Silicon One ASICs and pluggable optics. This new platform can deliver up to 68% power savings and 83% space savings compared to 400-gig solutions, helping to reduce operational costs and carbon emissions as well as enabling the densification of networks to support use cases such as AIML and IoT. This continues to drive positive customer feedback, and we're excited about this opportunity. To complement our own innovations, in Q3, we closed the acquisition of Valtix, which is aligned to our security cloud vision for providing protection across multi-cloud environments with a seamless experience. We also announced our intent to acquire 2 companies that further extend our capabilities in cloud, security and full stack observability. Before I close, I also want to share once again how incredibly proud I am that for the third year in a row, we were ranked #1 in the U.S. on Fortune Magazine's 100 Best Companies to work for. And in 14 other countries around the world, we were also ranked as the #1 Great Place to Work, reflecting Cisco's position as a premier destination for top talent worldwide. To summarize, our ability to navigate uncertainty was demonstrated by our record results. Our performance remains solid and reflects the strength of our strategy and the benefits from the investments we've made over the last several years. Our operational discipline and excellence in execution are driving record earnings, cash flow and shareholder value. As we look towards Q4 and fiscal year '24, I'd like to share a few observations. As I mentioned earlier, as of now, we see modest revenue growth in fiscal year '24 on top of our strong performance in fiscal year '23. You can also expect us to grow earnings per share at a higher rate than revenue in Q4 fiscal year '23 and full year fiscal year '24, reflecting improving gross margins and strong expense management. Lastly, we expect to continue our stock buybacks at the higher levels you've seen over the last 2 quarters. I'd like to thank our teams for their focus and execution and our customers and partners for the trust they placed in us. As cloud, AI and security continue to scale, Cisco's long-established leadership in networking and the breadth of our portfolio, give me the confidence in our ability to capture the many opportunities ahead. I'll now turn it over to Scott.Richard Scott HerrenThanks, Chuck. We delivered a record quarter that exceeded both our top and bottom line expectations driven by focused execution, continued business transformation and the actions we've taken over the last several quarters to mitigate supply issues. We reported our strongest ever revenue, non-GAAP income, non-GAAP earnings per share and operating cash flow for the quarter. Total revenue was $14.6 billion, up 14% year-on-year. Non-GAAP net income was $4.1 billion. And non-GAAP earnings per share was $1, up 15%. Looking at our Q3 revenue in more detail. Total product revenue was $11.1 billion, up 17%. And service revenue was $3.5 billion, up 3%. Within product revenue, Secure Agile Networks, our largest business, was very strong, up 29%. Switching revenue had strong double-digit growth with strength in both campus and data center switching driven by our Catalyst 9000, Meraki and Nexus 9000 offerings. Enterprise routing growth was driven primarily by strength in our Catalyst 8000 Series routers, SD-WAN and IoT routing. And wireless also had very strong double-digit growth with strength driven by our WiFi 6 products and Meraki wireless offerings. Internet for the future was up 5%, driven by growth in our core routing products, including very strong growth in our Cisco 8000 offering. We also saw double-digit growth in webscale. Collaboration was down 13% driven by declines in collaboration devices and meetings, offset slightly by growth in calling and contact center. End-to-end security was up 2% driven by our Unified Threat Management and Zero Trust offerings. And optimized application experiences was up 12% driven by growth across the portfolio, including double-digit growth in ThousandEyes. We continue to make progress on our transformation metrics as we shift our business to more recurring revenue-based offerings driven by higher levels of software and subscriptions. We saw solid performance of our ARR of $23.8 billion, which increased 6% with product ARR growth of 10%. Total software revenue was $4.3 billion, an increase of 18%, with software subscription revenue up 17%. 82% of software revenues were subscription-based. We continue to have an elevated level of software orders and our product backlog. Total subscription revenue was $6.1 billion, an increase of 11%. RPO was $32.1 billion, up 6%, with product RPO increasing 9% and service RPO increasing 4%. And total short-term RPO grew to $16.9 billion. Total product orders were down 23% driven by the 3 factors Chuck pointed out earlier. The aging of our backlog has improved significantly, and we continue to have very low cancellation, rates, reflecting the quality of our past orders and critical nature of our product portfolio. Total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 65.2%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range and down 10 basis points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 64.5%, up 240 basis points sequentially and up 40 basis points year-over-year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by positive pricing and favorable product mix. This was partially offset by higher component and other costs. Services gross margin was 67.3%, down 160 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was at the high end of our guidance range at 33.9%, down 80 basis points year-over-year and up 140 basis points sequentially. Backlog for both our hardware and software products continues to significantly exceed historical levels. Due to an improving supply situation and our focused execution, we were able to accelerate shipments of our aged backlog to meet customer needs, which resulted in a decline in backlog level sequentially and year-over-year. We continue to expect to exit the year with roughly double our normal product backlog. And just a reminder, backlog is not included as part of our $32 billion in remaining performance obligations. Combined, our significant product backlog and RPO continued to provide great visibility to our top line as we approach fiscal year '24. Shifting to the balance sheet. We ended Q3 with total cash, cash equivalents and investments of $23.3 billion. We had record operating cash flow for the quarter of $5.2 billion, up 43% year-over-year driven primarily by strong collections and the deferral of our Q3 federal tax payment due to the IRS tax relief related to the California floods earlier this year. The federal tax payment deferral had a positive impact of approximately 20 points of growth year-over-year on Q3 operating cash flow. This recent IRS relief postponed our remaining current year federal income tax payment deadlines until Q1 of our fiscal '24. In line with our disciplined capital allocation strategy and commitment to return capital, we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders during the quarter, which was comprised of $1.6 billion for our quarterly cash dividend and $1.3 billion of share repurchases. We ended the quarter with $12.2 billion in remaining stock purchase authorization. Year-to-date, we've returned a total of $7.7 billion via cash dividends and share repurchases. This reinforces our confidence in the strength and stability of our ongoing cash flows. We continue to invest organically and inorganically in our innovation pipeline. During Q3, we announced and closed the acquisition of Valtix, which further strengthens our security portfolio. This investment is consistent with our strategy of complementing our internal innovation in R&amp;D with targeted strategic M&amp;A. To summarize, we had a strong quarter, delivering record top line growth, non-GAAP profitability and cash flow. We continue to make progress on our business model shift to more recurring revenue while making strategic investments in innovation to capitalize on our significant growth opportunities. Turning now to our guidance. For fiscal Q4, our guidance is, we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 14% to 16%. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 64.5% to 65.5%, and our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be in the range of 34% to 35%. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $1.05 to $1.07. As Chuck mentioned, we are yet again raising our fiscal year guidance for fiscal '23, which is as follows. We expect revenue growth to be in the range of 10% to 10.5% year-on-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to range from $3.80 to $3.82. In both our Q4 and full year guidance, we're assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19%. Our guidance ranges reflect significant visibility driven by healthy backlog, ARR, RPO and improving availability of supply. As Chuck mentioned earlier, as of now, we see modest revenue growth in fiscal '24 on top of our strong performance in fiscal '23. You can also expect us to deliver earnings per share at a higher growth rate than revenue in Q4 and in fiscal '24, reflecting improving gross margins and strong expense management. And lastly, we expect to continue our stock buybacks at the higher level you've seen over the last 2 quarters. I'll now turn it back to Marilyn so we can move into the Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionMarilyn MoraThanks, Scott. Michelle, let's go ahead and tee up the queue for questions.OperatorSamik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.Samik ChatterjeeI guess maybe if I can start with a clarification on the orders. I think, Chuck, I heard you say orders were sequentially 1 point below seasonality. But if you can clarify whether on a quarter-over-quarter basis, they were up or down, and I'm not sure if you gave it year-over-year. But maybe more broadly, as you think about your guide for next year as well, are you -- what are you assuming for orders in that? And I have a follow-up.Charles H. RobbinsThanks, Samik. As I said in the opening comments, there are 3 factors really that are affecting demand, first of all. Our -- as we ship more of our backlog, our customers are digesting what they've ordered. Secondly, as our lead times come down, which our lead times have come down 40% over the last 2 quarters on a weighted basis, so it really eliminates the need for customers to order significantly in advance as they had been. And then obviously, the macro conditions. When I talk about sequentials, as I've said, the year-over-years are just so hard to figure out that we've said the real thing we're looking for relative to whether we're seeing a momentum shift in the business is, are the sequentials in line? And as I've said the last couple of quarters and this quarter as well, the sequentials were operating at or slightly below the low end of our historical ranges. So I wouldn't say it's robust, but it's still within the range or slightly below. And as we look at Q4, we actually expect our sequentials to be in line with what we've seen historically. So our view based on what we see today is that we can still deliver positive growth in fiscal year '24, even on top of the good growth year we had this year. I'll make one other point. If you go back to September '21 when we had our analyst conference, we actually laid out long-term top line growth of 5% to 7%, long-term EPS growth of 5% to 7%. If you move to the end of fiscal '24 based on what we see today, we will be in that range from a CAGR perspective, on a revenue perspective, and we'll be above that range from an EPS perspective during that same time period.Samik ChatterjeeOkay. Got it. And for my follow-up, I think I wanted to sort of touch on that expense control that you talked about and EPS growing faster than revenue. Is that sort of a change of thinking from the Analyst Day in terms of -- I think at the Analyst Day, you were talking about sort of limited operating leverage and growing earnings more in line with revenue. It seems to be that outside of the gross margin, you're thinking about being a bit more disciplined and pulling back on expenses, but maybe confirm if that's sort of how you -- if we are interpreting that right.Charles H. RobbinsYes. Samik, if you look at the last 2 years, we've actually grown EPS faster than revenue. And as we look to Q4 and then beyond, it's pretty clear that with the gross margin expansion and with our expense management that we are implementing, we can still fund the investment areas that we need to fund as well as actually deliver higher EPS growth rates than revenue, which is what a lot of our investors have been asking for. And so we believe that's quite feasible for us to do now. Scott, do you have any comments on that?Richard Scott HerrenNo. I think you touched on the key points. We will continue to invest in growth. But we also -- as you've seen in the last 2 years, you've seen us do this grow the bottom line faster than the top line in fiscal '22 and at the midpoint of our guide for fiscal '23. And as we look ahead, it's a time to be prudent, and so we see that happening again in fiscal '24.OperatorSimon Leopold with Raymond James.Simon Matthew LeopoldAt the beginning of May, Cisco announced a capital business acceleration program as a part of Cisco Capital. This is a topic we haven't talked about much on recent calls. I'd just like a little bit better understanding as to what's the strategy, thought process and rationale for implementing that program?Richard Scott HerrenYes, Simon, thanks for the question. That's something that you've seen us do in the past. It's more a reflection of interest rates jumping up to 5%. Our customers needing to get their hands on technology to continue to advance their own strategies and us just putting our balance sheet to work a bit. It's not more complicated than that.Simon Matthew LeopoldAnd no real effect on your financial model, I assume then?Richard Scott HerrenNo. Not in terms of profitability or in terms of the long-term impact that's going to have.OperatorDavid Vogt with UBS.David VogtMaybe just more qualitative and maybe as a follow-up to Simon's question. Can you kind of give a little bit more color on what you saw, let's say, in March into April and what you're seeing today from a macro perspective? Because it certainly sounds like from our conversations with partners and other industry folks that March was a bit softer than people had anticipated, and it didn't improve in April. Just love to get your perspective there. And then I'll give you my follow-up real quick. So if I kind of take your comment about the 3-year plan, it certainly would imply kind of revenue growth next year in kind of the 2%, 3% range and EPS in the 5% range. Is that kind of what you're trying to communicate from a back-of-the-envelope perspective next year given the macro headwinds?Charles H. RobbinsI'm sorry, David, could you repeat that second part, the numbers you had there? I didn't catch them.David VogtYes. If I just kind of take the back-of-the-envelope math on your 5% to 7% 3-year target, that would imply revenue growth next year in the 2% to 3% range and EPS maybe 5% to 6% range. Is that kind of what you're trying to message here? Just so we have a sense for how you're thinking about the macro.Charles H. RobbinsAll right, David. Thanks for the questions. So let me talk about the linearity that we saw in the quarter. It actually was very favorable from our perspective on the orders. While we clearly see that we're operating at the low end of historical ranges on a sequential basis, we did not see it deteriorate from the beginning of the quarter to the end. In fact, it was -- our linearity was slightly better than it normally is. And April was actually sort of in line with what we've seen, maybe even (inaudible) better than the first 2 months. So we did not see that particular outcome. And again, what we're looking for is a change in underlying momentum. I'm not suggesting there's strong momentum. I'm just saying we're looking for a change. And the best way to do that is to really understand, do the sequentials continue to play out the way they're supposed to? And as of now, we see they are playing out very consistently and sort of the low end of the range or slightly below. And then, Scott, do you want to take the FY '24 number?Richard Scott HerrenYes, sure. Just on the math you're trying to do, David, I think you're in the right ballpark. What I'd say, obviously, I don't want to get into being too precise on fiscal '24 yet since it's only our Q3 call. But bear in mind, that's growth on fiscal '24 on top of at the midpoint of our guide for fiscal '23, 10.2% growth in fiscal '23. The last time we had double-digit revenue growth for a full year was back in 2012 in the bounce back of the -- from the global financial crisis. So it's a very strong year this year, and we see a modest level of growth on top of that.OperatorGeorge Notter with Jefferies.George Charles NotterI guess I wanted to ask about the growth expectation for this year. I'm curious about your view. How much of that growth comes from price? How much comes from backlog consumption? What are the bigger factors driving that growth this year?Richard Scott HerrenYes. I guess where I'd start is the biggest factor driving the growth for this year is the huge amount of demand we've had from our customers that's been sitting in backlog as we've worked our way through some of the supply issues. That's -- if you ask what's driving the growth, it's that, it's end-user demand. When you start to peel back to the mechanics of how that got put together, a lot of it is our ability to -- based on a lot of hard work actually from both the engineering team and the supply chain team to free up some of the component supply issues that we've had that's allowed us to work through some of the backlog. We're not finished. There's still supply constraints. We think we end the year. Just like we said last quarter, we end the year with still with roughly double what our normal backlog would be, but we've made great strides on that front. Price has been a positive for us. As we said earlier, there's a -- as we work our way through the backlog, more of the orders that we received prior to those price actions that we took last year have been delivered now. And so we are seeing -- you'll see this when we publish our Q, about 1 point of benefit from price.OperatorMeta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.Meta A. MarshallI was wondering if you could just kind of speak to the trends you're seeing within enterprise commercial service provider. You noted kind of seeing some digestion on the webscale, but just wanted to kind of get a sense if there's any different trends that you're seeing within those customer types. And then maybe just as a follow-up question. Obviously, your customers have been going through cloud optimization efforts and kind of looking towards long-term architectures. Is there any changes kind of you distinguish from customers just on the outcomes or ways in which Cisco can kind of better help customers on that journey?Charles H. RobbinsYes. Thanks, Meta. So the trends by segment, I think if you think about the 3 factors that I described, one is customers needing to digest the shipments that we're shipping out. And secondly, as our lead times come down significantly, they don't need to order as far in advance. And if you think about who the customers are that have the most visibility and have done most of the advanced ordering, it's going to be large enterprises and service providers and webscale providers. And so from a segment perspective, I think the predominant issue we're seeing in the service provider space, which, by the way, contributed to 41% of the overall year-over-year decline, came from the (inaudible), which is less than 20% of our total revenue. So it had an outsized impact on our overall year-over-year decline. I would say in the enterprise, there's large enterprises that are dealing with the same issues and are facing -- and are doing the same thing. They're digesting the equipment, and they're not needing to order as far ahead. We're also seeing the same things that you've heard from others. We're seeing elongated sales cycles. We're seeing more signatures required. But in general, we're getting the signatures, but they are taking a little longer. And then as it relates to the technology trends and what our customers are focused on, the good news for us is that if you think about every customer on the planet is basically has 5 key priorities that we actually align to. One is they're re-architecting for this multi-cloud world. They're trying to figure out hybrid work. They're rebuilding their entire application strategy and rearchitecting their applications. They're rebuilding their cyber footprint because of all this distributed nature of what they're doing now, and they're focused on sustainability. And our technology plays across all of those very important areas, and we're working very hard with all of our customers in all of those spaces. And it's -- and then the final one, I think, that's on everybody's mind is artificial intelligence or Generative AI. And I would say in the webscale space, over the next 5 years, the market opportunity -- well, the entire market opportunity for AI infrastructure is estimated to be at $8.5 billion by '27, growing at about 40% CAGR from where it was. As I said in my opening comments, we're already installed as a networking infrastructure for some of these early AI models that the webscalers are running. If you think about where we were at the beginning of the webscale build-out a decade ago, I said many times on these calls that we were not prepared, and we got left out. And I would say this time for this AI infrastructure from a networking perspective, I believe we are better positioned than anybody else, and our teams have done a great job getting us into this position, and we see that as a massive opportunity.OperatorSami Badri with Credit Suisse.Ahmed Sami BadriAll right. My question is on any kind of dynamics with the hyperscalers or cloud providers that led to any kind of product pushouts or delays of shipments or any kind of receipts that took longer delivery. Anything that was shifted? Do you guys see any kind of shifting of deliveries or request to ship deliveries in the quarter?Charles H. RobbinsNo, we did not see any of that. In fact, we've been fulfilling all the request. There are certain projects that our teams have been working on that they have delayed, but those are around new orders, not around what's in the backlog. I think a lot of that is because there's so much focus now on building out the AI infrastructure for each of them, and so that's really what we see happening, and it's an area that we we've had lots of design wins. We continue to get design wins, and it's an area where we believe that we'll continue to gain market share.Ahmed Sami BadriGot it. And then one follow-up on gross margins. You talked about the modest growth in '24, and you also talked about EPS outpacing that. But maybe we could get an idea on gross margin trajectory. Should -- is there something we should be thinking as far as a glide path or an expansion range?Richard Scott HerrenYes, Sami, you see the midpoint of the guide we gave on gross margin for Q4. We've seen significant progress on gross margin through the year. I mean the product gross margin grew 240 basis points sequentially. That said, I think we're about to the point where we're lapping some of the benefits of the price increases. So there may be a little more room in gross margin sequentially. But if you look at the average for the year next year, of course, if you remember the first quarter of this year, we had a pretty significant impact in gross margin. So the average for the full year will definitely go up, right, as we see, if we keep it the same glide path through fiscal '24.OperatorMatt Niknam with Deutsche Bank.Matthew NiknamFirst, just a follow-up on the fiscal '24. The modest growth, what sort of macro assumptions are you embedding into that preliminary outlook? And then just secondly, if I could just double click on security. If you can maybe talk about what's driving some of the softness or decelerating growth. I believe it was about 2% growth this past quarter and what you're anticipating in terms of maybe additional backlog release and whether that can maybe help some of those trends looking forward.Charles H. RobbinsYou want to take the first?Richard Scott HerrenYes. If we start on fiscal '24. I think there's a few things, Matt, to keep in mind before we start talking about macro. We're rolling into the year with a backlog that's roughly double than what would be normal. And that's really just a function of kind of the continuing supply constraints that are definitely improving, and that's why you see some of the strength that we've shown in this quarter and in our guide for next quarter, but they're not done. I do see those normalizing sometime midyear. By the second half of the year, we should be through most of the backlog. The second is the absorption factor. We think that with the lead times normalizing and working through the backlog, the absorption factor also probably gets itself work through to next year by around midyear of next year. So -- but when you roll into the year with $32 billion of RPO, which is where we are today, $17 billion of that being current with almost $24 billion of ARR, which drives a huge renewal opportunity for us next year and with backlog, it takes a lot of pressure off of what needs to happen from a macro standpoint.Charles H. RobbinsAnd then I'd say on the security front, I think I've been -- we've talked about this on several calls, and we've hired new leadership team. The team is doing a phenomenal job. We had a big announcement recently at RSA where we launched an XDR platform that actually is one of the first that actually ingests data from our competitors and our partners across the industry. And at Cisco Live in a couple of weeks, we're going to make the next wave of announcements around some new innovation. And so I think we've acknowledged that we needed to get this -- these new technologies out, and I think that they're coming out with unique differentiation to Cisco. And I think that's over the next -- when you look out sort of the second half of next fiscal year, I think you'll see security really be accelerating into a growth driver for us.OperatorMike Ng, you may go ahead from Goldman Sachs.Michael NgI just have 2. First, could you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about inventory levels on the balance sheet going forward? And if you have any information you could share with us around purchase commitments as well? And then I have a quick follow-up.Richard Scott HerrenSure, Michael. If you look at -- you really have to look at the sum of those 2 collectively because purchase commitments are there, they're firm commitments that we've made to take on inventory. So the line between what's in purchase commitments and what's actually on our balance sheet is pretty great. When you add those 2 together and look back over the last 3 quarters, we've worked down about $3 billion worth of the combination of inventory on hand and the purchase commitment. So I think the team has done a really nice job balancing, ensuring we have supply to continue to work our way through the backlog, and at the same time, minimizing the risk that we have too much inventory.Michael NgGreat. Excellent. And then second, it was encouraging to hear about the expectation to return to a normal seasonality in sequential orders starting next quarter. I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more texture around those expectations. Is the absorption of early product shipments that may have impacted the sequential this quarter going to be largely done by next? Is it just the easier comps? Any thoughts there would be helpful.Charles H. RobbinsThanks, Michael. Well, when I said that Q4, we see normal sequentials from Q3, that just means they're in the range of the historical ranges that we've seen from high to low. So it's not like an anomaly. It's not going to be significantly higher or significantly lower based on what we see today. We think that the digestion issue and the lead time stuff, we're estimating right now that most of that stuff gets washed out by the middle of next fiscal year. So we think to really get back to where you see normalized sort of ordering patterns and normalized backlog, we think that's probably going to be the second half of fiscal '24.OperatorAmit Daryanani from Evercore.Amit Jawaharlaz DaryananiPerfect. Glad I sneaked in here. I guess I have 2 as well. Maybe first on the hyperscale side. Chuck, you talked about seeing gains on the AI infrastructure side. Can you sort of touch on where are you seeing these wins? Is it sort of data center switching or (inaudible) or something else? And then are these sort of net new applications getting (inaudible) just any color there would be helpful.Charles H. RobbinsYes. So on a specific hyperscaler situation, we've been winning and displacing or becoming a second vendor in existing architectures for the last couple of years. And then we're winning new franchises around. These AI networks, in many cases, are brand new, and we're actually winning some of them as well. And so as you think about AI, I think it's important to understand the underlying technology. And just quickly, today, what's largely used is something called InfiniBand. And we see that our -- the webscalers are -- they have a desire to move to Ethernet and then further to this new technology that we actually have (inaudible). And we support both Ethernet and (inaudible), and we think we're leading in this space. And it actually increases the -- I'd say, makes these networks run more effectively and more efficiently. And so those are some of the reasons we're winning. But it's just -- it's a very big opportunity over the next 5, 6, 7 years.Amit Jawaharlaz DaryananiGot it. And then if I could just maybe go back to this order discussion. I think everyone seems to be surprised on orders being down 22% despite the compares getting easier, and I get your sequential commentary fairly well. But perhaps you can just talk about -- you compared that you get really easy for the next few quarters. So do you feel like the down 22% is the trough and the declines may still be there but they sort of ease up until you get to the back half? Or how do you think about the order trajectory over the next few quarters and maybe the magnitude of it?Charles H. RobbinsYes, it's interesting. Back 4, 5, 6 quarters ago, I said we see this huge bookings and revenues running at a much lower level. And I said there will be an inflection point, where revenue will run much higher than bookings. But it's -- so it's playing out exactly as we expected. Now there is the added dynamic of sort of the macro uncertainty that people are certainly concerned about. What we're looking for is to see, again, if there is a significant shift in momentum from one quarter to the next, which is one of the sequential thing we watch. We watched it for 20 years, and it really helps us see what's going on. And I think we're just going to have to -- what we're telling you right now is based on what we see today. And when we look out at FY '24 and the commentary we made about showing positive growth on a high growth year that we're having this year, it's based on, as Scott said, on backlog, on RPO, and it's based on the visibility that our sales teams have right now and what their expectations are for orders over the next 12 months.Richard Scott HerrenYes. Just to add a little bit to that, Amit, a little bit more to that. When you add up between what will be current RPO that will turn into revenue during fiscal '24, plus the backlog normalizing, which will be a tailwind, plus the renewal opportunity of what's not in RPO today, but sitting in ARR today, round number is somewhere between 40% and 50% of that revenue for next year is contained in those 3 lines, right? It's either orders that are in-house and sitting in RPO or sitting in backlog or renewal opportunities that we have a chance to go out and renew this year. So when I said it takes a lot of pressure off of macro, it's a strong position to be in, rolling into next year with that much of it either already in-house or sitting as renewal opportunities for us.Charles H. RobbinsThat's a really good data point, Scott. And I think if you go back 8 or 10 years ago, in any given quarter, we would have to take orders for as much as 75% of our revenue in the quarter. And that's certainly not the case today, so that actually helps us as we (inaudible).Marilyn MoraAll right. Great. And Chuck, I'll turn it over to you.Charles H. RobbinsThanks, Marilyn. In closing, I want to thank everybody for spending time with us today, first of all. I'm super proud of our results. I think our teams are executing very well. I'm proud of the record results that we had this quarter. I'm also really proud that we're seeing what we also said, which is the market share gains come through that we had talked about. We've been asked on several calls about market share. And in the reports that we expect to be coming out very soon, we have meaningful share gains that, I think, you'll see in campus switching, SD branch routing, wireless LAN, SP routing, some of our absolute biggest markets, which reflect the relevance of our technology to our customers right now. I'm really proud that looking at FY '24, we still see growth on a strong double-digit growth year and also growing earnings per share faster than we are revenue. And our teams are committed to delivering on our commitments, and we look forward to spending time with you 90 days from now. So thanks for being with us.Marilyn MoraAll right. Thanks, Chuck. And to close this out, Cisco's next quarterly earnings conference call, which will reflect our fiscal year 2023 fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 results will be on Wednesday, August 16, 2023 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time, 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.
