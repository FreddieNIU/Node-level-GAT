These statements are based on assumptions and estimates that management believes are reasonable based on currently available information; however, management’s assumptions and Range’s future performance are subject to a wide range of business risks and uncertainties and there is no assurance that these goals and projections can or will be met. Any number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.

Range uses certain broader terms such as “resource potential,” “unrisked resource potential,” “unproved resource potential” or “upside” or other descriptions of volumes of resources potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that may include probable and possible reserves as defined by the SEC’s guidelines.

These quantities may not necessarily constitute or represent reserves within the meaning of the Society of Petroleum Engineer’s Petroleum Resource Management System or the SEC’s oil and natural gas disclosure rules. Actual quantities that may be recovered from Range’s interests could differ substantially. Factors affecting ultimate recovery include the scope of Range’s drilling program, which will be directly affected by the availability of capital, drilling and production costs, commodity prices, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, transportation constraints, regulatory approvals, field spacing rules, recoveries of gas in place, length of horizontal laterals, actual drilling results, including geological and mechanical factors affecting recovery rates and other factors.

We will also be discussing the global bath towel industry. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Highest Quality Bath Towels of 2024.', 'According to a report published by Fortune Business Insights, the global bath towel industry was valued at $10.66 billion in 2022. The global bath towel industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4.41% and reach $14.92 billion by 2030. Bath towels are one of the most essential consumer goods used daily in almost every household. Qualities including absorbability, durability, ease of use, and drying capability, add value to a towel and make it preferable over other alternative products. The demand for bath towels and the overall growth of this industry are tied to other markets, including personal care, fitness clubs, hotels, hospitals, and spas. Moreover, the growing trend of home swimming pools and consumer demand for luxury spa experiences has also contributed to the rising demand for more absorbent high-quality towels.', 'The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic had both negative and positive impacts on the global bath towel industry. The production almost came to a halt due to factors including lockdowns, travel restrictions, disrupted supply chains, and barriers in raw material procurement However, rising awareness regarding personal hygiene during and after the pandemic boosted the demand for towels, particularly for residential use. Moreover, the shutdown of physical stores during COVID-19 led companies to emphasize on online marketing and social media presence, thus contributing to resilient sales both during and after the pandemic.', 'Growing demand for high-quality towels from end markets such as hotels and spas is propelling the growth of the industry. Moreover, consumer demand is shifting towards more durable and less maintenance towels, especially in the hospitality and hotel industry, as they require products that can be reused and can withstand frequent laundry without compromising the quality.\xa0', 'International hotels and spas are also proponents of sustainability and demand commodities that align with their corporate social responsibility goals. Thus, towels made from organic materials, including bamboo, cotton, and recycled materials, are gaining popularity. Another notable trend in the global bath towel industry is the growing consumer demand for towels with customized monograms that add a personal touch to their bathroom décor.\xa0', 'The bath towel industry is segmented based on the raw material used for its production. The major segments of the industry include cotton, bamboo, and microfibers. It is worth mentioning that cotton towels hold the majority share in the market. According to Fortune Business Insights, cotton towels held a market share of approximately 47% in 2022. Moreover, as the market trend is shifting towards sustainability, the bamboo towel segment is expected to grow at the fastest CAGR compared to other segments from 2023 to 2030. Towels made from bamboo are gaining popularity not only because of their eco-friendly nature, but also due to their antimicrobial properties that help to keep bacteria and odor away.

So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc."", ""Marc N. Casper: Thank you, Raf. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today for our fourth quarter call. As you saw in our press release, our fourth quarter results were ahead of the guidance we provided on our call in October and demonstrates strong execution. As I reflect on our performance for the full year, I'm very proud of our team as they operated with speed at scale to enable the success of our customers while demonstrating incredibly strong operational disciplines and commercial execution. In 2023, we delivered differentiated short-term performance while at the same time strengthening our long-term competitive position. I'll get into more detail in my remarks later, but first, let me recap the financials."", 'Starting with the quarter, our revenue was $10.89 billion. Our adjusted operating income was $2.55 billion. We expanded our adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points to 23.4% and we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, growing adjusted EPS 5% to $5.67 per share. Then in terms of our full year results, our revenue was $42.9 billion in 2023, adjusted operating income was $9.81 billion and adjusted EPS was $21.55 per share. Last year, we once again delivered meaningful share gain with our industry-leading products, services, and expertise. We leveraged our PPI business system to enable outstanding execution, including aggressively addressing our cost base to effectively navigate a challenging macroeconomic environment.', 'At the same time, we strengthened our long-term competitive position with high-impact innovation, exciting and complementary acquisitions, additional investments in our capabilities, and further strengthening our trusted partner status with our customers. Turning to our performance by end market, in the fourth quarter, underlying market conditions largely played out in line with our expectations. Our continued strong execution resulted in revenue performance that was slightly ahead of our expectations. Now let me provide you some color on our performance in the context of each of our end markets. Starting with pharma and biotech, as expected, growth declined in the high single digits for the quarter and approximately 1% for the full year. In 2023, vaccine and therapy runoff resulted in a seven-point headwind in this customer segment, which was effectively offset through share gains as a result of our trusted partner status.', ""We've made strong progress in transitioning COVID-related capacity to other therapies, and that's very exciting for the future. In academic and government, we grew in the mid-single digits for the quarter and in high-single digits for the full year. In 2023, we delivered strong growth across a range of our businesses, including electron microscopy, chromatography, and mass spectrometry, as well as the research and safety market channel. In industrial and applied, we grew in the low single digits for both the quarter and for the full year. During the year, we delivered very strong growth in our electron microscopy business. And finally, in diagnostics and healthcare, in Q4, revenue declined in the high teens and was 30% lower for the full year."", ""In 2023, we delivered good core business growth in this end market, highlighted by our immunodiagnostics, microbiology and transplant diagnostic businesses. I'll now turn to an update on our growth strategy. As a reminder, our strategy consists of three pillars, high impact innovation, our trusted partner status with customers, and our unparalleled commercial engine. Starting with the first pillar, it was another terrific year of high-impact innovation. Throughout the year, we launched outstanding new products across our businesses that strengthened our industry leadership by enabling our customers to advance their important work. In chromatography and mass spectrometry, the year was highlighted by the launch of the groundbreaking Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Astral Mass Spectrometer, which is helping our customers uncover proteins that were previously undetectable."", ""The scientific breakthrough is enabling customers to advance precision medicine, including the identification of new clinical biomarkers. In the six months since launch, the scientific community's adoption of the product has exceeded our high expectations and the momentum is continuing to build as we enter 2024. In electron microscopy, we launched the Thermo Scientific Metrios 6 S/TEM, a fully automated system that enables our customers to rapidly obtain large volume, high quality data from increasingly complex semiconductors to advanced development. In specialty diagnostics, we launched the first FDA-cleared assays for the risk assessment and clinical management of preeclampsia. This first-of-a-kind diagnostic has received significant attention and adoption as it has significantly raised the standard of care for pregnant women, helping physicians to better manage care by predicting who is most at risk for this condition."", 'In Life Sciences Solutions, we introduced the Gibco CTS Detachable Dynabeads, our next generation Dynabeads platform to accelerate manufacturing of life-changing cell therapies. We continued this great innovation momentum in the fourth quarter. In electron microscopy, we launched the Thermo Scientific Meridian EX System for precise defect localization in advanced logic semiconductors. And in low laboratory products we launched the Thermo Scientific Aquanex Ultrapure Water Purification System for reliable water purity and operational enhancement in laboratories. So another spectacular year of innovation and an exciting pipeline for the future. In 2023, we also continued to strengthen our industry-leading commercial engine and the trusted partner status we have earned with our customers.', 'This included the opening of a state-of-the-art customer center of excellence in Milan to showcase our industry-leading product services and expertise. And during the fourth quarter, we further strengthened our position in advanced materials by opening a customer experience center for battery manufacturing in Seoul to accelerate the development of next generation of environmentally friendly energy solutions. We also made significant advancements in the partnerships and collaborations with our customers throughout the year. Building on our longstanding relationship with Borenger Ingelheim, a great example in the fourth quarter was an exciting opportunity to develop a genomic testing-based companion diagnostic for non-small cell lung cancer patients in Japan and the United States, where lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death.', ""Now let me turn to our PPI business system and our mission driven culture, which continued to enable successful execution during the year. PPI engages and empowers all of our colleagues to find a better way every day. It's helping us to drive share gain, improve quality, productivity, and customer allegiance. I'm proud of the way our team leveraged PPI to step up in an agile way to navigate the dynamic environment last year, driving higher commercial intensity, actively managing our cost base, and optimizing sourcing. We're also leveraging generative AI as part of our PPI business system toolkit to increase productivity, further optimize our commercial effectiveness, and improve the customer experience. A quick recap on capital deployment last year."", 'We continued to successfully execute our disciplined capital deployment strategy, which is a combination of strategic M&A and returning capital to our shareholders. In terms of M&A, we completed our acquisition of the binding site, our protein diagnostics business which enhances our specialty diagnostics offering by advancing the diagnosis and management of patients with multiple myeloma and other immune disorders. The integration has gone smoothly and the business is performing extremely well and tracking ahead of the deal model. As we look to the future of the protein diagnostics business, our launch of EXENT instrument solution represents a significant breakthrough given its enhanced sensitivity, specificity, and ease of use when compared to conventional methods.', ""This is a great complement to our Freelite assays and there's strong interest from the medical community due to the positive impact on diagnosing multiple myeloma patients. In the third quarter, we added CorEvitas, a leading provider of regulatory grade real-world evidence for approved medicines and therapies. CorEvitas is now integrated into our clinical research business, and customers are seeing the benefits of these additional capabilities. The business is off to a great start and performing very well. During the fourth quarter, we announced our intent to acquire Olink, a provider of advanced proteomic solutions that help researchers to gain an understanding of disease at the protein level rapidly and efficiently. As a reminder, Olink Technology compliments our leading mass spectrometry and life science platforms, and we are uniquely positioned to rapidly bring this technology to customers."", ""The transaction is on track to be completed by mid-2024, subject to customary closing additions, including regulatory approvals. In 2023, we also returned $3.5 billion of capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. Let me now give you a brief update on our corporate social responsibility initiatives. As a mission-driven company, we help to make the world a better place by enabling the important work of our customers. We also have a positive impact by supporting our communities and being a good steward of our planet. And I'm proud of the actions we took in 2023 in this regard. Building on the environmental sustainability initiatives, we continue to accelerate our transition to renewable energy with on-site solar projects and power purchase agreements around the world."", ""This progress will help us achieve our recently established target of utilizing 80% renewable electricity globally by 2030. To advance Global Health Equity in the fourth quarter, we announced a partnership with Project HOPE to improve the well-being and treatment outcomes for young people living with HIV in Nigeria, the country with the second largest HIV epidemic worldwide. Throughout the year, Thermo Fisher Scientific was once again recognized for our industry leadership and inclusive culture, where colleagues can have a mission-driven career. To list just a few of the recognitions, we were once again included on Fortune's list of the world's most admired companies, as well as Fortune's inaugural list of most innovative companies. Newsweek named us as one of America's most responsible companies, Forbes included us on its list of the world's top companies for women, and named us as one of the best employers for veterans."", ""As I reflect on the year, I'm very proud of what our team accomplished. Thanks to our incredible colleagues, we successfully navigated the environment, continued to build a bright future for our company. I'm very excited about 2024 and beyond. So let me now turn to guidance. Stephen will outline the assumptions that factor into our 2024 revenue and earnings guidance, but let me quickly cover the highlights. We're initiating a 2024 revenue guidance range of $42.1 billion to $43.3 billion, and an adjusted EPS guidance range of $20.95 to $22 per share. This outlook reflects a continuation of us demonstrating incredibly strong commercial execution and operational discipline and enabling the success of our customers. I've had the opportunity to connect with many of our customers in January to understand what's on their minds."", ""Based on our longstanding relationships, we have terrific access to the senior executive teams of our customers. From these conversations, it's clear to me that our customers value our partnership and see us as essential to enabling their success. They're enthusiastic for the future because of the progress and pipelines to treat disease, and there's also great enthusiasm with material science customers for the important advances made in those fields. All of this will create strong long-term demand for our capabilities as we enable customer scientific breakthroughs, and we continue to be incredibly well-positioned to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner, and safer. So to summarize our key takeaways for 2023, our proven growth strategy continues to drive significant share gain."", ""We continue to elevate our trusted partner status and deepen the relationship with many customers last year. And this in combination with the power of our PPI business system delivered differentiated performance for the quarter and the full year, helping us to effectively navigate a challenging macroeconomic environment. We're well positioned in 2024 to once again deliver differentiated short-term performance and further strengthen our long-term competitive position. With that, I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen."", 'Stephen Williamson: Thanks, Marc and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release we executed really well in Q4. Market conditions played out largely as we had expected in the quarter, and through the great execution, we delivered 1% more core organic revenue growth than our prior guide. In terms of adjusted EPS, we beat our prior guide by $0.05 and that included offsetting $0.08 of additional FX headwind, so really strong operational execution in the quarter. We also capped off the year with very strong free cash flow delivering $7 billion in 2023. Throughout the year we navigated the changing macro environment very effectively. Our proven growth strategy and PPI business system enabled us to deliver a differentiated experience for our customers and differentiated financial results for our shareholders, all the while continuing to invest in the business and advance our strategic position as the world leader in serving science.', 'Let me now provide you some additional details in our performance. Beginning with our earnings results, we delivered $5.67 of adjusted EPS in Q4 and $21.55 for the full year. GAAP EPS in the quarter was $4.20 and $15.45 for the full year. On the top line, reported revenue was 5% lower year-over-year in Q4. The components of our Q4 reported revenue change included 7% lower organic revenue, a 1% contribution from acquisitions, and a tail end of 1% from foreign exchange. Q4 core organic revenue decreased 4%. For the full year 2023 reported and organic revenue decreased 5% and core organic revenue growth for the year was 1%. In 2023, we delivered $1.73 billion of pandemic related revenue, $330 million of testing and $1.4 billion of vaccines and therapies revenue.', 'Turning to our organic revenue performance by geography, the organic growth rates by region are skewed by the pandemic-related revenue in the quarter -- in the current year and prior year. In Q4, North America declined low double digits, Europe declined low single digits, Asia Pacific grew low single digits with China declining in the mid-single digits. For the full year, North America declined high single digits, Europe declined low single digits, and Asia-Pacific declined low single digits with China declining high single digits. With respect to our operational performance, we delivered $2.55 billion of adjusted operating income in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 23.4%, 100 basis points higher than Q4 last year. In the quarter, we continued to deliver exceptionally strong productivity and achieved good price realization, this is partially offset by lower pandemic-related revenue, strategic investments, and FX.', ""The strength of our productivity reflects the impact of our PPI business system. It's enabling us to manage our cost base appropriately given the macro conditions. For the full year, adjusted operating income decreased 11% and adjusted operating margin was 22.9% in line with our prior guide. Total company adjusted gross margin in the quarter came in at 41.5%, 10 basis points higher than Q4 last year. The change in gross margin was due to the same drivers as those of our adjusted operating margin. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 41.2%. Moving on to the details of the P&L, adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 15.1% of revenue, an improvement of 50 basis points over Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 15.2% of revenue, an improvement of 60 basis points compared to 2022."", 'Total R&D expense was $328 million in Q4. For the full year, R&D expense was $1.35 billion, reflecting our ongoing investments in high-impact innovation. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue was 6.8% in 2023. Looking at our results below the line, our Q4 net interest expense was $81 million, which is $38 million lower than Q4 2022. Net interest expense for the full year was $495 million, an increase of $41 million year-over-year. Adjusted other income and expense was a net expense in the quarter of $19 million, $9 million higher than Q4 2022. This is primarily due to changes in non-operating FX. For the full year, adjusted other income and expense was a net expense of $16 million compared to a net income of $14 million in 2022. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter and for the full year was 10%.', 'This was 280 basis points lower than Q4 last year and 300 basis points lower for the full year, reflecting the results of our tax planning activities. Average diluted shares were 388 million in Q4, approximately 5 million lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases net of options. And shortly after the year-end in January 2024, we repurchased $3 billion of shares. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, full year cash flow from operations was $8.4 billion and as I mentioned earlier, free cash flow was $7 billion after investing $1.4 billion of net capital expenditures. We returned $136 million of capital to shareholders through dividends in Q4 and $523 million for the full year. During the year, we invested $3.7 billion on completed acquisitions and committed $3.1 billion to the acquisition of Olink, which we expect to close by mid-2024.', ""We ended the quarter with $8.1 billion in cash and $34.9 billion of total debt. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2 times gross debt to adjusted EBITDA and 2.5 times on a net debt basis. Concluding my comments on our total company performance, adjusted ROIC was 12%, reflecting the strong return on investment that we're generating across the company. Now provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Let me start with a couple of framing comments. The scale and margin profile of our pandemic-related revenue varies by segment, and that revenue was higher in the prior year so that does skew some of the reported segment growth rates and margins. In 2023, we continue to execute strong pricing realization across all segments to address inflation."", 'Moving on to the segment details, starting with Life Sciences Solutions, Q4 reported revenue in this segment declined 19%, and organic revenue was 20% lower than the prior year quarter. This was driven by the runoff of our pandemic-related revenue in this segment as well as lower levels of activity in our bioproduction business versus the year ago quarter. For the full year, reported and organic revenue was 26% lower than 2022. Q4 adjusted operating income for Life Science Solutions decreased 14% and adjusted operating margin was 36.2%, up 210 basis points versus the prior year quarter. During the quarter, we delivered exceptionally strong productivity, which was partially offset by unfavorable volume pull-through. The team has done an excellent job of appropriately managing the cost base and dealing with the unwind of the pandemic.', 'For the full year, adjusted operating income declined 39% and adjusted operating margin was 34.3%. In the Analytical Instruments segments, reported revenue increased 8% in Q4 and organic growth was also 8%. The strong growth in this segment this quarter was led by the electron microscopy business. For the full year, both reported and organic revenue were 10% higher than 2022. In this segment, Q4 adjusted operating income increased 23% and adjusted operating margin was 28.8%, up 340 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity and volume pull-through, which is partially offset by FX and strategic investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 27% and adjusted operating margin was 26.3%, an increase of 350 basis points versus the prior year.', 'Turning to Specialty Diagnostics, in Q4, reported revenue declined 1% and organic revenue was 7% lower than the prior year quarter. In Q4, we continued to see strong underlying growth in the core led by transplant diagnostics, microbiology and immunodiagnostics businesses. This was offset by lower pandemic-related revenue versus the year ago quarter. For the full year, reported revenue declined 8% and organic revenue was down 13%. Q4 adjusted operating income for Specialty Diagnostics increased 27% in the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 23.9%, which is 530 basis points higher than Q4 of 2022. In Q4, we delivered strong productivity and favorable business mix, which was partially offset by the lower -- the impact of lower COVID-19 testing volume and strategic investments.', 'For the full year, adjusted operating income was 10% higher than 2022 and adjusted operating margin was 25.5%, an increase of 400 basis points versus 2022. Finally, in the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, Q4 reported revenue decreased 4% and organic revenue was 5% lower than the prior year quarter. This was driven by the runoff of vaccines and therapies revenue and the phasing of revenue in our Pharma Services business within 2023 as had been expected. For the full year, both reported and organic revenue were 2% higher than 2022. In this segment, Q4 adjusted operating income declined 4% and adjusted operating margin was 14%, which is 10 basis points lower than Q4 2022. In the quarter, we delivered strong productivity, which is more than offset by unfavorable volume mix.', ""For the full year, adjusted operating income was 17% higher than the prior year and adjusted operating margin was 14.6%, an increase of 180 basis points versus 2022. Let me now turn to guidance, and as Marc outlined, we're initiating a 2024 revenue guidance range of $42.1 billion to $43.3 billion and adjusted EPS guidance range of $20.95 to $22. Our guidance assumes core organic revenue growth in the range of minus 1% to positive 1% for 2024. Our view on the expected market conditions in 2024 has not changed significantly from our initial framing for the year shared on the last earnings call. We're assuming that the market declines in the low single digits this year, our growth strategy and PPI Business System execution will enable us to continue to take share once again this year."", 'Our current estimate of pandemic-related revenue in 2024 is just under $100 million of testing revenue and $300 million to $400 million of vaccines and therapies-related revenue. In total, this represents a year-over-year headwind of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion or 3% of revenue. M&A is expected to increase revenue by $175 million year-over-year, the combination of six months of Olink revenue and the inorganic portion of CorEvitas revenue in 2024. At current rates, we expect FX to be neutral year-over-year to both revenue and adjusted EPS. From a phasing standpoint, FX is expected to be a slight headwind in Q1 and an offsetting tailwind in the second half. Turning to margins, our 2024 guidance range assumes adjusted operating income margins between 22.3% and 22.8%.', ""We continue to aggressively manage our cost base, and that's reflected in this margin outlook. In terms of the range for the margins, that's driven by the revenue range that I provided. We'll continue to use the PPI Business System to not only manage costs very carefully, but also continue to make the right long-term investments to enable us to further advance our industry leadership. Strong underlying productivity and cost controls, including the carryover benefit from the cost actions put in place last year, are expected to largely offset the runoff in the remaining pandemic-related revenue inflation and a normalization of incentive compensation across the company to appropriately invest in our colleagues. Below the line, we expect approximately $430 million of net interest expense in 2024 and expect adjusted other income and expense to net close to zero."", ""We assume that adjusted income tax rate will be 10.5% in 2024 and below the tax line, you should factor in $20 million of profit elimination related to minority interests. We're expecting between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion of net capital expenditures in 2024, and we're assuming free cash flow is in the range of $6.5 billion and $7 billion for the year. In terms of capital deployment, our guidance assumes $3 billion of share buybacks, which, as I mentioned earlier, were already completed in January and we estimate the full year average diluted share count will be approximately 383 million shares. We're assuming that we'll return approximately $600 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, and we're assuming that we closed the acquisition of Olink by midyear."", 'And finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing for the year as there are a few things to consider. First, in terms of organic revenue growth we expect Q1 to be better sequentially than Q4 2023 by 1 to 2 points and then improve each quarter during the year. Implied in that is core organic revenue growth in Q1 similar to Q4 2023. And core organic revenue growth is also expected to improve each quarter during the year, leading to moderate growth in the second half of the year. From a margin standpoint, we expect Q1 to be just under 21% and increase each quarter throughout the year from that level. And we expect Q1 adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 22% of the full year. So in conclusion, we navigated the challenging environment in 2023 very successfully.', ""We stepped up for our customers and delivered differentiated financial performance for our shareholders. We continue to manage the company with agility, and we're really well positioned for the year ahead. I look forward to updating you on our progress as we go through the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Raf."", ""Rafael Tejada: Thank you, Stephen.

(Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff Evanson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead."", 'Jeffrey K. Evanson', ""Thanks, Bill. Hello, everyone. I'm Jeff Evenson, Symbotic's VP of Investor Relations. Our press release and discussion today will include forward-looking statements based on assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements, including as the result of factors described in cautionary statements and risk factors in Symbotic's financial release and regulatory filings with the SEC, by which any forward-looking statements made during this call are qualified in their entirety.In addition, during this call, we will discuss certain financial measures that are not recognized under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which the SEC refers to as non-GAAP measures. We believe these non-GAAP measures assist management in planning, forecasting and evaluating our business and financial performance, including allocating resources. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most comparable reported GAAP measures are included in our financial press release, which is available in the Investor Relations section of our website and is on file with the SEC. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to measures used by other issuers.Today, we'll provide guidance for the first quarter, including revenue and adjusted EBITDA. We're not providing guidance for net loss today, which is the most comparable GAAP financial measure to adjusted EBITDA. We are not able to provide reconciliations to adjusted EBITDA to GAAP financial measures because certain items required for such reconciliations are outside our control, and/or cannot be reasonably predicted such as the provision for stock-based compensation.On today's call, we'll be joined by: Rick Cohen, Symbotic's Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol Hibbard, Symbotic's Chief Financial Officer. These executives will discuss our first quarter fiscal '24 results, and our outlook is followed by Q&A.With that, I'll turn it over to Rick. Rick?"", 'Richard B. Cohen', ""Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us to review our most recent results and discuss the year ahead. In our first quarter, we reported strong financial results and posted an equally impressive operational results. Our team set a new deployment record, completing the full build, installation and commissioning process for an entire Symbotic system in only 20 months. While we can't currently deploy all systems this quickly, this reflects the deployment speed improvements we are making, and we are focused on further reductions in deployment time as we build capacity to support growing customer demand. Once such improvement is SymBot.The mobile bot is now well established as our platform workhorse. SymBot has the newest NVIDIA chips with an enhanced version of our automation software that is powered by artificial intelligence. While SymBot can perform more transactions per hour and has improved reliability over our previous generation bot, SymBot will also improve our ability to deploy systems more quickly and efficiently with even higher customer ROI. SymBot also helps to extend the capability of our system and sets the stage for our entry into new markets such as non-ambient food.Turning to BreakPack. Our development of BreakPack progressed faster than expected over this past quarter and has advanced beyond the prototype stage. While we are always refining all our products, BreakPack is now ready for general availability to our full range of potential customers.Turning to our joint venture, GreenBox is receiving a lot of inbound interest. So like Symbotic, GreenBox is being selective in choosing the right customers to work it. GreenBox will share more about their road map when they announce their first customer, but we expect to be recognizing our first revenue from GreenBox in fiscal 2024. So in summary, our story is unchanged. We will continue to innovate, execute and scale to deliver for our customers as we grow and drive increased profitability in a capital-efficient way.Now Carol will discuss our financial results and outlook. Carol?"", 'Carol J. Hibbard', ""Thank you, Rick. I've enjoyed an exciting first 90 days here at Symbotic. During that time, we have enhanced the capability and scope of the entire Symbotic team to scale for the future. For example, we successfully implemented SAP software across the company, which helps with everything from scaling to Sarbanes-Oxley compliance.Our first quarter revenue grew to $369 million, up nearly 80% compared to the same quarter last year, and reflects an accelerated pace of growth from last quarter's 60% year-on-year growth. This was driven primarily by scale and the increasing number of systems we have in deployment. During the first quarter, we initiated 5 new system deployments and completed 3 as we continue to add both new customers and additional projects for existing customers. So at the end of Q1, we had 15 fully operational systems and 37 systems in the process of deployment. This is an increase from 12 operational systems and 35 deployments in progress last quarter; and 8 operational systems and 22 deployments in progress in the first quarter of last year.We have temporarily stabilized the pace of system deployment starts. Our future revenue growth is really driven by our ability to scale deployments and progress. Continued reductions in system deployment time as demonstrated by the system we recently deployed in just 20 months leaves us well positioned to support customer demand. It is important to note that as we scale, our customer base is becoming more diverse. The 37 deployments in progress are with 6 of our 9 customers. We continue to standardize our system platform and identify opportunities to further streamline our deployment processes. To that end, our network of outsourcing partners is executing well. We continue to see significant opportunities to gain efficiencies over time, and to build capacity as we continue to add partners to our outsourcing network.Our backlog remains stable at $23.2 billion and now reflects the addition of Southern Glazers who became a customer in November. Our recurring revenue streams grew 5% sequentially and 45% year-on-year. Adjusting for our 53-week year in 2023, recurring revenue streams reflect nearly a 12% sequential growth, but still below the 25% sequential increase in completed systems, because these systems were completed in the back half of the quarter. So we expect accelerating recurring revenue growth as we head into our second quarter.Gross margin increased sequentially by 90 basis points to 20%, driven primarily by improvement in system gross margin. While we do not expect gross margin to improve every quarter, we do expect it to improve each year well into our future. Our first quarter non-GAAP system gross margin increased 110 basis points from last quarter. As a reminder, these results still reflect significant costs associated with lower margin innovation projects like BreakPack, the burden of pass-through costs that protect gross profit dollars but can weigh on our reported gross margin percentage and costs associated with rapidly scaling our operations.Our recurring revenue streams again contributed to positive gross profit. This demonstrates the high leverage in our business model, showing that we can be profitable with such a small number of active sites with recurring revenue while also being invested for the much larger number of systems still in deployment. We continue to expect that as we scale over time, that recurring gross margins can trend to over 60%.Operating leverage improved again sequentially as we achieved a 3.8% adjusted EBITDA rate compared to a 3.4% rate last quarter. This is driven by our rapid revenue growth and gross margin expansion, along with stable operating expenses. Our cash and equivalents, including marketable securities and restricted cash grew $129 million sequentially, to $677 million. During the quarter, Walmart exercised its last remaining warrants at $10 per share, adding $159 million to our cash balance. Excluding the warrant proceeds, this total would have been $518 million, reflecting a $30 million use of cash in the quarter.As the working capital benefits of 2023 temporarily reset, we expect cash to decline slightly again in the second quarter before we return to working capital expansion in the back half of 2024. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect revenue of $400 million to $420 million and adjusted EBITDA between $12 million and $15 million, which represents revenue growth of over 50% and improved adjusted EBITDA margin of over 700 basis points, both on a year-on-year basis.We now welcome your questions. Operator, please begin the Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) One moment for our first question. Our first question comes from the line of Piyush Avasthy.', 'Piyush Avasthy', ""I think for the second quarter guidance, the implied EBITDA margin is modestly below from what you did in 1Q. Maybe some color on what is impacting margins in this quarter? And taking a step back, I know you don't give full year guidance, but when do you expect a more meaningful sequential improvement in margins?"", 'Carol J. Hibbard', ""Thanks for your question, Piyush. Our guide for the second quarter reflects our flexibility to accommodate increased spending if needed as we need to accelerate deployment schedules and ensure we have a high-quality deployment with as little disruption as possible. Ultimately, the customer satisfaction of that quality system rests on Symbotic; and so, as we continue to ramp, we're going to deploy resources as necessary to ensure we meet that schedule. So that's what we're seeing for the second quarter. And in terms of the longer term profitability, we continue to be on a trajectory to improve, and you're going to see that start to improve in the second half of the year and year-over-year, continued improvement in our profitability."", 'Piyush Avasthy', 'Got it. Helpful. And Rick, I think you talked about BreakPack being available as a stand-alone product now, maybe like talk about the target customers there? And how have the initial conversations been?', 'Richard B. Cohen', ""Yes. So the target customers for a BreakPack operation like that would be -- typically, what you see in BreakPack is, customers that are in the drugstore business, which is obviously a big market. And the original BreakPack that we designed for Walmart was really -- if you think of it, there's 4,500 supercenters and there's 45 drug stores within a Walmart supercenter. So these would be some of the customers that would logically look at a system like this, smaller store formats, smaller customers would be interested in BreakPack, and also people with a long tail of slowmovers that might be interested in shipping [eaches] as opposed to cases. So we think it's a very big customer base. We're not actively selling that BreakPack right now, but we're -- we've finished the prototype. It's no longer a prototype. And so, as we get more and more comfortable with it, we will begin to market it as an add-on product to our basic product."", 'Piyush Avasthy', 'Got it. Very helpful.', 'Operator', 'One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Sparenblek of William Blair.', 'Ross Riley Sparenblek', ""Maybe on the supplier network. I know, you guys noted that you're still adding suppliers. I thought we were kind of through that [dual sourcing] that would then begin to allow you to start alleviating some of the inventory challenges and bringing down those lead times. Can you just provide any update as we think of the timing around that?"", 'Richard B. Cohen', ""Yes, I've spent a lot of time with suppliers. What we're seeing is better inventory, higher quality products coming from our suppliers, which means that we're actually pushing the suppliers to do a lot more testing in their factories as opposed to on sites. And as a result, you'll see the implementation time for our systems faster, which is why we mentioned the fastest that we've done yet. This was completed this past quarter. And when we turned it on, it was above customer expectations for quality. So what we're seeing from suppliers now and what we're working at is the suppliers now understand how real we are. There's a lot of interest from suppliers. They're more price competitive, they're more willing to invest in quality. So I think, we're behind -- we're past the struggles to find good suppliers. And now, we're working with more good suppliers to be higher quality and more competitive.So I think it's -- I think we are in a good place with suppliers now."", 'Carol J. Hibbard', ""Yes. So Ross, I'll just add to that. If you think about 2023, it was really focused on getting those partners. And so, there is probably a more substantial growth in terms of the number. Now we're tweaking because we do need to continue to scale. And as Rick indicated, we now are coming in with a lot greater scale and suppliers are more interested. And so in 2024, as we focus on that, we're also focused with our suppliers on ensuring we're gaining those efficiencies, and we're going to start to see the benefit of that."", 'Ross Riley Sparenblek', 'Okay. Got it. And then maybe just thinking about new customer mix as we move to the year. Can you just maybe help us better understand what steel was? And then also, of the 5 additions, what would have been kind of customers outside of Walmart?', 'Carol J. Hibbard', ""Yes. So, out of our new customers. So, as we indicated, we had 5 new systems in this quarter, one of those was Southern Glazers. So we announced in November, we had the addition of Southern Glazers. So that's our new customer out of that mix of 5, the other 4 were additional statements of work for existing customers. I think, that was your first question on the new customer mix.Ross, can you go? You had another part to that. Can you?"", 'Ross Riley Sparenblek', ""Yes. Just understanding what the steel impact was. I know it's been pretty variable quarter-to-quarter here."", 'Carol J. Hibbard', ""Yes. So, in our contracts, we have pass through clauses that help us see that fluctuation of steel. We actually saw the benefit for steel fluctuation early in the year. Now, we're looking at headwinds as we head into 2024 and seeing that fluctuate. But I will emphasize, our contract structure allows us to have some of those costs as pass through. But we continue to monitor that and ensure that we're getting out ahead of it."", 'Ross Riley Sparenblek', 'Got it. So maybe just real quick, if we think about the 90 basis points of sequential margin expansion, was steel maybe half of that?', 'Carol J. Hibbard', 'No, steel would not have been that big of a contribute to that margin expansion. Yes.', 'Operator', 'One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville of D.A. Davidson.', 'Matt J. Summerville', 'A couple of questions. I was wondering if you could maybe take a second, back to some of your prepared remarks just regarding SymBot. Can you maybe review with us some of the KPIs, if you will, around SymBot versus prior -- the next closest prior generation? Trying to get an understanding for -- you mentioned more transactions an hour. If you can kind of put some numbers around how SymBot is differentiated versus your legacy gen robots.', 'Richard B. Cohen', ""So the first thing that we did with SymBot is it can actually -- and this may be one of the most important things, it can actually handle a tapered box and our original bot could not do that. So that was one of the first things that forced us to relook at long-term flexibility of a SymBot. So that part didn't actually help us go faster, but it gave us a much bigger universe of products that we could handle. Most of our competitors might do trays or something else. So we have a lot more flexibility on what size and shape of packages we can handle.The second thing that SymBot did over what we call [Botx] was that it has vision. And in order to put in vision, we needed graphic interfaces, and so we upgrade it to NVIDIA chips and their vision and graphic interface boards. And so, that allows us to actually see boxes that in the past, we couldn't see.Third thing is, we can pick and place packages 10 seconds faster than we could with the original bot, so those are some of the other things that we did.And then the last thing is, that we can now actually on this bot, pick up -- on inbound, we always were able to bundle and deliver 2 or 3 cases at a time. Now for the first time on outbound, we can handle more than 1 bot at a time. So I won't give you a lot of numbers because some of the stuff is still proprietary. But you get a sense this bot is -- I would say the upgrade for this bot would be from a motorcycle to an SUV."", 'Matt J. Summerville', ""Super helpful there. And then as my follow-up, you kind of -- talking about BreakPack generally available, not really actively selling it yet. I'll ask same question along the lines of GreenBox. Do you expect the BreakPack to start to contribute to revenue in fiscal '24? And then, when do you see Symbotic starting to attack the non-ambient market per one of your other prepared remarks?"", 'Richard B. Cohen', ""Yes. So it -- BreakPack may have impact in 2024 right at the end of the year. So in the last quarter, if it does, because of just the cycle of selling. And -- so that would be one. Ambient, we're actually piloting some perishable testing in a perishable warehouse as we speak. So I think that could be I would say, it -- probably not this year, but I would say, 12 months from now, just from the cycle. But we will be able to offer perishables and then after that would be frozen. But the first go around would be stuff like dairy, produce and meat, which is around 32 degrees. And then after that, we would develop a system for minus 20."", 'Carol J. Hibbard', ""And then, Matt, I'll just add to that. BreakPack, our proof of concept is already contributing to revenue this year and has been over the past year. And so, our prototype that we have in flow is already a revenue contributor. Now in terms of what we're able to add to that as we continue to offer it, you'll see that grow as we expand that at the end of 24."", 'Matt J. Summerville', 'Yes. Understood. I was aware of that. But thanks for clarifying. I should have stated a little differently.', 'Operator', 'One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs.', 'Mark Trevor Delaney', ""If I heard correctly, Carol, you mentioned stabilizing temporarily the number of system starts. And if I heard that correctly, I'm hoping to better understand the thought process and how you're thinking about managing the company operationally, especially with the company adding more outsourcing and manufacturing partners, I would have thought there had been some potential to increase the number of starts the company was doing?"", 'Carol J. Hibbard', ""Yes. And you'll see that -- thanks for the question, Mark. You'll see that by stabilizing, so last quarter, we introduced 4 new systems into the quarter. This quarter, you're seeing 5. By stabilizing, we're indicated don't expect that to continue to grow to 6 to 7 to 8 every single quarter, but we will see improved number of systems as we grow over the next couple of years.When you think about what we already have in our backlog, the other comment related to that stabilizing is you're going to start seeing us delivering on our systems with the backlog that we currently have. And so, we're going to continue to ramp the number of systems that we turn operational every quarter. And then the number that we continue to add from either new customers expect a new customer, 1 to 2 every year, as we've indicated in the past, there's really no change to that.And then as we expand into GreenBox into '24 and '25, I think that's when you'll really start seeing the additional ramp."", 'Mark Trevor Delaney', ""Understood. That's very helpful context. And then, in the first question about the EBITDA guidance. You mentioned the guidance assuming the ability and flexibility to deploy resources to support customers. Just to better understand what you meant by that? And is there something with some of the more recent projects that's been more difficult, or are you more alluding to? You're supporting some newer customers and just wanting to make sure you have the capability to support them in the event that is necessary? Thank you."", 'Carol J. Hibbard', ""Yes, thanks for the follow up. So in terms of our guide, when we talk about wanting the ability to deploy on schedule, as we are now in the stage where we have 37 different projects in deployment. So that's up from 22 a year ago. And so we are scaling right now. And what we want to make sure, we do is that we adhere to schedule and that we're able to deliver that high quality. So if that means providing a few additional resources or taking a week or 2 longer to go ahead and deliver, that's what you're going to see in some of what I'll call the lumpiness in the next quarter around both revenue and in our margin."", 'Mark Trevor Delaney', 'Okay.', 'Carol J. Hibbard', ""We don't want to do anything short sighted to save a few points on margin that will help us in the long term."", 'Mark Trevor Delaney', 'Understood.', 'Operator', 'One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank.', 'Nicole Sheree DeBlase', ""Yes. Maybe just starting with R&D. It's been on a bit of a declining path for the past few quarters. I guess, why is that? And then what is the outlook for R&D expense over the next several quarters?"", 'Carol J. Hibbard', ""Thanks, Nicole. So on R&D, I think what you're seeing from when you compare fourth quarter to first quarter is that additional week that we talked about. So in the fourth quarter last year, we had a 14-week quarter versus a 13-week quarter. So we had an extra week contributing to R&D. So that's a little bit of the fluctuation from fourth quarter to first quarter.I would expect our R&D to continue to ramp modestly throughout the course of the year. But what we do want to make sure we do is we're looking at multiple innovation projects. And so, we want to maintain the ability to ramp our R&D if those innovation projects come to light, and we want to expand that at the back half of the year. So I'd expect moderate growth. But we are looking at projects that not only drive innovation, but we're also looking at projects that drive improved efficiency that would help improve our cost structure, as well as the operational efficiency on the end customer for the systems that we deploy."", 'Nicole Sheree DeBlase', ""Got it. Okay. That's really helpful. And then when you spoke about getting to 1 deployment in the 20-month zone, I guess, what would be the long term goal of the length of deployment, once you feel good about the whole process."", 'Carol J. Hibbard', ""So I'll start, and then Rick can chime in, in terms of long term vision, as we've talked about in the past, we expect that 20-month cycle over the long term to get down to 12 months or lower. So we've talked about the things that we need to put in place to be able to go do that. So that's from a long term perspective.I think one of the other things to think through is what really enabled that 20 months, that might be one of the questions so that we can make sure we're looking at, how do you enable that going down to 18 months and then to 16 months. So a couple of things enabled us hitting that achievement this quarter. One was we now have continuous learning over multiple deployments. So our outsourcing partners, they've now got multiple deployments under their belt and they're improving on each one.We've also got increased collaboration from our entire deployment team. So our deployment team includes Symbotic resources, our suppliers, as well as our customer. And we've really seen an increase in that collaboration over the past quarter. And then, the last one is the quality and standardization of what I'll call the build. So our build instructions, our test procedures, we're standardizing that more and more from deployment to deployment, and that's really enabling the improvement from our partners."", 'Operator', 'One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder of UBS.', 'Christopher M. Snyder', ""I wanted to follow up on the communication earlier around accelerating or picking up growth investment to drive or to help facilitate the accelerated growth. And when we look at OpEx over the last 4 quarters, OpEx has generally been sideways and the number of projects in process and their revenue has gone up 40%. So I guess, is there something that's happening now that's causing the OpEx needing to pick up into Q2? Because we've seen so much growth already without that. So kind of, I guess the question is, why now?"", 'Carol J. Hibbard', ""Yes. We continue to modulate our OpEx because we're getting better on that spend. But I think you're going to see the improvement on that is where we'll continue to grow OpEx, but it's not going to grow nearly at the same level of our revenue because we're also getting improvements on our spending as we do that. Okay. Fair enough. And then I wanted to talk about or follow up on about the non-ambient food opportunity. Specifically, if we think about the existing customers that the company has, is there any way to frame the size of the opportunity from non-ambient food with those existing customers? And then also when you see the Walmart backlog, does that include any revenue for systems related to non-ambient food?"", 'Richard B. Cohen', ""The Walmart backlog does not include any systems that are non-ambient. So obviously -- and none of our other customers, whether it's C&S or UNFI, also, there's no -- we weren't selling non-ambient. But in the future, we'll be able to -- and we think that's a big market. It's a slightly different market because this is a market and where we're focused on ambient, we're really focusing on one, we can obviously build pallets. But building in a perishable warehouse, the space is just so expensive. We're actually working on increasing the density of our system, which may help us across a number of areas. But it's -- I can't give you a number for the market, but it's a big market."", 'Operator', 'One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Ricchiuti of Needham & Company.', 'James Andrew Ricchiuti', 'Rick, a question just on BreakPack. You alluded to the drugstore business. How important is it to you to get a use case outside of your large customer for BreakPack in a market like that?', 'Richard B. Cohen', ""It would be great. I mean, we're -- that's one of the things that I spend a lot of time on is figuring out who are the best use cases, who are the larger go customers for what we're doing. And one of the things that we find -- and we've been pretty busy, so we haven't been doing a tremendous amount of marketing because we're very focused on delivering for the customers we have in place.But one of the things that we do when we bring a new customer to the market to see a site is many times their responses, I didn't even know this was possible. So that's why we're very, very focused on delivering on time, delivering with a braggingly happy customer expectation, and we're going to focus on that for the rest of this year. And as we get better, then we'll have braggingly happy customers. And then the stuff that we're doing, the people said, I've never seen this before, gives us instant credibility and I think makes it very easy for us to expand our market."", 'James Andrew Ricchiuti', ""Okay. The follow up question, is just going back to that 20-month deployment that you achieved. As you bring on more partners, outsourcing partners, it sounds as though there could be some fits and [darts] and that we're going to see this move around. It's not going to be tell me if we're going to see consistent progress on this front. It just seems like as you bring on new partners, it's going to bounce around a bit."", 'Richard B. Cohen', ""No, we don't think that's going to happen. We are now -- when we started the outsourcing process, I think our team was smart enough to say, if there's a better way to do this, then show us. What we've been doing for the last year now is we're asking people to build-to-print is what is the expression they use so you don't change our design. If you want to talk about an improvement that may happen a year from now, but we're really working very hard to standardize our design, which speeds up the implementation, which simplifies the programming. The programmable logic, they call PLC code that goes into our machines. So the ability to replicate what we do at the very highest level is what we're focused on. So, no, I don't think you will see. I mean, I think, we had a lot of learning last year, and I think we talked about that openly. I don't think you're going to see that again in the future."", 'Operator', 'One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Newman of KeyBanc Capital Market.', 'Ken Newman', 'Carol, curious if you could just dig down into the comment about the increased spending to service, the higher growth in the second quarter. I mean when you think about that, is the biggest bottleneck there to service those deployments? Is that just in-house engineers? Is it the third-party supplier base? Just any color there to kind of help us bucket that headwind?', 'Carol J. Hibbard', ""Yes, it's a mix. Thanks, Ken. It's a mix of -- I wouldn't say it's mostly engineering because our engineering folks are focused on the R&D part of the business and less of that goes into our COGS. But it's the operators, and it's the folks we're putting on site for that final stage of commissioning and deployment to ensure we're hitting the reliability. And that includes some of our outsourced you referred to it as suppliers. So that would be their spend as well."", 'Ken Newman', ""Okay. And then, of course, I just wanted to get a little bit more color. I think, you'd mentioned working capital expansion in the second half. Obviously, we saw a big ramp in accounts receivable and maybe prepaid expenses this quarter. I'm guessing that's from Southern Glazier. But just any color on what drives the working cap expansion to the second half and just how confident you are about top cash or free cash getting better into the back half of this year?"", 'Carol J. Hibbard', ""Yes. So as most of you know, over the course of our deployment, our cash inflows tend to be very front-loaded. And so that's driven our favorable cash flow as we've ramped. But then in any particular quarter, depending on the maturity of that particular deployment, we might see a higher cash outflow. So as we're ramping to having 37 different deployments in flow now as we're heading into this quarter, we're going to see higher cash outflow in the second quarter similar to the first quarter. What we're expecting for the year, excluding the warrant exercise, I'd expect our cash to be flat."", 'Operator', 'One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano of TD Cowen.', 'Joseph Craig Giordano', 'Can you hear me? My phone seems to break up a second there.', 'Carol J. Hibbard', 'Yes, we can hear you, Joe.', 'Joseph Craig Giordano', ""Okay. Great. So I preface this by saying it's a high class problem, and you guys delivered revenue at the high end, basically, of what you said you would. But to be fair, it's the first time you haven't pretty easily gone considerably ahead of the high end. Now I just want to like -- it's a little bit of a tough question, Carol. I know you just -- you haven't been there for those prior quarters, but is it -- was there a need to be more conservative with guiding back then because you had fewer projects under -- that were in deployment and was more variable by nature, and now you have more kind of precision around a guide? I guess, you have more projects to limit the inherent volatility there?"", 'Carol J. Hibbard', ""Yes, you're exactly right, Joe. So as we scale and we have more and more systems in progress, the variance on a single project, we're not going to see that have as much contribution to an individual quarter's revenue. So before we had fewer projects, if you had one project either complete a month early or complete a month late or even a week here and there, it was really driving the variation in the revenue.And as I indicated just in the opening remarks as well, we've deployed SAP and some of the controls we're putting in place should help us standardize and drive our ability to tighten up that prediction range."", 'Joseph Craig Giordano', ""Okay. That's kind of what I figured. And your commentary suggested that you put in 5 into production this quarter. It sounds like it will be, give or take, that level for a bit here. I know like if you models have that ramping pretty large at some point. We could debate exactly when that starts. But I just want to make sure I understand like what is -- is there anything that's specifically not allowing that amount to be significantly higher right now? Or is it just subject to like the scheduling of your large customers? Like if your customers wanted that to be 15 next year, is that like theoretically possible right now?"", 'Carol J. Hibbard', ""So I'd say you're bot on our ramping of additional customers. We've indicated 1 to 2 a year, and that is metered by our ability to want to provide excellent customer service and satisfaction to the backlog that we have. And so, we don't want to continue to take on more and more statements of work and additional customers and not have the ability to deliver on the $23 billion backlog that we have."", 'Joseph Craig Giordano', ""Okay. And then one for Rick, if I can. Rick, going through the SymBot characteristics there. I'm just curious like when you now have the ability to handle multiple bots at one time on the outbound, like does this ultimately allow you to accomplish the system with fewer bots? And is that kind of going to be somewhat required as you move into non-ambient where, like, as you said, the facilities are smaller and you probably need to get like more bang for your buck from a square footage standpoint. And does that -- that whole dynamic lead to like any sort of difference in margins that you think you'd be able to get? Or is it better or worse equal versus what you've been doing on -- at scale?"", 'Richard B. Cohen', ""Yes. So I can honestly say everything we're doing is trying to increase our margins. We're not doing anything constantly to decrease them. But seriously, the journey that we're on with the SymBot, we expect that we will be able to run systems with less bots because they will be more capable, faster, be able to do more work. And that's the journey that we're on, and that will only increase margin.The other thing that, that will do is it would allow us to do a smaller system because we could sell -- we could use less bots because they're more capable. So that would allow us to, on the low end, hit a new price point, which is one of the things that I'm very focused on. I love having these big customers and I love having these big sales. But if we could sell a smaller system with a lower price point and still increase our margins, that's an even bigger market than we're talking about right now."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Greg Palm of Craig-Hallum.', 'Gregory William Palm', ""I think I heard my name, but something cut out. In terms of GreenBox, I was hoping to dig into a little bit more on the deployment schedule. Rick, I think you said deployments or maybe initial rev rec in fiscal '24. So I'd like you to confirm that, if possible. But how do you think about the ramp-up of deployments specific to Green Box? And just in terms of aggressiveness, is it dependent on customer announcements or sign-ons or how you're thinking about that over the coming years?"", 'Richard B. Cohen', ""I think we -- well, the answer, they're in parts. So we've been talking to some large customers and large suppliers about the opportunity. And so I think what will happen is that GreenBox will start off slowly and then go very fast. So there's a proving out concept where if we build a GreenBox site and we have multiple vendors in that site, and they test it, and logically, they're going to say, okay, I want 10 of these sites around the country because I need to cover a national network. So I think what we're doing is doing all of them work, putting in the foundation for GreenBox. And I think we'll -- we expect to have some good news on GreenBox in 2024, but we're also doing a lot of diligence to make sure that we set the foundation correctly."", 'Gregory William Palm', ""Okay. And just to be clear, you expect deployments or rev rec to start in this fiscal '24. Is that right?"", 'Richard B. Cohen', 'Yes.', 'Gregory William Palm', ""Okay. And just from a follow-up question on the pace of deployments in general, obviously, a lot of progress over the last your source -- since the outsourcing strategy ramp-up. But kind of as we sit here today, is there any constraints to not maintaining that current pace, but accelerating it further, whether it's bringing on additional partners, whether it's continuing to kind of reduce that time line per deployment. Just trying to get a sense if anything has changed internally where you're not trying to further accelerate deployments from current levels. I just want to make sure we're all kind of clear on what's changing, if anything, here?"", 'Richard B. Cohen', ""So I'll take this one. So the deployments we're doing now in this quarter were actually started a year ago. What we know a year later, which is now from where we were a year ago, we can go faster, we can go a lot faster."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Derek Soderberg of Cantor Fitzgerald.', 'Derek John Soderberg', ""Just sort of piggybacking off the last question, just around turning on the live systems with deployment time lines where they're at, it sounds like around 20 months or so. I think 1.5 years ago, you were at 13 systems in progress, a year ago, 22. I guess I'm wondering if you think you can bring maybe those 13 systems to live operation this year, maybe less. Can you share what expectations you have on the number of systems you think you can turn on this year?"", 'Carol J. Hibbard', ""Yes. So we typically don't guide on the number of systems we've got in deployment. But as was pointed out, we had gone quarter-over-quarter for 4 quarters in a row where we were deploying 1 system a quarter. We accelerated that to 2 last quarter, and now you saw that accelerate to redeployed 3 this quarter. I would expect to see continue to improve that throughout -- continued improvement on that throughout the year. And as you said, that 20-month deployment. But what we also pointed out is that 20-month deployment, that's for what I'll call an average system. So there will be variability, not every system we'll deploy in 20 months depending on the size of the system. We have some systems that we're implementing, which will be significantly larger, and those will take additional time to go ahead and deploy. But overall, the average, we're looking to continue to reduce that time of deployment, and that does enable clearly the ramp of how many we deploy in a given quarter."", 'Derek John Soderberg', ""And then as my follow-up, just trying to work out some of the math on the recurring revenue. I'm wondering how we should think about the recurring fee from a percentage standpoint? And is that moving higher as new systems are turning online? And should we really think about recurring revenue to more or less grow at a similar rate as these live systems come online?"", 'Carol J. Hibbard', ""Yes. And so the recurring revenue stream, and I'll start with software. So you saw our second profitable quarter 430 bps up from where we were. So in terms of profitability, we're seeing progressive improvement to the software margin. From a recurring revenue perspective, when you look fourth quarter to first quarter, you're not seeing as big of a ramp. Those 3 systems that we brought on live, hit live in the last month of the quarter. And so you're really going to see a much steeper ramp on that recurring revenue. It was a -- we had -- we went from 12 systems in deployment to 15 in deployment, but those last 3 happened in December. So we didn't see the real benefit. So I think you're going to continue to see that revenue grow.But in terms of your question on the attach rate, we still have, I'd say, 1/3 of the 15 systems that we've got deployed are really early proof-of-concept systems where our attach rates were significantly lower. So you're seeing the impact of that. New customers that we're signing on, we're looking to improve that recurring attach rate, as we have talked about in the past."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Rob Mason of Baird.', 'Robert W. Mason', ""Just to circle back to GreenBox a moment. There were some costs, it looked like in the quarter, small costs just related to the JV formation. I'm just curious how you expect those in the call on cash to trend through this year. And if, Rick, you could speak to any major milestones as we work towards their first customer announcements, I guess, maybe just structurally internally at GreenBox major milestones that still need to happen just in the formation of that entity."", 'Carol J. Hibbard', ""Yes. So Rob, I'll take the first part of that question that additional small amount of joint venture fees that is trailing costs associated with all the work we did last year. So you should not expect to see that continue. That was a one-off trailing expense from last quarter. So your second part in terms of GreenBox, as we've indicated, we expect our first customer this year. And we've got a lot of inbound as Rick addressed and we're on the trajectory we had planned for GreenBox. I don't know if that answered the second part of your question, Rob or not."", 'Robert W. Mason', ""I mean, can you -- is the management in place? Or again, I'm just trying to think is that, that comes to be, what are the other milestones that we're looking forward to there?"", 'Richard B. Cohen', ""Yes. So the management is -- we're recruiting, we're interviewing management to put that in place. But there's also -- from the outside, they may have different skills than we have, whether it's at SoftBank or Symbotic, but right now, we have between the SoftBank talent team and what we're doing at Symbotic we can actually sell systems into GreenBox, but we expect to expand the management team over the next period of time fairly quickly to build a bigger sales force at GreenBox. And so that's the process that we're on."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jeff Evanson for any closing remarks."", 'Jeffrey K. Evanson', 'Thank you, Val, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call tonight. We appreciate your interest in Symbotic. We look forward to seeing many of you at investor conferences, our warehouse tours or when we talk next quarter. Have a great night.', 'Operator', ""Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.""]"

The global bath towel industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4.41% and reach $14.92 billion by 2030. Bath towels are one of the most essential consumer goods used daily in almost every household. Qualities including absorbability, durability, ease of use, and drying capability, add value to a towel and make it preferable over other alternative products. The demand for bath towels and the overall growth of this industry are tied to other markets, including personal care, fitness clubs, hotels, hospitals, and spas. Moreover, the growing trend of home swimming pools and consumer demand for luxury spa experiences has also contributed to the rising demand for more absorbent high-quality towels.', 'The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic had both negative and positive impacts on the global bath towel industry. The production almost came to a halt due to factors including lockdowns, travel restrictions, disrupted supply chains, and barriers in raw material procurement However, rising awareness regarding personal hygiene during and after the pandemic boosted the demand for towels, particularly for residential use. Moreover, the shutdown of physical stores during COVID-19 led companies to emphasize on online marketing and social media presence, thus contributing to resilient sales both during and after the pandemic.', 'Growing demand for high-quality towels from end markets such as hotels and spas is propelling the growth of the industry. Moreover, consumer demand is shifting towards more durable and less maintenance towels, especially in the hospitality and hotel industry, as they require products that can be reused and can withstand frequent laundry without compromising the quality.\xa0', 'International hotels and spas are also proponents of sustainability and demand commodities that align with their corporate social responsibility goals. Thus, towels made from organic materials, including bamboo, cotton, and recycled materials, are gaining popularity. Another notable trend in the global bath towel industry is the growing consumer demand for towels with customized monograms that add a personal touch to their bathroom décor.\xa0', 'The bath towel industry is segmented based on the raw material used for its production. The major segments of the industry include cotton, bamboo, and microfibers. It is worth mentioning that cotton towels hold the majority share in the market. According to Fortune Business Insights, cotton towels held a market share of approximately 47% in 2022. Moreover, as the market trend is shifting towards sustainability, the bamboo towel segment is expected to grow at the fastest CAGR compared to other segments from 2023 to 2030. Towels made from bamboo are gaining popularity not only because of their eco-friendly nature, but also due to their antimicrobial properties that help to keep bacteria and odor away.

Now please turn to Slide 4, and I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Matthew Pine."", 'Matthew Francis Pine', ""Thanks, Andrea. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. It's a pleasure to share the Xylem team's exceptional performance in the fourth quarter of a transformational year for the enterprise. The team delivered both Q4 and full year results exceeding expectations on revenue and earnings per share. Looking at the fourth quarter, strong demand drove organic revenue growth of 9%. With disciplined execution, delivering EBITDA margin expansion of 90 basis points, that drove double-digit orders growth, and our backlog is now more than $5 billion. Our Q4 performance capped off a year in which the team overdelivered in every quarter. Full year organic revenues were up 12% with EBITDA margin expansion of 190 basis points and adjusted earnings per share growth of 20%. The team even delivered Evoqua run rate cost synergies in 2023 ahead of plan. Both the quarter and the full year give us very strong momentum entering 2024. Despite a dynamic environment and the excitement of our combination with Evoqua, the team stayed focused on serving our customers. Joining forces with Evoqua has put the sector's most advanced portfolio of capabilities in the hands of our customers and opened up new opportunities to address even more of their water challenges. In our last earnings call, we shared a bit about the synergy traction we're seeing between the legacy Evoqua services business and Xylem's dewatering business. And since then, we've seen the momentum continue to build as the team wins in the marketplace with our combined offering. On January 1, we made it even easier for our customers to access the full breadth of our capabilities with the creation of the Water Solutions and Services segment, effectively combining Xylem and Evoqua services offerings in a realigned segment structure. The move supports the continuing growth of our services business and expansion of recurring revenues. And to put Xylem in an even stronger position to capture value by serving industrial water customers who are increasingly outsourcing water management as water stresses intensify. Looking forward, we are starting off strong in 2024 with the momentum from our outperformance in '23, and continued healthy demand in our major end markets. Though we're keeping a close eye on demand dynamics in China and are taking a prudent view of end markets for Applied Water, which is our most cyclical segment, our backlog across the business is a source of continuing strength, especially in M&CS. We also feel very confident in our ability to drive continuing margin expansion by focusing our energy on the parts of the business delivering the greatest value. Overall, we're well positioned for profitable and sustainable growth. We expect 2024 organic revenues to be up 3% to 5% with solid EBITDA margin expansion, resulting in earnings per share between $4 and $4.20. I'll now turn it over to Bill to walk through the quarter's results and our outlook for 2024 in more detail."", 'William K. Grogan', ""Thanks, Matthew. Please turn to Slide 5. As Matthew mentioned, we are pleased with the strong finish to 2023. The team has stayed focused and consistently we delivered throughout the year, exceeding our expectations on revenue and earnings per share for Q4 and the full year. We continue to see resilient demand and are supported by our $5.1 billion backlog, which grew 5% organically for the year. Organic orders grew 10% in the quarter, with book-to-bill approximately 1 for the quarter and greater than 1 for the full year. Total revenues grew 41%, while organic revenues rose 9%, exceeding our guidance of 4% to 5%. Our performance was led by M&CS and water infrastructure. All regions grew, led by double-digit growth in the U.S. EBITDA margin was 19.6%, up 90 basis points from the prior year. With productivity savings, price and higher volume more than offsetting inflation, this reflects 33% incrementals on the legacy Xylem performance. We finished the year with EBITDA margin of 18.9%, up nearly 200 basis points over prior year. Our EPS in the quarter was $0.99, above the high end of our guide by $0.03. When excluding the impact of Evoqua, EPS was $1.10, up 10% over prior year. Our financial position remains robust with over $1 billion in cash and available liquidity of approximately $2 billion. We ended the year with adjusted free cash flow conversion of 122%, exceeding our expectations and significantly improved versus last year. Please turn to Slide 6. Before I highlight each segment's fourth quarter performance, I want to touch on some changes you'll see in our earnings materials going forward. In the spirit of 80/20, we have simplified our earnings materials to focus on what is most important for investors. To insist with the transition this quarter, we have provided our historical presentation format in the appendix. And now on to the segment performance. Measurement and Control Solutions saw robust orders growth of 14%, with strength across the portfolio, led by metrology and assessment services. Backlog is $2.3 billion and book-to-bill is above 1, a reflection of the strong demand for our AMI solutions and other digital offerings. M&CS revenue was up 21%, driven by metrology backlog execution and strong demand. We finished the quarter with improved EBITDA margins of 17.3%, up 220 basis points versus the prior year and up 160 basis points sequentially on productivity, price and higher volumes. Water Infrastructure also saw orders growth of 9% for the quarter, with strength across the portfolio led by robust treatment demand globally. Revenue exceeded our expectations with total growth of 30% and organic growth of 9%, driven by robust OpEx demand across all regions. EBITDA margin for the segment was down 90 basis points, driven by the impacts of legacy Evoqua. When excluding the impact of Evoqua, EBITDA margin was up 50 basis points primarily due to price, productivity and volume more than offsetting inflation and unfavorable mix. In Applied Water, although orders grew, book-to-bill was 0.9x, as we continue to work down our backlog, and we saw softer demand environment in the U.S., our largest geography. Revenues were flat, in line with our guide with the decline in developed markets offset slightly offset slightly by growth in emerging markets. Segment EBITDA margin expanded 80 basis points with productivity and price more than offsetting inflation and volume declines. Integrated Solutions & Services, orders grew 5% on a pro forma basis, and book-to-bill was 1. Demand was driven by services. Pro forma revenue growth of 10% exceeded our expectations as implied in our reported guidance with healthy growth across the portfolio. Adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at 21.1% driven by price realization and volume. Please turn to Slide 7. I will cover our segment outlook for the year. As Matthew mentioned, in December, we announced the creation of Water Solutions and Services segment. We are providing organic revenue guidance based on our previous reporting segments. Later this month, we will provide recast financial information aligned to the new segments. However, we expect the segment guidance outlook to largely be in line with the new segment structure and we'll update as needed in our Q1 earnings call. In M&CS, we expected growth of low teens. Demand and order momentum for our AMI solutions remains strong. We expect to see sequential revenue improvement throughout 2024 supported by a robust backlog. In Water Infrastructure, we expect growth of mid-single digits. We expect resilient OpEx demand due to mission-critical nature of our applications and a healthy CapEx demand. We are continuing to closely monitor softness in China where the majority of our business is in the utility end market. In Applied Water, we expect a modest decline of low single digits. We continue to see pockets of softness across our end markets, particularly in developed markets, which make up about 80% of our business. We also expect to see headwinds as we lap price increases and our backlog returns to more historic levels. ISS growth is expected to be mid-single digits with growth across both capital and services. We continue to see strong activity in our funnel particularly in high-growth verticals such as food and beverage, energy and life sciences. This segment is supported by $1 billion in backlog and a durable service business model. And as a reminder, the ISS growth outlook is on an organic basis. Now let's turn to Slide 8 for our 2024 and Q1 guidance. The growth outlook by segment translates to 2024 full revenue of $8.4 billion to $8.5 billion, resulting in total revenue growth of 14% to 15% and organic revenue growth of 3% to 5%. EBITDA margin is expected to be 19.4% to 19.9%. This represents 50 to 100 basis points of expansion versus the prior year, driven by higher volume, productivity and price offsetting inflation. This yields an EPS range of $4 to $4.20, up 8% at the midpoint over prior year. We are expecting approximately $100 million of exit run rate cost synergies in 2024, which is embedded in our guide. Free cash flow conversion for the year is expected to be 115% of net income. Drilling down on the first quarter. We anticipate total revenue growth will be in the 36% to 38% range on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically. We expect first quarter EBITDA margin to be approximately 18%, up 170 basis points, driven by higher volumes, continued price realization and productivity gains. This yields first quarter EPS of $0.80 to $0.85. We are entering the year with momentum and from a position of strength. Our balanced outlook reflects our strong commercial position and the durability of our portfolio. While we also continue to monitor broader market conditions, particularly in China and Applied Water, which is our shortest-cycle business. In the case of larger-than-expected volume declines, we're ready to take additional cost actions as needed to ensure continued focus on margin expansion. Overall, our expectations for the year remain positive as we build on our strong momentum. With that, please turn to Slide 9, and I'll turn the call back over to Matthew for closing comments."", 'Matthew Francis Pine', ""Thanks, Bill. It's been incredibly exciting to step up as CEO at a time of such great momentum and opportunity for Xylem. I began the year by spending time with customers and colleagues in India and the Middle East. Bill and I started off in India, and the scale of ambition there, to modernize infrastructure and tackle the big water challenges is frankly awe inspiring. We have an outstanding team there, doing great work to serve customers from our localized R&D and manufacturing platform that gives us a real competitive advantage. And both India and the Middle East provide great reminders of the fundamental interconnectedness of economic value and social value creation in our business. These markets present the expanse of commercial opportunity. In both markets, every project improves lives and increases the sustainability of communities. We took some time out with colleagues in India to visit a school in a rural area outside of Bangalore. We got hands on building a small-scale water treatment system that now provides clean drinking water to those students and their community. I'll be honest, the experience of celebrating with those kids and their teachers as the clean water started to flow, well, it's just hard to describe. And you also know that the impact on educational outcomes, health and quality of life is likely to be profound. That experience drove home for me not just the importance of what Xylem does but it reinforced the focus we're bringing into 2024. Whether at the scale of a school or the scale of a mega city, we have to make it easier for customers and communities to solve their big water challenges. Reducing the complexity of water solutions, that is our focus, simplifying water. We have assembled the most advanced and most comprehensive portfolio of products, solutions and services in this sector. The value creation opportunity in front of us is to make all that capability far easier for customers to access, to empower them to solve their most critical water challenges and deliver great outcomes with far less complexity. We started the year with great pace with strong execution off the back of a great Q4 in 2023 across both legacy Xylem and legacy Evoqua businesses. And our integration is well on track to deliver on the full value creation opportunity of the combination. Our end markets are resilient, and as long as the long-term trends in water continue to intensify, our team is energized to take all of our capabilities to deliver even greater impact for our customers. Our investment thesis remains robust, and we continue to execute on the strategy that has positioned us so strongly for further economic and social value creation. We look forward to sharing further insights into our priorities and strategic direction at our upcoming Investor Day on May 30 in Washington, D.C., when I hope many of you will join us. Now operator, I'll turn the call back over to you for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.', 'Deane Michael Dray', ""Matthew, as we start the year, I'd love to hear what's top of mind for you on your priorities. I know we're going to get a lot more specifics at the Analyst Day, but I think everyone would love to hear more about what you're thinking of the path and the opportunity for margin improvement broadly. And just some early thoughts on optimizing the portfolio potentially."", 'Matthew Francis Pine', ""Great. Thanks, Deane. First, I want to just acknowledge the team's Q4 and full year performance during really a transformational year for Xylem. We had the Evoqua combination. We announced that in January. Followed by the Idrica partnership. And then obviously, we had a leadership change, all that while dealing with a lot of macro challenges out there around the globe. So the team has done an incredible job staying focused. I'm really humbled and excited to lead Xylem into the next chapter. We built, as I've said before, an incredible platform over the past decade. If you look back 6 or 7 years ago, half the company did not even exist. So a lot of really good momentum there. And from my perspective, we're in a very unique position with our platform leadership of this 10-year journey to have visibility across the water value chain. And this really enables us to provide holistic kind of optimized solutions to our customers. And moving forward, we're going to continue to build on that platform. As COO last year, I did lead the strategic planning process at Xylem. So we have, I'd say, really strong strategic continuity as we transition this year. And I've talked about 3 strategic execution priorities that we're focused on. Number one, we have to deliver the Evoqua value capture. That's first and foremost. That's the transformational deal that we did last year. Number two, is -- and you hit on it, is we've got to get after margin expansion acceleration, and we're going to do that through productivity and continuing to drive operational excellence through the business. And then lastly, scaling our services business, enabled by digital, which we'll talk probably later in the call about the WSS segment for 2024 and its ability to help us do that. One thing I'd mention that we don't talk a lot, it's kind of the soft side and that's on culture. As we bring 2 large companies together, culture is really important, and we put a lot of focus in that area. We call it high-impact culture. And there's behaviors to drive alignment around our culture and those behaviors are, first of all, to have our people be inspired to innovate. We don't want people to fill a fear of failure. We want them to innovate and that's going to drive the next cash flows and top line growth in the company. The second is we want them to be empowered to lead and empowered in the business. And then thirdly and most importantly, we want them to be accountable to deliver. And so those are things we're really pushing the organization on to get alignment around that will, I think, help us going forward. Maybe the last comment I would make is we have a call to action in the company that we've been working on over the past few months, and that's -- we want to simplify water. And what that means is really bridging our aspiration, which is let's solve water, which everybody knows our tagline to our strategic execution priorities, which is really -- the what we're going to focus on. So that's really the rallying cry in the organization, and that's where we're going to be focused in 2024."", 'Deane Michael Dray', ""I appreciate all that color. And just as a follow-up for Bill, I would love to get an update on the rollout of 80/20 besides the check the box, a successful recast of the slides, which I really like. And then could you also lead in on the update on the revenue synergy plans on Evoqua specifically? I know there's a plan to roll out existing North America customers who have asked to have similar facilities outsourcing in Europe. So an update there, please."", 'William K. Grogan', ""Sure. So maybe I'll start with the first part of the question. And first off, 80/20 is a multiyear journey. As it gets weaved into the fabric of the culture. Matthew just highlighted, we are on a cultural evolution and incorporate some new tools and behaviors into the organization. And you have to remember, 80/20 is kind of about systematic complexity reduction. And that takes time. It's not just a quick math exercise and you're done. It's really about focused resource allocation methodology, aligning the teams around the things that matter most in the business. Obviously, there's a tremendous margin opportunity that comes with the tool set, but longer term, it's really a tool to drive better organic growth performance by overserving your best customers and innovating around your best ideas. We've kicked off 2 pilots late in Q4 within Applied Water North America and North American Metrology within M&CS. It takes some time to do the analytics. And I look to see some benefits starting to evolve within 6 to 12 months. Obviously, as we get to Investor Day, we'll be able to put some more specific numbers around that. But I really think it's going to be a transformational tool for the organization as we roll it out and be a big part of our longer-term margin improvement story."", 'Matthew Francis Pine', ""Yes. Maybe a little bit of color on revenue synergies, Deane. I was proud of the team in Q4. We completed the APT integration to water infrastructure, which was a big deal. We've appointed regional synergy leads for the revenue capture around the globe, and incentives are in place to drive that execution. And one thing we've been really focused on is training our sales teams as well as our service teams. And as you know, in December, we announced the creation of the WSS segment for 2024. And a few comments there. Number one, we feel it's going to accelerate our synergies, both on the cost side as well as the revenue side, which is where we're focused the most. One thing that maybe is not as intuitive, I do think it's going to help us with technician utilization so we can leverage our technicians across the broader portfolio and also provide better career pathing for them long term, as well as leveraging technology. And then the big thing it does for us, it really helps us leverage and enable the international expansion of WSS going forward in '24, like I said, internationally. And then the most important thing, it makes it easier for our customers because at the end of the day, it's about customer focus. And our customers instead of picking up the phone to pick -- make 4 phone calls, they can make 1 to Xylem to solve their biggest problems."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Mike Halloran with Baird.', 'Michael Patrick Halloran', 'A couple of questions to you. First, you commented on confidence in the end markets and sustainability of existing trends. Maybe talk a little bit about utility and industrial markets. What the customers are saying at this point, willingness to put capital forward for CapEx-related projects. Any signs of softness, acceleration? How are you thinking about this on that side?', 'Matthew Francis Pine', ""Yes, I could start this out. I mean from -- on the CapEx front, we've seen continued momentum there. For us, the proxy is our treatment business. Orders were very strong, both in Q4 and the full year, up double digits. And so that's -- that gives us a lot of confidence. And that number is not only just in the U.S., that's a global number. So every region is performing very well in treatment. So from a CapEx perspective, we haven't seen any pullback or any concern there. And obviously, a big part of our focus in our portfolio in utilities is focused on the OpEx side, and that's about 75% of the revenue, and that remains pretty strong. And it's also -- we've talked about buoyed, especially the long term. It's not going to be this year or even in the next year, but over the next 5 to 7 years, it's buoyed by regulation globally. Whether that's in the U.S. with the infrastructure bill, which includes PFAS funding or if you get into Europe with the Recovery and Resilience Act and then the AMP cycle in the U.K. That gives us a lot of confidence that we'll continue to see those markets do well. I'd say industrially, it's a little bit of a mixed bag on the new segment, WSS, which is a legacy ISS business, which contains assessment services and dewatering now. We're seeing strong momentum there, especially in power, life sciences, microelectronics. We're seeing a lot of bid activity there and we feel good about that. We've seen a little bit of lumpiness in the applied water end markets, especially resi. Some of that is just due to coming out of the pandemic where people were investing their discretionary income and upgrading their houses. And also weather has played some of a role in that is a lot of our resi products are applied into ag applications. And so we've seen some lumpiness there in the U.S. and a little bit in Western Europe. So that's a little bit of the view of the landscape."", 'Michael Patrick Halloran', ""Appreciate that. Second question, just on the pricing side of things, I guess, twofold. One, how are you thinking about pricing for '24? And as you think about the multiyear journey here as you're rolling out 80/20 and all the other tool kits you're going to be implementing, what is the opportunity for pricing as you think about the broader portfolio?"", 'William K. Grogan', ""Yes. Mike, maybe I'll take that one. So price expectations for next year are going to ramp down versus the capture that we experienced in 2023 will be a little over 1 point. That's still significantly higher than pre-pandemic pricing. But it is an opportunity as we look forward. As we calibrate and hone in the skills to continue to capture the value for our products across the portfolio. Obviously, that 1 point plus varies across the different segments. With M&CS and WSS going forward, probably stronger price capture opportunities. And then 80/20, I think will be up as we roll out opportunities within AWS as they've done some additional analytics and we look for just better pricing methodology and capture on some of the longer tail customers that we have. Obviously, we're leveraging price as one of our components to offset inflation. The team does a really good job driving operational productivity as a second lever to offset inflation. So we're going to manage price and material cost and stay positive. Obviously, that will compress a little bit next year as pricing goes down, but also our expectations relative to inflation will be price material cost positive and then look for productivity to really enhance our margins as we move forward."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Scott Davis with Melius Research.', 'Scott Reed Davis', ""Wanted to -- you made some comments incrementally on China, seemed a little bit more cautious, which is not a surprise just given what we've heard from others. But it looks like your business there has held up okay, at least versus some peers out there, but what -- maybe a little bit more granularity there would be helpful."", 'Matthew Francis Pine', ""Yes. Thanks for the question, Scott. China, for us, now with the new combination of the company is about mid-single digit in terms of our revenue. With over 50% of that being water infrastructure from an exposure standpoint, largely tied to public utilities. We've seen pretty decent orders there. Q4 orders were up 11%, full year up 10%. On the revenue side, we were up on the full year about 2%, low single digits. But if you look back on a 2-year stack, we're down mid-single digits in China. So the backlog is building, but we haven't seen that convert to revenue yet. Things continue to slide to the right in terms of funding.I think if you read the news, you continue to see the government's intervention in the economy there, and that's taking some of the funds away from investing in some of the infrastructure. But we believe that's more of a short-term issue. Across the utilities exposure, we continue to see, again, a healthy pipeline and we'll continue to monitor that funding.I would say on the industrial side, it's a little bit of a similar demand environment, and that's held up a little bit more resilient, to be honest, over utilities. And the last thing I would say with China, overall, we expect China to be roughly flat in 2024 for the business."", 'Scott Reed Davis', ""Okay. That's super helpful. Your balance sheet is in fantastic shape. And given the way you structure the Evoqua deal, just leads me -- a natural question would be are there -- should we expect kind of some bolt-on acquisitions or anything kind of in '24 that perhaps you could talk about your M&A backlog? And just as much just talk about the pipeline, perhaps talk about your interest in doing deals. That would be helpful."", 'Matthew Francis Pine', ""Yes. No, thanks. It's a good question. We closed out 2023, very strong following the close of our largest transformational deal in our history. And so one of the things we're laser focused on is making sure that we integrate the Evoqua well and we get the value capture in the near term. To your point, we do have a strong M&A pipeline. And the structure of the Evoqua deal allows us flexibility with a strong balance sheet.The short-term focus, Scott, is going to be to focus on small to medium bolt-ons. Evoqua, we can fairly ring-fence within the business, but there's other parts of the portfolio where we do want to continue to be inquisitive, with again, with small to medium bolt-ons. And we'll continue our disciplined approach, and we're evaluating our longer-term capital allocation framework, and we'll share more about that at Investor Day in May."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.', 'Andrew Alec Kaplowitz', ""Matthew, Bill, when you look at the 50 to 100 basis points of margin expansion for '24, could you give us a little more color on how that margin improvement translates by segment. And then you mentioned the 80/20 pilots with a focus on M&CS. You did have nice improvement -- margin improvement in M&CS in Q4. So how do you think about the margin potential in that particular business over the longer term?"", 'William K. Grogan', ""Yes. I mean relative to the largest impact on margin expansion for next year, I think M&CS leads the pack. Obviously, we've started our journey on margin improvement and recovery as they've gone through chip supply shortages, which I think, for the most part, has resolved. They've added capacity within the production facility to meet kind of the record backlog levels that they've had. They've gone out with incremental pricing to improve the quality of the margin within the backlog. And I think the value of their products and solutions are able to continue to drive incremental price as we go into next year.So I think their ability to exit the year at near historic record levels of EBITDA margin is the target, as they continue to leverage their volume and drive some pretty significant productivity as they look at their labor and material footprint around their products. So we're excited about the progress that they've made and look for them to continue to sequentially improve as we progress through the year in 2024."", 'Andrew Alec Kaplowitz', ""That's very helpful. And Matt, maybe just a bigger picture question for you. I know you want to guide conservatively for this year. You've been prudent in Applied in China, but you've got such a strong growth business in M&CS, and you're still only guiding 3% to 5%. Xylem's had a longer-term algorithm of 4% to 6%. So as you take over the CEO reins, do you worry at all, that's higher given all the self-help focus, focus on digitization, all these kinds of things that that's still the right number to growth rate?"", 'Matthew Francis Pine', ""Yes. I think, again, a lot of that has not changed from what we've said in the past. It's just, I think, being balanced in our approach and with a watchful eye to China. We've got that flat year-over-year, but there could be some potential headwinds there. And also with Applied Water, which is it's some of that cyclicality and timing as we think about that, Andy. So from a long-term framework, I know that's changed. It's just really more thinking about in the context of 2024 and thinking about going out with a balanced approach.We do have a lot of healthy demand across our largest end markets. When you look at the year from a seasonality standpoint, it's normalized. There's no change in terms of the seasonality of our business and how we ramp from Q1 through the balance of the year. I think the thing I'd leave you with, too, is our margin guide reflects low 40s pro forma incrementals. And so we feel really strong about the margin that we're delivering as well on the growth."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Nathan Jones with Stifel, please go ahead. Mr. Jones is your line open?', 'Nathan Hardie Jones', ""I'm going to follow up on the margin question. I think your Evoqua cost synergies get you something like 80 basis points, and you're obviously going to get some pretty good margin expansion out of the M&CS operating leverage. Which when I do the math gets me well in excess of the 100 basis points top end of your margin expansion target. So can you talk about what could be the offsets there or increased growth investments or anything that's kind of muting some of that margin expansion that I might otherwise expect?"", 'William K. Grogan', ""Yes. I think the biggest piece probably in your high-level math is we continue to invest in the business. Obviously, we've got significant growth opportunities over the long term that we want to make sure that we're allocating resources around -- across all 4 segments. There's exciting things relative to product launches and market expansions that put a little bit of pressure on some of the significant accretion relative to productivity and the synergies that you highlighted.And then also, Nathan, there's obviously an evolving macro environment that we want to make sure that we were prudent relative to the guide that we have the ability to account for things that come up. So I think our guide relative to the margin expansion is fairly balanced. I think Matthew just highlighted, at 40% incrementals on a pro forma basis, that's really strong flow-through. So excited about the opportunities the team has laid out here as we look for a really strong year on our margin expansion journey.And I think longer term, obviously, we're just starting with the 80/20 implementation. That will add some tailwind as we exit the year and into 2025 to try to get us at the higher end of that range longer term."", 'Nathan Hardie Jones', 'Great. And then my follow-up, Bill, I think you just mentioned that the chip supply issue has basically worked itself out. Can you guys comment on where the past due backlog is in M&CS today and when you expect that to get to whatever a normal level of past due backlog is?', 'Matthew Francis Pine', ""Nate, I'll take it, it's Matthew. Yes, we're making good progress on the past due backlog. If you remember, we started 2023 around 30% past due. We exited at 20%. And we feel that we're going to get to the bulk of the past due backlog in 2024. Some of that may stray into '25 but for the most part, we feel pretty confident that we'll get through the past due backlog in 2024, again, with a little bit of carryover into '25.And so really from a bottleneck standpoint, it really just comes down to our customers' ability to go out and execute the deployments Chip supply is falling. We've made investments over the past few years in our capacity. So there's no capacity limitations from our point of view internally here at Xylem in our 4 walls."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen.', 'Joseph Craig Giordano', ""I wanted to touch on Idrica. I guess one of the more like interesting kind of high level, where can we go type stories within water, how to get a real connected utility and I'm just curious how you guys think about this, like how do we judge success? What -- how meaningful could something like this turn into kind of over near to medium term? And just kind of maybe set expectations about where that can go?"", 'Matthew Francis Pine', ""Yes. I mean, I've been pretty bullish on this. You've heard me talk about being the aggregator of data in the utilities, much like folks are in the building management world or in the residential home. We believe we have the capabilities through this partnership to be able to be the leader in aggregating utility data. We're off to a really good start. We only had about 6 months under our belt last year once we got the combination closed. The teams have made great progress globally, and we built a significant pipeline. And one of the things I've talked about is it's one thing is to get the platform in play at the utility, but it's about building on the applications as well as pulling through our core products. So a little bit of a land and expand is how I would frame it, get the platform in place, help them optimize their water networks with our applications, as well as pulling through our products like AMI or treatment products, et cetera.So we've had some significant wins. Some of those I've highlighted on prior calls, we continue to have wins and build momentum. Like I said, and it's not a specific region, it's across the world, whether that's in the U.K., Italy, we just won a big deal in the Middle East, which is for a new city with fully digitizing their water management system with this platform. And I've talked in the past about some of the deals in Spain and the U.S.. We've done in terms of putting the platform in and being able to sell AMI deals as well as treatment products. So I think it can be a big opportunity for us. Obviously, we'll give you a lot more color as we get closer to May 30 at our Investor Day, but we're really bullish on the partnership."", 'Joseph Craig Giordano', ""That's great color. And then I just -- and apologies if you mentioned some of this on the prepared remarks, I had to join late. But on Evoqua like revenue side synergies. I know like selling an ISS solution outside the U.S. is going to take a long time to build out. But I'm curious if there's anything you can point to about like leveraging existing channels that you have in like Europe to put product through, which I would imagine would be a lower lift than to try to do a solution base sell."", 'Matthew Francis Pine', ""Yes. That's kind of a shorter to medium-term objective, and we've already had some wins. We just had one in South Africa actually where we took the capital from the legacy Evoqua business through the legacy Xylem business in South Africa. So we were able to execute and deploy that capital into an industrial application, without really having to have service folks on the ground and infrastructure. So those are things that we're focused on kind of in the short to medium term is leveraging the product side and really the capital side of the legacy Evoqua business through the Xylem channels both in the U.S. as well as internationally. So we are starting to see progress there."", 'Operator', 'This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Matthew Pine for any closing remarks.', 'Matthew Francis Pine', ""Yes. I just want to thank everybody for joining our call today and for your interest in Xylem. We look forward to speaking again in early May, followed by our Investor Day on May 30, where we're going to provide more details on our long-term outlook. Take care and make it a great day."", 'Operator', ""The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.""]"

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates."", 'The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 13. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This casino and resort operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.66 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -4.4%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $4.08 billion, up 13.5% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for MGM?', ""For MGM, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +16.27%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.', 'So, this combination indicates that MGM will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that MGM would post earnings of $0.55 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.64, delivering a surprise of +16.36%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", 'MGM appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.', ""An Industry Player's Expected Results"", 'Another stock from the Zacks Gaming industry, Boyd Gaming (BYD), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.43 per share for the quarter ended December 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -16.9%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $922.92 million, unchanged compared to the year-ago quarter.', 'Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Boyd has been revised 0.3% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 3.35%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.', 'This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Boyd will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.

I encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents. Now I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall."", 'Eugene A. Hall', ""Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. Gartner drove another strong performance in the fourth quarter. We delivered high single-digit growth in contract value. Revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow came in above expectations. Gartner delivers incredible client value in any macroeconomic environment. In 2023, the world experienced multiple disruptions. They impacted enterprises in dramatically different ways. For example, high interest rates affected capital-intensive industries and financial institutions such as regional banks. High inflation rates had an outsized effect on industries such as health care. Geopolitical polarization and conflict drove increases in military and defense spending while affecting supply chains. More shifts in how and where people work affected real estate, live events and entertainment and other industries. Cybersecurity attacks became even more frequent, were getting stronger and more disruptive. And we saw a significant leap in the capabilities of artificial intelligence, or AI, which fueled even more complexity. We serve leaders in every enterprise, across every industry and every geography. They know they need help, and they know Gartner is the best source for the help they need. Gartner delivers actionable objective insight that drive smarter decisions and stronger performance on an organization's mission-critical priorities. We guide the leaders who shape the world. Our insights often make the difference between success and failure, the leaders we work with and the enterprises they serve. As we move into 2024, our ability to execute operational best practices consistently is the strongest it's ever been. We have the lowest proportion of open positions ever. Our recruiting capability and capacity are world-class. We have a strong associate value proposition. And our teams have higher tenure than in 2023, which will allow us to drive strong performance well into the future. Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. Our market opportunity is vast across all sectors, sizes and geographies. Our business remains resilient in a complex external environment. Through relentless execution of proven practices, we're able to deliver unparalleled value to our clients. In the fourth quarter, we helped clients with a wide range of topics, including cybersecurity, data analytics, artificial intelligence, remote work, cost optimization and more. Research revenue grew 5% in Q4. Subscription revenue represented more than 75% of our consolidated global revenue in 2023. We delivered subscription revenue growth of 8% on an organic basis in the fourth quarter. Total contract value growth was 8%. Across GTS and GBS, contract value from enterprise function leaders grew at double-digit rates. New business with enterprise function leaders also grew at double-digit rates. Gartner serves executives and their teams through distinct sales channels. Global Technology Sales, or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. GTS also serves leaders at technology vendors, including CEOs, Chief Marketing Officers and senior product leaders. GTS contract value grew 6%, led by growth with IT and enterprise function leaders. GTS sales to leaders and technology vendors continued to be affected by technology sector dynamics. Exiting the year, we began to see some improvement. New business with tech vendors were at high single digits. We expect new business to lead retention and contract value growth. Global Business Sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, legal, sales and more. GBS contract value grew 13%. GBS new business was up double digits. Gartner Conferences deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to an engaged and qualified audience. 2023 was the first full year of in-person conferences since 2019. We had a great year, and we drove a strong finish in the fourth quarter. In Q4, we held some of our largest destination conferences, including IT Symposium in Orlando and Barcelona, and ReimagineHR in Orlando. These conferences were spectacular. Across all our destination conferences, attendance was up year-over-year, with many at or near capacity. Looking ahead to 2024, advanced bookings continue to be very strong and feedback continues to be excellent. Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper, extended project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IT research business. Consulting revenue grew 8% for the full year. We saw growth in labor-based consulting and record results in contract optimization for the full year. We are introducing 2024 guidance which we view as achievable across a wide range of economic and geopolitical scenarios with opportunity for upside. In closing, Gartner achieved another strong quarter of growth. We deliver incredible client value whether our clients are struggling, thriving or anywhere in between. We're exceptionally agile and continuously adapt to the changing world, and we know the right things to do to be successful in any environment. Looking ahead, we're well positioned to continue our sustained record of success far into the future. Our client value proposition and addressable market opportunity will allow us to drive long-term sustained double-digit revenue growth. We expect margins will expand modestly over time, and we generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. As we invest for future growth, we'll return significant levels of excess capital to our shareholders. This reduces shares outstanding and increases returns over time. With that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian."", 'Craig W. Safian', ""Thank you, Gene, and good morning. Fourth quarter revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow were better than expected as we continue to execute very well in a complex environment. Our financial performance for the full year 2023 included global contract value and consolidated revenue growth of 8%, EBITDA of $1.5 billion, diluted adjusted EPS of $11.33 and free cash flow of $1.1 billion. We are introducing 2024 guidance which we view as achievable across a wide range of economic and geopolitical scenarios, with opportunity for upside.Fourth quarter revenue was $1.6 billion, up 5% year-over-year as reported and 4% FX-neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 67%. EBITDA was $386 million, ahead of our guidance primarily as a result of disciplined cost management. Adjusted EPS was $3.04 and free cash flow was $196 million. We finished the quarter with 20,237 associates, up 5% excluding the 2023 divestiture and about the same as Q3. We have a great team across Gartner, driven by a very compelling associate value proposition. Moving into 2024, we are in an excellent position from a talent and tenure perspective. Research revenue in the fourth quarter grew 6% year-over-year as reported and 5% FX-neutral. Subscription revenue grew 8% on an organic FX-neutral basis. Non-subscription revenue performance in the quarter reflects a shift to higher-quality traffic. While this action has a short-term effect on revenue, we expect it will drive higher prices and increase revenue over time. Fourth quarter Research contribution margin was 74%, consistent with the prior year period as we have caught up on hiring and returned to the new expected levels of travel. For the full year 2023, Research revenues increased by 6%, both as-reported and FX-neutral. The gross contribution margin for the year was 74%. Contract value, or CV, was $4.8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 8% versus the prior year. CV growth is FX-neutral and excludes the first quarter 2023 divestiture. We expect new business to be a leading indicator for retention and, in turn, contract value growth. We had the highest 1 month of new business dollars ever in December 2023. For the fourth quarter, CV from enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS grew at double-digit rates. New business with enterprise function leaders increased double digits as well. CV from tech vendors about flat versus the prior year and up sequentially. Tech vendor CV continued the quarterly improvement we saw in Q3. Tech vendor new business was up high single digits in Q4, marking the first year-over-year increase in 2023. Quarterly net contract value increase, or NCVI, was $180 million. As we've discussed in the past, there is notable seasonality in this metric. CV growth was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. Across our combined practices, the majority of the industry sectors grew at double-digit or high single-digit rates, led by the energy, manufacturing and public sectors. We had high single-digit growth across almost all of our enterprise-size categories. The small category, which has the largest tech vendor mix, grew modestly. We also drove double-digit or high single-digit growth in the majority of our top 10 countries. Global Technology Sales contract value was $3.7 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 6% versus the prior year. GTS CV increased $134 million from the third quarter. Wallet retention for GTS was 101% the quarter, reflecting net growth even before the addition of new clients. In the fourth quarter, IT enterprise function leaders' wallet retention was consistent with historical GTS levels. GTS new business increased 12% versus last year. New business with IT enterprise function leaders increased mid-teens compared to 2022. New business with tech vendors increased high single digits in the quarter. GTS quota-bearing headcount was about flat year-over-year. With the dynamic territory planning we introduced a few years ago, the catch-up hiring we did last year and our teams moving up the tenure curve, we're well positioned for growth moving into 2024. Operationally, we are continuously allocating resources to the best near-term opportunities even as we ensure we are well positioned to capture the large addressable market opportunity over time. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the earnings supplement. Global Business Sales contract value was $1.1 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 13% year-over-year. The majority of our GBS practices grew at double-digit rates. Growth was led by supply chain, legal and HR. GBS CV increased $46 million from the third quarter. Wallet retention for GBS was 107% for the quarter, reflecting strong net growth with our existing clients. GBS new business was up 13% compared to last year. GBS quota-bearing headcount was up 8% versus the fourth quarter of 2022. This excludes headcount associated with the Q1 divestiture. As with GTS, a regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in the earnings supplement. As we do each year at this time, we've provided 2 years of quarterly historical contract value data updated to 2024 FX rates in the appendix of the earnings supplement. Conferences revenue for the fourth quarter was $214 million, up 14% year-over-year. Contribution margin in the quarter was 50%, consistent with typical seasonality. We held 11 destination conferences in the quarter, all in-person. For the full year 2023, we delivered an all-time high revenue of $505 million, which was an increase of 30% on a reported basis and 29% FX-neutral. Gross contribution margin was 50%. Fourth quarter Consulting revenues were $128 million compared with $138 million in 2022, when we saw a record performance in the contract optimization business. Consulting contribution margin was 27% in the fourth quarter, affected by revenue mix and growth hiring. Labor-based revenues were $99 million, up 3% versus Q4 of last year as-reported and on an FX-neutral basis. Backlog at December 31 was $162 million, increasing 21% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis with continued booking strength. We delivered $29 million of contract optimization revenue in the quarter. This part of our business is highly variable. For the second half of 2023, revenues were $62 million, up from the second half of 2022, when we delivered our largest-ever quarter in Q4. Full year Consulting revenue was up 7% on a reported basis and 8% FX-neutral. Gross contribution margin was 35% compared to 39% in 2022. Consolidated cost of services increased 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as reported and 10% on an FX-neutral basis. The biggest driver of the increase was higher headcount to support our future growth. SG&A increased 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as reported and 8% FX-neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of headcount growth. EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $386 million compared to $421 million last year. Fourth quarter EBITDA upside to our guidance primarily reflected disciplined expense management. EBITDA for the full year was almost $1.5 billion, a 1% increase over 2022 on a reported basis and up 2% FX-neutral. Depreciation in the quarter of $26 million was up modestly compared to 2022. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter, was $19 million. This was down $9 million versus the fourth quarter of 2022 due to higher interest income on our cash balances. The modest floating rate debt we have is fully hedged through maturity. The Q4 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 24% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust that income was 15% for the quarter. The full year tax rate for the calculation of adjusted net income was 22%. Adjusted EPS in Q4 was $3.04 compared with $3.70 last year. We had 79 million shares outstanding in the fourth quarter. This is a reduction of about 1 million shares or about 1% year-over-year. We exited the fourth quarter with about 79 million shares on an unweighted basis. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $11.33, up modestly from 2022. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $224 million, up 10% compared to last year. CapEx for the quarter was $28 million, down $4 million, as a result of catch-up spend on technology investments in 2022 which normalize this year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $196 million, up 19% compared to last year. Free cash flow for the full year was almost $1.1 billion, a 6% increase versus $2.2 million. Free cash flow on a rolling 4-quarter basis was 18% of revenue and 71% of EBITDA. Adjusting for the Q1 divestiture, the full year free cash flow conversion from GAAP net income would have been 138%. Our free cash flow conversion is generally higher when CV growth is accelerating. We have a new slide in the earnings supplement which shows the conversion from both EBITDA and GAAP net income to free cash flow on a rolling 4-quarter basis. The past 2 years have had some unusual items affecting the conversion, including insurance proceeds related to pandemic conference cancellations and the 2023 divestiture. We expect about a 4- to 6-point difference between EBITDA margin and free cash flow margins in a typical year. The normal free cash flow conversion from GAAP net income is 140% to 160%. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had about $1.3 billion of cash. Our December 31 debt balance was about $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under 2x. Our expected free cash flow generation, available revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. Our balance sheet is very strong with $2.3 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and effectively fixed interest rates. We repurchased $158 million of stock during the fourth quarter and more than $600 million for the full year. At the end of December, we had about $1 billion of authorization for repurchases remaining, and we expect the Board will continue to refresh the repurchase authorization going forward. As we continue to repurchase shares, our capital base will shrink. Over time, this is accretive to earnings per share and, combined with growing profits, also delivers increasing returns on invested capital. Before providing the 2024 guidance details, I want to discuss our base level assumptions and planning philosophy for 2024. For Research, we continue to innovate and provide a very compelling value proposition for clients and prospects. Executives and their teams face uncertainty and challenges, and they recognize how Gartner can help regardless of the economic environment. The outlook for 2024 Research revenue growth is a function of 3 primary factors: First, 2023 ending contract value; second, the timing of growth bottoming and the slope of the reacceleration; and third, the performance of non-subscription revenue. Starting with the Research subscription revenue, which was 76% of 2023 consolidated revenue. Our guidance reflects CV bottoming and reaccelerating during 2024. First quarter and first half NCVI are important inputs to calendar 2024 revenue growth. We have taken a prudent view of NCVI phasing because Q1 is a seasonally important quarter for tech vendor renewals. With the majority of our contracts being multiyear, some haven't come up for renewal during the tech sector's recalibration, and Research subscription revenue will likely bottom about 1 quarter after the contract value growth bottoms. If new business continues to perform well and retention is better than we've incorporated into the plan, there would be upside to our guidance. The non-subscription revenue was about 6% of consolidated revenue in 2023. In this part of the business, we help small business buyers find the best software for their needs and help sellers find customers. This adds a lot of tangible value for both groups. The outlook built into the 2024 guidance reflects a shift to higher-quality traffic sources. As I mentioned, this affects revenue in the short term, but we expect it to drive higher prices and increased revenue over time. For Conferences, which is about 9% of 2023 revenue, we are basing our guidance on the 51 in-person destination conferences we have planned for 2024. We expect similar seasonality to what we saw in 2023, with Q4 the largest quarter, followed by Q2. We have very good visibility into 2024 revenue, with the majority of what we've guided already under contract. This is consistent with last year and ahead of historical levels. For Consulting, which was also about 9% of 2023 revenue, we have more visibility into the first half based on the composition of our backlog and pipeline, as usual. Contract optimization has had several very strong years. It's also seasonally slower in the first quarter and remains highly variable. We've incorporated a prudent outlook for this part of the segment. We remain focused on aligning expense growth with CV growth. This is the best way for us to balance short-term margins while investing for long-term sustained double-digit growth. Our base level assumptions for consolidated expenses reflect a more typical cadence than we've seen in a while. We are investing for future growth even as we have taken a prudent view of the timing of revenue flowing into the P&L. We recommend thinking about expenses sequentially, with notable seasonality driven by the Conferences calendar and merit increases. Our plan for mid- to high single-digit sales headcount growth for 2024 reflects our commitment to invest for future growth while delivering on our margin targets. We have the recruiting capacity to go faster, depending on how the year plays out; and we have other levers, like increased tenure, to support CV growth in 2024. At current rates, FX will be approximately neutral to growth for the full year. Our guidance for 2024 is as follows. We expect Research revenue of at least $5.15 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of about 5%. The Research revenue guidance reflects a prudent plan for NCVI performance and the recalibration of non-subscription part of the business. The guidance reflects subscription revenue growth in the high single digits. We expect Conferences revenue of at least $560 million, which is FX-neutral growth of about 10%. We expect Consulting revenue of at least $530 million, which is growth of about 3% FX-neutral. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $6.24 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of 5%. We expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.435 billion, which results in an EBITDA margin of at least 23%. We expect 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $10.55 per share. For 2024, we expect free cash flow of at least $1.065 billion. This reflects a conversion from GAAP net income of above 140%. Our guidance is based on 79 million shares, which only assumes repurchases to offset dilution. Finally, for the first quarter of 2024, we expect to deliver EBITDA of at least $335 million. We performed well this year despite continuing global macro uncertainty and a dynamic tech vendor market. Global CV grew high single digits in the quarter, with enterprise function leaders CV growing double digits. Revenue, EBITDA and EPS performance exceeded our expectations, and we introduced achievable guidance with opportunity for upside. We repurchased more than $600 million in stock during 2023 and more than $3 billion in the past 3 years. We remain eager to return excess capital to our shareholders. We will continue to be price-sensitive, opportunistic and disciplined. Looking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% Research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing about in line with CV growth and G&A leverage, we will expand EBITDA margins modestly over time. We can grow cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which lower the share count over time, and on strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?"", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird.', 'Jeffrey P. Meuler', ""Just want to dig in first. I know it's not a huge business, but on the Research non-subscription headwinds and need for recalibration. I know it's been weak all year, but I was interpreting that previously more as like cyclical headwinds. And now it seems like you're responding more operationally to drive higher-quality traffic. So just I guess, I don't know if there was like a business review or, I guess, the why now in terms of cyclicality of the business versus where there's an opportunity for operational improvement."", 'Craig W. Safian', ""Jeff, thanks for the question. I'll give it a start, and then Gene will chime in as well. I think -- just starting with the facts, the non-subscription part of the business was about 6% of 2023 revenue. Obviously, we have had tech market pressure for the full year. And the way that mostly manifested itself through our results was real pressure on pricing throughout the full year. And we saw that. We adjusted coming out of Q2 earnings. And the good news is pricing has been roughly stable since we made that adjustment. In Q4 though, one of the things we're always focused on is making sure that we are providing the highest value to both sides of the equation. And with these offerings, we are essentially -- small business buyers are coming to our sites to learn more about what software to buy, and we actually help them with reviews and ratings and written research and things of that nature, and then we're matching them to the sellers. And again, so tangible value, as we mentioned, on both sides of the equation. We're always focused on driving even more value for our clients. And so one of the things we've done is really shift our focus and prioritization to higher-quality forms of traffic. And again, short-term impact on revenues. But over the long term, we think this is good for clients on both sides of the equation, will drive higher pricing over time, which will drive higher revenue, which is good for everybody. But one thing I would say just about the guidance is we've modeled in the real focus on higher-quality traffic. We have not modeled in any real uptick in the pricing. Again, over the long term, we expect that to happen. We did not want to model that in as we actually see that manifesting itself in reality."", 'Jeffrey P. Meuler', ""Okay. And then I hear you loud and clear on the better tech vendor new business sold trends. Maybe talk through more on the retention for tech vendor. Just like how you're thinking about the tail that has not yet renewed in a more difficult environment. Or just what's the typical lag time from when you've seen prior inflections in new business? Like how long it kind of takes for the retention trend to similarly improve?"", 'Eugene A. Hall', ""Jeff, it's Gene. So one -- the biggest issue we have is in the small tech vendors, and a lot of small tech vendors are in markets that have changed and they have difficulty getting funding now. And for those vendors, if they signed a 2- or 3-year multiyear a year or 2 ago, when that comes up for renewal, they don't have any funding. In fact, in many cases, out of business. And so what's happening there is that, that's our biggest drag in the tech sector in terms of retention. The larger companies, as you've seen, are still laying off tens of thousands of people, and so they haven't finished restructuring. As we mentioned, overall new business is up in the tech sector mid-single digits. And so we're thinking that's a leading indicator that retention will follow once we work our way through these -- particularly these companies that have gone out of business since they signed the agreement and -- today. And by the way, it's a very -- still a very robust business. It's just a different side of companies now that are getting funding. Think AI."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.', 'Toni Michele Kaplan', ""Actually, maybe following on a similar line to the last question. The commentary around new business in the prepared remarks. And this is beyond tech vendors, so just in general, the enterprise new business sounded very good. Even the tech vendor improvement in new business sounded good. Just wanted to understand if there was anything that could -- that is a risk to that sort of starting to flow through contract value in the next few quarters. And how quickly you could expect to see sort of that shift in contract value. I know you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you're expecting an inflection this year."", 'Craig W. Safian', ""Toni, thanks for the question. Just to lay out the facts. So to your point, GTS, the [AC] vendor part of the business, new business grew at high single-digit rates. The end user or enterprise function leader part of GTS grew, new business, mid-teens year-over-year. And GBS was up 13% over prior year on new business. So we actually saw a pretty strong new business results across all of the markets we sell into in the fourth quarter. And as we mentioned, we view new business as a real leading indicator for what's happening in the market in the moment, so to speak. And so again, we saw a modest improvement in new business from Q2 to Q3. That continued from Q3 to Q4 with tech vendor actually growing for the first time in 2023 in the fourth quarter. As you know, NCVI and CV growth are a function of the combination of new business and retention. And as we talked about in our prepared remarks and also in response to Jeff's question, there's still a lot of pressure, and Gene alluded to this as well, still a lot of pressure on retention in the small tech vendor part of the market. And we still have a lot of renewals that haven't been touched -- or coming renewals that haven't been touched since the tech sector really started to recalibrate, call it, third, fourth quarter of 2022. So still a little bit of retention pressure. However, new business, we definitely view as a leading indicator. And again, that's part of what gives us confidence to say that we expect CV to bottom during 2024 and start to reaccelerate during 2024 as well."", 'Toni Michele Kaplan', ""Makes a lot of sense. And then just for a follow-up, I wanted to ask about headcount. The -- I guess, what are your expectations for headcount growth in '24? And just wanted to understand a little bit more about -- it seems like headcount growth has been slowing the last 2 quarters to like below normal levels. I know there was a catch-up in sort of the prior year and earlier in '23. So I guess is the slower headcount sort of helping manage margin? Or is it, I guess, an indicator that there's -- I don't think you're saying there's less opportunity. But just wanted to understand the sort of below-normal headcount growth levels that we're seeing now."", 'Eugene A. Hall', ""So Toni, really look at it as there's a very enormous market opportunity. We intend to capture that market opportunity over the next many years. Part of our core strategy projected at that opportunity is growing our headcount to capture it. That headcount growth, it can be faster or slower depending on the actual kind of selling capacity of the team we have. And right now, we believe we have a lot of selling capacity embedded actually in the capacity we have today. Over time though, that's going to grow as we grow our business."", 'Craig W. Safian', ""And as we mentioned during our prepared remarks, we've actually got dialed into our plan, combination GTS/GBS quota-bearing headcount growth of mid- to high single digits. And as always, we're prepared to go faster. As both Gene and I mentioned, we have recruitment capacity go faster if we want to. And so we've got dialed in mid- to high single-digit growth in GTS and GBS quota-bearing headcount, and we can go faster if we see that rebound coming faster as well."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky with Bank of America.', 'Heather Nicole Balsky', ""I was muted. Sorry about that. I wanted to go back to the renewals on the tech vendor side and just ask you, are there any -- I mean, obviously, if companies are going under, there's nothing you can control there, but what you can do on that front. And can you help us in perspective how material the wave of renewals are? I know that's something investors have been curious about."", 'Eugene A. Hall', ""Again, if you look at the larger companies in the market, renewals are going kind of normally. It's a little slower than usual because, again, they're laying off tens of thousands of people. We expect that will change. There's plenty of demand. Again, we expect global IT spend in this year to grow by 7% to almost $5 trillion. So plenty of demand there. We expect over time, that will normalize. And so the real issue on retention is these very small tech vendors, which are over time a great market for us. But there's a shift going on now from what used get funding, through now, what does funding is, as I mentioned, there's a real focus on AI. And so those companies that are in less-popular segments for funding these days can't get funding. And if they haven't been as successful commercially, the either get acquired or go out of business. In which case, our retention -- it affects our retention."", 'Craig W. Safian', ""And the other thing I'd add, Heather, just on the larger tech clients, typically, what we see is a combination of maybe modestly less growth than we would normally buy or normally see through renewal cycles or modest cuts or reduction to spend. But they maintain a pretty significant Gartner presence always. And what we then do is make sure that we are there to win back that business, and it actually does help drive the growth coming out of tougher macro environment. And that's sort of what we've always seen in tough macro environments, tech vendor or otherwise, where we'll take some nicks from a retention perspective, but stay embedded, still delivering huge value to our clients, and then win back and grow that business over the long term."", 'Heather Nicole Balsky', ""And then just kind of asking another version of probably something you've already said in the same question, but you were talking about CV on the tech vendor side normalizing. Last quarter, you talked about normalizing over 12 to 18 months. Is that still your outlook? Based on what you saw in the fourth quarter, how are you thinking about that?"", 'Craig W. Safian', ""So our long-term view on this segment of the business is unchanged. We believe it can grow in line with our medium-term objectives. We still believe that we are going to see reacceleration of this business over time. Whether it's 9 to 15 months or 12 to 18 or 24, it will be in that range that we actually see that reacceleration. But we -- the market here is still really strong. Our offerings still drive really huge value for our clients in this segment. And over the medium term, there's no reason why this can't get back to 12% to 16% growth, consistent with our medium-term objective for this part of the business."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber with Wells Fargo.', 'Seth Robert Weber', ""I think maybe first, just a clarification. When you talk about your research revenue guide, I think backing into it, it kind of implies a non-subscription revenue growth of down -- like down low double digits. Is that the right way to think about what's baked into your model?"", 'Craig W. Safian', 'Yes, that is the correct math, Seth. You got it.', 'Seth Robert Weber', ""Okay. And then just on the strong new business wins, can you just frame that a little bit? I mean, is that a function of comps are easier, productivity is better? Or are you actually seeing or hearing better sentiment from your customers? Is -- are the sales cycles getting shorter? It just seems like the new business wins are just really strong, and I'm just trying to tie all these things together with your guidance."", 'Eugene A. Hall', ""Yes. So first I'd say is we have a strong value proposition. And so when clients see the value they get from our offerings, they want to buy. So that's what -- that's fundamentally what's driving demand. And on top of that, we're always focused on things that impact sales productivity. And there's things that -- and there's things like the tools that we have done, the process we have. And then as Craig mentioned in his remarks, tenure can affect as well. We're having modest improvement in tenure as well. And so -- but the fundamental thing that's driving it is really intrinsic demand from clients because they have to need for our services to get on the value of them."", 'Seth Robert Weber', ""Right. But has sentiment -- has customer sentiment changed at all over the last quarter? Has it gotten better? Or have the sales cycles changed? Or anything you'd call out for the acceleration of new business wins here?"", 'Eugene A. Hall', ""I'd say the sort of selling environment modestly improved throughout 2023."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.', 'Andrew Owen Nicholas', ""I wanted to touch on artificial intelligence as a driver of new business. I realize it was one of the topics, Gene, that you outlined at the front. Just kind of curious, is there any way to kind of quantify or maybe even subjectively talk about AI as the driver of new business, cross-sell, new conversations with clients? I understand it's part of an ever-evolving tech landscape, but I'm just wondering if there's been any boost or notable boost from that topic specifically as it relates to new client wins and new business."", 'Eugene A. Hall', ""Andrew, our -- we serve clients with a wide variety of areas, as you know, and they get value with all those areas. AI has had a lot of publicity over the last year. And so there is -- throughout the media, et cetera. And so the -- there is an unusually high level of interest understanding what AI is and how it could affect our clients' businesses. I'd say it's just like the other things that we help our clients with. It's not something that's causing like an extra 20% of demand or something. It's an area that is one of the things we cover that clients have interest in. Just clients that have cost problems, they're interested on cost optimization as opposed to AI. So it kind of depends on the situation of the individual client, but it's certainly an area of robust demand."", 'Andrew Owen Nicholas', ""Great. And then for my follow-up, I just wanted to hone in on the CV growth bottoming part of your guidance. I recognize that first quarter and first half NCVI are important inputs, and you've been conservative. Gene, I think in the press release, you said that you had an opportunity for upside and that guidance was achievable across a wide range of economic scenarios. So just trying to putting all these pieces together. Is it fair for us to assume that CV growth is bottoming in the second half in your guidance? And then upside would be from that happening earlier? Or is there some other way for us to think about the underlying assumptions there?"", 'Craig W. Safian', ""I think the way to think about the CV and the revenue, and obviously, our revenue guide for the Research segment and the subscription revenue piece, the revenue is always going to lag the contract value recovery. And on top of that, as you know, first half changes to NCVI are going to have a bigger impact on the 2024 revenue run-out than big step-ups in Q3 or Q4, which are great and drive great cash flow and will drive future revenue, but have minimal impact on 2024 revenue. So we're not guiding to a revenue or CV number for the year, nor are we pointing to specifically where the bottom is, but we have baked into our outlook a bottoming of that CV and a reacceleration of that CV over the course of 2024."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.', 'Brendan J. Popson', ""This is Brendan on for Manav. I just want to ask how you guys think about getting back to double-digit CV growth. Obviously, if your QBH is mid- to high single digit, your new business is still pretty strong. So it seems like really it's just like a wallet retention, higher cancellation issue for now. Is it just that, that kind of goes away over time? Or do you actually expect even more kind of new business productivity, if you will, from QBH? Or I guess, how do you guys think about that?"", 'Craig W. Safian', ""Brendan, I mean, the biggest thing impacting contract value and contract value growth right now is the tech vendor part of the business. And so as we mentioned, the enterprise function leader part of our business grew at double-digit growth rates in the fourth quarter and actually has been a consistent double-digit grower through the course of 2023. And so if you look at that 7.7% overall contract value growth, the reality is the enterprise function leader portion of the business, which is more than 75% of total CV, is growing at double-digit growth rates. And the tech vendor portion of the business, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, was essentially flat for the year. And so as we start to see a reacceleration of the tech vendor business, which again, is a little less than 25% of total CV, that obviously has an impact on the overall CV growth. The other piece that I think is obviously super important is we caught up on our hiring quite a bit over the course of 2022. And so what that meant is, over the course of 2023, we had a lot of people very early in their Gartner sales careers. And as you know, as people come up with tenure curve, their productivity increases. And so we feel confident that we've got enough capacity from a selling perspective heading into 2024 given the combination of tech sector rebound, and probably more importantly, our salespeople coming up the tenure curve. That should provide the right amount of fuel, if you will, to drive contract value growth in 2024. And we're growing our GTS, GBS headcount, mid- to high single digits during 2024, and that's really about accelerating and sustaining that growth as we roll into 2025 and 2026."", 'Brendan J. Popson', ""Okay. And then just any call-outs or growth rates you can give us within GBS? Obviously, it's still performing pretty well. So just anything -- any other color you can give us."", 'Craig W. Safian', ""Yes. I mean, it's still 12.9% or 13% year-over-year growth on a bigger base, and so getting bigger and bigger and sustaining growth within our medium-term objective for the segment. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, supply chain, legal and HR are the 3 fastest-growing pieces of the segment. But obviously, all pieces have to be growing nicely for us to register a 13% year-over-year CV growth."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Josh Chan with UBS.', 'Joshua K. Chan', ""I know that you don't guide to CV trajectory or NCVI. But I guess it sounds like you are emphasizing more the tech vendor renewal dynamic here. So I guess, are we to interpret that as there being more of an impact of that on Q1 than normal? Could you just kind of explain the rationale behind calling that specific dynamic out the way you did?"", 'Craig W. Safian', ""Yes, great question. So we're always looking at the skew of contract end dates and contract value associated with that. And as we've talked about in the past, generally speaking, we're pretty evenly skewed across the year. This year, we actually have a little bit of a bubble, not a huge one, but just a little bit more than average in -- with our tech vendor clients in the first quarter. And so you may have heard us use the word prudent several times during our prepared remarks. We just want to make sure that our guidance reflects our most recent performance and what we know about the next couple of quarters coming up. And so we've taken a prudent view on our first half NCVI to take that into account. That said, again, I'll reiterate, we do expect CV growth overall to bottom during 2024 and begin to reaccelerate with -- even with that first quarter focus on tech vendor renewals."", 'Joshua K. Chan', ""Okay. I appreciate the color there. That's really helpful. And if I can shift over to margins. Could you talk about the different drivers of margin year-over-year? I mean, you have positive revenue growth, you have reaccelerating CV, the cost structure seems to be in a good spot. So are there more margin pluses than minuses? And how does that reconcile with the guidance?"", 'Craig W. Safian', 'Sure, Josh. The simplest way to think about it is that, with our targeted headcount growth in GTS and GBS of mid- to high single digits and think about that, not the only place that we\'re actually growing but growing a little bit elsewhere, combined with normal merit and wage inflation combined with a growing Conferences business, if you look at the implied operating expense in the guidance, it\'s up about 8% or 9% year-over-year, which aligns with the headcount growth and the conference growth that we\'ve got dialed into the guidance. And so as we mentioned, a much more ""normal"" cadence of operating expense in 2024 as compared to prior years, where we fell behind and then we\'re catching up, et cetera, et cetera. So a much more normal quarter-to-quarter build of our operating expense. We are -- the biggest thing that drives our revenue for 2024 is the ending contract value for 2023. And obviously, as we talked about on Andrew\'s question, the revenue will lag the recovery in contract value. And so the reality is -- and again, we\'ve been not guiding, but pointing this way for the last several quarters, that this was going to be the reality for 2024, which is we\'re going to get back on our normal cadence of investing for the future and growing our sales force and growing other areas. We are dealing with the CV deceleration through 2023. And obviously, that has an impact on 2024 for revenues. Obviously, the non-subscription revenue performance also mutes the overall revenue as well; as does the Consulting growth rate, which while still within our medium-term guidance, given we had such a strong year in contract optimization, we\'re being thoughtful about the growth rates there. And so it\'s a little bit of all of those factors impacting the top line with what I would consider ""normal"" operating expense growth baked into the 2024 guide.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies LLC.', 'Surinder Singh Thind', ""Just taking a step back, if we look at the big picture and what I would call the relative strength of the economy, why do you think the clients on the tech side aren't spending more at this point? And I guess in your conversations, what would get them to commit? Like what are they looking for at this point?"", 'Craig W. Safian', ""So Surinder, on the tech side, I think it's really the -- so it's a combination of the recalibration of that market and also -- when I say recalibration, down to the things Gene was talking about, where we actually have a really healthy business on the small end of tech and there is funding flowing, but it's not flowing to the same places that it may have been a year or 2 or 3 ago. And so we're just dealing with that. And again, we're going after the opportunities where the money is or we're fishing where the fish are. But as you've seen, there are still large tech sector layoffs happening a year or almost even 15 months since they began. And selling into that environment when they're in the process of cutting tens of thousands of jobs is a little more challenging than it would be if they completely recalibrated. So I think we're still in. We're still driving huge value for those clients. They're still very important clients for us. We're going to be there to help them as they rebound and come through the recalibration. It's just going to take a little bit of time. But we're confident in the value we provide. We're confident, as I mentioned earlier, in the long-term or medium-term growth prospects for this part of the business. But the fact is they are still significantly recalibrating and we are along for that ride, so to speak."", 'Eugene A. Hall', ""Just to add a little bit. When you're selling into a company that is actively making layoffs, the attention of people's focus is on who they're going to lay off or whether, in fact, they're going to get laid off. And so it takes a little while -- that's a much tougher -- that's kind of the toughest selling environment. They'll get through that and will return to normal. That's the larger end. And on the small end, Craig described very well."", 'Surinder Singh Thind', ""Got it. And then I guess if we think about that or advance that line of thinking, so as you kind of more broadly think about the business and all of these clients that you serve, so is there arguably more, I guess, cyclicality or potential volatility today in your business than maybe in prior cycles? Would maybe the reason being there's more PE/VC-backed firms now, that they're just got a larger part of the ecosystem, so they're just more willing to make quicker strategic pivots or spending decision changes or other things? Is there something structural perhaps that we should be aware of or at least we should be thinking about?"", 'Eugene A. Hall', ""So our perspective is there's nothing structural about it. What happened was, during the pandemic, there was a pull-forward of tech spending. The tech -- many of the tech companies, probably most of them, assumed that was going to last forever, it turned out it was just a pull forward. Now they're just adjusting to getting back to normal. And it's as simple as that. So unless pandemics become cyclical, I think we're in pretty good shape."", 'Craig W. Safian', ""Yes. I also think, Surinder, just to sort of underscore that point. When we talk about the overall business or market opportunity, I'll focus on the market opportunity. So roughly $200 billion market opportunity, $190 billion of that is outside of the tech vendor opportunity. So we remain very focused on that big prize of $190-plus billion market opportunity serving enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS. And again, we're confident that the tech vendor market is a really strong market, but the reality is $190 billion out of that $200 billion market opportunity is the enterprise function leader opportunity."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.', 'Jeffrey Marc Silber', ""I know it's late. I'll just ask one, though it's multi-part. Can we talk about the pricing environment, can you just remind us what price increases you put in for this year? Are you getting any pushback? And others in the space have been providing some breaks for extending the length of the term, is that something you're doing as well?"", 'Craig W. Safian', ""Jeff, thanks for a quick question. On the pricing side, we're a little over 4%. We did our price increase in November of this year, which is when we typically do it. A little bit lower than what we did in '21 and '22, largely because we've seen inflation come down a little bit, most importantly wage inflation come down a little bit. And so we're in that around 4%, a little bit more than 4%. I think clients, by and large, are not pushing back on it. Again, remember, the average spend per client is, order of magnitude, $250,000. So the difference between a 3% or a 4% increase is pretty de minimis. And again -- and we're very focused on making sure that our products and services have incremental value each and every year. And we're continuing to sell with our upfront invoicing and a real focus on that. We're continuing to sell more and more multiyear contracts with our focus on that. And so I'd say, yes, the environment has been a little tougher, but we've been managing to stick to our guns on the things that we know drive huge economic value for the business, which is sticking to our pricing guns, not discounting, selling multiyear contracts and making sure we get the invoicing done upfront. And I think our teams have done a phenomenal job of sticking to our core knitting there."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs.', 'Keen Fai Tong', 'You mentioned 1Q tech vendor renewals are especially important because of a little bubble there. Can you help quantify that? How much concentration is there compared to other quarters in the year?', 'Craig W. Safian', ""Yes. I think -- I mean, again, remember, our tech vendor CV is a little less than 25% of total CV. Normally, Q1 represents a little bit more than 25% of total renewals on the overall franchise. This year, with tech vendors, it's in the low to mid-30% of overall CV. So it's not a huge bubble, it's just a little bit of an overweighting, more than normal, in the first quarter."", 'Keen Fai Tong', ""Got it. That's helpful. And then you're guiding to EBITDA margins of 23% for the year. What do you see as the major driver of potential upside to that target?"", 'Craig W. Safian', ""I think at this point, George, it's revenue upside will drive the biggest potential for margin upside from that 23%. As we've talked about -- I can't remember whose question it was, I think it was Josh's question. The OpEx is -- again, forgive me for using this term, more normal than it has been for the last few years. We're back on our territory growth planning. We're back on our more normal merit increases kicking in on April 1. And so I feel really -- we feel really good about the OpEx plan we've got. And so I think revenue upside across the various business lines would be the place that could potentially unlock a little bit of margin upside. That said, if we are doing better from a revenue perspective, and again, Gene and I both alluded to this, we've got recruitment capacity to go faster. And so we want to make sure that not only are we doing well in 2024, that we are setting ourselves up to continue to perform really strongly in '25 and '26. And so if we have the opportunity to go a little bit faster on GTS and GBS headcount growth, we're going to take that opportunity for sure."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the call back over to Gene Hall for closing remarks."", 'Eugene A. Hall', ""So here are the takeaways for today's call. Gartner drove another strong performance in Q4. We deliver incredible value whether our clients are struggling, thriving or anywhere in between. We're exceptionally agile and continuously adapt to the changing world, and we know the right things to do to be successful in any environment.Looking ahead, we're well positioned to continue our sustained record of success for into the future. Our client value proposition and addressable market opportunity will allow us to drive long-term sustained double-digit revenue growth. We expect margins will expand modestly over time. And we generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. As we invest for future growth, we'll return significant levels of excess capital to our shareholders. This reduces shares outstanding and increases returns over time. Thanks for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you again next quarter."", 'Operator', ""This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.""]"

They can provide you with a recurring source of income that (ideally) rises over time and helps build up your wealth. Three stocks that pay more than double the S&P 500 average yield of 1.5% and that could be great places to invest in right now include Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ), Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), and Realty Income (NYSE: O). If you can afford to invest $33,000, here's how you can spread that out over these three stocks to generate at least $2,000 in annual dividends."", 'Telecom giant Verizon Communications pays an incredibly high yield of 6.4% right now, which is far higher than normal for this top dividend stock. Investing $15,000 into the stock would mean you can expect to collect $970 annually from the dividend Verizon pays.', ""Verizon has also increased its dividend payments for 17 consecutive years, which is the longest streak in the U.S. telecom industry. The company's CEO believes that the stock is a potential substitute for bonds given its reliable dividend income. That suggests that if interest rate cuts happen this year, Verizon's stock could be in high demand as investors potentially pivot from bonds into dividend stocks."", ""Rising interest rates haven't helped Verizon's stock, as it is down 1% in the past 12 months. But what's important is that the payout remains safe. In 2023, the company's free cash flow rose to $18.7 billion versus $14.1 billion a year earlier. While operating revenue was down 2% to $134 billion, the improved cash position suggests that not only is the current yield safe, but also that Verizon's dividend growth steak is likely to continue."", ""Another stock that's paying a higher-than-normal yield is Pfizer. The pharma giant's shares have fallen close to 40% in just the past 12 months. Its dividend yield is slightly lower than Verizon's at 6.2%, but that's still a fairly high payout for investors. If you were to buy $13,000 worth of Pfizer shares, your annual dividend income from that investment could total approximately $792."", ""Pfizer recently boosted its dividend by a penny to $0.42. It has steadily increased its payout since 2010, and the healthcare company has paid a dividend for more than 340 consecutive quarters -- that's a span of more than 85 years."", ""The risk with the stock today is that Pfizer is in the midst of a transition as it moves away from COVID-19 products and focuses on new growth opportunities, which are partly fueled through acquisitions. In 2023, the company's sales were down 42% to $58.5 billion, largely due to a significant decline in COVID vaccinations."", 'Last year, Pfizer closed a mammoth $43 billion acquisition of cancer specialist Seagen, which will be a big part of its long-term turnaround plan.', ""There's some risk with Pfizer due to the uncertainty that lies ahead, but given its track record and ability to innovate and grow over the years, this is still a fairly proven and established company to invest in. Plus, with an estimated forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 12, investors are getting the stock at a good discount."", 'A real estate investment trust (REIT) like Realty Income makes for another promising dividend investment. Like Verizon, it has struggled due to rising interest rates, as its share price is down 22% over the past year. Its yield is around 5.7%, and investing $5,000 in the REIT would mean that you could earn around $286 in dividends over the course of a full year. When combined with the other investments on this list, your annual dividend income would now total at least $2,048.', ""What makes Realty Income attractive is its diversification. The REIT's portfolio isn't heavily exposed to one industry or area of the economy; its tenants are in 85 industries. Its occupancy rate is also just under 99%. Despite what its struggling share price may suggest, Realty Income isn't a highly risky investment to be holding."", ""When the company last released earnings in November, Realty Income's funds from operations, a key metric for REITs, increased by 7% to $1.04 per share for the quarter ending Sept. 30, 2023. And what may sweeten the deal for investors is that unlike most other dividend stocks, Realty Income distributes payments to investors on a monthly basis.

Realty Income (NYSE: O) is one of the best REITs money can buy."", ""Realty Income focuses on leasing retail properties. Consumers routinely spend money in these places, like grocery and convenience stores, pharmacies, dollar stores, and fast-food restaurants. The idea is that these businesses are recession-proof, so they shouldn't struggle to pay rent. Additionally, Realty Income uses net leases, which put expenses like taxes, insurance, and maintenance on the tenant.

Nike's brand stands on its own, and even playing hypotheticals, Nike is too big at this point for most companies to afford.

Babin notes investors are watching China demand and surging US production.', 'Though supply is expected to grow at a slower pace in 2024, Babin says US suppliers were able to ""pull the rabbit out of the hat"" last year and surpass forecasts. While supply growth should moderate, she notes investors feel ""confident"" on the supply side currently.', 'However, Babin doesn\'t think oil prices have ""peaked"" yet. She argues people ""overly"" fixate on ""downside risks"" around China and US supply, ignoring potential demand upside. As Babin points out, oil demand was ""consistently revised higher"" in 2023, a trend that could persist in 2024.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith"", '- How are you looking specifically at oil right now and where the supply demand dynamics are likely to move.', ""REBECCA BABIN: Yeah. So she brought up a couple great points. And the first is US supply growth. I think when analysts are looking at 2024, there's two numbers they're least confident in. The first is China demand, which they're very concerned is going to undershoot. And the second is US supply growth. In 2023, we saw the US really outperform most analysts' expectations on supply growth based on better efficiency, better use of capital, longer laterals."", ""So when we look at 2024, we are, and we're hearing this from the companies, they're expecting supply to continue to grow, but it's at a slower rate. And if the US grew a million barrels of supply last year, they're looking at something like 400,000 to 600,000 barrels of supply growth coming out of the US this year."", ""So that is really a key number. We got burned a little bit last year thinking supply growth would be capped in the US and they were able to kind of pull the rabbit out of the hat and really outperform. And so I think there is an expectation growth will slow down. But if you think about where analysts are looking at crude and looking at that very finely balanced market of 1.3 million barrels a day to 1.6 million barrels a day of demand growth and a very similar amount of non-OPEC supply growth, they're looking at the US as a potential to continue to outperform there."", ""It's really a tricky, tricky market in terms of nailing down those numbers. But I think most analysts are pretty confident that the market is well-supported and crude fundamentally kind of around that $70 a barrel in WTI. But they're very closely watching what's happening in China and what's happening with the US supply growth."", '- So then Rebecca, you mentioned staying in this sort of $70 range. Do you think then oil prices have peaked barring sort of any big movements or as you mentioned, the China factor here?', ""REBECCA BABIN: I actually don't think they've peaked. And here's the thing. Everyone seems to be very focused on these downside risks. US supply growth, China demand, and really kind of taking their eye off the ball of there are a couple of things that could go right for crude this year. We could actually see demand outperform. And if you look at the demand numbers in 2023, they consistently were revised higher from the weekly data that comes out from the EIA."", ""So we could continue to see this kind of worrying yourself into a lower market, but then seeing demand come in stronger. The second thing I'd say is we do have the SPR being refilled, they have been more active this year. There seems to be a commitment to continue to be active.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. I'm pleased to report our fourth quarter performance was very strong. For the fourth quarter, organic growth of 4.4% exceeded our expectations and full year organic growth was 4.1%. Excluding acquisition transaction fees related primarily to Flywheel. Operating profit margin for the quarter was 16.3%. For the full year, operating profit margin adjusted for certain non-GAAP items was 15.2%. Earnings per share for the quarter adjusted for acquisition transaction fees was $2.20, up 5.3% versus the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year, EPS adjusted for certain non-GAAP items was $7.41, an increase of 6.9% compared to the full year 2022.In 2023, we generated approximately $1.9 billion in free cash flow and returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our liquidity and balance sheet remain very strong and continue to support our primary uses of cash, dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions. On January 2, we closed the acquisition of Flywheel Digital, it is the biggest acquisition in Omnicom's history and brings scaled capabilities in the fastest-growing segments of the industry, retail, media and digital commerce. Flywheel enables brands to sell goods across digital marketplaces such as Amazon, Walmart, Alibaba and more than 100 other marketplaces around the world. Flywheel opens up an entirely new market opportunity for Omnicom, transforming us from an advertising and marketing focused company to a marketing and sales-focused company. We can now seamlessly integrate end-to-end services from brand media to precision marketing to e-commerce and in-store comers, ultimately delivering superior results for our clients.In January, we began combining Omni's audience and behavioral data with marketplace point of purchase sales data in Flywheel's Commerce Cloud, giving us an unmatched set of data not only to more effectively drive sales for clients, but to be fully able to measure return on advertising spend. It's a unique offering that no one has been able to achieve and our competitors can't match.I'm also proud to inform you that last week, Flywheel captured its first significant win as part of Omnicom, winning the highly owned e-commerce business in Europe from one of our competitors. This is a unique partnership and opportunity. In January, we welcomed CEO, Duncan Painter and more than 2,000 Flywheelers around the world to Omnicom, and we are excited about what we can achieve for our clients together. In the fourth quarter, we acquired Coffee & TV, a U.K.-based creative studio that specializes in CGI and visual effects. The acquisition is part of our strategy to leverage the scale of our production operations and launch a holistic suite of global content and production services under a single unit, Omnicom Content Studios. Omnicom Content Studios creates content for brands across all consumer experiences and touch points from long and short-form videos to social, experiential, digital and everything in between. In addition to these acquisitions, we continue to invest in high-growth areas through internal investments and partnerships. Last month at CES, we introduced several new ways to offer planning and measurement in the booming area of influencers. We announced several first-of-the-kind partnerships with TikTok, Google, Amazon and Meta to optimize the use of influencers, seamlessly integrate creator our assets in campaigns and measure influencer-driven commerce. In November, we announced the first mover collaboration with Getty Images that provides us early access to this new generative AI tool. It pairs Getty's library of creative content with Omni's data and AI technology. So our agencies can produce commercially safe and legally indemnified customized images for our clients. In 2023, we launched Omni Assist, a virtual assistant our people use to create, plan and execute ad campaigns using the trove of data in Omni. Omni Assist accesses OpenAI's GPT miles through Microsoft. As the first holding company and second company overall to be giving full access to OpenAI models in Microsoft Azure environment. we have a significant first-mover advantage, allowing us to experiment, prototype and launch applications within our platform before any other organization. Historically, we've invested tens of millions of dollars in AI. Going forward, generative AI investments and partnerships to enhance our platforms and educate our knowledge workers are expected to require greater resources. These investments will result in increased productivity and success for our clients. From e-commerce to influencers to generative AI, we are investing in all the areas that will shape the future of our industry. When these capabilities are combined with our legendary creativity, we remain positioned at the forefront of change in innovation. In new business, we had a very successful 2023. We secured record business with Amazon, Beiersdorf, HSBC, Jaguar, Land Rover, Novartis, Phillips, Telstra, Uber, Under Armour, Vans and Virgin Voyages among others. And we closed the year with exciting news that BMW consolidated its U.S. creative, digital and CRM and its media accounts with us. Before I discuss our outlook for 2024, I want to welcome the newest member of our Board of Directors, Casey Santos, who was recently appointed as an independent Director and a member of the Finance Committee. Casey joins one of the most diverse boards within the Fortune 500. Now at 11 members, our Board is proud to have 7 women and 6 diverse members. Casey's deep expertise in technology makes her a valuable addition to our Board.I also want to thank our people around the world for helping us successfully close out 2023. Your dedication and commitment to do outstanding work allow our agencies, clients and Omnicom to succeed. We entered 2024 from a position of strength, supported by our solid financial performance and balance sheet, new business wins and key strategic investments in the areas that will drive significant growth in the years ahead.While we continue to plan cautiously, given the uncertainties in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment based on current marketing conditions, we are targeting 2024 organic revenue growth between 3.5% to 5%. Our range of organic growth during the year will be impacted by new business won in the fourth quarter, which doesn't positively impact us until the second quarter and Flywheel's growth, which is typically stronger in the second half of the year. I'll now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at our financial results. Phil?"", 'Philip J. Angelastro', ""Thanks, John. We finished the year on a strong note in terms of revenue growth and profitability, even though the business environment was uncertain in 2023. As we look towards 2024, we're optimistic about the performance of our agencies and an improving economy. Let me spend a few minutes reviewing the financial details of the quarter, and then we'll open the lines up for questions and answers.Let's start with a review of our revenue performance on Slide 4. Organic growth in the quarter was 4.4%. The impact on foreign currency translation increased reported revenue by 1.2%. If rates stay where they are currently, we estimate the impact of foreign currency translation will be close to flat in Q1 2024 and for the full year.The net impact of acquisition and disposition revenue on a reported revenue was negative 0.7%, primarily reflecting the sale in Q2 of '23 of our research businesses. In 2024, we expect a positive contribution beginning in the first quarter with an increase of about 1.5% and about 2% for the full year, reflecting recent acquisitions and are having moved past recent dispositions. For the full year, organic revenue growth was 4.1%. This was in line with our revised guidance of 3.5% to 5%. We made some good progress toward this target despite a challenging comparison to 9.4% growth in 2022 and an uncertain macroeconomic environment during the year. As John discussed, organic revenue growth outlook for the full year 2024 is between 3.5% and 5%.Now let's turn to Slide 5 to review our organic revenue growth by discipline. During the quarter, advertising and media growth was very strong at 9.3%, once again driven by global media performance, which was partially offset by softer results from our advertising agencies. Precision marketing growth contracted 1.1%, reflecting a difficult comp to 11.5% growth in Q4 of 2022 and cycling some client spending reductions from earlier in the year. As we look forward to 2024, we expect this to once again be one of our fastest-growing disciplines. Commerce and branding grew by 1% compared to growth of 7.5% last year driven primarily by growth in specialty production to offset reductions in the quarter at our branding and commerce agencies. Experiential was down 8%, reflecting a difficult comp of 17% growth in Q4 of 2022 with the FIFA World Cup in Qatar, primarily offset by strong growth in Europe in the quarter.While quarterly results can be choppy based on the timing of certain client events. Experiential remains a solid business and is important to our clients' marketing plans. Execution and support declined by 0.4%, with mixed results that included a solid performance in field marketing. Public relations declined 2.9% in the quarter due to difficult comps related to the U.S. midterm elections of 2022 when growth exceeded 12% as well as softness in certain international markets. Finally, Healthcare continued its steady growth of 3.6% during the quarter. Turning to geographic growth on Slide 6. We saw growth in our 5 largest markets offset again by declines in Canada and the cyclical impact of experiential revenue in Middle East and Africa. The U.S. was up 0.6% in the quarter on solid performances by advertising and media, led by media, and our Healthcare businesses, offset primarily by execution and support, public relations and commerce and branding. Slide 7 shows our revenue by industry sector for the full year and the quarter. Looking at the full year, which tends to eliminate the volatility of client changes in the quarter. We saw a notable increase of 2 points in automotive and 1 point increases in both food and beverage and financial services. Weaker markets in technology and entertainment, which have been discussed widely in the industry over the course of the year, resulted in reductions of 3 points and 1 point, respectively.Now let's turn to Slide 8 for a look at our expenses. In the fourth quarter, salary and related service costs were higher due to increased staffing levels but were down as a percentage of revenue year-over-year, driven by our repositioning actions earlier in the year and through ongoing changes in our global employee mix. Third-party service costs increased in connection with the growth in our revenues. We generated profit on these costs and the higher levels in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to '22 were driven primarily by strong growth in our media business. Our disposition activity during the quarter and the year did not have much of an impact on this cost category. Third-party incidental costs were close to the same level as last year. And reflect client-related travel and incidental out-of-pocket costs that a bill declines directly at our cost with no profit. Occupancy and other costs were down in both dollar amount and relative to revenue, driven by ongoing rationalizations in our real estate portfolio. SG&A expenses were up primarily due to $14.5 million in professional fees related to acquisition costs incurred in the quarter, the majority of which related to Flywheel. Excluding these costs, quarterly SG&A levels were comparable to last year.Now let's turn to Slide 9 and look at our quarterly and annual income statement. To make the numbers more comparable. The table and footnotes describe some of the other adjustments that were made during this year and last year that we discussed on prior calls. Our operating income margin was negatively impacted by $14.5 million of costs in connection with the Flywheel acquisition, as I just discussed. Adjusting for this amount results in an operating income margin of 16.3% and an EBITDA margin of 16.8%.For the full year, our adjusted operating income margin was 15.2%, within our expected range of 15% to 15.4%. As a result of the Flywheel acquisition, we'll have higher levels of amortization expense than past years, and we will be focusing our margin expectations on EBITDA. We continue to expect integration costs as well as operating synergies related to the Flywheel acquisition during 2024. And the acquisition will be accretive to diluted EPS adjusted for amortization expense by the fourth quarter. For the full year 2024, we expect adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of reported revenue to be close to flat with last year. Also in this slide, you can see that our non-GAAP adjusted income tax rate of 26% for the full year 2023 was comparable to 2022. We do not expect the Flywheel business to change our tax rate outlook for 2024, but the 2024 rate will be negatively impacted, primarily related to increases in the statutory rates of certain international countries. For full year 2024, we expect our rates to approximate 27%.Acquisition costs related to Flywheel and better performance at agencies with minority shareholders contributed to a decrease in reported net income of 1%, but an increase of 2.1% and on an adjusted basis.Lastly, adjusted diluted EPS of $2.20 for the fourth quarter increased 5.3% from last year. For the year, adjusted EPS increased by 6.9%.Slide 10 is our cash flow performance for the year. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities excluding changes in operating capital. Free cash flow for 2023 was $1.9 billion, an increase of 6.5%. This increase was driven in part from operational improvements compared to 2022 and the use of operating capital, which we expect to improve further in the future.Regarding our uses of cash, we used $563 million of cash to pay dividends to common shareholders and another $71 million for dividends and noncontrolling interest shareholders. Our capital expenditures were $78 million, similar to last year. We expect 2024 levels to be higher due to growth investments at Flywheel. Total acquisition payments were $249 million. Although we closed the Flywheel acquisition on January 2, 2024, using cash on hand of approximately $845 million. It remains our intention, as we stated in the October 30 announcement to finance 2/3 of the purchase price with new debt, which I'll discuss in a moment.Finally, our stock repurchase activity, net of proceeds from stock plans was $535 million year-to-date within our expected range. Our capital allocation in 2024 will be consistent with our practice of returning cash to shareholders through a healthy dividend, making strategic acquisitions that lead to accelerated growth, and using a portion of residual cash to repurchase common stock. Since 2024 began with the closing of a larger-than-normal acquisition, we expect the total share repurchases in 2024 will approximate 50% of our recent average. Slide 11 is a summary of our credit, liquidity and debt maturities. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, the book value of our outstanding debt was $5.6 billion. There were no changes in outstanding balances during the quarter other than foreign exchange translations. Our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, which backstops our $2 billion U.S. commercial paper program remains undrawn, and our cash equivalents and short-term investments were $4.4 billion.We will continue to monitor the credit markets throughout 2024, and we expect to enter the debt markets to finance approximately $550 million or 2/3 of the $845 million we spent on Flywheel acquisition. And during the year, we will refinance the $750 million of 3.625% senior notes, which are due November 1, 2024.Financing the Flywheel acquisition will increase our interest expense in 2024. It's also likely that refinancing November notes will increase interest expense by some amount, but it is too early to estimate. For 2024, we expect that our internal financing of the Flywheel acquisition in early January with cash on hand prior to an expected financing of 2/3 of the purchase price, coupled with a decline in global interest rates. Will lead to lower interest income in 2024 compared to 2023.Slide 12 presents our historical returns on 2 important performance metrics for the 12 months ended December 31, 2023. Omnicom's return on invested capital is 26% and return on equity was 41%, both reflecting very strong performance. Healthy returns like these reflect the strength of our industry, our operating discipline and the preservation of our conservative balance sheet. Operator, please open the lines up for questions and answers. Thank you."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Cameron McVeigh with Morgan Stanley.', 'Cameron Alan McVeigh', 'How are you guys thinking about the cadence of growth in margins over the course of 2024 from what you can see now, the comp to ease as the year progresses when you have the Summer Olympics and the U.S. election in November. So curious any color you can provide on how you expect the year to shape up? And then I have a follow-up.', 'John D. Wren', ""Sure. Well, the comps in the first quarter remain probably the most difficult comps that we have going into the year, but it's not that as much as it is Flywheel, which we closed on January 2 is just seasonally natural at least stronger in the second half than the first. So that's one point. And as I said in my prepared remarks, A number of the new business wins we had late in the third quarter, early in the fourth quarter or throughout the fourth quarter. Whilst we won them and we have to ramp up our expenses in order to handle them with the notice periods, the companies that lost those accounts. We don't start getting revenue really until the second quarter or so. So the additive tailwind for that won't happen until then. You're absolutely correct that as we go through the year, if all goes well, the Olympics will add something to the revenue as will the U.S. elections add something as we get a little bit later into the second quarter than the third quarter. And there'll be a tail to it also in the fourth quarter. So that's kind of reflected in the range that we have given you. And we want to emphasize that whilst we expect this to ramp it didn't start ramping on January 1."", 'Philip J. Angelastro', ""Yes. I think I would just add that, I think, it's probably logical -- our margin expectations would kind of mirror that as the year goes on. And as performance builds, as John had said, you'll see some consistency in the performance of the margins as well."", 'Cameron Alan McVeigh', ""Great. Makes sense. And a question for Duncan. As you ran essential and built Flywheel, what are you excited about now that you're part of Omnicom, love your thoughts."", 'Duncan Painter', 'Yes. So well, firstly, Cameron, it\'s a pleasure to be here on the call. And I\'m delighted to be part of the leadership group at Omnicom. We had the chance to work alongside Omnicom for a long time for me 12 years. And we always admired the pride and the quality that they focus on always leading with the best-in-class quality products and services in the market. It was always very, very clear and having built a platform in Flywheel that focused on exactly the same, that was very important to us. And since we\'ve been here, it\'s really clear how this company really focuses on high-quality products and great service to customers. So there\'s a natural fit there. That all saying ""form is temporary, but class permanent"" is showing in the company. The other thing from our side is we really do think the scale of clients and the very early engagement we\'ve already had with the clients that Omnicom has, but they clearly have very trusted relationships with them is giving us great access to not just maintain our growth rates, but to have some sense that we\'ve got a chance to accelerate them, and that\'s exciting for us. And we\'re great to see that come through. And just the quality of our ability to just expand across a range of really high-quality clients. And then finally, and perhaps the most exciting for us and the thing that we -- that John alluded to in his presentation is that there\'s no doubt from our diligence upon the, it\'s a modern next-generation platform that has, by far, the largest scale trading data on the marketing side. And having built on the flywheel side, the biggest trading data platform on the marketplaces. We\'re really excited about the ability to combine that information. We think it\'s a unique opportunity, and it really is for the first time ever going to give clients the real ability to measure marketing sales in one go. So that\'s definitely the most exciting element that we see.', 'Operator', 'Next question will come from the line of David Karnovsky with JPMorgan.', 'David Karnovsky', ""John, some of your peers have pushed AI to the front of conversations recently and highlighted potential competitive advantages around data attack. I'm interested first, do you think as AI is integrated into the holding companies that real differentiation and execution is going to emerge that will be visible to clients? And then secondly, for Omnicom how do you think about the time line of moving from testing AI capabilities to deploying it in a way that is going to be visible to investors on the top line or in cost?"", 'John D. Wren', ""Sure. There's a lot to add. First of all, AI is just AI. We've been investing in that for close to a decade more seriously in the last 5 years, you see it reflected in Omni Assist. What they're really talking about is the impact of generative AI, I think, and what it's going to do to the entire landscape. And we've taken a view that it's going to make us more productive and make what I refer to as our knowledge workers, better, faster able to get come up with better answers and insights for our clients.It's unknown territory. One of the immediate concerns we had, and it's reflected in comments that I made earlier and it was released in November, when you look at AI and technology always travels faster than society's ability to absorb it and the laws and regulations that generally follow it. So making certain that we don't expose our clients to anything that can be -- create a problem because of its -- because it was handled improperly, is key. And the first move we made there was entering into the DoD images. So we're capable of accessing those and teaching our programs and platforms, how to utilize that in a fast and efficient way. And more of those type of arrangements are going to occur as we go forward.Also, I think because governments will be late in catching up with how they want to protect the consumer, we're going to have to tread very carefully. So I think our ability to do things will exceed whether or not we will use them to do things. And we're going to put the clients' interest and safety above all in that consideration set. In terms of bartering of products and things that we're doing, we already have a few clients who we're bartering products with who are very aware of the risks associated with it that we're going to break a few things. We're going to -- but at the end of the day, we're going to create a better, more efficient way. I'm going to throw the question to somebody who's sitting here as well. My colleague Paolo, who has been first and foremost in heads committees look at this. So Paolo?"", 'Paolo Yuvienco', ""David, thanks for the question. So just to get back to the first part of your question, I think the short answer is yes. And it's precisely the reason why artificial intelligence has been pervasively deployed across our industry-leading operating system, Omni, since we created it well over 5 years ago. And more specifically around generative AI, we spent the last 18 months working with really the titans in enterprise-ready generative AI, including the likes of Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Adobe, John mentioned Getty, we're having -- we've had first mover advantage with all of these partners really in testing and integrating their models to change and optimize the way we are delivering outcomes for our clients.So with over 50,000 people across Omnicom, both clients and our employees kind of using and have been provisioned access to Omni. We've already started to bring these capabilities to life, as John mentioned, on several clients and select accounts. And actually, to the second part of your question, we've actually launched these capabilities back in June of 2023 with Omni Assist. Omni Assist is utilizing those large language models, those defusion models. And they're already starting to make the jobs of our people easier and frankly, they'll work for our clients better."", 'David Karnovsky', ""Great. And then maybe one more. Just on the technology vertical, it's been a headwind across the industry for some time now. I think there's been some investor optimism that this could improve with easier comps for the year. Same time, we keep seeing layoffs in the technology space. I know it's been generally less an issue for Omnicom, but interested to know what you're seeing here and whether there's any read-through to business lines like precision marketing?"", 'John D. Wren', ""Certainly, there'll be easier comps. But as you suggest, I don't think in our prior calls, we've been moaning too much about the impact that technology has had whereas I think our competitors have had much greater hits, which probably means that they must have much easier comps going forward. But yes, we expect an uplift from the base of technology clients that we have in the forecast as it rolls through the rest of the year."", 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Adam Berlin with UBS.', 'Adam Ian Berlin', ""I'll ask two questions, if I can. The first one is, can you say a bit more about why advertising and media was so strong in the fourth quarter? Was it to do with account wins? Can you quantify how big the account wins were? And can you say something about how much was media and how much was created within that segment?"", 'John D. Wren', ""Well, I'll answer the second part of your question first. Media certainly was stronger in advertising, but we choose to treat it as one reporting entity when we put both of those numbers together because quite often, they've come together. More specific than that, I don't think is a protective way to look at the business. Yes, there are a lot of strength in the fourth quarter in media. There are a great number of projects and spending that was conservatively held back and then released into the fourth quarter, and we benefited from it, as you can see in the numbers. And I would say that was through the West including Western Europe."", 'Adam Ian Berlin', ""And can I ask one more question then about working capital -- about working capital. I know you exclude it from your free cash flow, but it was still quite a large number, $460-so-million. Do you expect that to come down in 2024? Or can you say a little bit about why it's still so high?"", 'Philip J. Angelastro', ""Sure. For the year, certainly, the change in working capital was positive, almost a $400 million improvement, which we're pretty satisfied with. I think relatively speaking, though, the overall negative reflects the fact that the actions of the Fed and over time, global treasuries have obviously made it a more challenging area to manage. I think the fact that we cut the change in half where we cut the number in half in 2023 is really reflective of good performance all throughout the organization. It's really a matter of 3 yards in a cloud of dust in terms of blocking and tackling to improve those numbers.We're certainly going to strive to get the number back to neutral, if not positive, as we go, but that isn't going to happen overnight. I think as the economic environment changes and as the rates eventually come down, I think you'll see some continued improvement. It's certainly an area we're very focused on and we're not done in terms of improving our performance. But it has been more challenging in the last few years than in the past."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from the line of Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo.', 'Steven Lee Cahall', ""Maybe to first just to expand on the question around advertising and media. So I think you talked about how creative has been lagging, and then you've had a lot of strength in media, and you've definitely showed off strong capability there and want a lot of business. John, I'm just wondering if there's anything bigger to read about how the industry is changing and the acceleration in media with the slowdown in creative, do you think that's a change in the way marketers just think about the future of marketing and marketing spend is much more about the delivery than the content? And if so, are there any other changes that you might think about to your business longer term, if that is, in fact, the case. And then just in Q4, your organic growth was pretty similar to what you've guided to for 2024. The EBIT margins were solid. They weren't necessarily up year-on-year. I know there's a lot of moving pieces then this year with Flywheel. But can you just talk about what's holding those margins a little flattish, like the guidance that you gave? And is there anything that could drive more margin expansion in the future?"", 'John D. Wren', ""Sure. There's a lot there. You bring up an interesting point, and I probably won't do justice to it in my response. But creative is our IP at the end of the day. What you see in a reflection or your guess as to the impact on the way that the business has been organized and then reported. What you see is technology has probably had a greater impact on the traditional setup of an agency in terms of how we can utilize great ideas and through algorithms and through automation, deliver those ideas to the right venue to present them to reach customers. And so that has an impact.That, in fact, is why we don't separate the 2 because they feed off each other. But I think one of the things that has always differentiated us is actually the quality of our creative products and the quality of our agencies and people that we're able to attract. And that's not to be diminished because some is trying to do an analysis, which doesn't -- is not really reflective of what we're trying to accomplish. And so you have to -- you do have to look at them jointly. And we fully expect that it's going to continue to shift. But to our benefit, as we bring other technologies and benefits to the client because any time we can save $1 and prove that we've saved it effectively for a client, then my experience that the client expands their relationship with us. So I'm very confident about that. I would never want to lose that IP that creative IP because of a shift in the way that I'm organized. The second question?"", 'Philip J. Angelastro', ""Yes, I'll give it to (inaudible) on margins and expectations. I think as we've said in the past, we certainly strive over time to make steady progress on margins and make improvements. Certainly, in our two of our largest expenses, salary and service costs and occupancy and other, we see future opportunities. Certainly, on the salary-related side, there's still quite a few initiatives we have benefit from offshoring and automation. There are strong initiatives that we're pushing, and we'll continue to push in those areas.And we continue to go through a real estate rationalization and expect to benefit from that over time as well, and we continue to make some improvements there. I think, however, we talked a lot about AI on this call. That will be part of what helps us be more efficient and generate some of these benefits. But at the same time, it requires investments that we're going to continue to make in the business that, as we've talked about in the past, many of the investments we've made have run through the P&L, it's the right thing to do to make sure that our platforms are ready to give us the sustainable growth that we've been able to achieve and expect to achieve in the future. So it's a continual balance that we go through in terms of making those investments and generating the appropriate returns from a margin perspective and benefits for our shareholders ultimately as well. So I think that's a balance that we continue to manage. We look at it every year. We look at it every day. It's both. So hopefully, that's helpful."", 'Operator', 'The next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.', 'Michael Brian Nathanson', ""I have one for Duncan and John and one for Phil. Duncan, can you give us a sense of your client mix, you see Omnicom kind of -- you know their clients and their exposures. Can you talk a bit a bit of your biggest clients for verticals you serve? And then John, this is a big deal to you obviously. Anything you said about channel conflict, client conflict. When you look at Duncan's list and yours and perhaps either the ability to upsell your common list of clients or any kind of challenges? And then Phil, over the years, we've asked you about media and then third-party service costs. This quarter looks like you grew media or the media line very, very quickly organically. But your service costs, we're actually pretty flat on a constant currency basis. Can you talk a bit about what's happening on the ground on margin when you dig into that sector between organic and service costs?"", 'John D. Wren', ""Sure. Conflicts really are not -- it's been quite a while since it really has become a topic or an item that concerns us. Most clients are very sophisticated these days, and they're more interested in the teams of people that are servicing them on a consistent basis. And we -- and I think you'd see this experience throughout the industry have been able to cope very comfortably with that because those people never meet, it's only at the holding company level that they get consolidated. With respect to sectors, there will be challenges and all, and there will be benefits in some, and some will have low comps, and some will have more difficult comps.The one area that has never been strong or as strong maybe as it could be for Omnicom is in CPG. And I think that with changes that we made first to the commerce group in terms of leadership, and then with the addition of Flywheel and the expertise that it brings, Omnicom now has thousands of more people who are confident in addressing the needs of CPG type of clients. And I think we'll be more competitive than we've been historically in that area as a result. So I'm very excited about that. We're still doing this. I think maybe, Duncan, if we turn it over to you first, if you want to comment on -- add some commentary on your side."", 'Duncan Painter', ""Yes. So yes, thanks for the question. Flywheel has always been very strong in CPG. We serve already 50 of the top 100, and we're already seeing opportunities for us to combine, as John says, both our capabilities and Omnicom's capabilities to further enhance those clients' experiences. And also Omnicom does have a client mix that helps us expand into a number of the LPGs we haven't served. So it's -- there's a good combination there. But actually, what's exciting for us is other categories where we've seen strong potential over time and Omnicom are very strong.And clearly, electronics is a big area. Tech and electronics, Omnicom has very good relationships there and primarily with the high-quality providers in those -- customers in those segments certainly, our ability to now work with potentially a number of the top 20 brands that actually sell through Amazon, for example, is very exciting. And then in addition to that, opportunities that are definitely coming through the business transformation for the industries, particularly around areas like automotive, where if you look at the secondary parts markets and secondary service markets of automotive, marketplaces are becoming -- it's one of the fastest growth segments in marketplaces. And of course, Omnicom is perfectly positioned to position us in with those kind of organizations trying to work out how they really maximize that opportunity. So yes, we can see both strength in our existing segments but actually opening up beautifully some new segments for us."", 'Philip J. Angelastro', 'And then on your last question, I think certainly, media experienced very strong growth in the fourth quarter and had a great year. That growth was pretty consistent and strong across most of the media businesses and agencies we have in most markets for a number of reasons. And certainly, some of what you see in third-party service costs is a result of the gross media businesses performing well also. There is a bit of a mix difference between those businesses within our media operation but they complement each other quite nicely. And I think we certainly have an offering that clients are very attracted to. And find very helpful and useful and valuable to meet their needs.', 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Tim Nollen with Macquarie.', 'Timothy Wilson Nollen', ""I've got a numbers question and a broader question as well. The numbers question is, if you could please comment a bit further on the shift in growth rates between the U.S. slowing in Q4 and a lot of international markets, it looks like accelerating Europe, Asia Pac. Just kind of curious, I heard what you said about the U.S. side, just maybe a bit more color on that. And then why conversely some of those international markets like they accelerated year-over-year? And then the broader question is about cookie deprecation and all the changes that Google is perhaps bringing about this year. I just wonder what your take is on the likelihood of cookies ending up being fully deprecated by year-end or some of the recent news flow is perhaps holding up progress there. Just curious how engaged Omnicom agencies may be in the privacy sandbox?"", 'John D. Wren', ""Sure. When you look at where the strength was, the fourth quarter really has 3 components to it. It's clients releasing projects, new business wins in its impact, and then if you've lost anything where you're feeling that impact as you net down to what we report as organic growth. I'd say that -- the project work came in very strong, stronger than we expected in some parts of Western Europe. And we have a thesis about why, but it's certainly not something we plan for. It came in decently in North America. But North America, is where we were cycling through a number of losses that occurred in the advertising sector over a year ago.And when you lose something that's bad news, but then you have to live with it as you cycle through it. So all that is the alchemy of how you get to organic growth and as a result, that makes us -- we're still cautious about this year because of all the unrest and the Fed hasn't really started reducing rates yet. But in terms of what issues we had, they're for the most part, behind us. And some of the new business wins have not -- we haven't started benefiting from yet. So I'm very comfortable that 2024 will probably wind up looking more traditional than 2023 did. In terms of cookie deprecation, that's something we've been fully expecting for a very long time, but I could chat about it, but I'm going to throw it to Paolo because he's more of an expert and more closely deals with it on a day-to-day basis."", 'Paolo Yuvienco', ""Yes. So as John said, we have been expecting it for a very long time. And to predict if it's going to actually happen at the end of this year, I mean, frankly, your guess is as good as ours, but we've been preparing for it, and we're ready for it. In fact, Omni has been purpose-built to actually address a cookie-less world just with respect to third-party cookies on Google. So in addition to that, we've been preparing in other ways like some of the deals that we've struck with clean rooms and the integration into various clean rooms that are helping us to facilitate first-party data. And then, of course, the acquisition of Flywheel and all the data that they bring directly from the marketplaces, that is helping to drive a better understanding of consumers without the need of those third-party cookies."", 'Operator', 'And the next question comes from the line of Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners.', 'Craig Anthony Huber', ""John, I wanted to hear your thoughts, if I could, on 2 sectors: your pharmaceutical health care area, what your outlook is for this upcoming year. It's obviously been very steady growth for a number of years. And also your thoughts on the auto sector. It looks like you had a very good year. Last year, you won the BMW account recently and stuff. How optimistic are you about auto sector for you guys this upcoming year? And I have a follow-up for Phil."", 'John D. Wren', ""Sure. Pharma, we remain very optimistic on. The only headwind I think we face as we go into '24 with Pharma was earlier in the year, we lost Pfizer, so we'll be cycling through that. But the only limitations we are currently looking through, not things that we haven't won or we haven't been asked to work on, but have they gotten through the FDA because pharma -- and just the simple science of things in the events that are occurring give us tremendous opportunities to continue to grow. And I think that will be not only '24 but '24 and beyond a very strong sector for us.Autos, when it comes down to is we're very well represented in autos, and I think we have the best clients one could ask in the sector. There is this tension going on in the marketplace that most auto OEMs are dealing with in terms of what's the mix between the electric cars that we're going to put out in the market, more conventional cars and hybrid. And there's a lot of decision-making and a lot of long lead times that go into that. But in terms of the sector itself, there's no question. It becomes an information platform for the OEMs as we go forward and the more merrier from my perspective. And as Duncan mentioned, now with the addition of Flywheel, there was a whole sector of aftersales parts that we could do a modest job on, but now we can do a much more robust job when you look through how those goods are distributed to the ultimate consumer, which is, in many cases, and then increasingly in marketplaces.So it's been a strong sector. It should even get stronger for us as we extend into that over the coming months and years, and we're very comfortable with it."", 'Craig Anthony Huber', ""And then, Phil, just I can just ask 2 quick housekeeping things. How would you sum up how your project-related work did for the whole company in the fourth quarter versus a year ago? And then a nitpick question, your amortization for a number of quarters here has been sitting around $20 million. How much do you think it's going to go up here with this Flywheel acquisition? Do you have that handy?"", 'Philip J. Angelastro', ""We don't have the final number because there's a number of steps that we have to complete, given the acquisition just closed in early January. So we have some valuations and other things to do on the intangible assets, which aren't complete. I would say it's going to be a meaningful increase, no question and amortization expense. And we obviously think the value of the Flywheel asset and team are going to prove to be a very wise investment. But amortization is going to go up in a meaningful way. We just don't have a number yet to guide you with, but that's something we're working through and we'll be working through quite diligently over the next few weeks and months before we finalize it.And then as far as project spend goes, I think similar to Q4 of '22, project spend was quite strong but probably not as strong as '22. '22, for sure, was a much more robust time frame. I think when we were -- when we were having discussions in late '22 and early '23 and probably on our call in January -- February '23. Yes, there are a lot of clouds that people saw on the horizon in the short term that actually turned out not to be as dark as some had expected. But the fourth quarter environment in 2022 is certainly much more robust than it was this year. But we're happy with the performance our agencies as far as capturing project spend in Q4 of '23. But relative to '22, certainly on '22 is more robust."", 'John D. Wren', ""And don't lose sight of the fact that in '24 as we get into it, we do have the Olympics. We do have a presidential election, and it's been my experience that presidential election years are generally very good one way or the other for the economy, and there gets to be some tension in the media marketplaces, especially in the U.S. as you get later in the year. So that makes people -- forces people to make decisions sooner. And if the Fed comes through and starts to cut, that will be the beginning of, I think, fuel to aid in the outcomes that I just suggested will be there. So we're cautious, but we are optimistic."", 'Operator', 'And with that, at this time, there are no other further questions. That does conclude our conference for today.

Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) stock rose 98% in 2023 -- higher than any of its Dow Jones cohorts."", ""The company's visionary CEO, Marc Benioff, could be viewed as a specialist in mergers and acquisitions. Although Salesforce has long been a staple for sales and marketing professionals, the company is quickly making inroads into other areas of enterprise software. From data analytics to workplace productivity tools, Salesforce is evolving into a more sophisticated business -- and artificial intelligence (AI) is front and center in this growth story."", ""Let's dig into what fueled Salesforce's growth last year and assess why further returns could be in store for 2024 and beyond."", ""Salesforce is no stranger to acquisitions. In more recent history, the company has completed deals with MuleSoft, Tableau, and Slack.

By bolstering its CRM with other software tools, the company has undoubtedly been able to better cross-sell to customers while simultaneously broadening its total addressable market.', ""However, acquisitions often come with complex integration efforts that can take a toll on a company's growth trajectory.

Moreover, data is more important than ever for leadership to make informed, efficient decisions. As such, businesses are going to need a full spectrum of analytics tools, communication instances, and storage applications to connect and share data among different enterprise software suites.', 'The power of AI and its myriad use cases is allowing Salesforce to take its acquired properties to the next level, and help its customers reach a level of flexibility that it does not yet have.', ""The potential for AI to improve Salesforce's business looks promising. The company is relentlessly innovating and releasing new features across its portfolio, and is using AI as its primary marketing driver. With that said, the run-up in the stock should not go unnoticed. While Salesforce appears to be maturing as a business, the company's margin expansion and cash flow generation still have a long way to go."", 'At a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 8.4, Salesforce is trading at a slight premium to its 10-year average based on this metric. Nevertheless, despite its market-beating return in 2023, I do not see the hype of AI as fully baked into the stock.', 'Salesforce is in a solid position to benefit from increased spending in generative AI, and its diversified software suite certainly helps differentiate the company from other workplace productivity solutions.

MSI is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 8, after the closing bell. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 5.6%. It pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 5.6%, on average.The Chicago, IL-based company is expected to have recorded year-over-year higher revenues on the back of growth in both segments — Products and Systems Integration and Services and Software. It benefits from the increasing demand for its mission-critical technologies in North America and globally.', ""During the to-be-reported quarter, Motorola secured a contract from Lithuanian police to deploy the M500 in-car video system to augment the situational awareness and safety of their officials. The M500 in-car system, integrated with AI, incorporates industry-leading video technology with sharp sensors that enhance the clarity of vision, both during the day and night, as well as inside and outside of the vehicle. This is likely to have generated incremental revenues during the quarter.In the quarter, Cologne Bonn Airport opted to upgrade its TETRA (terrestrial trunked radio) digital radio communication infrastructure, leveraging Motorola’s TETRA solution portfolio. Along with enhanced flexibility and security, this system provides greater scalability, capable of supporting a single site to a network spanning 5000 sites. The solution also comes with multi-layered cyber defense features that incorporate regular security updates, operating system patching, anti-virus and more.During the quarter, New South Wales State Emergency Services opted to deploy Motorola’s SmartConnect to enhance mission-critical radio communications infrastructure. Engineered for excellent coverage and ensuring connectivity beyond the boundaries of a network, it allows safety workers' radio systems to utilize in-vehicle LTE or satellite modems for seamless remote access without interruptions. These are likely to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.During the fourth quarter, Motorola augmented its mobile video portfolio with the launch of LTE-enabled V500 body-worn cameras for improved safety and security of frontline officers. With critical real-time field intelligence to emergency response backed by LTE connectivity, the cameras facilitate security personnel to respond quickly and efficiently to any adverse situation. In addition to live streaming facilities for enhanced situational awareness with 128GB storage capacity, it speeds up evidentiary workflows by enabling officers to tag footage from the camera and send it to the backend software immediately.Riding on such state-of-the-art products, Motorola expects to record strong demand across video security and services, land mobile radio products and related software while benefiting from a solid foundation. These systems drive the demand for additional device sales and promote software upgrades and infrastructure expansion. The comprehensive suite of services ensures continuity and reduces risks related to critical communications operations. These developments are expected to have positively impacted its performance in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Products and Systems Integration segment’s revenues is pegged at $1,835 million. The figure indicates a rise from $1,810 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. Our estimates for revenues from this segment stand at $1,816, implying 0.3% year-over-year growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Services and Software segment’s revenues is pegged at $980 million, up from $896 million recorded in the year-earlier quarter. Our estimate for revenues from this segment stands at $990, suggesting 10.5% year-over-year growth. \xa0For the December quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2,814 million, which indicates growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of $2,706 million. The consensus estimate for adjusted earnings per share stands at $3.63, which suggests an increase from $3.60, driven by top-line growth."", 'Our proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Motorola in the fourth quarter.

Intel is betting that integrating dedicated AI hardware into its CPUs will give it an edge and boost demand for PCs, while Microsoft is unleashing AI-powered assistants to supercharge its Windows operating system.', ""The two strategies don't quite converge. Intel's latest Meteor Lake laptop CPUs include powerful AI hardware capable of enabling AI features in third-party software, but there's not nearly enough horsepower to drive something like OpenAI's GPT-4, the advanced large language model that Microsoft uses for its Copilot AI assistant. Microsoft's AI assistants thus call out to a cloud service for processing."", ""Two downsides of using a cloud service are latency and cost. It takes time for a cloud-based AI model to respond, especially if it's overloaded with requests. This latency impacts the user experience. It's also expensive. While Microsoft offers a basic version of Copilot for free, Copilot Pro is priced at $20 per user per month for those already subscribed to its cloud-based Microsoft 365."", 'For software developers looking to integrate AI into their products, there are two options: Run the AI processing locally and incur no ongoing cost, or call out to a cloud service and pass that cost onto the user. For free software, the first option is the only viable one.', ""Intel is likely to include AI hardware in most of its future CPUs, and that hardware will become more powerful over time. But AI PCs will also need far more memory to run advanced AI models locally. That's where memory chip manufacturer Micron (NASDAQ: MU) comes in."", 'The memory chip industry is pulling out of a severe downturn that saw demand and prices plummet. One thing that will help firm up pricing is the soaring demand for the ultra-fast memory used by AI accelerators running in cloud data centers. As Micron and its competitors prioritize this memory, the supply of standard memory chips destined for PCs will languish.', 'While this will boost prices in the short term, the requirements of the AI PC will drive up demand in the long term. Laptops that come with just 8 GB of random-access memory (RAM) are still common today, but Microsoft has reportedly indicated that any Windows PC must have at least 16 GB of RAM to be called an AI PC.', ""Even 16 GB doesn't get you very far. A large language model powerful enough to be useful as an AI assistant can require far more memory. The Llama 2 family of AI models created by Meta, for example, requires 30 GB of RAM at a minimum for the scrawniest variant, and 320 GB for the beefiest version."", ""Intel's push to include AI hardware in its CPUs will eventually enable powerful AI assistants to run on PCs without the need for cloud-based AI services. This will require vast increases in the amount of RAM inside a typical PC, a boon for Micron."", 'Even if it takes years for the AI PC to gain traction, Micron can benefit now from strong demand for memory chips used in powerful AI accelerators that train and run AI models in the cloud.', ""While Micron is a clear beneficiary of the AI revolution, it's important to remember that memory chips are a commodity, and pricing is a function of supply and demand. Predictions for the size of the AI accelerator market are extremely optimistic. AMD, for example, expects $400 billion of AI accelerators to be sold in 2027."", ""It's these kinds of pie-in-the-sky forecasts that will plant the seeds of the next downturn in the memory chip industry. As supply is ramped up to meet expected demand, all it takes to produce a price-stomping glut of memory chips is for these forecasts to prove slightly too optimistic."", ""The size of the market for memory chips is likely to rise as the demands of AI, both in the cloud and on personal devices, push up the memory chip content in PCs and servers. But pricing, and thus Micron's profitability, depends on demand relative to supply."", ""Micron is in a great position to benefit from the growth of AI, but that doesn't necessarily mean that its profits will soar permanently higher. That's something investors must understand before buying the stock."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Micron Technology wasn’t one of them.

Consequently, AMD could significantly profit from increased demand for AI-equipped PCs, carving out its own niche in the burgeoning AI market.', ""In its fourth quarter, AMD's revenue rose 10% year over year to $6 billion, beating analysts' expectations by about $60 million. The company's AI-focused data center segment posted revenue growth of 38%. Meanwhile, improvements in the PC market boosted AMD's client segment by 65% year over year."", ""Earnings were positive.

Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As we share the results of our fiscal second quarter, I'm pleased to share our strong results supported by innovation, new logos and expansion of our existing accounts around the world. In Q2, our cloud ARR grew to $256.1 million, up 34% year over year cloud now represents 70% of our total ARR of $365 million in the quarter, we earned SaaS and support revenue of $77.1 million, up 25% year over year and total revenue of $103.9 million, up 23% year over year. We released new applied AI capabilities. And we built on the initial success of our industry solutions strategy during the quarter, and we announced that our inaugural Investor Day will take place February 22nd date also marks our intelligence applied launch dates. We will unveil a host of new applied AI capabilities as well as our AI roadmap and a new brand identity to our clients, partners, and investors. We're excited to share these developments with all of you.Now I'll share a few highlights from our fiscal second quarter. First, I'll talk about innovation. As I've mentioned, Intel has been embedding industry-specific AI. throughout our platform and solutions for more than 10 years now, we've infused our solutions with AI technology, including automation, machine learning, deep learning and now generative AI to help our clients use their data to improve critical processes and make better faster decisions.During this quarter, we enhanced our relationship intelligence feature with new AI capabilities that automate contact and co-creation within deal club feature captures key contacts and companies directly from client interactions, enriches and validate information via third party data and then adds it directly to the platform. This helps professionals prioritize and act on their most promising opportunities and helps keep the entire Firm's latest insights and relationships up to date. It's another example of our zero entry philosophy, we're delivering greater value to busy professionals while the leaving them from manual tasks or typing. We're now deploying this at firms ranging from 10 to 5,000 seats, including one of the largest firms in the world who is using the solution across 40 countries. A great example from this quarter is McCain's lawyers who added relationship intelligence to their deal cloud instance, to support their lawyers as they deepen their relationships with clients.As I mentioned at the top of the call, we'll be revealing a broad set of AI capabilities at intelligence applied launch day on February 22, we will showcase how generative AI can help our clients drive incremental productivity, enable broader firmwide transformation and do so with compliance and trust during Q2. We worked closely with firms in our AI early adopter program to use and provide feedback on these new features, which we're excited to now bring to all our clients working closely with our clients to understand their needs has always been integral to Internap's product development approach. We're ensuring that new applied AI capabilities are purpose built for our client firms most pressing and industry-specific needs.We're also continuing to expand our portfolio of industry solutions. We're growing our capabilities for each of the sub verticals that we serve with specific deal cloud blueprint that enables best practices using applied AI, we delivered new blueprints for legal, private equity and fund to funds. The latest release also included several enhancements to existing footprints as well as an accelerated deployment path for clients seeking best practices and an even faster time to value. We also extended our Blueprint strategy to our data Cortex technology, which supports faster integration with our many data partners helping both new and existing clients enrich their data with critical market and contact intelligence. Our initial win rates, accelerated deployments and increased client satisfaction to show us that our industry solutions strategy of packaging best practice blueprints will serve us well and drive growth. As an example, this quarter Rhone group, a transatlantic private equity firm, selected deal cloud to replace its aging homegrown CRM using our private equity blueprint clients. Leveraging these blueprints deploy in roughly half the time and gain access to the best practices. We have learned over thousands of deployments with dozens more blueprints in the pipeline. We intend to build on our successes with continued expansion and enhancement of this offering.Okay. Moving to Q2 wins and implementations, I'll share some examples of how we're continuing to grow our client base and expand existing accounts. I'm pleased to share that we again welcomed new clients across every vertical that we serve.Here are just a few highlights in our investment banking client base. Global investment banking firm, Livingstone Partners replaced a legacy cloud-based CRM with SteelCloud due to lack of adoption among their professionals. They were impressed by SteelCloud tailored platform and numerous Microsoft integrations, and they anticipate significant efficiency gains. We saw expansion in our consulting client base with new logos that included these two firms global consulting firm, AlixPartners selected deal cloud to replace a legacy CRM with technology purpose-built for the complexity of their work. The firm's corporate development team will have greater visibility into pipeline, I'd be better able to execute deals and private equity focused consulting firm Accordion also recently selected SteelCloud to support their growth strategy and promote collaboration among teams. They chose us over a generic cloud-based CRM because of our expertise in the market and our software has the ability to suit their specific needs. We have also seen marked growth in the legal market this quarter with the addition of several new clients, including Panama based Galindo, RES and Lopez for selective entire time to take advantage of our automated time capture functionality UK-based Marianne Harrison selected Internap time after deciding they required a more efficient, reliable, cloud-based time tracking system and US-based portfolio. Bromberg and Neumune selected Internap conflicts to help automate the processes associated with managing the firm's high volume of conflicts. Additionally, cross-selling and upselling successes in our existing accounts continue to drive net revenue retention.Let me go through a few expansion examples global law firm and long-time intact risk and compliance client Baker box recently replaced a large legacy CRM with deal club firms selected deal cloud to support its strategic growth plans in the tech and energy sectors. Steelcloud, intuitive interface and relationship intelligence capabilities helped drive their selection. The firm believes they'll help its lawyers, develop new business, deepen client relationships and take market share from its competitors, investment banking firm and deal size. Client Union Square advisors selected our employee compliance offering to replace their previous solution. They chose our software as it offered an easier more modern way to automate personal compliance tests and monitor trade activity. And we continue to see success at the world's largest accounting and consulting firms. One of our existing global accounting clients uses in test solutions across multiple geographies and has now expanded its use of SteelCloud to its Ireland and U.K. based corporate finance team, SteelCloud will replace the division's legacy CRM, which had proved challenging to maintain and lacked adoption. Steelcloud was selected over two large horizontal CRM options based on our ability to deliver capabilities tailored to their transaction advisory business this is a great example of the power of our industry solution blueprints to meet the specific needs of even the largest and most complex professional.Finally, cloud wins and implementations continued to affirm our strategy as shown to a number of new Enpath time migrations in the quarter. These include an analog top 10 firm, which purchase intent time in the cloud to benefit from features like automated data capture, mobile time entry and compliance. Tom Alan, an over-read one of the world's top law firms, which typically uses on-prem solutions, completed a straight to cloud implementation for Internet time and one of the world's largest international law firms completed its migration of Intact time from on-prem to the cloud.In conclusion, we're proud of our strong second quarter performance, and we're optimistic about our continued growth opportunities. As our Q2 highlights illustrate, we continued to grow by adding new purpose-built capabilities to our platform, positioning us to help lead our industries to harness the power of generative AR, and we can't wait to share our new applied AI capabilities, AI road map and new brand identity in greater detail.Just a few weeks from now, we see continued opportunity to drive growth, adding new clients across a broad TAM and expanding within our existing client base. We're serving a durable end market with our subscription revenue model and industry-specific cloud platform, we have a great growth opportunity to drive AI, cloud adoption and modernization across all the industries we serve. As always, I'd like to thank our clients, our partners, our investors, our Board and our global Intel team for their teamwork and dedication. We hope you all join us on the 22nd for our Investor Day.

With that, let me turn it over to Dave to share our Q2 results."", 'David Morton', ""Thanks, John, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I'm pleased to report our solid second quarter performance, driven by strong revenue growth, expanding customer base and enhanced operational efficiency within the quarter. These achievements collectively position us to extend our leadership as we embark on an exciting market opportunity in fiscal Q3 and Q4 of 2024 and beyond.Best and support revenue was $77.1 million, up 25% year over year, reflecting sales to new clients and expansion of existing clients from both cross-selling and upselling sales motions. Subscription license revenue was $14.1 million, up 29% year over year, largely due to several large clients opting for multi-year on-premises renewals. Total recurring revenue was $91.3 million, up 26% year over year. Professional services revenue was $12.7 million. We experienced a modest 5% year-over-year increase. This growth rate is in line with our deliberate strategic shift to deemphasize professional services opting instead to better leverage the strength of our partner network and the success of our industry solutions further contributes to clients realizing quicker time to value through an expedited implementation process.Total revenue was $103.9 million, up 23% year over year, driven primarily by sales of our cloud solutions and growth of subscription license revenue. Our international businesses provides a growth opportunity to further expand and invest in the use of our platform outside of the US as revenue from our international operations remained strong, contributing approximately 30% of total revenue for fiscal Q2, Q2 non-GAAP gross margin was 73.4% as compared to 71.5% in the prior-year period. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $68.6 million, a $10.9 million increase year over year as we continue to invest in go-to-market and product development to support our growth as we continue to focus on our operational efficiency. Non-GAAP operating profit was $7.6 million as compared to $2.8 million in the prior-year period. And non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.11 in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to $0.03 in the prior-year period. Free cash flow, which is defined as our cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, was $11.8 million for the second quarter or 11% of total revenue. We exited the quarter with $166.4 million of cash and cash equivalents.Turning to our key metrics. Cloud ARR was up 34% year over year, and total ARR was up 21% year over year. Total remaining performance obligations were $447.6 million, up 15% year over year. Overall, we continue to execute our land-and-expand model, ending the quarter with more than 2,400 clients, 649 of which had a IRR of at least 100 k, up from 561 and prior-year period. Our net revenue retention rate underscores our ability to retain and steadily expand business with our existing customers. This key metric was 115%, which continues to track within our range of 113% to 117%.Now turning to our outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect bath and support revenue between 80 and $81 million, total revenue in the range of 107.5 to $108.5 million. Non-GAAP operating profit in the range of six to $7 million and non-GAAP EPS results of $0.06 to $0.08 using a diluted share count weighted for the quarter of approximately 81 million common shares outstanding for the full year fiscal 24, we expect we are increasing our SaaS and support revenue of between 312 and $316 million and due to our intentional shift in the revenue contribution mix, specifically reducing the emphasis on professional services, we are maintaining our total revenue in the range of 422.5 to $426.5 million. We also expect non-GAAP operating profit to be in the range of 27 to $31 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.31 to $0.35 using a diluted share count weighted for fiscal year '24 of approximately $81 million common shares outstanding. And as previously noted, Intact will be hosting our inaugural Investor Day on February 22.During this event, we will discuss our key strategic imperatives metrics, financial targets, while providing a comprehensive overview of our company's trajectory and future plans. We look forward to sharing valuable insights with stakeholders on the significant occasion.Thank you, and I will now turn the call back to the operator."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Koji Ikeda, Bank of America.', 'Koji Ikeda', 'John, Dave, thanks for taking the questions. A couple from me. First one, I am excited to hear about the AI. launch day and wanted to actually follow up on a monetization question. I asked you last year at our tech conference. So thinking about this AI. launch day, how are you planning on monetizing these new Air Products? Or are you introducing new premium SKUs?I mean, are the add-on SKUs or something else? Any sort of color there would be helpful,', 'John Hall', ""Koji. Thank you. Yes, we will have a mix. So some of the capabilities will be included in our offerings that people have subscriptions today, but we will also be introducing additional skews based on some of the more advanced capabilities that clients have been asking for. So we're going to do both Got it."", 'Koji Ikeda', 'Got it.Wanted to shift the next question over to net revenue retention once again in the range here of one 13, one 17, just kind of trying to triangulate a little bit of the contributions of net revenue retention, maybe split between a couple of vectors, your professional services versus financial services and then maybe of the cross-sell of deal cloud versus anything else, how all those are playing into net revenue retention?', 'John Hall', ""You had stated to lock in some additional color to that at our upcoming Investor Day. I don't want to front run any of was key metrics also articulating what that had been around looks like spur off prem as well, albeit not everything is created equal. And clearly those that are advancing at a quicker rate of pace on the off-prem cloud solution native solution. Obviously, that should have a higher clip rate."", 'Koji Ikeda', 'Got it. Thank you. Looking forward to the Investor Day. Thanks so much.', 'Operator', 'Steve Enders, three line.', ""Okay, great.Thanks for taking the questions and for having me on you on the call today on, I guess, maybe just two sections of our own intrigued to hear more of what's coming down the pipe on the AI side that as you think about the opportunity within your customers?Yes, I feel that what gives you the right to win for this AI use cases and what ends up becoming the differentiator for us in the marketplace versus other providers that might be? Are you targeting the use cases that you're going after?"", 'John Hall', ""Yes. Thanks, Steve, and welcome. We're excited to be working with you, the positioning of the company overall and the positioning of our applied AI strategy are the same, which is we specialize in these professional and financial services firms. The way that they work the uniqueness of the partnership model and the high end advisors and investors that work in these firms and the way that they work on complex deals, engagements matters and our whole angle on applied AI is to build all the capabilities of AI technologically into specific industry solutions that meet the needs of each of the practice areas. Each of the deal types, you should the investment strategy teams in a way that feels compelling to the professional because somebody has really taken the time to understand how they work. And it's a huge differentiator for us that we've built the whole company with both technologies from Silicon Valley, but also a huge population of people who have come from these firms themselves. So that the solutions that we design for the end users really speak directly to them when they see it for the first time. And the same thing for the applied AI generation of our industry solutions."", ""Okay, perfect. That's that's a couple of contracts there. And then maybe just on the outlook here, just to make sure that we're thinking about the puts and takes in the right way. It seems like there's a shift going away from from services, and that's the main headwind or impact. But how should we be thinking about what that shift would be looking like over time and how conservative that effort is to drive, I guess, more margin out of that as well."", 'John Hall', ""Now for sure, Steve, I think it over the long term. As we continue to model out, obviously, we'll be looking to partner more and more with the economy that we continue to build up with the likes of partners within our ecosystem. And so I think you started seeing some early innings to that. Obviously, we're going to continue to be at the forefront and touch point with our respective clients you're thinking more about longer-term models, I see SAP versus a revenue driver. And then we're also our path to breakeven margin within that specific our profile. And so as we continue to look at the respective levers, both from growth factors as well as contribution margin. That is something that we'll continue to work on longer term. But the overall value and narrative on this. This value asset is clearly on our SaaS growth, which continues to do very, very well and continues to be very, very durable.Yes, Herb, I think taking the question thank you. One moment, please.Our next question comes from the line of Doug Royal of JPMorgan. Your line is open.Hey, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the results also looking at sales and marketing seeing a bit of a decel in growth here.So maybe a question. How are you thinking about balancing investing in growth versus realizing profitability?Yes. It's a great question. I would say we've already started our FY. 25 planning on as we continue to look at the envelope and the scope that we're under today. As well as looking at productivity and areas for continued opportunity going forward. And so it's always going to be a balance and driving that additional leverage. And we think we can continue to scale, not only with the investments that we've made over the past year or two and then continue to monetize that and hopefully see the rate of pace go from there.Great."", 'David Throne', 'Thank you so much.', 'Operator', 'Alex Gala of Raymond James.', ""Great. Thank you, John and Dave, it's a two-part question on SteelCloud. You did some brand consolidation efforts last year. There's some nice wins that you announced in prepared remarks this quarter. So John, first for you. Can you just talk about how much deal cloud drove those wins versus kind of what your prior offering was to the pro professional services market in the past?And David, any financial benefit you've seen so far in the model from that brand consolidation?Thanks."", 'David Morton', ""Thanks, Alex. Yes, we consolidated our brands at the time of our IPO. We had a brand and professional services called one place that had a history that a lot of firms knew, but the technology that it even it represented was dual cloud technology. And we got we started getting a lot of inbound calls from folks in the legal accounting consulting industries asking for SteelCloud by name. So we just made a pragmatic decision to say we can simplify branding here and get some leverage word of mouth on deal cloud across our whole market. And so it was a change for some of the people who had gone with the one place branded initially, but it wasn't a technology change. It was a brand change. And there's a lot of excitement now because we have a broader community of field cloud users that are coming together at our events, our user conferences, our advisory boards, who are all sharing best practices across these firms. There's been a lot of enthusiasm that we actually have uncovered an underserved community here who have different professional specialties with a lot of deep expertise in each area. But if you actually step back and look at the way that the firms go to market. They pursue opportunities in the marketplace and pursue clients that huge network of relationships among all these people. It's not a linear sales model. All these firms share a very networked model going to market uncovering opportunities through referrals and each other they love talking to each other. So I actually think the brand consolidation has turned out to be a net positive for Delta. And we were excited to be able to name a bunch of customers this quarter who I'm very grateful said, hey, you could talk about us because there's a there's a growing community of folks who really see this as the next generation and now that we're bringing the applied AI in in relationship intelligence, which I talked about specifically, but more broadly to the deal cloud platform and the rest of the offerings that we have. There's a lot of enthusiasm for SteelCloud coming in. So you'll see some more work on the brand simplification as we as we come out on February 22nd, because we really want to help everyone share in that word of mouth across the marketplace. That's working for us.And I would say that's probably where you're going to see that manifest in the P&L. The most is that opportunity, cost of winning and being able to focus all your efforts as we continue to cross-sell and upsell across our various industries that we serve using the same technology.Okay."", ""That's great color. Look for more. They're all in the coming quarters.And John, the other thing you mentioned under the new Blueprint strategy or that somewhat new Blueprint strategy, initial win rates is something that you're seeing track higher as one of the one of the few positive early development thoughts on the prepared remarks, can you just elaborate on what you saw in terms of win rates versus prior quarters from that strategy."", 'John Hall', ""The experience when you come in and you show a blueprint that specialized in the previous quarter, we talked about private credit. And this quarter we expanded our fund-to-funds blueprint. You're getting more and more specific to each of the professional teams and the way that they talk in the way that they work and recognize they see that you have a solution that really understands them. And not only do you have a broad universe of 24 hundred clients, which about 100 clients just like them and the types of work that they do. And it just makes a huge psychological impression at the first moment to really appreciate our industry expertise. But then it also gives confidence that we're going to be able to deploy and get them up and running quickly. And so a lot of it is time to value for them as well as the confidence that we're going to have to support them and enable them over time. So we have seen strong responses, both at the early end of the funnel and in any competitive conversations that come in later in the process when people need to show that they've shopped. There's just nothing like what we are showing to this type of professionals we deploy. So we're very enthusiastic about this blueprint strategy and we're going to do more. It helps on win rate, helps on time to value. It helps on services and getting our costs down to help people be successful. And that's part of the model here. So we're big believers that where this is going. And then now the whole applied AI strategy is rolling under this blueprints idea. So we really want to bring applied AI out specific to each of the professionals workflow again."", ""That's super helpful context.Thank you both."", 'Operator', 'Saket Kalia of Barclays.', ""Okay, great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here.How are you and it's good to talk to you a journey.They've apologies in advance here if some of these questions have been asked us to kind of happen in a couple of calls. But John, maybe maybe for you, I guess I wonder how you think about the seasonality here in the cloud business, particularly as we look at net new ARR, we have really strong strong start to the year with net new ARR was down a little bit sequentially because that's sort of in line with kind of the shape that you think about in the business are in line with sort of your customer spending cycles. Just a little bit a little bit of color on how you think about the shape of that based on kind of typical seasonality that makes sense."", 'John Hall', ""Yes, absolutely. So generally speaking, our year ends in June and some of the clients and figure that out. So we tend to have different patterns across the quarters, some of their years and now some of them in the UK and in April. So there is some fluctuation from quarter to quarter. I think in this quarter we had strong results. We also saw a little bit of a mix evolution. The professional services firms like legal accounting consulting were strong. We were very interested to see the economic reports about the hiring there that kind of match when we saw it come out. We also saw in Investment Banking a little bit of budget management from some of the large firms. And we saw the economic importance of the news about that and that made sense to us after the quarter was over. So I think we've benefited from some of our diversification across these firms. We've talked about that as a durable model. And we've grown through lots of different parts of the economic cycle consistently because of this. But there was some of that in this quarter's results that we worked through."", 'David Throne', ""Got it. Got it. That makes sense. Dave, maybe maybe for my follow-up for you. I'm really looking forward to February 22nd. I think there's a lot of a lot of fun stuff to talk about. And so if this is if this is too much of a teaser, you let me know. But based on I guess for given your background coming from from somebody different SaaS business in the past, could you sort of aspire to would you sort of benchmark Encapsys business model to based on where you are in kind of the lifecycle where you are from a scale perspective, if that makes sense, it does.And there's a lot of great compromise that we aspire to be in the vertical SaaS and there's a reason for that, right, because they're very purposeful built and they've had many years of success. And so we follow and some of those footsteps as we look at kind of our evolution and kind of where we're headed to. Clearly, we have very unique base and that in the top couple of hundred could be billions of worth of SAM with our respective clients. But we also have somewhat of a longer tail and uniqueness about us that, you know, we've got the opportunity to go and serve those respective markets as well. And so it's kind of going through that evolution as we apply resources and we serve these greater clients. So we're pretty excited to talk more about that.Coming on the 22nd and kind of where we're putting more of that wood behind that arrow. But clearly, you've seen the resiliency within our model across both. And so that spectrum that we've articulated and some of these customer examples or client examples.Got it.Very helpful. Thanks, guys.Looking forward to the 22nd.Yes.Thank you. one moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Parker Lane of Stifel. Your line is open.You guys."", 'David Morton', ""Thanks for taking the questions here. John, you guys have been doing applied AI for a while, but clearly you're bringing a lot more solutions to the market, and we'll see those later this month.Curious if you could talk about, I guess, the acceptance or willingness of your different end markets to leverage AI in their workflows."", 'John Hall', ""Is the feedback they're generally positive?"", 'David Morton', ""Do you think there's a big opportunity in the near term or is it going to take some time for people to really trust what's going on behind the scenes, get their hands on these tools before and you see budgets starting to free up around day out. I think some banks. There's some early adopters who are really enthusiastic because they just feel how big a potential there is for AI to make its way into these knowledge-based professional so much of their work is about serving large sets of data regardless of their area of expertise. They're looking across large areas of data, trying to develop a point of view either for ideal investment decision for advice to their clients and then from a daily workflow standpoint. So much of what they do is unstructured information processing to come back to clients and orchestrate deals and all these different types of advisory activities that they do, that there's a lot of excitement about the broad potential, particularly now of the generative AI on store. So there's some early folks who are in and then there's some more pragmatic folks who are saying this is all great, I believe it. But what are we going to do about the compliance questions are going to do about the information access questions, big organization globally with a lot of knowledge buried in our systems. If we point AI. at that, how are we going to make sure that we comply with all the regulatory obligations and the client obligations that we have. And so this is an area that we are very focused on because we've had such a strong position in the compliance aspect of these industries and their information for so many years, we think we can bring a unique value proposition that has all the potential of AI applied in industry-specific ways. But one of the core issues in industry-specific applications around here is the compliance and trust set of concerns. So this is a theme you're going to hear from us. This is where we're going is to bring a more compliant story to the whole AI opportunity. And we think that will lower the barriers and the concerns that anybody might have. And so in terms of time line, we're not making specific commitments today, but I think we can do all the work to get the fastest AI deployment in these firms through that perspective.Got it.That's really great feedback and thanks for that. But just curious if you could talk about the entire time migration specifically the large law firms are the ones that have held out and been on-premise in the past. Why now is the simple question, some widening, what incentives are people seeing to move to the cloud and what drives that inside of the laggards that you still have remaining on premise?Yes, it's been interesting. I think you know, we've talked a little bit about the fact that when everybody had to go home for COVID, a lot of these firms had to wake-up moment because people could get access and have the right experience for all their traditional in-house built or on-prem solutions. So I think that was a permanent change in the mindset and the firms who have made a cloud-first or cloud-only commitment coming out of that even the most sort of legacy environments that made that commitment. What's happening now as firms have had a couple of years to get their IT projects, organized their priorities rolling through clear everything out and actually start making the meaningful moves to the cloud."", 'John Hall', 'So we do encourage our firms to do that.', 'David Morton', ""We haven't gotten we really prescriptive that they must do it on a particular time line yet. And yet a lot of them have flipped and are started pulling us into the market. And I think it's just a great sign I think that the firms are going cloud and we're getting into a stronger and stronger position to help them benefit from from all the new technology and particularly all the AI technology that you can really only get in a cloud platform. So it's just the normal development of the market. And I think this is going to go faster here.Makes sense Appreciate you guys taking the question."", 'David Throne', ""Thank you.Thank you. One moment, please.Our next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman of Truist Securities. Your line is open.Yes, hey, John, Dave and David, congratulations from me as well on the solid results in the quarter. I had just two questions. First, as it relates to just the ongoing relationship at multiple levels with Microsoft. So whether it's Azure marketplace and being able to use prepaid cloud spend and just them influencing business, how is that shaping up? And then I had a follow-up question for Dave."", 'David Morton', ""So thanks to a the Microsoft relationship is continuing to grow and develop reforming more and more relationships on the ground in each of the accounts. And we had some really exciting wins here in this quarter where some firms already had minimum Azure commitment contracts with Microsoft, and they used that to buy from us. And then we even had some firms that realized they could do that and they signed up for contracts because they were going to buy TAP and they could get some additional benefits for Microsoft. So there's a lot of positive feedback going between our field and Microsoft's field on this point, and I think it is helping us."", 'David Throne', ""That's great to hear."", 'John Hall', 'Thanks for that, John.', 'David Throne', ""I guess maybe the follow-up question for Dave. Any way to think about seasonality or just free cash flow the rest of the year as we move into the next couple of quarters of the second half? And then what are maybe what's the relationship of EBIT to free cash flow conversion?"", 'John Hall', ""Just trying to understand a little bit more how we should think about our free cash flow?Yes, first and foremost, Terry, I still think we're working on some continued operational efficiencies, just normal course. And Ian, I've been here for six months, and we're just trying to get a little more cadence and so on some constants around just normal things, such as our receivables and simple things like that, right, which face value doesn't really come up with a lot, but then there's still a lot of opportunity for us to move forward. So I would say that's seasonality. Well, in theory, come more apparent when we get into FY 25 about midway through the year and then we can look at okay, on a normal course. How's our respective business that Lisa and John already oriented around June and for EMEA and others as well as December here for U.S. And so as we continue to look at some of those bigger accounts that may move the needle with standard payment terms of 30 60 days. Clearly that would follow in the following quarters. So some we can come back and talk a little bit more a little more in detail here in a quarter to understood you guys.Thanks.Thank you. one moment, please.Our next question comes from the line of Matt that lead a BTRG. Your line is open."", 'David Throne', 'Yes, good afternoon.', 'David Morton', 'Thanks for taking my question.', 'David Throne', ""Maybe a quick follow-up on the Microsoft partnership from Terry's question here."", 'David Morton', ""But as you think about sort of the the overall contribution margin when you're getting customers to come through that channel and really leverage some of those existing contracts or prepaid spend, is there a specific margin uplift we can think about or is it and more of it over time as more of the workloads move to Azure that you just gain the leverage on the gross margin side and just help us think about sort of the dollar for dollar on a direct sale versus one that comes through the Microsoft channel. So I think generally, I'll give some color. And then, Dave, you can talk about anything you want to add from the relationship so far has had a relatively small fraction of our overall business coming through this channel in that sort of way around the Azure commitments. It is something that's causing us to win in certain large accounts that already have those. And then, as I mentioned, we've started to see some more firms come on board. It's not our overall model today, but I think there's opportunity to continue to grow the contribution that comes from the Microsoft relationship in each and every deal as we grow the business. So I think it's early days generally on this model. At the same time, we're getting a lot of energy and visibility and buzz working with them and meeting a lot of the clients that they have and working together in a lot of the regions around the world where they have a strong footprint and they have Azure capabilities. So I think it is a net positive today, even though we're early in the place where that that model may be a major contributor. Dave, do you want to say more, but yes.Now I've gotten China spot on when you think about some of the larger enterprise in their respective industries that we serve, not only as a check-the-box, but it's also a great avenue for additional conversations of what can foreshadow our opportunities on both ends. And so I think that's been a great series of conversation points.When you think about just overall impact. And today's P and L, as John had noted, it's very immaterial or dollar for dollar, it's that same arm. And so like we're looking longer term and how we continue to evolve both of these relationships and get some materiality that we can give some additional color on."", 'David Throne', ""Okay, very helpful. And then as you look towards the second half of the fiscal year here or out over a longer period of time, where where do you stand in terms of your headcount and the needs to continue to expand that? What areas of the business, do you expect to continue to sort of grow more or less in line with revenue growth? And what areas do you have enough scale now that you can really kind of build into.I don't think we're going to grow at the levels of revenue per se, either expense or headcount. So you're always going to see some natural leverage coming off the model as far as headcount going forward, it's primarily going to be in your product and engineering as we talk about these different items that we continue to bring online so we talked about the investment with them. I'm IM. as well as the industry solutions that we've narrated on. And so that's been a good series of early day investments and then moving back over, we've narrowed it a little bit about our partner economy. And so we could see some small incremental investments on that. And then to the extent that we go further international with a broader scale, and this is a little bit down the road. You could see some incremental investment in that, and that's more in sales and marketing and addressing any concerns that or any areas of opportunity that we would see there."", 'David Morton', 'Great. Thanks.', 'David Throne', 'I look forward to seeing everyone in a couple of weeks.Thank you a moment.', 'David Morton', 'Please.Our next question comes from the line of Brian Schwartz of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.', 'David Throne', ""Hey, this is Ari Friedman sitting in for Brian Schwartz.Thanks for taking my question. I had a question just on like International.I know you guys had about 30% of the revenue came from international in 2Q and were there any other geographies that came like above your expectations or did all geographies kind of come in line on? And any color on that would be helpful.Thanks.If everything pretty much came in line, it's a good series of activities. We have opportunities obviously going forward on. And so as we continue to expand on that, I would say in the past, some of those opportunities have been more opportunistic versus purposeful. And I think you'll hear us start migrating some of the international areas of opportunity, more purposeful. These are the us going direct versus being pulled in on some of our hub and spoke with accounts. So hopefully that gives you some additional color on that.Thank you.Thank you.Okay, that does conclude our Q&A session. And I'd like to turn the call over to John Hall for any closing remarks.Okay."", 'David Morton', ""Thanks, everyone. We appreciate your attention and your questions. And we have a great Q2 behind us, and we're excited to talk to you again this month at Investor Day on February 22nd. So for now, we'll let you go. Have a great day.Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.No. And and we are yes, you to.Yes, we see.Yes.""]"

The math is wonderfully simple."", ""Assuming Microsoft is a fair valuation right now, then the stock would go up at the same rate as earnings growth.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. This means that investors who purchase Paychex's shares on or after the 12th of February will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 27th of February."", ""The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.89 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$3.56 per share to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Paychex has a trailing yield of 2.9% on the current share price of US$122.19. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Paychex's dividend is reliable and sustainable. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Paychex ', ""Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. It paid out 77% of its earnings as dividends last year, which is not unreasonable, but limits reinvestment in the business and leaves the dividend vulnerable to a business downturn. We'd be concerned if earnings began to decline. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Over the last year it paid out 68% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies."", ""It's positive to see that Paychex's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. For this reason, we're glad to see Paychex's earnings per share have risen 10% per annum over the last five years. It paid out more than three-quarters of its earnings in the last year, even though earnings per share are growing rapidly. We're surprised that management has not elected to reinvest more in the business to accelerate growth further."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Paychex has increased its dividend at approximately 10% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see."", ""Has Paychex got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? It's good to see earnings are growing, since all of the best dividend stocks grow their earnings meaningfully over the long run. However, we'd also note that Paychex is paying out more than half of its earnings and cash flow as profits, which could limit the dividend growth if earnings growth slows. Overall, it's not a bad combination, but we feel that there are likely more attractive dividend prospects out there."", 'Ever wonder what the future holds for Paychex?

PH is currently averaging 666,534 shares for the last 20 days."", 'Earnings Outlook', 'The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes.

Market share gains through innovation and premiumization have also been driving performance. Continued momentum in Coors Light and Miller Lite in the United States is expected to have aided TAP’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter.Additionally, the company’s top line is expected to have benefited from its pricing actions, which have been undertaken to overcome the inflationary environment. Its sales are likely to have benefited from favorable price and sales mix, as well as brand and financial volume growth in the fourth quarter.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management indicated that it expects strong top-line growth in the quarters ahead, driven by the recovery in the U.S. beer category, stronger-than-expected brand volume growth and better-than-expected pricing across global markets, particularly Canada. This optimism is likely to get reflected in its fourth-quarter revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter brand volume is pegged at 19.81 million, indicating an increase from 18.74 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The consensus estimate for net sales is $2.2 billion for the Americas and $558 million for EMEA & APAC.TAP has been on track with its revitalization plan focused on achieving sustainable top-line growth by streamlining the organization and reinvesting resources into its brands and capabilities. As part of this plan, it has been investing in iconic brands and growth opportunities in the above-premium beer space, expanding in adjacencies and beyond beer and creating digital competencies for commercial functions, supply-chain-related system capabilities and employees.These investments are expected to have been reflected in Molson Coors’ fourth-quarter top line. Also, the company’s cost-saving program has been one of the key growth drivers.TAP has emphasized that it has been making efforts to change the shape of its product portfolio and expand in growth areas. Its U.S. above-premium portfolio is likely to have witnessed sales growth outpacing its U.S. economy portfolio, driven by the rapid growth of its hard seltzers, the successful launch of Simply Spiked Lemonade and the continued strength in Blue Moon and Peroni’s.However, the company continues to witness cost inflation with respect to materials and manufacturing expenses, along with an unfavorable mix. Also, softness in the beer industry is concerning.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management continued to anticipate the persistence of inflation impacts on COGS for the fourth quarter. Underlying MG&A expenses are projected to be nearly $100 million higher in the second half than the first half and up about 15% year over year. This will be driven by elevated marketing spending, which is likely to be up around $100 million, coupled with increased people-related costs.', 'Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for Molson Coors this time around.

Offering products and services outside of the United States allows companies to reach more potential customers. However, it can have a tremendous impact on Celsius Holdings. Some companies prioritize international markets when their domestic growth rates decelerate. However, Celsius is still achieving meaningful revenue growth in North America.', 'It’s also important to note how much of the company’s revenue comes from the continent. Out of the company’s $385 million in total revenue, $371 million came from North America. That’s 96.4% of the company’s total revenue.', 'Many bullish investors have compared Celsius Holdings to\xa0Monster Beverage\xa0(NASDAQ:MNST).

Without the International segment, Monster Beverage only generated $1.13 billion in Q3 revenue.', 'For every dollar Monster makes in the U.S., it makes roughly $0.65 in International sales. Giving Celsius Holdings that ratio can lead to substantially higher revenue.', 'With a 1.65 multiplier from a large international presence, Celsius Holdings’ Q3-2023 revenue would have jumped from $385 million to $612.2 million. I am using the $371 million in North American revenue as the multiplier ($371 million x 1.65 = $612.2 million).', 'This new revenue figure represents a 225.3% year-over-year increase compared to $188.2 million in Q3-2022 revenue. Assuming the net profit margin of 21.82% remains the same, profits would have been $133.6 million instead of $84.0 million for Q3 2023.', 'Celsius isn’t likely to generate roughly 40% of its revenue from international markets anytime soon. However, long-term investors can wait patiently for the company to get closer to that percentage.', 'If Celsius Holdings has the same international reception as it did in the U.S., investors may enjoy triple-digit year-over-year revenue growth in those markets for a few years. It’s this possibility, combined with a dominant domestic performance, that has this stock trading at a high valuation.', 'On TipRanks, CELH stock comes in as a Strong Buy based on 11 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. As stated earlier, analysts project 28.5% upside in Celsius stock, but the highest price target of $83.33 suggests even more optimism. This price target suggests 49% upside from the current price. Even the lowest price target of $64 per share implies a 14.7% gain.', 'Celsius Holdings has delivered exceptional growth for investors as its sports beverages gain market share in the United States. While growth remains strong, leadership has not yet tapped into the company’s full potential.', 'A meaningful international expansion can fuel higher revenue growth for several years. It’s possible for Celsius Holdings to catch up to Monster Beverage’s market cap, and the company has a high-demand product that has the potential to become a big hit in other markets.', 'Disclosure']"

All three of the major stock indexes have oscillated between bear and bull markets in successive years since the start of the decade."", 'But therein lies the opportunity for long-term investors. Since every notable drop in the major indexes throughout history has eventually been cleared away by a bull market rally, corrections and bear markets have always been blessings in disguise. Even with the major indexes at or near all-time highs, discounts on high-quality stocks can still be found.', 'Best of all, online brokerages have largely done away with minimum deposit requirements and commission fees for stock trades on major U.S. exchanges. In other words, any amount of money -- even $200 -- can be the perfect amount to put to work.', ""If you have $200 that's ready to invest, and you're absolutely certain this isn't cash you're going to need to pay bills or cover emergency expenses, the following three stocks stand out as no-brainer buys right now."", 'The first spectacular stock that you can confidently scoop up with $200 right now is none other than the largest electric utility by market cap, NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE).', 'Following a virtually unstoppable two-decade stretch for NextEra, shares of the company were clobbered in 2023 as interest rates rapidly rose and short-term Treasury yields soared to more than 5%. Investors typically flock to utility stocks for their low volatility and market-topping yields. But if they can get similar or higher yields from Treasury bonds, it leads to far less interest (pardon the pun) in utility stocks.', ""The good news is that 2024 (and beyond) holds a number of catalysts for NextEra Energy. For instance, the nation's central bank is expected to begin a rate-easing cycle this year. Treasury bond yields have responded by moving well off of their highs from 2023. This is going to make utility stocks more attractive to income investors."", 'But macro factors aside, the real reason to be excited about NextEra Energy is its focus on renewable energy. As of the end of September, NextEra had 70 gigawatts (GW) of capacity in operation, with 34 GW tracing back to renewable sources. The 23 GW from wind and 6 GW from solar are the highest marks in the world among electric utilities.', ""While these projects weren't cheap, they've helped to meaningfully lower electricity costs and have fueled a nearly double-digit adjusted annual earnings growth rate since 2012. For context, most utilities grow their year-over-year earnings by a low-single-digit percentage."", ""I'll also add that utilities provide a basic need. Homeowners and renters are going to need electricity to power their appliances and/or HVAC systems. Since demand for electricity doesn't change much one year to the next, and most utilities operate as monopolies or duopolies in the areas they service, the cash flow NextEra generates is highly predictable."", 'Shares of NextEra Energy can be purchased right now for below 16x forward-year earnings. This represents its lowest forward-year multiple in at least a decade, and a 40% discount to its five-year average forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.', ""The second no-brainer stock that's begging to be bought with $200 right now is specialty biotech BioMarin Pharmaceutical (NASDAQ: BMRN)."", ""If there's a knock against BioMarin, it'd likely be the company's valuation. With the stock market being especially volatile over the past couple of years, paying more than 110 times trailing-12-month earnings may not be everyone's cup of tea. Thankfully, Wall Street tends to be forward-looking, and that's where BioMarin shines."", ""One of the most unique aspects about this company is that it exclusively targets orphan and ultrarare diseases. Although focusing on treatments for small patient pools does come with risk, there's plenty of reward for successful trials and approved therapies. In addition to improving the quality of life for patients who previously had few (if any) available treatment options, orphan and ultrarare novel drugs face minimal pushback from insurers on their high list prices, and they typically have limited or no competition. In short, approved ultrarare drugs can have a wide-open pathway to success."", ""Among BioMarin's eight approved novel therapies, dwarfism drug Voxzogo has the most promising future. Sales of the drug more than tripled to roughly $324 million through the first nine months of 2023, and have the potential to eventually top $1 billion annually."", ""Further, in December, BioMarin appeased activist investor Elliott Investment Management by agreeing to expand the company's board of directors by four seats to 15, and adding a new review committee. While activist investors don't have a perfect track record of increasing the value of everything they invest in, their presence often signifies the possibility of value being unlocked in the future."", ""Additionally, healthcare is a defensive sector. Demand for prescription drugs tends to be stable in any economic climate, which is excellent news for the company's operating cash flow."", 'Lastly, BioMarin is a lot cheaper than investors may realize. Earnings per share are on track to quadruple from a little over $1 in 2023 to more than $4 by 2026. All the while, sales are expected to shoot up more than 50%.', 'The third no-brainer stock to buy with $200 right now is global tobacco powerhouse Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM).', 'The front-and-center headwind for tobacco companies is that consumers have become increasingly aware of the dangers of long-term tobacco use. This education, coupled with warnings on packaging in most markets, has led to a decline in adult cigarette smoking rates in some developed countries.', ""There's no doubt that the best days are in the rearview mirror for the traditional tobacco industry. However, this doesn't mean tobacco stocks can't make patient investors richer."", ""This first factor working in Philip Morris' favor is its virtually unparalleled geographic diversity. It sells tobacco products in more than 180 countries. If adult smoking rates are declining in developed markets, there's a reasonable chance the company can offset shipment declines with growing demand in emerging markets."", 'This is a good time to mention that tobacco contains nicotine, which is an additive chemical. The addictive lure of tobacco products often allows the big players, such as Philip Morris, to pass along price increases that more than offset inflation and/or outpace the rate of cigarette shipments declines in select markets.', ""But the biggest catalyst of all for Philip Morris International is the company's smokeless tobacco push via its Iqos heated tobacco system. In the September-ended quarter, the company notes that heated tobacco unit (HTU) shipments rose 18% to 32.5 billion from the prior-year period, with total market share of HTUs rising by 120 basis points to 9%. Philip Morris is still in the very early innings of its smokeless products expansion."", ""Tobacco stocks are also known for their generous capital-return programs. With the understanding that their supercharged growth days are in the rearview mirror, tobacco companies usually offer robust dividends and/or hearty buyback programs. Though Philip Morris hadn't repurchased any shares in 2023 (through September), it is doling out $5.20 per share in dividends. That's good for a market-crushing 5.6% yield."", ""To round things out, Philip Morris' stock is cheaper than it's been in six years. Shares are trading at 14x consensus earnings in 2024, which is an 8% discount to its average forward-year multiple over the past five years."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in NextEra Energy, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and NextEra Energy wasn’t one of them.

Higher pricing variance has been an upside to the company’s performance for quite some time now.Additionally, the company’s focus on smoke-free transformation has been a driver, as consumers increasingly gravitate toward reduced-risk products. Smoke-free products generated 36.2% of PM’s net revenues in the third quarter of 2023.

Before turning to the results, I would like to provide some perspective on our company as we celebrated our 30th anniversary as a public company mid-December of last year. We have grown our company into a global leader in premier shopping, dining, entertainment and mixed-use destinations managing through, and in some cases, very turbulent times. Over the last 3 decades, from our base of 115 properties in 1993, we have acquired approximately 300 properties, developed more than 50 and disposed of approximately 250 resulting in our current domestic portfolio of about -- of 215 assets. We expanded globally and today have 35 international outlets, including world-renowned outlets in Asia. And our portfolio is differentiated by product type, geography, enclosed and open air centers located large and dense catchment areas. Our portfolio is supported by the industry's strongest balance sheet and a top management team. We are the largest landlords, the world's most important retailers and not by accident. Our diversified tenant base has solid credit. And our mix is always changing and adapting, best illustrated by the fact that compared to 30 years ago, only 1 retailer is still in our current top 10 tenants. Our team's hard work has resulted in industry-leading results, including some of the following: our annual revenue increased from $424 million to nearly $5.7 billion, annual FFO generate -- our annual FFO generation increased 30x from approximately $150 million to nearly $4.7 billion, a 12% CAGR. Total market capitalization has increased from $3 billion to $90 billion. We have paid over $42 billion in dividends to shareholders. We have assets in our portfolio that have been in business for more than 60 years. Those assets are still growing today with many generating $100 million in NOI. These assets are in great locations. The loyal and large customer base that are where the retailers want to be. No other asset type has the longevity, including the NOI generation and embedded future growth that these assets have. Yes, they change. Yes, they evolve. Yes, they adapt, but yes, they also grow. Our collection of assets cannot be replicated. And there are hidden -- always hidden opportunities within them. I want to thank the entire Simon team who have contributed to 30 years of success as a public company. And now let me turn to our fourth quarter '23 results. We generated approximately $4.7 billion in funds from operation in 2023 or $12.51 per share and returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. For the quarter, FFO was $1.38 billion or $3.69 per share compared to $1.27 billion or $3.40 per share. Let me walk you through some of the highlights for this quarter compared to Q4 of 2022. Domestic operations had a terrific performance this quarter and contributed $0.28 of growth, primarily driven by higher rental income with lower operating expenses. Gains from investment activity in the fourth quarter were approximately $0.07 higher in a year-over-year comparison, other platform investments and $0.03 lower contribution compared to last year. FFO from our real estate business was $3.23 per share in the fourth quarter compared to $2.97 from last year. That's 8.7% growth and $11.78 per share for '23 compared to $11.39 last year. Domestic property NOI increased 7.3% year-over-year for the quarter and 4.8% for the year, continued leasing momentum, resilient consumer spending, operational excellence delivered results for the year, exceeding our initial expectations. Our NOI ended the year higher than 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency grew 7.2% for the quarter and 4.9% for the year. Mall and outlet occupancy at the end of the quarter or fourth quarter was 95.8%, an increase of 90 basis points compared to last year. The mills occupancy was 97.8%. Occupancy is above year-end 2019 levels for all of our platforms. Average base minimum rent for malls and outlets increased 3.1% year-over-year, and the mills rent increased 4.3%. We signed more than 960 leases for approximately 3.4 million square feet in the fourth quarter. For the year, we signed over 4,500 leases, representing more than 18 million square feet. Approximately 30% of our leasing activity for the year were new deals with going in rents of approximately $74 per square foot and renewals had going in rents of approximately $65 per square foot. Leasing momentum for the last couple of years continues into 2024. Reported retailer sales per square foot per quarter was $743 for malls and outlets, combined at $677 for the mills. During the quarter, we sold a portion of our interest in ABG for gross proceeds of $300 million in cash and reported pretax and after-tax gains of $157 million and $118 million, respectively. We opened our 11th outlet in Europe last year. Construction continues on 2 outlets. Yes, in Tulsa, Oklahoma. And yes, one in Jakarta, Indonesia. We completed 13 significant redevelopments and we'll complete other major development projects this year. In addition, we expect to begin construction this year on 5 to 6 mixed-use projects representing around $800 million of spend from Orange County to Ann Arbor to Boston to Seattle to Rosebel Field. They're some of the ones that are planning to start this year, and we expect to fund these redevelopments and mixed-use projects with our internally generated cash flow of over $1.5 billion after dividend payments. During 2023, we completed $12 billion in financing activities including 3 senior note offerings for approximately $3.1 billion, including the Klépierre exchangeable offering. We recast and upsized our primary revolver credit facility to $5 billion and completed $4 billion of secured loan refinancings and extensions. Our A-rated balance sheet is as strong as ever. We have approximately $11 billion of liquidity. During 2023, we paid, as I mentioned earlier, $2.8 billion in common stock dividends. We repurchased 1.3 million shares of our common stock at an average price of just over $110 per share in 2023. Today, we announced our dividend of $1.95 per share for the first quarter, a year-over-year increase of 8.3%. The dividend is payable on March 29 of 2024. Now moving on to 2024. Our FFO guidance is $11.85 to $12.10 per share. Our guidance reflects the following assumptions: domestic property NOI growth of at least 3%, increased net interest expense compared to 2023 of approximately $0.25 to $0.30 per share, reflecting current market interest rates on both fixed and variable debt assumptions and cash balances. Contribution from other property -- other platform investments of approximately $0.10 to $0.15 per share. No significant acquisition or disposition activity and our current diluted share count of approximately 374 million shares. So with that said, it's safe to say we're excited to enter year 31 as a public company. Thank you for your time, and we're ready for Q&A."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.', 'Stephen Thomas Sakwa', ""I was just wondering if you can maybe talk a little bit about kind of the leasing pipeline and where things stand today versus maybe the year ago? And what sort of conversations are you having with the tenants? And maybe how has the pricing dynamic changed given that you're now kind of 95% leased and pretty full in the portfolio?"", 'David E. Simon', ""Well, I mean, Steve, we're always adjusting our mix. We're always trying to -- so even though we're 96% leased, they're vast. We're always looking to improve our retailer mix and often beneficial to our NOI growth. I would say just generically, and obviously, I spent a lot of time myself on leasing and with my team on leasing demand remains very strong. And there is a real interest by all sorts of retailers and people that populate our shopping centers to be part of what we're doing. So I think as you probably saw our new deals are $74 a foot thereabouts, our renewals are $65 a foot. Our expiring leases this year in the 56, 57 range. So we're seeing generally positive spreads. Supply and demand is in our favor. Historically low supply in big properties across the country. I mean, there used to be 40 million square feet of retail real estate built every year. Now there's essentially less than a few million here and there. So -- and then there's been obsolescence, too, which makes the supply shrink as well. So -- and then there's just great new retailers that we're very excited to do business with. I was on the West Coast, seeing some of them -- the importance of bricks and mortar has never been higher. And the cost of -- all of the things that we said about -- don't get me wrong, e-commerce is critically important. But all of the stuff about e-commerce, cost of customer acquisition, returns, stickiness, et cetera, all is -- continues to be a challenge. If you looked at the marketplaces that pure online, they run into problems. So you're really -- they really need to be connected to a bricks and mortar for survivability. So all of those things are pointing to a positive picture. It's a function of execution, a function of being first, a function of continuing to improve our properties which we're very focused about. But even though we've bounced back and had a couple of really good years in terms of lease-up from the depths of the pandemic. We're not finished. And retail demand continues and it's strong. And it's across the board. I mean it's not one category, one retailer, but pretty much across the board."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs.', 'Caitlin Burrows', ""David, could you give us some more detail on the ABG sales that you referenced, maybe how much you still own? How much do you think your remaining OPI could be worth? And whether you plan to monetize more in '24 or maybe what could influence that decision?"", 'David E. Simon', ""Sure. Well, let me just -- we sold about 2% of our ABG stock. So we essentially went from just under 12% to just under 10%. And we'll continue to look to monetize these investments. They've been, by and large, very good investments across not just the big ones, but the smaller ones as well. Obviously, there's a number of them that are synergistic to us. But we have a strict adherence to creating value. And if we think we can deploy that capital into kind of what I'd call the mothership and get better growth from that, then that's where our #1 priority will be. So it wouldn't surprise me, Caitlin, for us to continue to monetize. Obviously, some of these are bigger value -- bigger investments. So it's not that easy to do it in one big swoop, but we're very focused on portfolio management of those assets. And if we can monetize them, are we going to get a better return, plowing it back into our core business."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Jeff Spector with Bank of America.', 'Jeffrey Alan Spector', ""First, congratulations on the anniversary. David, there's a lot of initiatives. So as you think about the next 5 years, I know it's probably a difficult question, but is there 1 or 2 key initiatives that you're most excited about as you think about the next 5 years?"", 'David E. Simon', ""Well, look, I'd say a couple of things on the property level, there's no question that all of the mixed-use stuff that we're bringing in, plus the redevelopment of our department store boxes are probably the most interesting and exciting things that we're doing on the ground. And so -- that would certainly be number one. Number two is, we're very excited about growing our outlet business in Southeast Asia. It's an incredibly -- it's an incredible -- incredibly robust market, a young population and a growing. And I'm not -- when I say Southeast Asia, I'm not like in Jakarta, places like that where it's not China, it's places like that where we see kind of what we can do in Japan and in Korea on the outlet side. Jeff, you probably know that better than anybody based on your previous history with -- in terms of that. So we -- that's very exciting. I'd also say we still are in the pursuit of bringing technology to our loyal consumers that allow them to now enhance and -- their shopping experience with us. So we've got a lot of initiatives on the marketing, loyalty, sign and search is a great example where our consumer, either in property or previsit, can search our tenant base for what -- if they're looking for a black dress, where in this center can I buy it? And what retailer, obviously, that ties into the marketplace we're building with premium outlets. There'll be some news there this year on that front. So that whole system about customer interaction, reinforcing their shopping behavior, rewarding loyalty, expediting their trip and making it more useful is a big focus. And then as important, I think this is number 4 really is just we've got to do a great job of continuing to evolve our retailer mix. The exciting thing is there are more and more entrepreneurs or more and more exciting retailers that are coming up with great concepts, proving them out and then realizing that our centers are a good place for them to do business. So those are the ones that come to mind, but I'm certain there'll be ones that I haven't even thought of."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.', 'Alexander David Goldfarb', ""So I think at the opening, you mentioned that NOI is now exceeding pre-pandemic. The dividend is within less than 10% of pre-pandemic. And sort of thinking about Jeff's and Steve's questions on reinvestment. As you think about getting back to that pre-endemic dividend level, given the investment opportunities, especially lack of supply, growing demand, people are once again really engaged in physical retail, does that change your trajectory as you think about getting the dividend back to pre-pandemic, meaning are there better investment opportunities with that capital? Or is the delta really a function of rising interest rates that's -- meaning that the surpassing pre-pandemic NOI versus the dividend is really just a function of the higher interest expense now?"", 'David E. Simon', ""Well, I mean, Alex, look, our yield is ridiculously hot, okay? So that's really -- and we could financially pay [2 10] tomorrow, right? So we have $1.5 billion of free cash flow after our dividend. So it has nothing to do with financial wherewithal. I mean, we would like -- we don't like trading at this high yield. So I think that's kind of how we look at it. We still think as we have these additional capital events. We still are anxious to continue to buy our stock back. And again, when I look at either the S&P 500, I look at the REIT peer group. I look at what the strip center rates -- our yield is plenty high for investors. So tell all of my investors, I could pay 2 10 tomorrow evening, okay, per quarter without a blink, but our yield is too high. And it will be there before you know it, but we would like to trade a little lower yield. Because we think -- certainly, if you look at it on that basis, our yield is higher than it should be. I mean the S&P is under 2% our REIT strip centers, Tom are in the 4s. We're close to 7%, right, 6.5%, 7%. So I mean, Alex, you should be pounding the table."", 'Alexander David Goldfarb', ""Yes. Unfortunately, I'm a nonpaying customer. The real customers are the ones listening to the call. We're just asking the questions."", 'David E. Simon', ""Absolutely. By the way, we are -- just so you know, we like your welcome out there. We are west of the Hudson, and we're not going to tell you exactly where we are, okay? We may not be in Indiana tonight, but we are west of the Hudson."", 'Alexander David Goldfarb', ""I assume you'll be in Las Vegas this Sunday."", 'David E. Simon', ""Well, I can't tell you my schedule."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS.', 'Michael Goldsmith', 'David, base rents are up healthily in the low single-digit range year-over-year, while your tenant sales or square foot are down slightly. So can you just talk a little bit about these dynamics? Is that a reflection of your rents kind of catching up to some of the strength the tenants have experienced before their sales have started to come down? And just how long are these dynamics kind of sustainable like this?', 'David E. Simon', ""Sure. Good question. So I will say this, I think the rent -- the going-in rents, renewals or new leases are very much sustainable. If you look at our occupancy cost, they are still at the low end of our historical range, and we're at 12.6%. And we have run up to 14-plus percent before. And I would also -- I would also caution report -- these are the sales that our tenants are reporting to us, but they are somewhat affected by returns they get and so on. We actually think our sales per foot are higher than this. In some cases, they have the ability to offset returns. In most cases, they don't. So I just put that out there. So I wouldn't -- and I mentioned this maybe 2, 3 years ago, probably certainly pre-pandemic, but we reported -- I know the market likes it, we actually think our sales were higher. They come from our properties and then they're somewhat affected by returns. And we think some -- a lot of those returns are Internet sales returns. So they don't even come from our properties. And so -- again, when we look at it, we feel like supply and demand, low occupancy cost, high retail sales and just overall demand, we'll be able to generate kind of the new leasing and renewal spreads that we've seen over the last couple of years."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point. Our next question is from Craig Mailman with Citi Group.', 'Craig Allen Mailman', ""Just going back to maybe the reinvestment theme here. You guys have plenty of cash after the dividend. And I'm just kind of curious, at this point, what is the level of anchor box reinvestment you actually need to do just given what maybe they give today? And after you guys were spared kind of some of the recent Macy's closings, but -- just as you look at the portfolio today, kind of what do you think over the next 2, 3 years? You guys could ultimately get back and have to retenant -- and just you talked a lot about how the leasing environment is good. Just what's the outlook for retenant in those boxes today? What's the targeted kind of makeup there? And is luxury still doing enough to be able to be the primary kind of backfill option?"", 'David E. Simon', ""Well, on the -- Craig, on the department store boxes, I don't have it off the top of my head, but the ones we own, we basically don't have a ton of work to do. We have a handful of boxes that we own that -- that are in process like, for instance, and I mentioned just briefly on the call. We -- that was a former Sears store. We tore it down. It's in development now, under construction now. So the actual stores that we own are not manning probably under 10 at this point that are either currently under construction or in process. So very small amount of kind of less of an opportunity than you think. The ones that we -- Transformco still owns some boxes and so does Seritage. So we'll -- in our properties. So we'll see how that evolves. I mean eventually, some of those could be opportunities for us to buy and redevelop. We haven't made deals on those just because the ask has been too great. But -- we find -- and I don't think luxury is really going to be the dominant theme on a lot of these mixed-use -- I'm sorry, on these boxes. I think a lot of it will be -- continue to be the mixed-use development that we're doing. And obviously, opening up if it's in a closed mall opening et cetera with restaurants and entertainment and so on that's worked very well. So we have a number under construction or about to be under construction. But we don't really have that existing pipe that until we make more deals to buy some of the boxes back. It's not as big as you might think. It's only a handful. Now Macy's, is you're right, they announced some store closings, none of which are ours. So we're always very focused on knowing exactly where we might be at risk. No. And I would point out, very importantly, when Sears went out of business, the whole market said how are you going to survive Sears going out of the business? There's [800] good department stores at that time, frankly, they're down to, believe it or not, operating maybe 5, 6, 7, 8. I think we actually have the most between us and the [Taubman] portfolio. But how are you going to survive it? The fact of the matter is it was a nonevent to the mall customer. And if anything, as we've gotten those boxes back, we've made the center better. So as we look -- we don't look at box -- the changes in box as a concern. We view it really more aggressively and progressively as something that will enhance the properties portfolio. And the assets that we're worried about that couldn't survive that basically don't exist in our portfolio anymore. So if you ask me that question 10 years ago, I might have a different answer. Craig, I hope you get better prior to the Sydney conference, I'm sure you will. But it sounds like you've lost your voice."", 'Craig Allen Mailman', 'Yes. Hope to be on the mend by then.', 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Vince Tibone with Green Street.', 'Vince James Tibone', ""Could you help me better understand how much incremental FFO we should expect in '24 from development or redevelopment projects that stabilized either later in '23 or slated to be finished in '24? Just any color to help us better understand the timing of incremental NOI and FFO from all the development activities would be helpful."", 'David E. Simon', ""Yes. In fact, it's interesting. You actually take us -- I think in '24, we're taking a step back. I'll just give you a trivial example. I mentioned Brian now for the third time, but we have a whole wing that's connected to the former Sears department store that we're redeveloping, plus an outdoor shop. We're building a Dick's sporting goods. We have a lifetime fitness resorts and then we'll do roughly 350 apartments or so. But that wing leading to Sears, we've had to de-lease it to ultimately put in not sure I'm allowed to say it, but I'll say it anyway, Zara and Uniqlo. And they won't open until end of '24 best case. So by and large, all of the stuff in the U.K. that we've listed, and I don't believe in the air, if it is, just it will be there shortly. None of that is really -- it really gets in '24. We do have Tulsa opening in the late summer. That will have a marginal impact leasing is going well. But with all the redeveloping, this is really more of a '25, '26 story. And the one that we'll see the benefit of this year, and I don't have a number handy is [fixed] which we opened in '23. That's kind of the one that I would say most meaningful, but most of the redevelopment is a '25, '26 story."", 'Vince James Tibone', ""No, that's really helpful. I mean, is there any like for -- just in terms of, I guess, the $1.3 billion that's acted today, plus the $800 million you're going to start. I mean, what's a fair assumption for '25, '26 in terms of level of maybe spend stabilizing? I mean, that's how we model it like it's $500 million stabilizing annually, let's call it, 7%, 8% yield a fair assumption? Or -- and that's what I'm trying to get out, like how quickly..."", 'David E. Simon', ""Yes. No. I appreciate that. If you don't include what I saw, ground up new development, I would say probably about between $600 million and $800 million a year. And our goal would hopefully be to bring that in at north of 8%. Obviously, if it is multifamily, you can still create value at a lower yield than that. And in some cases, we're building at a lower yield than that, like for instance, both [Brea's] apartments and the ones that we're building at the former Northgate Mall, we're basically about to start construction there. We'll be subbing -- so it may round down that 8%. But if you're talking kind of everything else, we would hope to be north of that."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.', 'Ronald Kamdem', ""Great. Just a 2-part really quickly, starting with the core NOI. Just in '24, can you just touch on the tourist centers and how much recovery there is and how much upside for volume to '24 as well as the variable to fixed conversion? Just trying to get a sense of how much of a tailwind that is to the core. And then on the sort of other platform investment, maybe could you just touch on what seasonality should we be thinking about between sort of the first part of the year and 4Q?"", 'David E. Simon', ""Sure. So -- and Brian will chime in here. I'll just give you some thoughts on my head and then Brian, hopefully will agree or correct me. So I would say we saw in '23 a really decent bounce back from the tourist centers. Now I give you a great example. So -- and I was just happy to look at this for -- I must have been probably doing my job, but I noticed in Q4, Q4 is an example of the bounce back with very -- Q4 sales were around $350 million, okay, which, to me, is a real good indicator bounce back and obviously, the highest fourth quarter sales we've had there in quite some time. So I'd say, generally, we're seeing a really good bounce back in the tourist centers. I don't think we -- the one area that the U.S. overall, and obviously, will have an impact on us. I do not think we'll see the Chinese -- we do not expect the Chinese to come back the way they have had before pandemic. And our -- and just our tourist centers did outpace our sales for the portfolio for '23 on average. So good bounce back across the board. And then I would say on your variable rent, we continue to see that as a lower percent of revenues both the vast majority, I think we increased our -- the way to think about it that's interesting is -- and again, hopefully, Brian won't need to correct me, but Brian is available to correct me. Our domestic operations had $0.28 of improvement Q-over-Q. That's $0.28. And within that $0.28, our variable income went down. So I think that gives you kind of a leading barometer, we're still working that way down, and we're getting that into kind of our base rent. So -- and then your final on OPI, loss Q1, relatively flat Q2, Q3 and then most of it in Q4. Q2 is a little better than Q3 usual, but on the margin. And it's only -- we're only projecting this year, $0.10 to $0.15."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank.', 'Greg Michael McGinniss', 'David, I just wanted to dig into the guidance a bit at OPI that you just cited in particular. Is it fair to assume that the $0.10 to $0.15 includes gains or monetization similar to last year or operations expected to improve from the minus $0.02 contribution to FFO in 2023?', 'David E. Simon', ""Yes. Thank you for that question. And the answer, no. That's pure operations. And no onetime or sale gains or any of that are in there. And yes, I mean just by -- I mean, we had a -- we had a tough '23 in OPI. We saw -- we didn't meet our -- both our budgeted expectations and our expectations is kind of big year when we recalibrated it. And the team in OPI, again, we're partners with. So it's not just us, we're partners, are making significant efforts within their own business to improve performance. And again, the overriding thing was -- and we should be sensitive to this across the board. The overriding theme was the lower-income consumer still with inflation and embedded even though inflation has subsided, they're still dealing with things that cost a lot more money than they used to. And the good news is their income is increasing, but it's still not in a position that they have the discretionary income that they need and they deserve. And we need to figure that out as a country."", 'Greg Michael McGinniss', 'So just to clarify...', 'David E. Simon', ""So no. Yes. So hopefully, I answered. So no onetime gains. Hopefully, the -- we're being conservative, and that's kind of where the numbers are. And just to take a step back, we're kind of getting OPI in this level where it was pre the extraordinary year of '21, '22, if you go back in time. This is kind of where the number was, nobody cared. We really outpaced ourselves and at extraordinary '21 and '22. And I think now we're kind of getting back to a kind of a more stabilized number."", 'Greg Michael McGinniss', ""So just to clarify, so there's going to be some improvements in operations, I guess, that are going to be kind of driving this year-over-year growth. But what do you think that implies in terms of the operational standpoint and the customer for your other tenants in the portfolio? How are those retailers performing? And are they going to be able to make the same sort of operational changes to benefit income?"", 'David E. Simon', ""Well, you're just talking about our tenant base now, is that the question? Or..."", 'Greg Michael McGinniss', 'I guess (inaudible) plus your tenants, yes.', 'David E. Simon', ""Okay. Well, like I said, the ones in SPARC and Penny, I really spoke to. I mean, I think generally, the plan that they have in place we think we're on the right track, and we're all working very hard to produce these results and hopefully we'll do better than that. Again, I mentioned to you, we're kind of getting back to where we used to be. And if you look at it in conjunction with pre-pandemic '18/'19, that's kind of where the number was. And we really outperformed in '21, '22, and we really underperformed in '23. As simple as that. Brands are good. Businesses are -- have the right game plan and we're moving. I would -- so that's SPARC, Penny, any questions on that, then I'll move to your other questions. I mean, retail is very specific. So I think our retailers, they're generally -- the credit is in really good shape. There's always 1 or 2 or 3 tenants that we are somewhat nervous about. But there -- they all understand the importance of bricks and mortar. They're reinvesting in their stores. They're spending less on technology, which is good for us, putting more money back in the stores. And they're open to buying. The return on investment in stores is a proven financial model, they're doing that. So I'd say generally, comfortable, very comfortable with all the retailers that we're doing business with. There will always be a couple here and there that have to sort through their financial issues."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Hong Zhang with JPMorgan.', 'Hongliang Zhang', 'I guess -- I was wondering if you could quantify the magnitude of the development drag this year. And also, it seems like you saw a very strong rent and occupancy growth in the Taubman portfolio in the fourth quarter. Wondering what drove that and what are your expectations for that portfolio this year as well?', 'David E. Simon', ""Just on Taubman, I mean, our expectations on the comp NOI are roughly right on -- in excess of 3%. What drove both portfolios really is supply and demand onto retail sales, operational excellence, all the things that I mentioned earlier. So listen, we're a big company. We did have some drag from redevelopment, but it's not -- it's not an excuse. We don't worry about it. It -- and it's not so much big redevelopment. You -- when you retenant a mall, you have downtime. And as I've mentioned this before, the better the tenant, the better the build out. And in some cases, build out is 6 to 9 months and restaurants can be even close to a year. And as you know, we have -- our portfolio restaurant new business is at least 100 new restaurants over the next year or so. So it -- it is a long arduous process, getting permits. I mean, we had a crazy thing in the Bay Area where they couldn't hook up the gas for a while, encourage you to read the Supreme Court overruling of an ordinance in Berkeley that affected Palo Alto. If you're really bored, you can read it. We finally got gas back into the center. And as you know, chefs like to cook with gas. So it was -- it cost us 6 months and the delay -- I mean, that's normal. But I'd say the bigger issue on -- just -- is not so much redevelopment and really retenanting. And I would say by and large, if I had to make up a number, it costs us probably $0.10 to $0.20 a year just downtime. But that's a guess."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities.', 'Ki Bin Kim', ""Just a couple of questions. First, your operating expenses were down in 4Q. Also just curious what drove that and if that's sustainable?"", 'Brian J. McDade', ""Yes, Ki, it's Brian. Yes, we did see some savings year-over-year. There was some seasonality to it. Weather was a little bit lighter. But yes, we do expect it's sustainable."", 'Ki Bin Kim', 'Okay. And on the ABG partial sale, was that a down round valuation versus the $18 billion mark previously?', 'Brian J. McDade', 'No.', 'David E. Simon', ""Yes. Remember, that, that was the enterprise value. They have some debt. So that was an equity value. It was -- so just when you say $18 billion, that's enterprise value as opposed to equity value."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho Securities.', 'Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste', ""Question I have is on your signed but not yet open pipeline. I think last quarter or you previously outlined is about 200 basis points of embedded occupancy from that signed but not yet open pipeline. So maybe you can give us an update on where that stands today? And then also maybe what's embedded in the guide for bad debt and lease term fees this year?"", 'David E. Simon', ""So signed but not opened is a little bit north of 200 basis points. We've been kind of holding that as we open stores and sign new leases. So we're holding steady around 200 basis points. We are assuming a normal level of bad debt, which is about 25 basis points of total revenue would be our expectation on that."", 'Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste', 'Lease term fees?', 'David E. Simon', 'Normal rate of lease term fees, I think the answer -- the number for the year is about $30 million, estimate.', 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.', 'Juan Carlos Sanabria', ""Just a quick one for me. Just curious on the current state of affairs with Jamestown and how that relationship is progressing. More talk about mixed use. So just curious if there's anything in the works or in the planning stages that you're doing with them and how you're thinking about that particular relationship?"", 'David E. Simon', ""Yes. Thank you. So we're -- we haven't quite had a year under our belt, but very pleased with the relationship and the partnership. And we continue to look at opportunities, both within our pipeline and obviously, what they do on behalf of investors. So a lot of good feedback going both ways. And we haven't -- we're working on one project. I mean, we have one development project we're working on together. But other than that, it's a lot of corporate. There's -- it's more strategic and more corporate, more of a corporate discussion than property level specifics other than one where we are partners on and going through a development process in that now in the Southeast."", 'Operator', ""There are no further question at this time.

Before turning to the results, I would like to provide some perspective on our company as we celebrated our 30th anniversary as a public company in mid-December of last year. We have grown our company into a global leader of premier shopping, dining, entertainment and mixed-use destinations managing through and in some cases, very turbulent times. Over the last three decades from our base of 115 properties in 1993, we have acquired approximately 300 properties, developed more then 50, and disposed of approximately 250 resulting in our current domestic portfolio of about 215 assets. We expanded globally, and today have 35 international outlets, including world-renowned outlets in Asia, and our portfolio is differentiated by product type, geography enclosed and open-air centers located in large and dense catchment areas.', ""Our portfolio is supported by the industry's strongest balance sheet and a top management team. We are the largest landlords, the world's most important retailers, and not by accident, our diversified tenant base has solid credit, our mix is always changing and adapting, best illustrated by the fact that compared to 30 years ago, only one retailer is still in our current top 10 tenants. Our team's hard work has resulted in industry-leading results including some of the following; our annual revenue increased from $424 million to nearly $5.7 billion, our annual FFO generation increased 30 times from approximately $150 million to nearly $4.7 billion, a 12% CAGR. Total market capitalization has increased from $3 billion to $90 billion. We have paid over $42 billion in dividends to shareholders."", ""We have assets in our portfolio that have been in business for more than 60 years. Those assets are still growing today with many generating a $100 million in NOI. These assets are in great locations, have a loyal and large customer base that is where the retailers want to be. No other asset type has longevity including the NOI generation and embedded future growth that these assets have, yes, they change. Yes, they evolve, yes they adapt, but yes, they also grow. Our collection of assets cannot be replicated. And there are hidden - always hidden opportunities within that. I want to thank the entire Simon team, who have contributed to 30 years of success as a public company. And now let me turn to our fourth quarter '23 results. We generated approximately $4.7 billion in funds from operation in 2023 or $12.51 per share and returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases."", ""For the quarter, FFO was $1.38 billion or $3.69 per share compared to $1.27 billion or $3.40 per share. Let me walk you through some of the highlights for this quarter compared to Q4 of 2022, domestic operations had a terrific performance this quarter and contributed $0.28 of growth primarily driven by higher rental income with lower operating expenses. Gains from investment activity in the fourth quarter were approximately $0.07 higher in a year-over-year comparison, other platform investments at $0.03 lower contribution compared to last year. FFO from our real estate business was $3.23 per share in the fourth quarter compared to $2.97 from last year. That's 8.7% growth and $11.78 per share for '23 compared to $11.39 last year. Domestic property NOI increased 7.3% year-over-year for the quarter and 4.8% for the year continued leasing momentum, resilient consumer spending operational excellence delivered results for the year, exceeding our initial expectations."", ""Our NOI ended the year higher than 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency grew 7.2% for the quarter and 4.9% for the year. Mall and outlet occupancy at the end of the quarter, fourth quarter was 95.8%, an increase of 90 basis points compared to last year. The Mills occupancy was 97.8%, and occupancy is above year-end 2019 levels for all of our platforms. Average base minimum rent for malls and outlets increased 3.1% year-over-year and The Mills rents increased 4.3%, we signed more than 960 leases for approximately 3.4 million square feet in the fourth quarter. For the year, we signed over 4,500 leases, representing more than 18 million square feet approximately 30% of our leasing activity for the year were new deals, we're going-in rents of approximately $74 per square foot and renewals had going-in rents of approximately $65 per square foot."", ""Leasing momentum for the last couple of years continues Into 2024. Reported retailer sales per square foot in the quarter was $743 for malls and outlets combined and $677 through The Mills. During the quarter, we sold a portion of our interest in ABG for gross proceeds of $300 million in cash and reported pretax and after-tax gains of $157 million and $118 million respectively. We opened our 11 outlet in Europe last year, construction continues on two outlets, yes, one in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and yes, one in Jakarta, Indonesia. We completed 13 significant re-developments. And we'll complete other major development projects this year. In addition, we expect to begin construction this year on five to six mixed-use projects representing around $800 million of spend from Orange County to Ann Arbor, to Boston, to Seattle, to Roosevelt Field, they are some of the ones that are planning to start this year."", 'And we expect to fund these redevelopments to mixed-use projects with our internally generated cash flow of over $1.5 billion after dividend payments. During 2023, we completed $12 billion in financing activities, including three senior note offerings for approximately $3.1 billion including the Klépierre exchangeable offering. We recast and upsized our primary revolver credit facility to $5 billion and completed $4 billion of secured loan refinancings and extensions. Our A-rated balance sheet is as strong as ever, we have approximately $11 billion of liquidity. During 2023, we paid, as I mentioned earlier, $2.8 billion in common stock dividends. We repurchased 1.3 million shares of our common stock at an average price of just over $110 per share in 2023, and today we announced our dividend of $1.95 per share for the first quarter and year-over-year increase of 8.3%.', ""The dividend is payable on March 29 of 2024. Now moving onto 2024, our FFO guidance is $11.85 to $12.10 per share. Our guidance reflects the following assumptions; domestic property NOI growth of at least 3%, increased net interest expense compared to 2023 of approximately $0.25 to $0.30 per share reflecting current market interest rates on both fixed and variable debt assumptions and cash balances. Contribution from other property, other platform investments of approximately $0.10 to $0.15 per share; no significant acquisition or disposition activity, and our current diluted share count of approximately 374 million shares. So, with that said. It's safe to say, we're excited to enter year '31 as a public company.

The net loss attributable to Nabors shareholders for the quarter was $17 million, compared to a net loss of $49 million in the third quarter. This equates to a loss of $2.70 per diluted share, compared to a loss per diluted share of $6.26 in the third quarter. The fourth quarter results included a gain, related to mark-to-market treatment of Nabors warrants, of $10 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, compared to a charge of $8 million, or $0.86 per diluted share, in the third quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $230 million, compared to $210 million in the previous quarter.', 'Full-year 2023 operating revenues were $3.0 billion, compared to $2.7 billion in the prior year. This 13% overall increase was driven by growth in all company segments. Nabors Drilling Solutions and Rig Technologies both expanded by 24%. U.S. Drilling revenue increased by 10%, while International Drilling was 12% higher than in 2022.', 'For the full year 2023, the net loss attributable to Nabors shareholders was $11.8 million, compared to a loss of $350.3 million in 2022. Adjusted operating income improved to $269.9 million from $44.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA for 2023 was $915 million, compared to $709 million in the prior year, which translates into 29% year-on-year growth.', 'Anthony G. Petrello, Nabors Chairman, CEO and President, commented, ""Our fourth quarter operating results exceeded our expectations across all of our segments. In the U.S., daily rig margins in the Lower 48 increased sequentially, as daily revenue expanded and daily expenses were lower. Similarly, daily margins in our International business widened.', '""Pricing in the Lower 48 market held firm, as utilization of the highest specification rigs remained high. Average rig count was slightly below our estimates, as several rigs started later in the quarter than anticipated. In our International segment, rig count increased as deployments in Saudi Arabia and Colombia contributed. The International daily margin expanded, driven by better overall operating performance, and specifically by the newbuild deployments in Saudi Arabia. The improvement in our Drilling Solutions segment largely reflected growth from the third party and international markets. Rig Technologies benefitted from higher volumes in both capital equipment and the aftermarket.""', 'Highlights', ""Nabors Drilling Solutions was selected by a major operator in the Middle East to deploy NDS's rig automation technology. Initially, the award covers five working rigs, with the potential for significant expansion."", 'ExxonMobil has selected Nabors to support its lithium production project in Arkansas.

Earlier in the year, this same contractor purchased two rigs from Nabors, which are now being deployed in Libya.', ""Nabors and SLB (NYSE: SLB) jointly announced a collaboration to scale automated drilling solutions for operators and drilling contractors.

The announcement follows technology agreements earlier in 2023 with Corva and with Halliburton (NYSE: HAL)."", 'Nabors Energy Transition Corporation, the special purpose acquisition company sponsored by Nabors, and Vast Renewables Limited completed their previously announced business combination.', 'Segment Results ', 'The U.S. Drilling segment reported fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $118.4 million, compared to $117.4 million in the third quarter. Nabors exited the year with 74 rigs on revenue in the Lower 48 market, while the fourth quarter average rig count totaled 70. Daily adjusted gross margin in the Lower 48 market averaged $16,240, an increase of $385 sequentially. This improvement reflected slightly higher daily revenue and reduced operating expenses. For the full year, EBITDA margins for U.S. Drilling increased by 600 basis points to 44.2%.', 'International Drilling adjusted EBITDA totaled $105.5 million, compared to $96.2 million in the third quarter. The additional rigs in Saudi Arabia and Colombia drove the increase. International rig count averaged 80, up from 77 in the previous quarter. Daily adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter averaged $16,651, up approximately 6% from the third quarter, on improved operational performance.', 'Drilling Solutions adjusted EBITDA increased sequentially by approximately $4.1 million, to $34.5 million. Revenue growth of 6% was led by a 13% expansion in international operations. Drilling Solutions gross margin increased by 120 basis points to 52.4%.', 'In Rig Technologies, adjusted EBITDA reached $8.8 million, a 22% sequential improvement. Seasonal increases in third-party equipment revenue and higher aftermarket sales led to wider margins.', 'Adjusted Free Cash Flow', 'Adjusted free cash flow was $52 million in the fourth quarter, a $57 million improvement versus the prior period. Capital expenditures totaled $124 million, which included $43 million for the newbuilds in Saudi Arabia. This compares to $157 million in the third quarter, including $52 million supporting the newbuilds.', 'William Restrepo, Nabors CFO, stated, ""Results across our operations were impressive. EBITDA rebounded close to the levels of the first half and was significantly above our projections. In the Lower 48, we were able to add the expected number of rigs, albeit later in the quarter than we originally envisioned. Our revenue per day and daily gross margin improved sequentially. Market pricing for rigs was stable, and our efforts to reduce costs paid off. Looking ahead to the first quarter, we expect a high level of rig churn to keep our average rig count essentially in line with the fourth quarter exit rate. As operating rigs continue to reprice to the current market, we expect some erosion in daily margin.', '""Internationally we deployed rigs at attractive pricing. Reduced operating expenses and improved execution, particularly in Saudi Arabia, drove higher daily gross margins. In the first quarter, we expect newbuilds in Saudi Arabia and the initial startups in Algeria to increase our rig count.', '""Drilling Solutions and Rig Technologies fourth quarter results benefitted from strong performance software and casing running revenue, as well as higher seasonal capital equipment shipments.', '""During the fourth quarter, we completed a $650 million senior note offering due in 2030. With the proceeds, we have already retired both of our nearest pending maturities: the convertibles due in January 2024 and the senior notes due in 2025. Our next maturity is in 2026.', '""As we enter 2024, we expect to build on our 2023 results. In the U.S., our annual average rig count for 2024 should approach the prior year\'s level. We have a robust international deployment schedule in 2024, and the number of incremental opportunities continues to grow. Adoption of the NDS portfolio is still expanding, particularly on third party rigs and in international markets. Increased global drilling activity should benefit Rig Technologies. Additionally, increasing client focus on improving their operating efficiencies should drive demand for our automation solutions, while their goal to simultaneously reduce their environmental impact should drive demand for our energy transition offering.', '""We still have a number of open international tenders and potential upside in activity level for the Lower 48. While it is still early in the year, we do expect to deliver a significant improvement in adjusted free cash flow, compared to the level of 2023. We plan to allocate the 2024 cash flow generation to reducing our net debt.""', 'Outlook', 'Nabors expects the following metrics for the first quarter of 2024:', 'U.S. Drilling', 'Lower 48 average rig count of 73 - 75 rigs', 'Lower 48 daily adjusted gross margin of approximately $15,300', 'Alaska and Gulf of Mexico adjusted EBITDA up by $1.5 to $2.0 million', 'International', 'Average rig count up by approximately two rigs versus the fourth quarter average', 'Daily adjusted gross margin of approximately $16,100 - $16,300', 'Drilling Solutions', 'Adjusted EBITDA of $30 - $31 million', 'Rig Technologies', 'Adjusted EBITDA of $5 - $6 million', 'Capital Expenditures', 'Capital expenditures of $170 - $180 million, with approximately $50 million for the newbuilds in Saudi Arabia', 'Mr. Petrello concluded, ""As we look to 2024, we expect our financial performance to accelerate. International rig awards already in hand should drive growth this year. We are currently in negotiations and tendering for a significant number of additional international rigs.

Other companies in this industry may compute these measures differently.\xa0Reconciliations of consolidated adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income (loss) to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, net debt to total debt, and adjusted free cash flow to net cash provided by operations, which are their nearest comparable GAAP financial measures, are included in the tables at the end of this press release.

However, management evaluates the performance of its operating segments and the consolidated Company based on several criteria, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income (loss), because it believes that these financial measures accurately reflect the Company\'s ongoing profitability and performance.\xa0 Securities analysts and investors use this measure as one of the metrics on which they analyze the Company\'s performance.\xa0 Other companies in this industry may compute these measures differently.\xa0 A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to net income (loss), which is the most closely comparable GAAP measure, is provided in the table set forth immediately following the heading ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Net Income (Loss)"".', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '(6)', ""Rig revenue days represents the number of days the Company's rigs are contracted and performing under a contract during the period.\xa0 These would typically include days in which operating, standby and move revenue is earned."", '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '(7)', 'Average rigs working represents a measure of the average number of rigs operating during a given period.\xa0 For example, one rig operating 45 days during a quarter represents approximately 0.5 average rigs working for the quarter.\xa0 On an annual period, one rig operating 182.5 days represents approximately 0.5 average rigs working for the year.\xa0 Average rigs working can also be calculated as rig revenue days during the period divided by the number of calendar days in the period.', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '(8)', 'Daily rig revenue represents operating revenue, divided by the total number of revenue days during the quarter.\xa0\xa0\xa0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '(9)', 'Daily adjusted gross margin represents operating revenue less direct costs, divided by the total number of rig revenue days during the quarter.\xa0\xa0\xa0', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '(10)', 'The U.S. Drilling segment includes the Lower 48, Alaska, and Gulf of Mexico operating areas.', '', '', '', '', '\xa0', 'NABORS INDUSTRIES LTD.

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with APTV.', ""On February 6, 2024, Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) released its annual 10-K filing, providing a comprehensive overview of the company's financial health and strategic positioning. As a leading global technology and mobility architecture company, Aptiv PLC specializes in delivering end-to-end mobility solutions, with a strong focus on vehicle electrification and autonomous driving technologies. The company's financial tables from the filing reveal a solid market capitalization of approximately $28.8 billion as of June 30, 2023, and a global workforce that is nearly half comprised of women, indicating a commitment to diversity and inclusion. With a presence in 50 countries and a significant investment in research and development, Aptiv PLC is poised to capitalize on the evolving automotive industry."", ""Technological Leadership and Market Presence: Aptiv PLC's strength lies in its cutting-edge technology and significant market presence in the fields of vehicle electrification and autonomous driving. The company operates 138 major manufacturing facilities and 11 major technical centers, showcasing its extensive global footprint. With approximately 22,200 scientists, engineers, and technicians dedicated to product development, Aptiv PLC is at the forefront of innovation in the automotive sector. Its leadership in electrical architecture and component products, as well as advanced safety and user experience solutions, positions the company as a key player in shaping the future of mobility."", ""Commitment to Sustainability and Safety: Aptiv PLC's commitment to environmental sustainability and workplace safety is another core strength. The company's focus on reducing its carbon footprint and its alignment with ISO 45001 standards for safety management systems underscore its dedication to corporate responsibility. These initiatives not only enhance Aptiv PLC's reputation but also contribute to long-term operational efficiency and risk mitigation."", 'Customer Concentration Risk: Despite its technological prowess, Aptiv PLC faces the risk of customer concentration, with its largest customers, General Motors and Stellantis, each accounting for approximately 9% of 2022 revenue. This reliance on a few major customers could expose the company to significant financial risk if any of these relationships were to weaken or terminate.', ""Competitive Pressures: The automotive technology sector is highly competitive, with rapid innovation and frequent market entrants. Aptiv PLC's competitors may develop superior products, adapt more quickly to new technologies, or offer similar products at lower costs. The company's ability to maintain its competitive edge is crucial to its success, and any failure to innovate could adversely affect its market share and profitability."", ""Growth in Electrification and Autonomous Driving: The global shift towards electric and autonomous vehicles presents significant growth opportunities for Aptiv PLC. The company's expertise in advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving technologies positions it to capitalize on these trends, particularly in key markets like the Asia Pacific region and China."", ""Strategic Partnerships and Expansions: Aptiv PLC's strategic partnerships, such as the joint venture with Hyundai for autonomous driving, offer avenues for growth and innovation. The company's investments in manufacturing operations, technical centers, and research and development activities support its expansion into new markets and product categories, potentially leading to increased market share and revenue."", 'Industry Disruption and New Entrants: The automotive industry is subject to rapid changes and potential disruptions from new market entrants, especially in emerging vehicle technologies. Aptiv PLC must navigate these challenges and respond effectively to maintain its position in the market. The rise of mobility on-demand services and shifts in consumer preferences could also impact the demand for traditional vehicle components and systems.', 'Regulatory Changes and Technological Risks: Changes in regulations, such as those related to autonomous driving and environmental standards, could impose additional compliance costs and impact product development. Aptiv PLC must stay ahead of regulatory trends and adapt its products accordingly to avoid obsolescence and ensure continued competitiveness.', 'In conclusion, Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) exhibits a strong foundation in technological innovation and market presence, particularly in the rapidly growing fields of vehicle electrification and autonomous driving. However, the company must address its weaknesses, such as customer concentration risk and competitive pressures, to sustain its market position. The opportunities presented by the global shift towards electric and autonomous vehicles, along with strategic partnerships and expansions, offer promising avenues for growth. Nevertheless, Aptiv PLC must remain vigilant against industry disruptions, new market entrants, and evolving regulations to secure its future success in the dynamic automotive technology landscape.', 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

NTRS.', 'Industry: Regional Banks', 'Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2221574/3-major-regional-banks-to-buy-on-economic-growth-high-rates', 'The Zacks Major Regional Banks will benefit from high rates as net interest income (NII) continues to rise, despite increasing funding costs and weakening loan demand putting a strain on net interest margin (NIM) expansion. Solid economic growth will also support banks’ financials in the near term.', 'Business restructuring/expansion initiatives and digitization will offer support. While weakening asset quality is now likely to exert some pressure on the financials, major banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co., The Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and Northern Trust Corp. are worth betting on.', 'The Zacks Major Regional Banks industry includes the nation’s largest banks in terms of assets, with most operating globally. The financial performance of these banks largely depends on the nation’s economic health. As the banks are involved in several complex financial activities, they are required to meet the stringent regulations set by the Federal Reserve and other agencies.', 'Apart from traditional banking services, which are the source of the net interest income (NII), major regional banks provide a wide array of other financial services and products to retail, corporate and institutional clients, both domestic and global. These include credit and debit cards, mortgage banking, wealth management and investment banking, among others. Therefore, a large revenue source for these banks is fees and commissions earned from these services.', 'High-Interest Rates: The Fed’s aggressive monetary policy since March 2022 has led the rates to touch a 22-year high of 5.25-5.5% as it continues to fight ‘sticky’ inflation. With the inflation numbers coming down, the Fed officials have signaled the end of rate hikes this cycle and three interest rate cuts later this year. While the market participants were betting on rate cuts as early as March, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell put down such prospects with a message that the central bank will tread carefully on the timing of rate cuts.', 'While the faster pace of rate hikes puts pressure on major banks’ NIM because of an increase in funding costs, high rates for longer periods will be a boon for the industry players on the back of solid economic growth, resilient consumers and decent deposit inflows. This will support banks’ NII growth.', 'Business Restructuring Initiatives: Major regional banks are taking several strategic actions to expand into new avenues and lower their dependence on spread income. The restructuring of operations is essential for technological advancement and further domestic/global expansion to continue improving profitability. Banks are investing heavily in artificial intelligence and other digital platforms and even partnering/acquiring providers of such services.', 'The demand for these witnessed a substantial rise amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Banks are also aggressively expanding their footprint outside the United States and into Europe and Asia. Several industry players are re-evaluating their business structure to simplify operations and do away with unprofitable ones.', 'Waning Loan Demand: The central bank’s aggressive monetary policy lowered the demand for loans due to fears of an economic downturn. Further, the Fed’s latest Summary of Economic Projections indicates that the U.S. economy will slow down this year and grow at a rate of 1.4%. In 2023, the U.S. economy grew at a rate of 2.5%, per the data released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The high interest rates are keeping the borrowers on the sidelines. Hence, the lending backdrop is expected to be subdued as the demand for loans continues to wane.', 'Weakening Asset Quality: For most of 2020, major regional banks built extra provisions to tide over unexpected defaults and payment delays due to the economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 mayhem. This considerably hurt their financials. But with solid economic growth and support from government stimulus packages, banks began to release these reserves back into the income statement.', 'Now, given the current macroeconomic headwinds, industry players are building provisions to counter any adverse fallout. While conservative lending policy and the resilience of borrowers helped banks to keep their asset quality manageable, several metrics have started rising. This, thus, signals the gradual deterioration of the industry players’ asset quality.', 'The Zacks Major Regional Banks industry is a 15-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #33, which places it in the top 13% of more than 245 Zacks industries.', 'The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates outperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.', 'The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of an encouraging earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since the end of the third quarter of 2023, the industry’s earnings estimates for the current year have been revised 1.4% upward.', 'Before we present a few major bank stocks that are worth considering, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.', 'The Zacks Major Regional Banks industry has widely underperformed both the S&P 500 composite and its sector over the past three years. While stocks in this industry have collectively gained 9.7% over the period, the Zacks S&P 500 composite has jumped 25.4%, and the Zacks Finance sector has rallied 17.1%.', 'One might get a good sense of the industry’s relative valuation by looking at its price-to-tangible book ratio (P/TBV), which is commonly used for valuing banks because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next.', 'The industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/TBV of 1.82X. This compares with the highest level of 2.48X, the lowest of 1.21X and the median of 1.95X over the past five years. The industry is trading at a huge discount compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/TBV for the S&P 500 composite is 10.80X.', 'As finance stocks typically have a lower P/TBV ratio, comparing major regional banks with the S&P 500 may not make sense to many investors. However, a comparison of the group’s P/TBV ratio with that of the broader sector ensures that the group is trading at a solid discount. The Zacks Finance sector’s trailing 12-month P/TBV came in at 4.75X. This is way above the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry’s ratio.', 'JPMorgan: The largest U.S. bank (in terms of assets), JPMorgan has operations in more than 60 countries. The company is expected to keep benefiting from higher rates (though now the funding costs will put some strain), decent loan growth, strategic buyouts, business diversification efforts, a strong liquidity position and initiatives to expand the branch network in new markets.', 'Last May, JPM took over the failed First Republic Bank for $10.6 billion after almost two months of joint efforts with other lenders to save the flagging institution. The deal immensely benefited the company’s financials in 2023 and helped record the biggest annual profits in its history.', 'This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) lender has been growing through on-bolt acquisitions, both domestic and international. These are expected to keep aiding its plan to diversify revenues and expand the fee income product suite and consumer bank digitally.', 'Also, JPMorgan is expanding its footprint in new regions and has a presence in 48 of 50 U.S. states. It intends to expand its retail branches further. The strategy continues to help the bank grab cross-selling opportunities by increasing its presence in the card and auto loan sectors. Also, the company launched its digital retail bank Chase in the U.K. in 2021 and plans to expand its reach across European Union countries.', 'With a market cap of $502.6 billion, JPMorgan is expected to continue benefiting from its scale and business expansion efforts. Also, analysts are bullish on the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has moved 2% upward for 2024 in the past month. The stock has rallied 11.4% in the past six months.', 'BNY Mellon: Operating in 35 countries, BNY Mellon provides various products and services to individuals and institutions. Its global client base consists of financial institutions, corporations, government agencies, endowments and foundations, and high-net-worth individuals.', 'Higher interest rates will support BNY Mellon’s top-line growth. While the company’s NIR and net interest margin (NIM) declined in 2020 and 2021, both rebounded solidly thereafter. NIR recorded a five-year (ended 2023) CAGR of 3.8%. Though a rise in funding costs will likely weigh on NIR, the metric is anticipated to keep improving in the quarters ahead, driven by the high interest rate regime.', 'This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has been trying to gain a foothold in foreign markets and is undertaking several growth initiatives (including launching new services, digitizing operations and making strategic buyouts). In 2023, non-U.S. revenues constituted 36% of total revenues. Its international revenues are expected to continue improving as the demand for personalized services rises globally. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.', 'Following the clearance of the 2023 stress test, the company hiked its quarterly cash dividend by 14% to 42 cents per share. BK announced a share buyback program worth $5 billion, effective Jan 1, 2023. As of Dec 31, 2023, nearly $2.4 billion worth of buyback authorization remained. The company expects to return 100% or more of its earnings to shareholders in 2024 after having returned 123% last year. Driven by a strong capital position and earnings strength, the company is expected to sustain efficient capital distributions.', 'BNY Mellon has a market cap of $42.8 billion. Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has moved 4.8% upward for 2024. In the past six months, the stock has gained 18.8%.', 'Northern Trust: With total assets worth $150.8 billion as of Dec 31, 2023, Northern Trust is a leading provider of wealth management, asset servicing, asset management and banking solutions to corporations, institutions, families and individuals.', 'Organic growth is the company’s key strength. Its revenues witnessed a CAGR of 3.5% over the last three years (2020-2023), driven by rising non-interest income and NII. The growth of NII was aided by an improvement in loan balances and higher rates. Also, robust pipelines in the Asset Servicing and Wealth Management segments will likely drive organic growth in the upcoming period.', 'NTRS is undertaking expense management efforts to tackle expense growth and reinstate its operating leverage. It focused on disciplined headcount management, vendor consolidation, rationalization of its real estate footprint and process automation. Through such efforts, it will likely improve productivity and meet the financial targets.', 'This Zacks Rank #2 company’s capital distributions seem impressive. In 2022, the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 7% to 75 cents per share. In 2021, the company announced a 25-million share repurchase program with no expiration date. Its debt/equity ratio, comparing favorably with the broader industry, and decent liquidity highlight the fact that such capital-distribution activities are sustainable in the future.', 'NTRS has a market cap of $16.6 billion. Analysts are bullish on the stock. In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has been revised 8.9% upward for 2024.

JPM, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation BK and Northern Trust Corporation NTRS are worth betting on.', 'About the Industry', 'The Zacks Major Regional Banks industry includes the nation’s largest banks in terms of assets, with most operating globally. The financial performance of these banks largely depends on the nation’s economic health. As the banks are involved in several complex financial activities, they are required to meet the stringent regulations set by the Federal Reserve and other agencies. Apart from traditional banking services, which are the source of the net interest income (NII), major regional banks provide a wide array of other financial services and products to retail, corporate and institutional clients, both domestic and global. These include credit and debit cards, mortgage banking, wealth management and investment banking, among others. Therefore, a large revenue source for these banks is fees and commissions earned from these services.', 'Themes to Influence the Major Regional Banks Industry', 'High-Interest Rates: The Fed’s aggressive monetary policy since March 2022 has led the rates to touch a 22-year high of 5.25-5.5% as it continues to fight ‘sticky’ inflation. With the inflation numbers coming down, the Fed officials have signaled the end of rate hikes this cycle and three interest rate cuts later this year. While the market participants were betting on rate cuts as early as March, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell put down such prospects with a message that the central bank will tread carefully on the timing of rate cuts.While the faster pace of rate hikes puts pressure on major banks’ NIM because of an increase in funding costs, high rates for longer periods will be a boon for the industry players on the back of solid economic growth, resilient consumers and decent deposit inflows. This will support banks’ NII growth.Business Restructuring Initiatives: Major regional banks are taking several strategic actions to expand into new avenues and lower their dependence on spread income. The restructuring of operations is essential for technological advancement and further domestic/global expansion to continue improving profitability. Banks are investing heavily in artificial intelligence and other digital platforms and even partnering/acquiring providers of such services. The demand for these witnessed a substantial rise amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Banks are also aggressively expanding their footprint outside the United States and into Europe and Asia. Several industry players are re-evaluating their business structure to simplify operations and do away with unprofitable ones.Waning Loan Demand: The central bank’s aggressive monetary policy lowered the demand for loans due to fears of an economic downturn. Further, the Fed’s latest Summary of Economic Projections indicates that the U.S. economy will slow down this year and grow at a rate of 1.4%. In 2023, the U.S. economy grew at a rate of 2.5%, per the data released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The high interest rates are keeping the borrowers on the sidelines. Hence, the lending backdrop is expected to be subdued as the demand for loans continues to wane.Weakening Asset Quality: For most of 2020, major regional banks built extra provisions to tide over unexpected defaults and payment delays due to the economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 mayhem. This considerably hurt their financials. But with solid economic growth and support from government stimulus packages, banks began to release these reserves back into the income statement. Now, given the current macroeconomic headwinds, industry players are building provisions to counter any adverse fallout. While conservative lending policy and the resilience of borrowers helped banks to keep their asset quality manageable, several metrics have started rising. This, thus, signals the gradual deterioration of the industry players’ asset quality.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Suggests Bright Prospects', 'The Zacks Major Regional Banks industry is a 15-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #33, which places it in the top 13% of more than 245 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates outperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of an encouraging earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since the end of the third quarter of 2023, the industry’s earnings estimates for the current year have been revised 1.4% upward.Before we present a few major bank stocks that are worth considering, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.', 'Industry Underperforms the Sector and the S&P 500', 'The Zacks Major Regional Banks industry has widely underperformed both the S&P 500 composite and its sector over the past three years.

This compares with the highest level of 2.48X, the lowest of 1.21X and the median of 1.95X over the past five years. The industry is trading at a huge discount compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/TBV for the S&P 500 composite is 10.80X, as the chart below shows.', 'Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM)', '\xa0', 'As finance stocks typically have a lower P/TBV ratio, comparing major regional banks with the S&P 500 may not make sense to many investors. However, a comparison of the group’s P/TBV ratio with that of the broader sector ensures that the group is trading at a solid discount. The Zacks Finance sector’s trailing 12-month P/TBV came in at 4.75X. This is way above the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry’s ratio, as the chart below shows.', 'Price-to-Tangible Book Ratio (TTM)', '', '3 Major Regional Banks to Bet on', 'JPMorgan: The largest U.S. bank (in terms of assets), JPMorgan has operations in more than 60 countries. The company is expected to keep benefiting from higher rates (though now the funding costs will put some strain), decent loan growth, strategic buyouts, business diversification efforts, a strong liquidity position and initiatives to expand the branch network in new markets.Last May, JPM took over the failed First Republic Bank for $10.6 billion after almost two months of joint efforts with other lenders to save the flagging institution. The deal immensely benefited the company’s financials in 2023 and helped record the biggest annual profits in its history.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) lender has been growing through on-bolt acquisitions, both domestic and international. These are expected to keep aiding its plan to diversify revenues and expand the fee income product suite and consumer bank digitally.Also, JPMorgan is expanding its footprint in new regions and has a presence in 48 of 50 U.S. states. It intends to expand its retail branches further. The strategy continues to help the bank grab cross-selling opportunities by increasing its presence in the card and auto loan sectors. Also, the company launched its digital retail bank Chase in the U.K. in 2021 and plans to expand its reach across European Union countries.With a market cap of $502.6 billion, JPMorgan is expected to continue benefiting from its scale and business expansion efforts.

Its global client base consists of financial institutions, corporations, government agencies, endowments and foundations, and high-net-worth individuals.Higher interest rates will support BNY Mellon’s top-line growth. While the company’s NIR and net interest margin (NIM) declined in 2020 and 2021, both rebounded solidly thereafter. NIR recorded a five-year (ended 2023) CAGR of 3.8%. Though a rise in funding costs will likely weigh on NIR, the metric is anticipated to keep improving in the quarters ahead, driven by the high interest rate regime.This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has been trying to gain a foothold in foreign markets and is undertaking several growth initiatives (including launching new services, digitizing operations and making strategic buyouts). In 2023, non-U.S. revenues constituted 36% of total revenues. Its international revenues are expected to continue improving as the demand for personalized services rises globally.

Its revenues witnessed a CAGR of 3.5% over the last three years (2020-2023), driven by rising non-interest income and NII. The growth of NII was aided by an improvement in loan balances and higher rates. Also, robust pipelines in the Asset Servicing and Wealth Management segments will likely drive organic growth in the upcoming period.NTRS is undertaking expense management efforts to tackle expense growth and reinstate its operating leverage. It focused on disciplined headcount management, vendor consolidation, rationalization of its real estate footprint and process automation. Through such efforts, it will likely improve productivity and meet the financial targets.This Zacks Rank #2 company’s capital distributions seem impressive. In 2022, the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 7% to 75 cents per share. In 2021, the company announced a 25-million share repurchase program with no expiration date. Its debt/equity ratio, comparing favorably with the broader industry, and decent liquidity highlight the fact that such capital-distribution activities are sustainable in the future.NTRS has a market cap of $16.6 billion.

In it, he talked about a focus on artificial intelligence to make it easier to create videos, increasingly professional-quality videos, and a growing emphasis on subscriptions for consumers to watch videos ad-free while still paying dividends to content owners.', 'The letter comes after a strong fiscal 2023 for parent Alphabet, driven partly by YouTube’s quickly expanding ads and subscriptions businesses. The video giant, which generated over $9 billion for Alphabet last year, has become a huge source of potential growth for its parent as consumers increasingly shift their entertainment time from cable TV to streaming—in many cases on big-screen TVs in their living rooms.', '“They’re watching YouTube the way we used to sit down together for traditional TV shows,” Mohan said.', 'In a sign of its status among creators, Mohan said, YouTube now has over 3 million channels enrolled in its ad and subscription revenue sharing program (YPP). Those channels—mostly individuals and small outfits that he described as “next-generation studios”—get a cut of any revenue their videos generate.', 'The creator world has become so big that Mohan, in his letter, suggested that YouTube may lobby for creators in Washington over unspecified legislation. He wrote the company will “help policymakers and partners across the industry see the economic and entertainment value that creators bring to the table.”', 'In terms of subscriptions, Mohan wrote of their importance to YouTube and that it will push for more in 2024. Last year, they generated $15 billion, driven by YouTube’s premium TV, music, and NFL Sunday Ticket offerings. Mohan also revealed that YouTube TV (a cable replacement) has 8 million subscribers while Music has 100 million (including trial members). The big subscription numbers show how YouTube is continuing to encroach on territory dominated by paid streamers like Netflix and Spotify Premium, particularly the latter as the music platform has 226 million paid subscribers globally (while Netflix has around 260 million).', 'The real venue for YouTube to compete with the likes of Netflix and Spotify is the living room. Helped by YouTube TV, NFL Sunday Ticket, and other big screen-ready content, Mohan said users average more than 1 billion hours of YouTube content on their TVs daily as opposed to watching it on their laptops or smartphones. This comes as YouTube simultaneously takes on TikTok for dominance in short, snackable video clips, especially with YouTube’s introduction of TikTok competitor Shorts.', 'While living room-ready content may ring alarm bells for creators—most of whom do not have the means or training to make big-picture-perfect content—Mohan hopes YouTube’s AI with “appropriate protections” will quell their fears. These AI tools include Dream Screen, which creates a professional or realistic-looking background, and Music AI Incubator, which helps with audio. “Everyone should have access to AI tools that will push the boundaries of creative expression,” he said.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$6.26b', 'US$5.34b', 'US$5.10b', 'US$4.95b', 'US$4.89b', 'US$4.88b', 'US$4.90b', 'US$4.95b', 'US$5.02b', 'US$5.10b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x6', 'Analyst x6', 'Analyst x2', 'Analyst x1', 'Est @ -1.24%', 'Est @ -0.20%', 'Est @ 0.52%', 'Est @ 1.03%', 'Est @ 1.39%', 'Est @ 1.64%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.5% ', 'US$5.8k', 'US$4.5k', 'US$4.0k', 'US$3.6k', 'US$3.2k', 'US$3.0k', 'US$2.8k', 'US$2.6k', 'US$2.4k', 'US$2.2k', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$34b', ""The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage.

In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth.

The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Phillips 66 as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.264. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

The company's recent acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics has further expanded its reach into rare disease drugs, including the thyroid eye disease drug Tepezza."", ""Despite robust revenue growth, Amgen's GAAP earnings per share (EPS) saw a significant decrease of 53% in the fourth quarter, attributed to acquisition-related expenses and incremental operating expenses from the Horizon acquisition.

Non-GAAP EPS, which excludes certain expenses, showed a more favorable trend with a 15% increase in the fourth quarter and a 5% increase for the full year."", ""The company's financial achievements, particularly in product sales growth, are critical in an industry where innovation and the ability to bring new drugs to market can significantly impact a company's performance.

While the acquisition has led to increased operating expenses, it has also provided a significant boost to product sales and expanded Amgen's therapeutic portfolio.

Nevertheless, its unique role in markets as a store of value sets it apart from nearly all other assets. Acting as a safe-haven metal, gold offers a hedge against geopolitical instability and financial turbulence, providing investors with a secure asset to protect their purchasing power and guard against currency devaluation, such as that of the US dollar. Like any commodity, gold's price is influenced by the dynamics of supply and demand. However, its utility extends beyond being a mere store of value or investment.

Regarding gold, the report highlighted that ""a significant portion of central banks express apprehension about the precedent established by the US freezing of Russian reserves, with the majority (58%) concurring that this incident has heightened the attractiveness of gold.""

Babin notes investors are watching China demand and surging US production.', 'Though supply is expected to grow at a slower pace in 2024, Babin says US suppliers were able to ""pull the rabbit out of the hat"" last year and surpass forecasts. While supply growth should moderate, she notes investors feel ""confident"" on the supply side currently.', 'However, Babin doesn\'t think oil prices have ""peaked"" yet. She argues people ""overly"" fixate on ""downside risks"" around China and US supply, ignoring potential demand upside. As Babin points out, oil demand was ""consistently revised higher"" in 2023, a trend that could persist in 2024.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith"", '- How are you looking specifically at oil right now and where the supply demand dynamics are likely to move.', ""REBECCA BABIN: Yeah. So she brought up a couple great points. And the first is US supply growth. I think when analysts are looking at 2024, there's two numbers they're least confident in. The first is China demand, which they're very concerned is going to undershoot. And the second is US supply growth. In 2023, we saw the US really outperform most analysts' expectations on supply growth based on better efficiency, better use of capital, longer laterals."", ""So when we look at 2024, we are, and we're hearing this from the companies, they're expecting supply to continue to grow, but it's at a slower rate. And if the US grew a million barrels of supply last year, they're looking at something like 400,000 to 600,000 barrels of supply growth coming out of the US this year."", ""So that is really a key number. We got burned a little bit last year thinking supply growth would be capped in the US and they were able to kind of pull the rabbit out of the hat and really outperform. And so I think there is an expectation growth will slow down. But if you think about where analysts are looking at crude and looking at that very finely balanced market of 1.3 million barrels a day to 1.6 million barrels a day of demand growth and a very similar amount of non-OPEC supply growth, they're looking at the US as a potential to continue to outperform there."", ""It's really a tricky, tricky market in terms of nailing down those numbers. But I think most analysts are pretty confident that the market is well-supported and crude fundamentally kind of around that $70 a barrel in WTI. But they're very closely watching what's happening in China and what's happening with the US supply growth."", '- So then Rebecca, you mentioned staying in this sort of $70 range. Do you think then oil prices have peaked barring sort of any big movements or as you mentioned, the China factor here?', ""REBECCA BABIN: I actually don't think they've peaked. And here's the thing. Everyone seems to be very focused on these downside risks. US supply growth, China demand, and really kind of taking their eye off the ball of there are a couple of things that could go right for crude this year. We could actually see demand outperform. And if you look at the demand numbers in 2023, they consistently were revised higher from the weekly data that comes out from the EIA."", ""So we could continue to see this kind of worrying yourself into a lower market, but then seeing demand come in stronger. The second thing I'd say is we do have the SPR being refilled, they have been more active this year. There seems to be a commitment to continue to be active. And we have a very disciplined OPEC, which I think will absolutely extend their cuts through the first half of '24 and maybe even throughout the whole year, if they need to."", ""So I actually think the market should be trading closer to 75%, 80%. I think we'll probably see 80% as we get closer to summer when the balance is starting to tighten up and the market is overly kind of worrying themselves on these downside risks on a day in and day out basis.""]"

This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Zoetis?', ""For Zoetis, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.21%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.', 'So, this combination indicates that Zoetis will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Zoetis would post earnings of $1.35 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.36, delivering a surprise of +0.74%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower.

All three of the major stock indexes have oscillated between bear and bull markets in successive years since the start of the decade."", 'But therein lies the opportunity for long-term investors. Since every notable drop in the major indexes throughout history has eventually been cleared away by a bull market rally, corrections and bear markets have always been blessings in disguise. Even with the major indexes at or near all-time highs, discounts on high-quality stocks can still be found.', 'Best of all, online brokerages have largely done away with minimum deposit requirements and commission fees for stock trades on major U.S. exchanges. In other words, any amount of money -- even $200 -- can be the perfect amount to put to work.', ""If you have $200 that's ready to invest, and you're absolutely certain this isn't cash you're going to need to pay bills or cover emergency expenses, the following three stocks stand out as no-brainer buys right now."", 'The first spectacular stock that you can confidently scoop up with $200 right now is none other than the largest electric utility by market cap, NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE).', 'Following a virtually unstoppable two-decade stretch for NextEra, shares of the company were clobbered in 2023 as interest rates rapidly rose and short-term Treasury yields soared to more than 5%. Investors typically flock to utility stocks for their low volatility and market-topping yields. But if they can get similar or higher yields from Treasury bonds, it leads to far less interest (pardon the pun) in utility stocks.', ""The good news is that 2024 (and beyond) holds a number of catalysts for NextEra Energy. For instance, the nation's central bank is expected to begin a rate-easing cycle this year. Treasury bond yields have responded by moving well off of their highs from 2023. This is going to make utility stocks more attractive to income investors."", 'But macro factors aside, the real reason to be excited about NextEra Energy is its focus on renewable energy. As of the end of September, NextEra had 70 gigawatts (GW) of capacity in operation, with 34 GW tracing back to renewable sources. The 23 GW from wind and 6 GW from solar are the highest marks in the world among electric utilities.', ""While these projects weren't cheap, they've helped to meaningfully lower electricity costs and have fueled a nearly double-digit adjusted annual earnings growth rate since 2012. For context, most utilities grow their year-over-year earnings by a low-single-digit percentage."", ""I'll also add that utilities provide a basic need. Homeowners and renters are going to need electricity to power their appliances and/or HVAC systems. Since demand for electricity doesn't change much one year to the next, and most utilities operate as monopolies or duopolies in the areas they service, the cash flow NextEra generates is highly predictable."", 'Shares of NextEra Energy can be purchased right now for below 16x forward-year earnings. This represents its lowest forward-year multiple in at least a decade, and a 40% discount to its five-year average forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.', ""The second no-brainer stock that's begging to be bought with $200 right now is specialty biotech BioMarin Pharmaceutical (NASDAQ: BMRN)."", ""If there's a knock against BioMarin, it'd likely be the company's valuation. With the stock market being especially volatile over the past couple of years, paying more than 110 times trailing-12-month earnings may not be everyone's cup of tea. Thankfully, Wall Street tends to be forward-looking, and that's where BioMarin shines."", ""One of the most unique aspects about this company is that it exclusively targets orphan and ultrarare diseases. Although focusing on treatments for small patient pools does come with risk, there's plenty of reward for successful trials and approved therapies. In addition to improving the quality of life for patients who previously had few (if any) available treatment options, orphan and ultrarare novel drugs face minimal pushback from insurers on their high list prices, and they typically have limited or no competition. In short, approved ultrarare drugs can have a wide-open pathway to success."", ""Among BioMarin's eight approved novel therapies, dwarfism drug Voxzogo has the most promising future. Sales of the drug more than tripled to roughly $324 million through the first nine months of 2023, and have the potential to eventually top $1 billion annually."", ""Further, in December, BioMarin appeased activist investor Elliott Investment Management by agreeing to expand the company's board of directors by four seats to 15, and adding a new review committee. While activist investors don't have a perfect track record of increasing the value of everything they invest in, their presence often signifies the possibility of value being unlocked in the future."", ""Additionally, healthcare is a defensive sector. Demand for prescription drugs tends to be stable in any economic climate, which is excellent news for the company's operating cash flow."", 'Lastly, BioMarin is a lot cheaper than investors may realize. Earnings per share are on track to quadruple from a little over $1 in 2023 to more than $4 by 2026. All the while, sales are expected to shoot up more than 50%.', 'The third no-brainer stock to buy with $200 right now is global tobacco powerhouse Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM).', 'The front-and-center headwind for tobacco companies is that consumers have become increasingly aware of the dangers of long-term tobacco use. This education, coupled with warnings on packaging in most markets, has led to a decline in adult cigarette smoking rates in some developed countries.', ""There's no doubt that the best days are in the rearview mirror for the traditional tobacco industry. However, this doesn't mean tobacco stocks can't make patient investors richer."", ""This first factor working in Philip Morris' favor is its virtually unparalleled geographic diversity. It sells tobacco products in more than 180 countries. If adult smoking rates are declining in developed markets, there's a reasonable chance the company can offset shipment declines with growing demand in emerging markets."", 'This is a good time to mention that tobacco contains nicotine, which is an additive chemical. The addictive lure of tobacco products often allows the big players, such as Philip Morris, to pass along price increases that more than offset inflation and/or outpace the rate of cigarette shipments declines in select markets.', ""But the biggest catalyst of all for Philip Morris International is the company's smokeless tobacco push via its Iqos heated tobacco system. In the September-ended quarter, the company notes that heated tobacco unit (HTU) shipments rose 18% to 32.5 billion from the prior-year period, with total market share of HTUs rising by 120 basis points to 9%. Philip Morris is still in the very early innings of its smokeless products expansion."", ""Tobacco stocks are also known for their generous capital-return programs. With the understanding that their supercharged growth days are in the rearview mirror, tobacco companies usually offer robust dividends and/or hearty buyback programs. Though Philip Morris hadn't repurchased any shares in 2023 (through September), it is doling out $5.20 per share in dividends. That's good for a market-crushing 5.6% yield."", ""To round things out, Philip Morris' stock is cheaper than it's been in six years. Shares are trading at 14x consensus earnings in 2024, which is an 8% discount to its average forward-year multiple over the past five years."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in NextEra Energy, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and NextEra Energy wasn’t one of them.

Solid economic growth will also support banks’ financials in the near term.', 'Business restructuring/expansion initiatives and digitization will offer support. While weakening asset quality is now likely to exert some pressure on the financials, major banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co., The Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and Northern Trust Corp. are worth betting on.', 'The Zacks Major Regional Banks industry includes the nation’s largest banks in terms of assets, with most operating globally. The financial performance of these banks largely depends on the nation’s economic health. As the banks are involved in several complex financial activities, they are required to meet the stringent regulations set by the Federal Reserve and other agencies.', 'Apart from traditional banking services, which are the source of the net interest income (NII), major regional banks provide a wide array of other financial services and products to retail, corporate and institutional clients, both domestic and global. These include credit and debit cards, mortgage banking, wealth management and investment banking, among others. Therefore, a large revenue source for these banks is fees and commissions earned from these services.', 'High-Interest Rates: The Fed’s aggressive monetary policy since March 2022 has led the rates to touch a 22-year high of 5.25-5.5% as it continues to fight ‘sticky’ inflation. With the inflation numbers coming down, the Fed officials have signaled the end of rate hikes this cycle and three interest rate cuts later this year. While the market participants were betting on rate cuts as early as March, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell put down such prospects with a message that the central bank will tread carefully on the timing of rate cuts.', 'While the faster pace of rate hikes puts pressure on major banks’ NIM because of an increase in funding costs, high rates for longer periods will be a boon for the industry players on the back of solid economic growth, resilient consumers and decent deposit inflows. This will support banks’ NII growth.', 'Business Restructuring Initiatives: Major regional banks are taking several strategic actions to expand into new avenues and lower their dependence on spread income. The restructuring of operations is essential for technological advancement and further domestic/global expansion to continue improving profitability. Banks are investing heavily in artificial intelligence and other digital platforms and even partnering/acquiring providers of such services.', 'The demand for these witnessed a substantial rise amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Banks are also aggressively expanding their footprint outside the United States and into Europe and Asia. Several industry players are re-evaluating their business structure to simplify operations and do away with unprofitable ones.', 'Waning Loan Demand: The central bank’s aggressive monetary policy lowered the demand for loans due to fears of an economic downturn. Further, the Fed’s latest Summary of Economic Projections indicates that the U.S. economy will slow down this year and grow at a rate of 1.4%. In 2023, the U.S. economy grew at a rate of 2.5%, per the data released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The high interest rates are keeping the borrowers on the sidelines. Hence, the lending backdrop is expected to be subdued as the demand for loans continues to wane.', 'Weakening Asset Quality: For most of 2020, major regional banks built extra provisions to tide over unexpected defaults and payment delays due to the economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 mayhem. This considerably hurt their financials. But with solid economic growth and support from government stimulus packages, banks began to release these reserves back into the income statement.', 'Now, given the current macroeconomic headwinds, industry players are building provisions to counter any adverse fallout. While conservative lending policy and the resilience of borrowers helped banks to keep their asset quality manageable, several metrics have started rising. This, thus, signals the gradual deterioration of the industry players’ asset quality.', 'The Zacks Major Regional Banks industry is a 15-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #33, which places it in the top 13% of more than 245 Zacks industries.', 'The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates outperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.', 'The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of an encouraging earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since the end of the third quarter of 2023, the industry’s earnings estimates for the current year have been revised 1.4% upward.', 'Before we present a few major bank stocks that are worth considering, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.', 'The Zacks Major Regional Banks industry has widely underperformed both the S&P 500 composite and its sector over the past three years. While stocks in this industry have collectively gained 9.7% over the period, the Zacks S&P 500 composite has jumped 25.4%, and the Zacks Finance sector has rallied 17.1%.', 'One might get a good sense of the industry’s relative valuation by looking at its price-to-tangible book ratio (P/TBV), which is commonly used for valuing banks because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next.', 'The industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/TBV of 1.82X. This compares with the highest level of 2.48X, the lowest of 1.21X and the median of 1.95X over the past five years. The industry is trading at a huge discount compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/TBV for the S&P 500 composite is 10.80X.', 'As finance stocks typically have a lower P/TBV ratio, comparing major regional banks with the S&P 500 may not make sense to many investors. However, a comparison of the group’s P/TBV ratio with that of the broader sector ensures that the group is trading at a solid discount. The Zacks Finance sector’s trailing 12-month P/TBV came in at 4.75X. This is way above the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry’s ratio.', 'JPMorgan: The largest U.S. bank (in terms of assets), JPMorgan has operations in more than 60 countries. The company is expected to keep benefiting from higher rates (though now the funding costs will put some strain), decent loan growth, strategic buyouts, business diversification efforts, a strong liquidity position and initiatives to expand the branch network in new markets.', 'Last May, JPM took over the failed First Republic Bank for $10.6 billion after almost two months of joint efforts with other lenders to save the flagging institution. The deal immensely benefited the company’s financials in 2023 and helped record the biggest annual profits in its history.', 'This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) lender has been growing through on-bolt acquisitions, both domestic and international. These are expected to keep aiding its plan to diversify revenues and expand the fee income product suite and consumer bank digitally.', 'Also, JPMorgan is expanding its footprint in new regions and has a presence in 48 of 50 U.S. states. It intends to expand its retail branches further. The strategy continues to help the bank grab cross-selling opportunities by increasing its presence in the card and auto loan sectors. Also, the company launched its digital retail bank Chase in the U.K. in 2021 and plans to expand its reach across European Union countries.', 'With a market cap of $502.6 billion, JPMorgan is expected to continue benefiting from its scale and business expansion efforts. Also, analysts are bullish on the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has moved 2% upward for 2024 in the past month.

Its global client base consists of financial institutions, corporations, government agencies, endowments and foundations, and high-net-worth individuals.', 'Higher interest rates will support BNY Mellon’s top-line growth. While the company’s NIR and net interest margin (NIM) declined in 2020 and 2021, both rebounded solidly thereafter. NIR recorded a five-year (ended 2023) CAGR of 3.8%. Though a rise in funding costs will likely weigh on NIR, the metric is anticipated to keep improving in the quarters ahead, driven by the high interest rate regime.', 'This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has been trying to gain a foothold in foreign markets and is undertaking several growth initiatives (including launching new services, digitizing operations and making strategic buyouts). In 2023, non-U.S. revenues constituted 36% of total revenues. Its international revenues are expected to continue improving as the demand for personalized services rises globally. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.', 'Following the clearance of the 2023 stress test, the company hiked its quarterly cash dividend by 14% to 42 cents per share.

Its revenues witnessed a CAGR of 3.5% over the last three years (2020-2023), driven by rising non-interest income and NII. The growth of NII was aided by an improvement in loan balances and higher rates. Also, robust pipelines in the Asset Servicing and Wealth Management segments will likely drive organic growth in the upcoming period.', 'NTRS is undertaking expense management efforts to tackle expense growth and reinstate its operating leverage. It focused on disciplined headcount management, vendor consolidation, rationalization of its real estate footprint and process automation. Through such efforts, it will likely improve productivity and meet the financial targets.', 'This Zacks Rank #2 company’s capital distributions seem impressive.

While the market participants were betting on rate cuts as early as March, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell put down such prospects with a message that the central bank will tread carefully on the timing of rate cuts.While the faster pace of rate hikes puts pressure on major banks’ NIM because of an increase in funding costs, high rates for longer periods will be a boon for the industry players on the back of solid economic growth, resilient consumers and decent deposit inflows. This will support banks’ NII growth.Business Restructuring Initiatives: Major regional banks are taking several strategic actions to expand into new avenues and lower their dependence on spread income. The restructuring of operations is essential for technological advancement and further domestic/global expansion to continue improving profitability. Banks are investing heavily in artificial intelligence and other digital platforms and even partnering/acquiring providers of such services. The demand for these witnessed a substantial rise amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Banks are also aggressively expanding their footprint outside the United States and into Europe and Asia. Several industry players are re-evaluating their business structure to simplify operations and do away with unprofitable ones.Waning Loan Demand: The central bank’s aggressive monetary policy lowered the demand for loans due to fears of an economic downturn. Further, the Fed’s latest Summary of Economic Projections indicates that the U.S. economy will slow down this year and grow at a rate of 1.4%. In 2023, the U.S. economy grew at a rate of 2.5%, per the data released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The high interest rates are keeping the borrowers on the sidelines. Hence, the lending backdrop is expected to be subdued as the demand for loans continues to wane.Weakening Asset Quality: For most of 2020, major regional banks built extra provisions to tide over unexpected defaults and payment delays due to the economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 mayhem. This considerably hurt their financials. But with solid economic growth and support from government stimulus packages, banks began to release these reserves back into the income statement. Now, given the current macroeconomic headwinds, industry players are building provisions to counter any adverse fallout. While conservative lending policy and the resilience of borrowers helped banks to keep their asset quality manageable, several metrics have started rising. This, thus, signals the gradual deterioration of the industry players’ asset quality.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Suggests Bright Prospects', 'The Zacks Major Regional Banks industry is a 15-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #33, which places it in the top 13% of more than 245 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates outperformance in the near term.

Since the end of the third quarter of 2023, the industry’s earnings estimates for the current year have been revised 1.4% upward.Before we present a few major bank stocks that are worth considering, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.', 'Industry Underperforms the Sector and the S&P 500', 'The Zacks Major Regional Banks industry has widely underperformed both the S&P 500 composite and its sector over the past three years.

The deal immensely benefited the company’s financials in 2023 and helped record the biggest annual profits in its history.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) lender has been growing through on-bolt acquisitions, both domestic and international.

Babin notes investors are watching China demand and surging US production.', 'Though supply is expected to grow at a slower pace in 2024, Babin says US suppliers were able to ""pull the rabbit out of the hat"" last year and surpass forecasts. While supply growth should moderate, she notes investors feel ""confident"" on the supply side currently.', 'However, Babin doesn\'t think oil prices have ""peaked"" yet. She argues people ""overly"" fixate on ""downside risks"" around China and US supply, ignoring potential demand upside. As Babin points out, oil demand was ""consistently revised higher"" in 2023, a trend that could persist in 2024.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith"", '- How are you looking specifically at oil right now and where the supply demand dynamics are likely to move.', ""REBECCA BABIN: Yeah. So she brought up a couple great points. And the first is US supply growth. I think when analysts are looking at 2024, there's two numbers they're least confident in. The first is China demand, which they're very concerned is going to undershoot. And the second is US supply growth. In 2023, we saw the US really outperform most analysts' expectations on supply growth based on better efficiency, better use of capital, longer laterals."", ""So when we look at 2024, we are, and we're hearing this from the companies, they're expecting supply to continue to grow, but it's at a slower rate. And if the US grew a million barrels of supply last year, they're looking at something like 400,000 to 600,000 barrels of supply growth coming out of the US this year."", ""So that is really a key number. We got burned a little bit last year thinking supply growth would be capped in the US and they were able to kind of pull the rabbit out of the hat and really outperform. And so I think there is an expectation growth will slow down. But if you think about where analysts are looking at crude and looking at that very finely balanced market of 1.3 million barrels a day to 1.6 million barrels a day of demand growth and a very similar amount of non-OPEC supply growth, they're looking at the US as a potential to continue to outperform there."", ""It's really a tricky, tricky market in terms of nailing down those numbers. But I think most analysts are pretty confident that the market is well-supported and crude fundamentally kind of around that $70 a barrel in WTI. But they're very closely watching what's happening in China and what's happening with the US supply growth."", '- So then Rebecca, you mentioned staying in this sort of $70 range. Do you think then oil prices have peaked barring sort of any big movements or as you mentioned, the China factor here?', ""REBECCA BABIN: I actually don't think they've peaked. And here's the thing. Everyone seems to be very focused on these downside risks. US supply growth, China demand, and really kind of taking their eye off the ball of there are a couple of things that could go right for crude this year. We could actually see demand outperform. And if you look at the demand numbers in 2023, they consistently were revised higher from the weekly data that comes out from the EIA."", ""So we could continue to see this kind of worrying yourself into a lower market, but then seeing demand come in stronger. The second thing I'd say is we do have the SPR being refilled, they have been more active this year. There seems to be a commitment to continue to be active. And we have a very disciplined OPEC, which I think will absolutely extend their cuts through the first half of '24 and maybe even throughout the whole year, if they need to."", ""So I actually think the market should be trading closer to 75%, 80%. I think we'll probably see 80% as we get closer to summer when the balance is starting to tighten up and the market is overly kind of worrying themselves on these downside risks on a day in and day out basis.""]"

The company's diverse portfolio, catering to first-time, move-up, and active adult buyers, allows it to tap into different consumer segments, reducing dependency on a single market. In 2023, PulteGroup Inc saw a slight shift towards first-time buyers, indicating adaptability to market demands.

This intense competition requires continuous innovation and marketing efforts to maintain and grow market share. PulteGroup Inc must navigate this competitive landscape to ensure long-term success, which can strain resources and limit pricing power."", ""Dependence on Economic Cycles: The homebuilding industry is cyclical, and PulteGroup Inc's financial performance is subject to fluctuations in the economy.

A recession can lead to reduced consumer spending, lower home sales, and downward pressure on home prices. The company's performance is closely tied to the health of the economy, and any prolonged economic challenges could have a material adverse effect on its financial results."", 'Regulatory Changes and Environmental Concerns: The homebuilding industry is subject to stringent regulations, which can impact the development and construction process. Changes in building codes, environmental laws, and labor regulations can increase costs and delay projects. Additionally, growing environmental concerns may lead to stricter regulations on construction practices, requiring PulteGroup Inc to adapt its operations accordingly.', ""In conclusion, PulteGroup Inc's SWOT analysis reveals a company with a strong market presence, innovative design capabilities, and a diversified product range. However, it also faces challenges from intense competition and economic cycles. Opportunities for technological advancements and market expansion are countered by threats from economic downturns and regulatory changes.

These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics.

Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just nine.Here are five of the nine stocks that fit the bill:Ohio-based Installed Building Products operates as a residential insulation installer in the United States.

But what actually drives impact?', 'When reviewing an organization\'s reporting on ID&E, here are a few ""green flags"" - or positive signs - to look out for:', ""Reporting on more than representation. While representation goals help measure progress in diversifying teams and advancing equity for underrepresented populations, the story begins long before that. It's important to look at whether an organization is approaching ID&E the right way - through efforts like leadership accountability, inclusive hiring practices, and equitable access to development and sponsorship opportunities. The report should focus on efforts to build and maintain an inclusive culture for all, not just select representation numbers."", 'Including the voices of real people - the employees. Cultivating a culture of belonging means sharing the stories and voices of employees. In order to build belonging, all employees need opportunities to connect, thrive and educate each other. How do we know if these programs are benefitting employees? We need to hear testimonials and success stories from the employees themselves. For example, we know that degree requirements can be a barrier to talented candidates, including ethnically diverse groups and veterans, when it comes to advancing their careers. And for us at Medtronic, hearing from employees like Candi Sneed, who leveraged our Medtronic Advancement Pathways and Skill-building (MAPS) program, brings our impact to life. We provide 100% upfront college tuition directly to an academic institution for eligible employees, without the need for reimbursement. And because we helped remove that barrier, Sneed completed her degree in Electrical Engineering, making her the first link in the chain of future engineers for her family.', 'Sharing actionable progress and impact. While sharing progress with data is critical to transparency, equally as important is sharing the actions taken to get there.

The data come from a trial of patients in Canada and Europe, but an interim look at a U.S. study shows the performance is currently consistent across geographies.', 'J&J subsidiary Biosense Webster is working to become the third company, after Medtronic and Boston Scientific, to bring a PFA device to the U.S. market. The investigational device, Varipulse, features a catheter, PFA generator and integration with J&J’s Carto 3D mapping system. The need for PFA mapping has been a subject of debate,\xa0but latecomers Abbott and J&J are pitching their integrations as positives.\xa0', 'J&J put its device to the test in the Inspire study, a clinical trial that enrolled 272 people with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AFib) at sites in Canada and Europe. After 12 months, just over 75% of subjects were free from atrial arrhythmia recurrence. The figure rose to 80% in patients who received a level of PFA application that J&J called “optimal.” BTIG noted the optimal level of PFA applications was at least 48.', 'The proportion of patients free from atrial arrhythmia recurrence after 12 months was higher than in the pivotal studies of rival devices. Around 73% of patients in Boston Scientific’s PFA trial met the 12-month efficacy endpoint. The figure in the paroxysmal AFib cohort of Medtronic’s trial was just over 66%.\xa0', 'However, cross-trial comparisons can be misleading because differences between the studies, as well as differences between the interventions, influence the results. BTIG analysts noted that participants in the J&J trial were younger and had a slightly lower risk of stroke. The average age in the J&J trial was around 59 years, compared with over 62 and 63 years, respectively, in the Boston Scientific and Medtronic studies.', 'J&J presented final data from Inspire alongside interim results from the pilot phase of the Admire study it is running in the U.S. Eighty percent of the 20 patients with 12 months of follow up were free from atrial arrhythmia. BTIG analysts told investors they “view these results as favorable, but with just a few patients evaluated, we await results from the pivotal phase, which enrolled up to 408 patients, in the near future.”', 'The U.S. data could position J&J to start competing for the PFA portion of an AFib market that RBC Capital Markets analysts predict will grow to $5.8 billion by 2026. The RBC analysts expect “a rapid shift to PFA,” although their counterparts at BTIG noted concerns including the price of pulsed field ablation that could slow the transition. Physicians said PFA costs twice as much as radiofrequency ablation in Europe.', '“With [electrophysiology] typically a profit center for hospitals and hospital margins under pressure, this is a concern,”\xa0the analysts wrote. “These doctors expect pricing to decrease as PFA volume increases. Combining ablation and mapping in one catheter may also be preferred, since that is one less catheter to pay for.” ', 'This story was originally published on MedTech Dive.

Against such a backdrop, investors are increasingly exploring strategies that will help them to protect their portfolios from downside risk. Nothing seems better than the strategy of dividend investing.Picking stocks with a history of dividend growth leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Installed Building Products Inc. IBP, PACCAR Inc. PCAR, McKesson Corporation MCK, Republic Services Inc. RSG and PulteGroup Inc. PHM — that could be solid choices amid market volatility.', 'Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just nine.Here are five of the nine stocks that fit the bill:Ohio-based Installed Building Products operates as a residential insulation installer in the United States.

While significant price swings have always characterized investments in oil and natural gas, the degree of uncertainty has markedly risen in recent years, especially following the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.In such a volatile energy market context, a dividend increase serves as a signal from management of confidence in the company's future prospects. By elevating the dividend, management is essentially expressing the belief that forthcoming cash flows will be sufficient to cover the increased dividend.Now, let's examine five energy companies — Chevron CVX, The\xa0 Williams Companies WMB, Magnolia Oil & Gas MGY, HighPeak Energy HPK and Shell SHEL — that recently raised their dividends.Chevron is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas companies in the world, with operations that span almost every corner of the globe. The only energy component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, San Ramon, CA-based Chevron is fully integrated, meaning it participates in every aspect related to energy – from oil production to refining and marketing.CVX said on Feb 2 it will pay out a cash dividend of $1.63 per share of record on Feb 16. The company’s dividend represents a 8% increase to its quarterly dividend rate, providing an annualized dividend of $6.52 per share. At yesterday’s closing price, investors get a dividend yield of 4.3%.Next up is The Williams Companies. Founded in 1908, the Tulsa, OK-based firm is a premier energy infrastructure provider in North America. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s core operations include finding, producing, gathering, processing, and transporting natural gas and natural gas liquids.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Late last month, WMB increased the quarterly dividend by 6.1%. The company will pay a dividend of 47.50 cents per share against 44.75 cents last quarter. Calculating a 5.5% annualized yield, this payout increase comes into effect with the one recorded on Mar 8.Magnolia Oil & Gas is another energy operator that deserves mention. It is an independent upstream operator engaged in the exploration, development and production of natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. Headquartered in Houston, TX, the firm is focused on the Eagle Ford Shale and Austin Chalk formations in South Texas.MGY yesterday increased the quarterly dividend by 13% from 11.5 cents to 13 cents. This payout increase comes into effect with the dividend recorded on Feb 16. At the current share price, Magnolia offers a dividend yield of 2.6%.Then there is HighPeak Energy. The Fort Worth, TX-based energy firm concentrates on extracting unconventional oil and natural gas deposits, primarily in Howard County of the Midland Basin. It was established in 2020 by merging HighPeak Energy and Pure Acquisition Corporation, a special-purpose acquisition company.HPK proposed a quarterly dividend of 4 cents, taking the full-year payout to 16 cents, up 60% compared with the previous dividend. The new dividend, which offers a yield of 1.2%, will be paid to stockholders of record on Mar 1.Finally, we have Shell — one of the primary oil supermajors, or a group of U.S. and Europe-based big energy multinationals with worldwide operations. The company’s long-term strategy revolves around LNG. This London-based firm bought BG Group for $50 billion in 2016 to become the world’s largest producer and shipper of LNG.SHEL said last week it paid out a fourth-quarter cash dividend of 34.40 cents per share. The company’s dividend represents a 4% increase to its quarterly dividend rate, providing an annualized dividend of $1.376 per share.

That could come in a final report that could be more than a year away.', 'In a statement, the Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday: “This incident should have never happened and it cannot happen again. The FAA is continuing to support the National Transportation Safety Board’s investigation into the Jan. 5 door plug incident.”', 'The NTSB is in charge of the investigation and will provide any updates.', 'The fact that no one was sitting in the seat next to the gaping hole that appeared in the side of the plane is a key reason there was not a fatality on the flight.', 'Six crew and 171 passengers were on board the flight, which returned safely to Portland International Airport. Nobody was seriously hurt in the incident.', 'The missing bolts are apparently not the only problem. Both Alaska Airlines and United Airlines said last month that inspections of their fleets that took place after the January 5 incident revealed loose bolts.', '“This is a somewhat complex issue with a lot of parts,” NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy told CNN in the week leading up to the release of the preliminary report. Even still, Homendy stressed that she “would have no problem getting on a Max 9 tomorrow and flying.”', 'The release of the report comes as Boeing’s quality control is under intense scrutiny. During a House subcommittee hearing Tuesday, FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said there are now two dozen FAA inspectors on location at Boeing’s Renton, Washington plant as part of an agency audit.', 'Late Sunday, Boeing disclosed that it would need to “rework” improperly drilled holes discovered on 50 incomplete 737 Max planes still on the production line, causing a slowdown in deliveries.', 'Later, Boeing fuselage contractor Spirit AeroSystems said it had caused that more recent problem.', 'A Spirit spokesman said the company is working on “continuous improvement.”', '“As we review the NTSB’s preliminary report, we remain focused on working closely with Boeing and our regulators on continuous improvement in our processes and meeting the highest standards of safety, quality and reliability,” spokesman Joe Buccino said in a statement.', 'The report also details the shock of the blowout, which caught passengers and crew by surprise.', '“The captain said that, while climbing through about 16,000 ft, there was a loud bang,” the report said.', '“The flight crew said their ears popped, and the captain said his head was pushed into the heads-up display (HUD) and his headset was pushed up, nearly falling off his head. The FO [first officer] said her headset was completely removed due to the rapid outflow of air from the flight deck.”', 'CNN has reported that NTSB investigators have been closely scrutinizing the door plug and whether crucial bolts that hold it in place were properly installed when the incident occurred.', 'Meanwhile, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration told House lawmakers Tuesday that his agency is “closely scrutinizing” Boeing after last month’s door plug blowout.', '“Going forward, we will have more boots on the ground closely scrutinizing and monitoring production and manufacturing activities,” FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said in prepared remarks.', 'The Federal Aviation Administration failed to properly scrutinize Boeing after two fatal crashes of 737 Max aircraft killed 346 people more than four years ago, the agency’s new chief said.', '“I wasn’t there at the time as you noted. I guess I would say in retrospect and given what happened with the plug door, it’s hard to call that oversight sufficient,” Whitaker told Congress on Tuesday.\xa0\xa0“So, we’re looking at that process and what additional steps need to be taken to make sure that oversight is sufficient.”', 'Whitaker was sworn in late last year and was not at the FAA at the time of those crashes in 2018 and 2019.\xa0\xa0He was previously the second-ranking FAA official from 2013 to 2016. Whitaker appeared before the House aviation subcommittee, his first congressional testimony since being confirmed to the post little more than three months ago.', 'His agency is currently overhauling how it scrutinizes plane manufacturers, including Boeing, after a hole blew open in the side of a 737 Max 9 last month.', '“I certainly agree that the current system is not working cause it is not delivering safe aircraft,” Whitaker said. “We have to make some changes to that. And I think we also have to look at the culture.”', 'This story has been updated to adjust the characterization of the report.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Rica, and I will be your coordinator today. (Operator Instructions) And I now would like to hand the presentation over to Ryan Avey, Senior Director, of Investor Relations and FP&A. Please go ahead.', 'Ryan Avey', ""Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'm Ryan Avey, and with me today are Spirit's President and Chief Executive Officer, Pat Shanahan and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Suchinski. Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections or goals we may include in our discussion today are likely to involve risks, including those detailed in our earnings release, in our SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement at the end of this web presentation.In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures we use when discussing our results. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Pat."", 'Patrick M. Shanahan', ""Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will update you on how we are running the business at Spirit. Most of my remarks will focus on the steps we took after the January 5th accident. Mark will address the financials in his comments. My mandate when I came here was to put our operations and financials back on solid footing. In my estimation, we achieved significant progress toward that goal in the fourth quarter. However, the accident on January 5th demanded a different focus by our team.Consistent with our protocols, our response team was activated within hours. Since that moment, Spirit's focus was on supporting Boeing, it's airline customers, the NTSB, the FAA and our people. The immediate response was taking a hard look at our processes and incorporating any findings into action. Within days, we enacted countermeasures to include adding in-line and ship in place inspections with Boeing that replicated those performed by the airlines to return to service, leveraging the FAA's safety management system to conduct a product safety risk assessment. Incorporation of detailed review and observation with Boeing of the mid-entry door plug assembly and installation process to include both Spirit and Boeing operations. Concurrent with those immediate actions, we have initiated a second wave of actions centered on addressing human factors, nonconformities, product safety, and expanded inspections across 737 manufacturing. People are at the heart of the company and our manufacturing processes. A significant portion of the 737 fuselage build is manually performed by our skilled teammates.Repeatability, reliability and capability in manufacturing is required to produce high-quality conforming products. The human condition and human factors must be accounted for in any improvement efforts. And through that lens, we are focusing additional actions. The four main levers to mitigate human factors that we are pulling include proficiency of our mechanics and inspectors, compliance to our quality management system, mistake proofing and observation.We will do more testing and training. We will drive greater discipline to the QMS. We will enable our teammates with better tools, techniques and technology that is available today. The goal of any world-class manufacturing company is perfection or 0 defects. We aspire to achieve perfection. Detecting, correcting and ultimately propending defects otherwise known as nonconformities is the basis for continuous improvement.We are expanding our efforts to integrate more with Boeing's QMS realigning organizationally to accelerate redesign and process reengineering and utilizing more advanced data analytics. We are also increasing the number of spirit performed inspections and Boeing performed inspections. And soon, we will integrate these efforts with those with the FAA and customers who have joined us here in Wichita.That is a brief summary of some of the systemic improvements in our second wave of collective actions. There are additional actions we are taking as well. The point is we are mobilized for implementation with detailed plans and fully aligned with Boeing. Our next wave of improvement will be the deployment of autonomation and automation for sections of the airplane that remain highly manual. That is the fundamental solution to zero defects and zero escapes. On the 737 fuselage, the front and back sections have the most complex physical geometries and are the most confined workspaces. The build is largely manual. Our eye is towards finding the right balance of using human-assisted technology and automated technology. There is a path to deployment. Broadly speaking, full-scale robotics is impractical. In our research labs, we have significant human-assisted technology that is manufacturing readiness level 6 that we look to accelerate. I have recently reviewed this technology with the team and will ensure it receives the appropriate resources and investments. I am very proud of how our team has responded to this accident. They have been calm, focused and moving with urgency. I have a lot of confidence in this team.At this point, the art form is to integrate broad actions with our ongoing operations and not as a one-off project. Our teams across manufacturing and engineering are fully aligned and will implement changes seamlessly. I believe we will move quickly because of our shift in governance away from being top down. The mindset shift is to understand that the airplane is the boss. The airplane tells us what to do. Our mechanics, sealers, engineers and inspectors are like surgeons. They tell us in management what they need to perform their operations.Our goal is to give them what they need, when they need it and resolve issues or make improvements. Receptivity from our teammates across our facilities, shop floors and offices have been positive. I also appreciate their candor and telling me what's on their minds. I've heard from every corner of the factory in Wichita and from every shift, lots of energy, lots of ideas. This does not surprise me. Our workforce at Spirit has a clear understanding of the importance of their work.That commitment is rooted in a long legacy we have in this industry. In the coming weeks, we will learn more from the regulators from their formal reporting and will respond with urgency and transparency. Now I'll shift to a couple of other topics I think you have on your mind as well. First, we made significant progress in the fourth quarter in stabilizing the 737 production line. We briefly paused the line to stabilize, which ultimately allowed us to deliver 104 fuselages, the highest quarterly total in 4 years.We made investments during the quarter to recover schedule and buffer the production system which enabled us to start the year with a balanced factory. Second, we recognized additional forward losses on the A350 and A220 programs this quarter, which Mark will address in a moment. That said, we are working to not only improve these programs in our day-to-day operations, but also are engaged in discussions with Airbus to address the long-term financials.The negotiations with Airbus continue and have been productive. We hope to conclude by February, but we need to ensure all items are addressed. We are converging on operational and financial solutions. I appreciate the partnership and engagement by their leadership. This remains an important near-term priority for me. I'll now turn the call over to Mark to review with you our financial results."", 'Mark J. Suchinski', ""Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. We experienced significant pressures in 2023 due to production schedule volatility, supply chain constraints and ongoing inflation. Quality challenges and increased labor costs. This resulted in higher-than-anticipated costs throughout the year. However, we also accomplished some major milestones during the year including reaching a contractual resolution with our largest union, bringing, Pat on board to lead spirits recovery and executing a favorable agreement with our largest customer.We also due to debt refinance and a capital raise, which strengthened our capital structure and increased production rates across many of our major programs. While we expect some of these pressures from 2023 to continue into 2024, we entered the year strongly focused on execution to stabilize and strengthen Spirit both operationally and financially. Given the latest news around the 737 MAX production rates in relation to the FAA approval as well as our ongoing negotiations with Airbus, we are not in a position to provide guidance at this time.Now let me take you through the details of our fourth quarter financial results. Let's start on Slide 2. Revenues for the quarter were $1.8 billion, up 37% from the fourth quarter of 2022. This substantial increase year-over-year was primarily due to higher production on our commercial programs, increased defense and space and aftermarket segment revenues as well as the impacts from the previously disclosed Boeing MOA executed in October of 2023, which included favorable pricing adjustments on the 787 program. Overall, deliveries in the quarter increased 16% year-over-year. Now turning our attention to EPS. We reported earnings per share of positive $0.52 compared to negative $2.32 in the fourth quarter of 2022. Excluding certain items, adjusted EPS was $0.48 compared to negative $1.46 in the prior year. Operating margin was positive 11% compared to negative 11% in the same period of 2022, largely driven by the favorable impacts from our Boeing MOA.As a result of the favorable pricing adjustments to the 787, we reversed $361 million of total liabilities during the fourth quarter, which included 787 forward loss reversals of $206 million, which favorably reduced cost of sales and reversal of 787 material right obligation of $155 million, which flowed through the income statement as an increase to revenue.Fourth quarter net forward loss reversals totaled $34 million and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments was $55 million. This compared to $114 million of forward losses and $59 million of unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2022. The current quarter forward losses relate primarily to A350 and A220 programs and were driven by higher estimates of supply chain, labor and other costs. We also recorded net incremental forward losses for anticipated performance obligations beyond 2025 in the amount of approximately $30 million.The unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments relate primarily to 737 program, reflecting higher costs required to recover and stabilize the production system, which we have done in the fourth quarter. Now turning to free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was positive $42 million compared to free cash flow usage of $66 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Fourth quarter free cash flow includes the previously disclosed funding of approximately $100 million received from Boeing per the terms of the MOA and tooling and capital through 2025 on both the 737 and 787 programs. In our effort to stabilize operations, we also made certain working capital investments and accelerated certain capital investments in the fourth quarter of 2023.Now let's discuss our quarterly segment performance, starting with our commercial segment on Slide 3. In the fourth quarter of 2023 commercial revenues increased 43% over the same period 2022 due to higher production across all of our programs as well as favorable pricing from the 787 Boeing MOA. Quarterly operating margin increased to positive 17% compared to negative 8% in the prior year, primarily driven by a favorable change in estimates recorded in the current period.These changes in estimates, which I previously disclosed, included net forward loss reversals of $48 million and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $51 million. In comparison to the fourth quarter of 2022, the segment recorded charges of $111 million of forward losses and $58 million of unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments. Now let's turn to Defense & Space segment on Slide 4. Defense & Space grew to $205 million, up 12% higher than the fourth quarter of last year, due to higher development program activity and increased KC-46 Tanker production. Operating margin for the quarter decreased to 2% compared to 11% in 2022, primarily due to higher unfavorable changes in estimates recorded in the period. The segment recorded forward losses of $13 million and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $4 million compared to forward losses of $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The forward losses were primarily driven by higher production cost estimates on the CH-53K program and unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, which were primarily driven by the Boeing PA program.For our aftermarket results, let's turn to Slide 5. Aftermarket had a strong quarter with revenue of $91 million, up 24% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher spare parts sales. Aftermarket has continued to grow with global aircraft recovery and is on track to meet our plan for $500 million by 2025. Operating margin was strong for the quarter at 23% compared to 13% during the same period of 2022, primarily due to the absence of a onetime inventory adjustment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2022.With that, let's now briefly touch on our full year results on Slide 6. 2023 revenue came in at $6 billion. That's up 20% year-over-year, driven by higher commercial production volumes as well as higher defense and space and aftermarket segment revenues. 2023 adjusted EPS decreased year-over-year primarily due to higher interest and other expenses, partially offset by improved operating income during the current year. Other expense for 2023 was $140 million compared to other expenses of $14 million in 2022, primarily due to higher noncash losses related to settlement accounting for our primary U.S. pension plan, foreign currency and sales of receivables recognized in 2023.Full year cash flow was a usage of $374 million compared to a use of 516 in 2022. Free cash flow usage was higher than we previously expected, primarily due to factory costs incurred in the quarter to recover schedule and stabilize operations, higher levels of inventory to support rate increases as well as increased CapEx spend related to the customer-funded capital and tooling received as part of the Boeing MOA.With that, let's now turn to cash and debt balances on Slide 7. We ended the year with $824 million of cash, which reflects the proceeds from the issuance of common stock and exchangeable senior notes during the fourth quarter of '23. We will use the if converted method regarding exchangeable notes, implications to EPS, which results in the shares being dilutive if there is positive net income. If net loss position, they would be anti-dilutive. We ended the year with $4.1 billion of debt. There are now no significant debt maturities until 2026. So with that, we will be happy to take your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) We have the first question on the phone line from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan.', 'Seth Michael Seifman', ""Pat, thanks very much for the comments at the beginning of the call. I guess maybe to level set a bit where 737 is right now, you talked about kind of stabilizing the factory in the fourth quarter. Does that mean stabilizing at a production of 38 a month? And if we took it as a given that it's up to the FAA now when that rate will move higher. But if we took it as a given that that's the rate for 2024 that Spirit is now in a place to produce at that rate through the year and that what we saw -- what we've read about over the past few weeks since the Alaska accident and specifically yesterday with the latest mis-drilling issues and Boeing's effort to cut down on traveled work. Do you still kind of consider the factory to be stabilized at 38 a month?"", 'Patrick M. Shanahan', ""Seth, I would tell you that we are cycling at 42 a month but building at 38 a month. And by that, I mean we have a production schedule that allows us to have buffer days, and it's our means of testing our ability to go up in rate. And that buffer -- those buffer days allow the factory to when we talk about stability, minimized traveled work, have everybody stay in position. So from that standpoint, we're in a good position, and we'll take our guidance from Boeing as to how to adjust our schedules if necessary.Maybe I'll just address those 2 nonconforming holes, those are not a safety of flight issue, and just kind of characterize the normal process. Anytime there's a nonconformity, we basically scope and bound it. Engineering does a preliminary look to see if there's a safety of flight issue, then essentially, we communicate to the customers if there's any potential exposure, but we say, here's a heads up and then we do a detailed engineering analysis and work to get a final disposition and when we have a final disposition that we can determine and repair and from that a response.And relative to these 2 holes, there is not a final engineering disposition. We expect that in the next 72 hours. Based on that, we'll determine what the repair might be and any impact associated with that. And then the follow-on is a root-cause corrective action."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. We now have David Strauss of Barclays. You may proceed with your question.', 'David Egon Strauss', 'Quick follow-up there. What is the status of the MAX buffer stock as it relates to you matching up with Boeing in terms of your production rate? And then on the Airbus side of things, the $5 million (inaudible) on the balance sheet. At this point, is that really all A220, A350 (inaudible) negotiations conclude with Airbus, should we expect to see a significant reversal there?', 'Mark J. Suchinski', ""Sure. David, let me address your second comment in regards to the balance sheet and the forward loss reserves that we have, both short term and long term. I think we met -- we mentioned this on the last call as it relates to Boeing and the 787 program. We stated that we would be in a forward loss through '24, maybe slightly into the first quarter of 2025. So really the short-term forward loss is -- has some 787 in there as we come down our unit cost curves and drive that to cash flow positive in 2025 and then it would include the A350 as you indicated an A220 and a little bit on 67 and CH-53K, but I think you got it right."", 'Patrick M. Shanahan', ""Maybe just to answer the question about the buffer or what we refer to as the ship in place, there are 42 available units today to ship in place. We're taking a few extra days. So think of that as a delay on some of the deliveries to rented just to make sure we can complete all the inspections related to the mid-entry door plug as well as any known rework and doing -- conducting some additional inspections."", 'Operator', 'We now have Jason Gursky of Citigroup.', 'Jason Michael Gursky', ""Maybe a 2-part question. I apologize for that. Patrick, wonder if you can just -- to fix the problem, you have to understand exactly how you got here. So I was wondering if you could just from your perspective, describe a little bit about the conditions that led us to where we are today. It sounds like you've got a plan to fix something. I'm just kind of curious to get your input on how we got here. And then the second part of the question is, once we figure this all out, has anything kind of fundamentally changed on the types of rate breaks that you can do in the future? I know Boeing's got a master schedule out there. And historically, you guys have gone up 10%, 15% on different rate breaks and then hold for a bit before going back up again. So I'm just wondering, in the context of all of this, whether things have fundamentally changed in the industry or the industry's view on its ability to go up in rate and whether we go up slower than we have in the past?"", 'Patrick M. Shanahan', ""Yes, Jason, I think it's hard to go back and look at how we got here. I wish I had that history. But what I would tell you is the basic fundamentals around rate breaks haven't changed. Some of the dynamics around the supply chain have changed. I would offer that some of the work that Spirit has done in the fourth quarter to align the 2024 plan with Boeing's rate schedule has afforded us some more stability. We have used that time to improve the dynamics of the supply chain. We've seen a lot of improvement in the near term to support rate 42. As it relates to rate 47, we have line of sight on virtually all the issues.Five suppliers that we have to give special attention to. But at this point, the majority of the issues are related to raw material and labor availability. I think the hardest part of this industry is given its complexity and breadth, how do you judge? How quickly to go up in rate? In the case of the 737, it's been done before. So there's a playbook that parametrically says -- this is what you can do, but we have to adjust that for current events in the environment.But I would say that the 2024 plan we laid out is -- incorporates the existing environment. And if there are any changes, we'll accommodate Boeing's direction."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. We now have Myles Walton of Wolf Research.', 'Myles Alexander Walton', ""Pat, you're in a pretty unique position having been inside of Boeing with Vice President of Commercial Airplanes for time and now inside of Spirit. And I can sort of give the perspective, I think, of what if and the what-if is -- if Wichita, we're still part of Boeing with the -- signals with the Boeing quality, the QMS system have captured these quality escapes sooner? And if so, does that create industrial logic for some element of reabsorption? Or is the solution just a greater integration into Boeing's existing QMS?"", 'Patrick M. Shanahan', ""I guess I would respond not so much to the hypothetical, but the fact that we're behaving as if we were part of Boeing and that the coordination and the integration you refer to is really taking place now. So if you sat in one of our meetings, you people took off their badges, you would not be able to tell which company they worked for. I think because of the trust that's been built recently, some of the feedback loops that existed in the past are being restored and that should allow us to even work better together."", 'Myles Alexander Walton', ""So just to clarify that, Pat, is that a change of behavior, the tightness of the feedback loop? Or is that a reflection of what's always been the case?"", 'Patrick M. Shanahan', ""I would -- I think as a result of the MOA and the shedding of the financial constraints, it opened up the aperture to really work more seamlessly together, and we're seeing that. And I think we're surprised every single day how much more quickly people are working shoulder to shoulder. So I think the MOA was a big change that allowed us to increase the integration between the 2 companies."", 'Operator', 'We now have Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jeffries.', 'Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu', ""Pat, if I could ask you in just its current state, how do we think about the 737 cash profile per ship set, just given potentially additional costs this year, how does that change with the rate break in '25 if the FAA does also limit you guys at 38% a cap? I'm not sure. And then into '26, the free cash flow per ship set, just given the step down?"", 'Patrick M. Shanahan', ""Sheila, I'm just trying to think. Yes. No, no, no. I mean we obviously go up in rates, you can distribute the overhead more broadly. The fundamentals of the things that we're doing in terms of improving cash flow or cost reduction and a lot of that's through productivity or improvement in quality. So those things aren't going to change. We've built a plan around achieving support -- labor support, I'll say, cost that mirrors our performance in 2018. We're working to that regardless of a change in direction from Boeing. So that might dampen a bit. Indirect costs, we're going after the same way, probably the one that wouldn't be affected by rate as working capital because we just need to optimize that to a much larger degree last year, we were anticipating being at a much higher rate. So there's a real opportunity there regardless of where the rates stabilize that. Mark, do you have any other comments?"", 'Mark J. Suchinski', ""No, I think you hit it, Pat. Obviously, Sheila, as you go up in rate, you get the leverage from the higher production rates from an absorption standpoint. But at the end of the day, I think the key here is as we look over the next couple of years, it's about operating the factories efficiently, leaning it out, working on flow, working on the items that Pat talked about and he's got the teams really rallied around that.And so we're really excited over the next couple of years as we go up in rate to see that financial benefits of those production rates through the variety of actions that we're working on, including focusing on improving overall quality. So we do think over the next couple of years, we'll continue to drive our unit cost down and take advantage of the higher production rates."", 'Aaron Hunt', ""Sheila, maybe just one add-on here. I think we have to think about the supply chain. I mean, I think that's the one that if we do change production rates, we have to figure out what do we do with the things that we've already ordered. How do we keep them healthy, so that as things get corrected, we can go back to building fuselages. So I think that would be the one we still need to sort through."", 'Sheila Karin Kahyaoglu', ""And just to follow up, given the MAX is the biggest driver of your free cash flow, do you still expect -- do you expect free cash flow to be positive in '24 without giving any guidance."", 'Mark J. Suchinski', ""Sheila, let me just address that. I think what I would tell you is with the question marks around the production rate increases in front of us that we had previously planned in '24, the Airbus negotiations, and then just trying to assess what additional cost may come as it relates to quality and the regulatory oversight.As we said in our press release, we're just -- we're not in a position to talk about cash flow. We know that it's an important aspect of our business here, and I'm not trying to avoid the topic. We're working really hard to improve the overall business financially. But give us a little time to digest the current situation here. And in the coming months, we'll be able to give you the answers that you guys are looking for. But I think we need a little bit more certainty. There's -- there's still too much uncertainty here for us to really dial this in and give you a more direct and concrete answer.So more to come. It's not now, but give us a little while, and we'll be able to address those questions."", 'Operator', 'We now have Scott Deuschle from Deutsche Bank.', 'Scott Deuschle', 'Pat, have you priced your content on B21 yet?', 'Patrick M. Shanahan', 'You say that one more time. This is on the LRIP.', 'Mark J. Suchinski', 'The B21 kind of.', 'Scott Deuschle', 'Yes, have you priced your LRIP content on B21 yet?', 'Mark J. Suchinski', 'We have not.', 'Scott Deuschle', 'Okay. And then, Pat, can you clarify what the operating elements might be with respect to the Airbus negotiations? Are you referencing moving some work over to them? Or is this something else?', 'Patrick M. Shanahan', ""Well, our focus has really been on price and the focus has really been on understanding between the 2 companies what is the right level of productivity that should be achieved that they're willing to pay for and what is costs were all aligned on that is real and needs to be reflected in the price. And our discussions to date have been in substantiating both of those. And along with that, aligning expectations around our performance on the 220 and the 350 in '24."", 'Operator', 'We now have Ken Herbert of RBC Capital Market.', 'Kenneth George Herbert', ""Pat and Mark.

Can you comment on at which rate you're pulling say, MAX shipments from suppliers at and depending upon your schedules with Boeing on the MAX, how much inventory are you prepared to build? And maybe how much of a use of cash as working capital this year versus maybe visibility on how much of a savings it can be in the back half of the year?"", 'Mark J. Suchinski', ""Thanks, Ken. Let me take that one. I think Pat briefly mentioned it, as we move through 2023, we had expected to be at a higher rate at this point in time. We'd expect it to deliver more than we finished the year out at. And so we built inventory throughout the year and ordered inventory from our suppliers in anticipation of that. And that caused us to build inventory to help to support 42 a month. We've also tactically here in the fourth quarter, built strategic buffers with critical components for our production system. So really, you saw throughout the year, almost a $300 million increase in inventory through 2023, and that was in anticipation of higher rates. As we move into 2024, and where our plans are at here. We're not going to have to make that sizable increase because we've got the suppliers tuned up to help support and produce and deliver at 42 aircrafts per month. So I would say that as we move into 2024, I would anticipate working capital the drag that we saw in 2023 to be released to a big degree.And so I think in summary, suppliers are delivering to us at 42. Pat talked about what our factory cycling to. And so our goal here is to really optimize the working capital as we stabilize the factory, and we think that there's some work for us to go do there. And we think that as we move forward here, that will create a bit of a tailwind to our free cash flow."", 'Patrick M. Shanahan', ""And maybe just to add on to what Mark is saying, there are discrete plans around how we're managing the suppliers and the buffer. So again, one of the things we ask them to do is protect the factory in terms of the critical jobs that need parts to maintain the build of the aircraft. And so in those critical areas, we've built buffer stock. There are also suppliers when we look at their history that are unpredictable. So those we will continue to work with, but we'll probably build some buffer stock.Then there are the highly reliable consistent suppliers where we need to maximize inventory turns and the teams are taking those bleeding down the inventory and trying to balance there, the suppliers build -- we don't want to turn them off and start them at the same time, we've got a kind of optimized way to get our inventory turns up. So it's a dance and the teams are able to do pulled 10 levers, whereas in the past, I think it was just one order all the parts. So I expect to see a real improvement in 2024."", 'Operator', 'We now have Doug Harned of Bernstein.', 'Douglas Stuart Harned', ""When you talked about the process redesign, introducing automation as some of the things you're doing to deal with the quality escapes across the company. But I think of this on really 2 time scales, and that can be and some of those things can be longer term. But at the same time, you have issues that may already be in things that have been done, like the mis-drilled holes that came up over the weekend. There's a lot of concern that there could be another incident like the Alaska MAX 9 incident. How do you make sure that as you do the broader redesign, you can also identify any situations that might be an issue in things that have already been essentially produced?"", 'Patrick M. Shanahan', ""Yes. No, good. Thank you for that question. And I remember in the last call, you asked me about just the overall quality and maybe we can expand into that. I think the short answer to that question is our quality management system really looks at product quality, the FA's safety management system looks at product safety.So our first look at the 37 has been through the product safety lens. And maybe just in parallel, I think what you'll find is that there -- if we drew a Venn diagram, there would be a lot of overlap between the safety management, system risk assessment and feedback nonconformities for our QMS. But our first priority has been to look through the product safety lens. We have 4 discrete categories that we're evaluating. If you look at the installation plans that we have that direct how a 737 fuselage is built, there are 2,300. Through this lens of product safety, we've distilled it down to 200 that we're going through and doing a detailed examination to include observations of the mechanics and a review by our master mechanic of the build process.That's in parallel, I think, Doug, maybe to this broader question of what are you doing now about quality? And what are you doing long term? And the short answer for us at Spirit on quality is less manual, less interpretation and more inspections. Medium term and long term is more human-assisted equipment and technology, more automation. And when we think about, well, where is the focus, it's where most of the manual work is, it's in the forward and rear sections of the airplane.If you are a mechanic working in there, you'd almost have to be a gymnast. So we're really looking at, well, how do we address the human factors as some of this other technology is bridging to be implemented. We're very focused in four areas. The first is proficiency. We got to test more, we got to train more. The second is compliance. And I always think of Bill Belicheck here is, do your job. So part of the compliance piece is people have to show up and do their job. I mean, we will help them do their job, but there's an element of they need to be committed to personal warranty.The third is, there's a lot of things we can do to mistake-proof. The build of the aircraft. And probably the last one is observation. It's not just more inspections, but it's our team spending more time on the factory floor. So that's -- if you were to come here to our war room and look at our plans, you see that we're really trying to address human factors in the near term, prioritized by product safety."", 'Douglas Stuart Harned', ""And if I can just quickly follow up. Is there a way to characterize where you are on this path? I mean, you've now had a chance to be much closer to this over the last few months. Is there a way to characterize when you feel like at least in the near term here, the issues, the escapes that we have seen that you've got a really solid handle on it and feel confident in what's being delivered, I guess."", 'Patrick M. Shanahan', ""Yes. I mean that's the question that I think we all wrestle with how can we predict the future? It's hard. I don't know how to predict it, but I -- some of the things that we just talked about it or the best way to do that. So it's here in short order, making real progress in making these things stick, I think, will give us the belt and suspenders confidence that we can mitigate this.I'd say the other one is we've been working with Boeing to do more inspections and more inspections as though we weren't doing a lot of inspections. I think what we're doing a better job of is harmonizing our work together. So we're looking at it the same way, at the same time, all the time and trying to keep it here in Wichita. And these are -- some of them are our interpretation of fastener rider skin quality. But those -- when we're working together mitigate what ends up being found in rent in where it's much more disruptive to fix."", 'Operator', 'We now have George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.', 'George D. Shapiro', ""Mark, if I look at the underlying margins that you've had in commercial, I mean you had 10.6% as the high in the first quarter, and you had relatively high 737 deliveries. But this quarter, you had the highest 737 deliveries and the margin was like 8.5%. Now is that just reflective of the extra work that you mentioned that you put into try and improve the production process in the quarter? And what would be kind of a normal look as we went forward on this?"", 'Mark J. Suchinski', ""George, I would say just that, I mean, it's hard to assess and state that the fourth quarter is kind of a normalized commercial margin. We entered the quarter in a very disruptive state behind schedule. Pat talked about, we did a pause in the fourth quarter. And so there was a lot of investment to stabilize the factory in the fourth quarter. And you saw that come through in the unfavorable cumulative catch-up.We delivered the most deliveries that fuselages in the fourth quarter than we did in 4 years. So there was definitely a big cost investment to stabilize the 737 production system. And when we think about jobs behind schedule all of the operational metrics that we had as we exited the year we were in the best shape than we've been in a long, long time here. So I don't want to lean forward here and start talking about what the normal margins are, but they were definitely depressed as it relates to the investment we made to stabilize the operations.And we did a lot of good work in the fourth quarter. Anything you want to cover, Pat, on top of that?"", 'Patrick M. Shanahan', ""And in addition, it's not margins, but we also made working capital investments to also stabilize that factory and that put a little bit of pressure on cash, although your question wasn't about cash. It was more about the margins. But the goal here is once you have a stable factory, the financials will come with it, and that's what we're focused on."", 'George D. Shapiro', ""And one quick follow-up, Mark. The free cash flow that you missed in the quarter, I mean, certainly, it looks like $30 million or so was CapEx, and you enumerated a couple of other things. I would think that some of that is actually a benefit to 2024 because you won't be spending that much more on CapEx than what you spent this quarter. Is that a fair statement?"", 'Mark J. Suchinski', ""That's right, George. We'll buy some of that back as we move into 2024, for sure, right? We as we think about stabilizing the operations and co-investing with Boeing, we did accelerate some of that CapEx to stabilize the system. And so as you said, some of that will come back as a benefit in 2024."", 'Operator', 'We now have Gavin Parsons of UBS.', 'Gavin Eric Parsons', ""Maybe just following up on George's question there or on the end on cash flow. A lot of moving pieces in '23. I think besides the working capital, the pension closeout the MOA, the advances labor contract ratification. What are some of the other moving pieces? Or are there other onetime items we should keep an eye out for in '24 or is '24 a relatively clean year best we can tell?"", 'Mark J. Suchinski', ""As you said, there was several onetime items, both good and bad in 2023. As we think about 2024, we are not anticipating significant one-offs as we stand here today. I think it's about just running the business. We talked about some of the opportunities to improve free cash flow and what are some of the tailwinds we're working hard. We talked about the operations, but we're also focused on indirect and overhead costs and the working capital side of things. But Gavin, I'm not aware of any of the sizable type items that we saw in 2023 coming back in 2024."", 'Operator', 'We now have Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.', 'Noah Poponak', ""Pat and Mark, what's your latest thinking on your framework of where your free cash flow margin can go in the future, putting any specific (inaudible) just longer term at -- compared to history at equivalent volumes, right? You used to have a targeted range and then you've had a targeted range for when volumes are back at certain levels. Is there any kind of new way you're thinking about that as you evaluate where pricing costs are shaking out -- and then I'm curious also to hear you talk about how you are going through the process of renegotiating pricing while your costs are such a moving target? Right? You're at low volumes where you sort of don't even know what the cost per unit is at higher volumes or double the volumes, right? So how are you factoring that in as you go through these customer pricing renegotiations?"", 'Mark J. Suchinski', ""Okay. Noah, let me address the second one first and I understand your point with fourth quarter here, we just took some additional forward losses, which will put pressure on unit costs as we move forward here. But we've been doing a lot of work as we think about the A220, A350 on our long-term unit costs. We've worked shoulder to shoulder with our customer as it relates to where we are now, what the learning curves look like, what benefits we'll get from optimizing the supply chain over the next 3 or 4 years.We've done a deep dive internally to assess that as best we can based on what we know now. And that is really the information that we're using as we enter the conversations with our customers and that's the best way that I would describe that on the Airbus side. As it relates to longer term..."", 'Patrick M. Shanahan', ""Maybe I'll just add on to that, Noah. When we think about like the 220, for example, a good portion of the cost reduction, which allows us to get to the right pricing level comes from a transfer of work. Many of the suppliers that we would transfer the work to, this is coming out the old Bombardier supply chain are going to Airbus suppliers. And we've jointly evaluated those costs, and Airbus has a significant history with those suppliers. So I feel confident in that cost basis. We also have a fairly good understanding of the cost and productivity curves for assembly, particularly in Belfast. And that's really 9% or 10% of the cost. But those learning curves hold true.And I would just say on the 350, there's a history of a higher production. So that kind of holds as a baseline that we need to get back to, and then there's a normal adjustment for labor and raw material price increases. So I don't think there's -- with these increased rates that it really creates a different cost estimating basis that we're not familiar with."", 'Noah Poponak', 'Okay. That makes sense.', 'Mark J. Suchinski', ""And then to address your first question around long term. I don't want to get into the prediction business. But when you think about what this business generated in the past, I think you're referencing the 7% to 9% margins and $500 million to $600 million worth of free cash flow in the future. As we go up to the higher rates that will obviously help from a revenue and a profitability and a cash flow standpoint, I think we can get back to those levels.There are some headwinds as it relates to some of the inflationary pressures that we talked about before like the IM contract. But I think the single biggest item that we need to work on to help us drive back up to those cash flows because I think the business is going to drive it is we're carrying $4 billion of debt and $350 million, $325 million of cash interest.So over the next couple of years, we need to take that positive cash flow, pay down debt. Not only will that help our leverage from a balance sheet standpoint, but it will get the cash interest drag off the books. And if we can drive that interest back down to our historical measures, we can get back to similar to levels that we've had in the past."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research.', 'Robert Alan Stallard', ""Pat, I just wanted to follow up on a comment you made earlier that you said that Spirit personnel are acting as if they're now part of Boeing. I was wondering if this has any sort of impact on your relationship with Airbus in particular and perhaps to other customers?"", 'Patrick M. Shanahan', ""I don't think so. I guess the real difference is I know more people at Boeing than I do at Airbus, but I've quickly come to meet quite a few of the executive leadership through program reviews we've been doing on the $220 million and the $350 million. But my Rolodex isn't as great. But I'd say the interaction is just as positive and the transparency and the focus on driving improvement. I'll do a number of -- they use Google Meet, we Google meet. And the feedback I get is just as direct as the feedback I get from Boeing and working together effort is almost identical.I mean, everybody tries to get the job done the right way. I think with Boeing, I just had a few more tricks in my bag just because of my familiarity with how to navigate their system. But the treatment and the behavior and working together Spirit out of (inaudible) is strong. And we just were able to get things done pretty well."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli of Truist Securities.', 'Michael Frank Ciarmoli', ""Pat, lots of talk about quality. If the airplane is the boss, we got safety and quality are paramount. If I just -- maybe not to put you on the spot, but if I look at your proxy, and I guess you're going to file it next month, compensation incentives, looks like only 20% is tied to quality on annual cash comp, nothing tied to quality in the longer term. It seems like everything we're talking about here, cash generation revenue, EBIT margin, all tied to quality.I mean, are you guys planning on changing compensation to drive some of this behavior towards more of a focus on quality."", 'Patrick M. Shanahan', ""It will be significantly different. And the heaviest weighting will be on quality. And right now, I'm really working to design it. So the system can't -- manipulation is probably too strong, but I want to make sure that it drives the right behaviors and we can measure true performance. I'll just do a shout out to Donna Anderson at T. Rowe Price, and she threw out the idea. You got to really look at the utility industry. We're in their quality metric, there's a significant penalty for an escape.So we're really trying to look at how do we measure defect reduction, but also what if there's any type of escape. Only one wouldn't drive much in the metric, but it really should. So the answer to your question is we're changing it fundamentally, and we're now making sure that what we put in place works well and drives the right kind of behavior."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. Due to time, our final caller comes from Peter Arment of Robert W. Baird.', 'Peter J. Arment', 'Yes, Mark, Pat. Maybe just a quick one. I mean is there a timing when you expect to price the B-21 LRIP? And then just, Mark, if you could just give a little more color on the CH-53K program. I know you mentioned some of the forward losses there. Just what -- any color in terms of the health of the program right now?', 'Patrick M. Shanahan', ""Why don't we switch? Why don't you answer the LRIP, I'll answer the 53."", 'Mark J. Suchinski', ""Absolutely. Yes. Thanks, Peter. On the B21, we expect in the back half of this year to complete the negotiations in regards to the initial LRIP on that program. We're on the tail end of the development side of the program, which is a cost-plus type arrangement and so we'll be able to report back more on that later in the year. And obviously, when we think about our customers, our goal here is to sign up for contracts that add value to our company. And so that's what our focus is going to be as we negotiate that contract later in the year."", 'Patrick M. Shanahan', ""Yes, just maybe comment on the CH-53 program. We disappointed Stephanie Hill and our teammates at Lockheed Martin in '23.

MAA is slated to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 results on Feb 7 after market close.The Germantown, TN-based residential REIT delivered a surprise of 0.44% in terms of core FFO per share in the last reported quarter. Its quarterly results were driven by an increase in the average effective rent per unit for the same-store portfolio.MAA has a decent surprise history. Over the trailing four quarters, MAA surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all occasions, the average beat being 0.99%. This is depicted in the chart below:', 'Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. Quote', 'Let’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.', 'Per RealPage data, although there was a significant recovery in apartment demand in the fourth quarter, it was not enough to keep up with the huge amounts of new supply, with the onslaught affecting occupancy and rent growth.There was demand for 58,200 units in the fourth quarter, pushing the total demand figure to 233,741 units in the 12-month period, which marked a considerable change from net move-outs from 123,290 units recorded in 2022. However, there were massive amounts of new supply, with 129,015 units being delivered in the fourth quarter across the top 150 markets tracked by RealPage, bringing the total number of units delivered to 439,394 in 2023.With supply outpacing demand, the occupancy level was 94.2%, contracting 30 basis points (bps) in the quarter and 90 points year over year. Apart from the occupancy rate, operators’ pricing power was also affected, with fourth-quarter rents contracting 1.3% but increasing 0.2% in the year. The monthly rent was $1,805, while the rent per square foot was $1.986.', 'MAA’s diversified Sunbelt portfolio is well-poised to benefit from the favorable fundamentals of this market. The pandemic accelerated employment shifts and a population inflow into the company’s markets as renters seek more business-friendly, lower-taxed and low-density cities. These favorable, longer-term secular dynamic trends are increasing the desirability of its markets.MAA has also been investing in its existing properties to attract new tenants and retain current ones. The company has been upgrading its amenities and technology to meet the evolving needs of renters. These improvements are likely to result in high occupancy rates and rental income for MAA.MAA continues to implement its three internal investment programs — interior redevelopment, property repositioning projects and Smart Home installations. The programs are expected to have helped the company capture the upside potential in rent growth, generate accretive returns and boost earnings from its existing asset base.However, the struggle to lure renters will persist as supply volumes are expected to remain elevated in some markets. This is likely to affect the company’s power to raise the rent or increase occupancy.We expect same-store net operating income to increase 2.5% year over year in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, we project average physical occupancy of 95.6%, slightly lower than the prior quarter’s 95.7%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $543.37 million. This suggests a 2.92% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.MAA projected fourth-quarter 2023 core FFO per share in the band of $2.21-$2.37, with the midpoint being $2.29.Before the fourth-quarter earnings release, the company’s activities were not adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share has remained unchanged at $2.30 in the past month. This suggests a slight year-over-year decline of 0.86%.For the full year 2023, MAA expects its core FFO per share in the range of $9.06-$9.22, with the midpoint being $9.14. This is based on the company’s outlook for same-store property revenue growth in the range of 5.75-6.75%, operating expense increase of 6-7% and same-store NOI expansion in the band of 5.5-6.5%. The company expects average physical occupancy for the same-store portfolio in the range of 95.50-95.70%, with the midpoint being 95.60%.For the year, we expect same-store property net operating income growth of 6% year over year. For the fourth quarter, we project an occupancy of 95.6%.For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for core FFO per share is pegged at $9.16.

Most real estate stocks will be real estate investment trusts (REITs), structured to pay at least 90% of their taxable profits as dividends. Realty Income (NYSE: O) is one of the best REITs money can buy."", ""Realty Income focuses on leasing retail properties. Consumers routinely spend money in these places, like grocery and convenience stores, pharmacies, dollar stores, and fast-food restaurants. The idea is that these businesses are recession-proof, so they shouldn't struggle to pay rent. Additionally, Realty Income uses net leases, which put expenses like taxes, insurance, and maintenance on the tenant.

Nike's brand stands on its own, and even playing hypotheticals, Nike is too big at this point for most companies to afford.

Three stocks that pay more than double the S&P 500 average yield of 1.5% and that could be great places to invest in right now include Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ), Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), and Realty Income (NYSE: O). If you can afford to invest $33,000, here's how you can spread that out over these three stocks to generate at least $2,000 in annual dividends."", 'Telecom giant Verizon Communications pays an incredibly high yield of 6.4% right now, which is far higher than normal for this top dividend stock. Investing $15,000 into the stock would mean you can expect to collect $970 annually from the dividend Verizon pays.', ""Verizon has also increased its dividend payments for 17 consecutive years, which is the longest streak in the U.S. telecom industry. The company's CEO believes that the stock is a potential substitute for bonds given its reliable dividend income. That suggests that if interest rate cuts happen this year, Verizon's stock could be in high demand as investors potentially pivot from bonds into dividend stocks."", ""Rising interest rates haven't helped Verizon's stock, as it is down 1% in the past 12 months. But what's important is that the payout remains safe. In 2023, the company's free cash flow rose to $18.7 billion versus $14.1 billion a year earlier. While operating revenue was down 2% to $134 billion, the improved cash position suggests that not only is the current yield safe, but also that Verizon's dividend growth steak is likely to continue."", ""Another stock that's paying a higher-than-normal yield is Pfizer. The pharma giant's shares have fallen close to 40% in just the past 12 months. Its dividend yield is slightly lower than Verizon's at 6.2%, but that's still a fairly high payout for investors. If you were to buy $13,000 worth of Pfizer shares, your annual dividend income from that investment could total approximately $792."", ""Pfizer recently boosted its dividend by a penny to $0.42. It has steadily increased its payout since 2010, and the healthcare company has paid a dividend for more than 340 consecutive quarters -- that's a span of more than 85 years."", ""The risk with the stock today is that Pfizer is in the midst of a transition as it moves away from COVID-19 products and focuses on new growth opportunities, which are partly fueled through acquisitions. In 2023, the company's sales were down 42% to $58.5 billion, largely due to a significant decline in COVID vaccinations."", 'Last year, Pfizer closed a mammoth $43 billion acquisition of cancer specialist Seagen, which will be a big part of its long-term turnaround plan.', ""There's some risk with Pfizer due to the uncertainty that lies ahead, but given its track record and ability to innovate and grow over the years, this is still a fairly proven and established company to invest in. Plus, with an estimated forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 12, investors are getting the stock at a good discount."", 'A real estate investment trust (REIT) like Realty Income makes for another promising dividend investment. Like Verizon, it has struggled due to rising interest rates, as its share price is down 22% over the past year. Its yield is around 5.7%, and investing $5,000 in the REIT would mean that you could earn around $286 in dividends over the course of a full year. When combined with the other investments on this list, your annual dividend income would now total at least $2,048.', ""What makes Realty Income attractive is its diversification. The REIT's portfolio isn't heavily exposed to one industry or area of the economy; its tenants are in 85 industries. Its occupancy rate is also just under 99%. Despite what its struggling share price may suggest, Realty Income isn't a highly risky investment to be holding."", ""When the company last released earnings in November, Realty Income's funds from operations, a key metric for REITs, increased by 7% to $1.04 per share for the quarter ending Sept. 30, 2023. And what may sweeten the deal for investors is that unlike most other dividend stocks, Realty Income distributes payments to investors on a monthly basis. Currently it pays nearly $0.26 per share in its monthly dividend."", 'Realty Income can make for a great dividend stock to buy and hold for the long term given both its high yield and its diverse portfolio mix.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Verizon Communications right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Verizon Communications, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Verizon Communications wasn’t one of them.

But the stock is feeling the hangover from that gold rush ending, which puts investors in a predicament."", ""The company's revenue and earnings are plummeting, and Wall Street has sent the stock to near decade-lows.

Over the next year, analysts predict FOX's cash profitability will improve. Their consensus estimates imply its LTM free cash flow margin of 8.1% will increase to 11.6%."", ""We were impressed by how significantly FOX blew past analysts' EBITDA and EPS estimates this quarter. Its revenue, although down year on year, also slightly beat thanks to better-than-expected affiliate (retransmission fee) and advertising revenue. Revenue was down this quarter because of the absence of FIFA Men's World Cup games. This headwind, however, was partially offset by its renewed NFL contract. Overall, this quarter's results seemed fairly positive and shareholders should feel optimistic.

It's still the dominant player in the fintech field, but it has lost its luster. Investors haven't been pleased with its progress, and PayPal stock is down 27% over the past year."", ""There's a lot of change taking place right now at the company as it strives to right its ship. Let's go through the bull and bear cases for PayPal and see if its stock is worth taking a chance on."", 'Parkev Tatevosian: My bull case for PayPal stock centers around the convenience the company adds to the digital buying process. People using PayPal can purchase more quickly and conveniently than those who are taking out their debit or credit cards for a transaction. Over the years, that customer value proposition has attracted hundreds of millions of customers to its platform and increased its revenues and profitability.', ""Indeed, from 2018 to 2022, PayPal's revenue grew from $15.4 billion to $27.5 billion. (Its final numbers for 2023 are not yet available.) The company has done an excellent job of capitalizing on the network effects its business benefits from. When more consumers use PayPal, it incentivizes more merchants to accept it as a payment method, which in turn adds reasons for still more customers to join. Getting that virtuous cycle rolling was arguably the most challenging part of its business expansion."", ""Also from 2018 to 2022, PayPal's profits expanded from $2.5 billion to $4 billion. Its asset-light business model allows for solid profits. Of course, challenges persist for PayPal as it tries to defend its market share against rivals offering similar services. I will argue, however, that its cheap valuation more than accounts for the risks PayPal shareholders face. The stock's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 10 gives it an attractive risk-versus-reward proposition, to be sure."", ""Jennifer Saibil: What's happened to PayPal over the past few years is that it has become so big that it's lost a clear path forward. It's still the largest digital payments processor, with more than $1.5 trillion in trailing-12-month payment volume. But it's increasingly losing market share to other players that are entering smaller niches and cracking them wide open. Alphabet's Google Pay and Apple's Apple Pay apps are easy to use, and companies like Klarna and Adyen have developed agile platforms for payment processing."", ""PayPal's performance in recent quarters has been sluggish, and it is expected to report this week that revenue increased by a percentage in the mid-to-high single digits in the fourth quarter. It's losing active customers, and although management says it's letting go of its least-active customers to focus on generating higher revenue from those who are more active, it's a metric to watch. Profitability has also been pressured."", 'If PayPal continues in its current state without strong innovation and a guided path toward growth, its spot at the top of the fintech chain will be in jeopardy. It has taken several steps to correct its course, starting with bringing in a new outsider CEO and CFO. Management recently announced a new slate of services to ""revolutionize commerce,"" with rapid checkout and other value-enhancements for businesses. These are the right moves, and although they inspire confidence, PayPal is a company in flux, and that implies some amount of instability and risk.', ""PayPal still has the opportunity to turn itself around and revitalize its growth trajectory. Value investors may want to take advantage of PayPal's low valuation right now on the premise that it has the potential to get back to high growth. Risk-averse investors, though, may want to wait for it to start delivering more sustained strong performance before wading into PayPal stock."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

And when you're investing in stocks for five, 10, or more years at a time, you should be selective about the businesses you add to your portfolio. You should also prepare yourself for the fact that not all the stocks you pick will be winners all the time. A stock might lose for a long time in your portfolio before market forces finally kick in and generate a solid rebound."", 'There are quality businesses out there with understandable, viable growth stories that align with your investment thesis and with your long-term financial goals. When you find them, invest in them over time to eventually construct a well-diversified, profitable portfolio.', 'Here are two super stocks to consider adding to your basket as 2024 kicks off.', 'Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) stock is trading up by around 40% from its position 12 months ago, about twice the return of the S&P 500 in that same period. The image search and sharing social media platform is used by close to half a billion monthly active users around the world for ideas and inspiration across a vast range of topics. When a user inputs a search term -- some of the most popular categories on Pinterest are home decor, fashion, and health and wellness -- they will pull up a variety of images and videos that align with that search intent.', 'Some of these images and videos are ads for various products and services by the scores of brands that pay to advertise on Pinterest. Management wants Pinterest to eventually get to the point where every image or video, known as a ""pin,"" is shoppable. This would mean that any pin featured in the search results would link the user to an appropriate corresponding product or service.', ""In the third-quarter earnings call, CEO Bill Ready gave more insight into the company's continued implementation of its strategy to make Pinterest a place where people habitually shop, taking that initial idea for inspiration and turning it into an action that results in a purchase. Interestingly, Pinterest is using artificial intelligence (AI) to help make this happen:"", 'Our new shop, the Look Module, which we launched in Q2, helps users to easily shop what they see in lifestyle images. When a user clicks on one of these lifestyle images, the Shop the Look module will appear as a carousel within the pin close-up. Within that module, we employ AI and computer vision to then recommend similar buyable items within our merchant catalog that users can easily shop. In fact, 70% of the products recommended in Shop the Look are rated as exact or highly relevant matches.', 'Pinterest is also seeing growing adoption of its application programming interface (API) for conversion. A conversion API allows the brand to send data from its server to a third-party advertising platform like Pinterest, which helps enable more precise, higher-conversion ad campaigns. Pinterest is partnering with companies like Adobe and Salesforce to deploy its API for conversions, and brands are onboarding at such a clip that this single product now accounts for nearly 30% of its revenue as of the most recent quarter.', ""In other words, Pinterest isn't just expanding the ad potential of its platform, but it's also using key partnerships, new ad initiatives, and AI-driven experiences to provide an enhanced value proposition for brands and deliver more engaging, successful ads to users. Pinterest is slowly but surely growing revenue again after a series of tough quarters affected by fluctuating ad spend. It also turned a $7 million profit according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the most recent quarter. Now could be a good time to scoop up this stock, as it looks to have abundant growth potential still to explore over the next five to 10 years."", 'PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) is still trading down by around 30% from one year ago, although the stock is slightly up from its position at the start of 2024. Concerns about competition with other payment services, a slowdown in growth from a few years ago, and dampened enthusiasm from many investors toward fintech stocks compared to the height of the pandemic have all been factors.', ""As always, when you're looking at a company to invest in, you need to think about it in terms of its business, not just whether the stock is up or down. A share price going up or down in and of itself tells you very little other than what investors value the stock at a given moment in time."", ""If you're considering buying and holding a stock for the long term, that means you're going to become a part owner of that business (however fractionally small an amount that might be). Looking at PayPal specifically, while growth has slowed from previous periods, much of this is a function of the macroeconomic landscape in which the business is operating rather than a negative quality attributable to the business itself."", 'As a leading payment processing provider, PayPal is heavily dependent on the trajectory of consumer spending. The broader fluctuations in discretionary consumer spending have impacted the business, too. While competition is ramping up in this space, consider that PayPal still accounts for roughly 40% of all online payment processing that occurs globally.', ""That's a pretty wide moat to rely on as it builds future growth, and PayPal has still reported some impressive growth figures lately despite the difficult environment in which it's operating. Total payment volume rose 15% year over year to $388 billion in the most recent quarter, while net revenue came in at $7 billion, an 8% bump from the year-ago period."", 'PayPal processed 6.3 billion payment transactions in the quarter, an 11% year-over-year boost. And transactions per active account for the trailing 12 months came in at 56.6, a 13% boost from the prior-year period. PayPal has grown revenue by roughly 55% over the trailing five-year period. At its current price-to-sales valuation of 2 and price-to-book ratio of 3, investors looking to buy a top growth stock at a discount may find that this business looks like a solid choice to hold onto for the long run.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Pinterest right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Pinterest, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Pinterest wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.', 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Below is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share for tracking historical trends.', 'As of today, International Business Machines Corp currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.63% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 3.64%. This suggests an expectation of increased dividend payments over the next 12 months.', ""Over the past three years, International Business Machines Corp's annual dividend growth rate was 0.60%. Extended to a five-year horizon, this rate increased to 1.20% per year. And over the past decade, International Business Machines Corp's annual dividends per share growth rate stands at 5.50%. Based on International Business Machines Corp's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost of International Business Machines Corp stock as of today is approximately 3.85%."", ""To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends.

The payout ratio indicates a healthy balance between earnings distribution and retention for growth.

And some of the stocks that these companies really that are really high on was beer companies in particular-- Bud, Molson Coors returning with Coors Light to Super Bowl. But as I think three different ads in Super Bowl. Constellation Brands, not so much there. But they kind of launched their lot of their sports marketing with beer stuff."", 'So seeing a lot of that staples names, too. Makes sense.', ""JOSH SCHAFER: To me, it's interesting.

We know the Super Bowl has a giant audience. It also has a giant audience of people that drink beer and watch football."", ""It's sort of-- it's the perfect moment to make your pitch again, whatever their sort of big rebranding pitches are, right, to have a creative ad--"", 'ALEXANDRA CANAL: Those are the ads that stick out to me, too.', ""JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah. Those are the ads that stand out. And you bring sort of people back, maybe we get the Clydesdales back for Budweiser. Those horses were always a hit.

They've never submitted ads into the Super Bowl. And now they are going to be for the first time."", ""So perhaps the notion is that with more female viewers watching the Super Bowl, they want to get in on the action. We also saw Dove, they haven't been in a Super Bowl for 18 years. They're coming back for the first time. So beauty brands, health and wellness brands, perhaps, because of the female watcher. That's definitely increased, the NFL has said that.

And that's why these brands are hopping on."", ""ALEXANDRA CANAL: And you're getting women to be watching any football game, it is the Super Bowl, right? Like, people want to be part of that cooler moment, that conversation."", ""JOSH SCHAFER: And how many times have we talked recently about how Gen Z is putting on more makeup and buying more makeup, right? A lot of those companies you just listed were makeup companies.

And the other thing that I'm always excited for is the brands that you haven't heard of as much or even, I would say, a Dove that you've heard of, but like putting a name to a brand is something a lot of marketers have talked to me about in the past when it comes to sports advertising.

After, we will open up the phone lines to take questions. Udit."", 'Udit Batra', ""Thank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. I would like to begin today's call by expressing my gratitude to all my colleagues.2023 was another transformative year for Waters. Throughout the year, our teams kept an unwavering focus on customers, launched innovative new products and delivered strong business performance, all during highly eventful times with dynamic market conditions.As 2022 ended, the results of our transformation clearly showed on the top line, having delivered several years of very strong above average sales growth. Since then, in 2023, we have demonstrated our ability to manage exceptionally well through a downturn while continuing to make investments for growth.In 2023, we also initiated the next phase of our transformation with the acquisition of Wyatt. This brings with it a new vector for value creation to our shareholders through M&A and we're off to a great start. As an added benefit, it has accelerated our journey into high-growth adjacent markets, where we made continued progress with our organic investments over the course of the year. We launched new and innovative products in2023, including our Alliance iS next-generation LC platform. We expanded our Xevo TQ mass spec into clinical applications and developed size exclusion columns for viral vectors that bear with wired malls instruments. We even had our first light scattering launch as a combined company with ZetaStar.Finally, we were recognized as one of the world's most sustainable companies achieving a variety of ESG awards. This includes our top 5 ranking on Barron's Most Sustainable Companies list, which scores over 1,000 publicly traded companies based on 230 ESG performance indicators. We're very proud of what we've achieved at Waters in 2023. Today, as I share our fourth quarter and full year results, I have 3 key messages. First, we've continued to execute well. Second, our transformation is contributing to our results. And third, we're well positioned for future long-term growth.Turning now to our results. In the fourth quarter, sales declined 4.5% as reported, which was in line with our expectations. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share landed at the high end of our guidance at $3.62 driven by strong margin performance. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $3.65. For the full year, sales declined 0.5% as reported and 2% in organic constant currency. Even with a constrained CapEx environment, all our regions outside of China grew in 2023 in organic constant currency terms. As expected, Wyatt successfully delivered on on-target M&A contribution of 2.5% to sales. And with a strong EPS result in Q4, non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share came in at $11.75, which reflects underlying growth of approximately 2% before FX headwinds of 3% and 1% dilution from the Wyatt acquisition.I will now describe our sales results in more detail. The spending environment for instruments remained challenging into year-end. However, Q4 revenue increased versus Q3 levels in all our geographies, even China, as we continue to execute well in tough macro conditions. Reported sales were $108 million higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. This reflects a 15% ramp that was consistent with our guidance for a muted year-end budget flush. For the full year, our organic constant currency sales grew 3% year-over-year, excluding China. As I mentioned earlier, the Americas, Europe and Asia, excluding China, all grew in 2023. This took a lot of effort from our sales team who did a fantastic job capitalizing on the available opportunities in the market with our competitive portfolio. As a result, on a 4-year stack basis, our ex-China growth remains at a healthy high single digits.A key challenge in 2023 was the abrupt turn we saw in China where conditions deteriorated as the year progressed. This was particularly the case in the pharma market where our revenues are most heavily weighted. For the full year, China sales declined more than 20% overall, which was a 5% headwind to our total growth.This brings us now to our margin performance. We believe that the best reflection of good operational execution is effective margin management when things slow down. During 2023, we saw volume and FX headwinds, while inflationary pressure continued. We responded with stronger pricing and added further discipline to our operational objectives. We redoubled our productivity efforts, including the opening of our Global Capability Center in Bangalore, India. And we undertook proactive cost alignment as the slowdown began to emerge. This resilience, focus and commitment allowed us to deliver excellent operational results in our P&L. Our full year gross margin was 59.6%, which is 160 basis points better than the previous year. Our full year adjusted operating margin was 30.9%, which is 70 basis points of expansion.Now let me share our progress with the acquisition of Wyatt Technology. The strong start to lead sharing between Wyatt and Waters allowed us to offset a slowdown in biotech spending resulting in an on-target M&A contribution of 2.5% to our full year sales. I will now give some details and how our revitalized portfolio and alignment with higher growth segments are contributing to growth as part of our transformation. Our strong results in 2023 were supported by our innovative portfolio, which helped drive customer spending. Our new products are gaining good traction in the market, including TQ Absolute, Alliance iS, and MaxPeak Premier Columns as well as several of our high-res mass spec instruments such as Cyclic, G3 and MRT. From an adoption perspective, this puts us in an excellent position when instrument budgets begin to normalize.Turning now to our adjacencies. We have continued to invest and expand into adjacent high-growth markets where our business model of solving problems in downstream regulated applications can be deployed. For bioseparations and bioanalytical characterizations, we've made organic investments, launched new products and deployed capital to M&A. Large molecule applications are now 35% of our pharma revenues and expected to trend higher, up from around 20% just a few years ago.For Diagnostics, we have invested in our clinical business and added workflows for specialty applications of mass spec. This has transformed related revenue growth from that of low to mid-single digits to double digits in the past several years.Finally, our focus on batteries is paying dividends, where very strong growth has remained throughout the year. Revenues from battery applications are now at over 10x 2019 revenue levels, and our TA business is increasingly aligned with less cyclical faster-growing applications. Each of these exciting growth areas is delivering incremental revenue to the company.Now I will share some facts supporting the long-term outlook for above-average growth and provide our 2024 guidance. Since 2010, Waters has grown, on average, 6% in organic constant currency terms. For Instruments, while the standard deviation is high, long-term average growth has been 5%. For recurring revenues, the standard deviation is much lower and the average growth is 7%. As we look ahead, several vectors make us confident that this growth could be even higher. The first is even faster volume growth in segments that we serve, driven by global prescription drug sales and environmental regulations. Second is increased use of analytical instruments for characterizing large molecules and novel modalities. And third, it's about historic pricing where we expect to sustain a 100 basis point long-term tailwind in incremental growth.Let's take each of these growth vectors in turn. There are at least 2 key drivers of testing volume acceleration. The first is related to the adoption of GLP-1 drugs where Waters' instruments and columns are specified into in-process testing and QA/QC testing at the 2 leading manufacturers. We expect our position to contribute an average additional revenue growth of 30 basis points per year between now and 2030.The second is PFAS testing where we've been gaining share in a rapidly expanding market, in part driven by the sensitivity and compact size of our Xevo TQ Absolute mass spec. We expect PFAS testing to contribute an additional 30 basis points to our revenue growth for the foreseeable future.Finally, Wyatt light scattering is a high-growth business, serving attractive large molecule applications. We expect it to contribute 40 basis points of core growth accretion to our business on an annualized basis. It also accelerates our ability to solve customer challenges in formulation development, bioanalytical characterization and QA/QC testing, which has positive repercussions for our Waters business as we increasingly tie our columns, LC and mass spec into these workflows.I will now cover our 2024 full year guidance. We expect customer spending caution to continue in the first quarter of the year with slow budget releases for downstream instrumentation. We then expect to see a gradual improvement for the remainder of the year as budgets open up, market conditions improve and as prior year comparisons become easier. We expect weakness in China to continue, particularly in the first half of the year, which also plays into the growth phasing of our guide. With this initial outlook for 2024, we expect full year organic constant currency sales growth to be between negative 0.5% to positive 1.5%. We expect continued strong operational performance to build, leveraging our P&L with 20 to 30 basis points of further operating margin expansion, while still reinvesting for growth and we expect adjusted EPS growth of 0% to 3% in the range of $11.75 to $12.05.Now I will pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our fourth quarter financial results in more detail and give additional commentary on our guidance for 2024. Amol?"", 'Amol Chaubal', ""Thank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. We delivered a solid close to a tough year in the fourth quarter with sales that were in line with our expectations despite continued market challenges. In the quarter, sales declined 4.5% as reported, which aligned with our expectations for a 15% increase in reported revenues versus Q3. Organic constant currency sales declined 8% against the high single-digit growth comparison last year.We did observe a budget flush in the fourth quarter as sales grew across all geographies in Q4 and versus Q3. However, this year's budget flush was more muted than typical, consistent with our expectations. Our Wyatt acquisition delivered excellent results again, adding over 3% growth to the reported sales. In organic constant currency by end market, Pharma declined 11%, Industrial declined 4% and Academic & Government declined 9%.In Pharma, our results were impacted by a further weakening in China, which declined 45% for the quarter. Outside of China, Pharma sales declined 4% as instrument sales were impacted by a muted budget flush in line with our expectations.In Industrial, growth was flat outside of China against a tough high teens prior year comparison. China declined approximately 20% as weakness has broadened into nonpharma segments due to weak economic conditions. Overall, we observed continued strong growth in PFAS and battery-related applications which have continued to partially offset weakness in more cyclical areas.In Academic & Government, our ex-China business continued to perform well with mid-single-digit growth. However, this was more than offset by a decline of almost 40% in China, where demand has deteriorated after the benefits of stimulus ended in the second quarter.By Geography, sales in Asia fell 16% as China weakness more than offset mid-single-digit growth in the rest of Asia. The Americas declined 2% and Europe declined 6%, driven by this year's muted budget flush dynamics. By Products & Services, Instruments declined 20%. Recurring revenues grew mid-single digits with continued high single-digit growth outside of China. There was 1 additional day in the quarter versus the prior year. Looking now at our full year results. By End Market, Pharma declined 5%, Industrial was flat and Academic & Government grew 10%. Excluding China, Pharma and Industrial grew low single digits, and A&G grew mid-teens for the year, each reflecting solid results against double-digit comps.Now by Geography, sales in Asia declined 7%, with China declining more than 20%, while Asia, ex-China grew high single digits. The Americas grew 1% and Europe grew 2%.By Products & Services, Instruments declined 10%, which is primarily driven by China. Excluding China, Instruments declined low single digits in 2023, reflecting healthy high single-digit 4-year CAGR.Recurring revenues grew 6% overall and high single digits outside of China with robust growth throughout the year. Chemistry growth has been supported by strong customer demand for MaxPeak Premier Columns serving large molecule workflows and adoption of e-commerce. For Service, growth has been supported by expansion of plan attachment. In 2023, we exceeded our objective for a further 100 basis points of service plan attachment and delivered a 200 basis point increase for the year.Now I will comment on our fourth quarter and full year non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Despite headwinds from lower sales volumes, FX and inflation, in 2023, our team responded to these challenges with resilience and commitment. Our continued focus on operational excellence with pricing, productivity and proactive cost alignment together with lower incentive compensation, allowed us to deliver a fourth quarter gross margin of 61.2% and expansion of 170 basis points and fourth quarter adjusted operating margin of 34.9%, an expansion of 120 basis points. For the full year, our focus and efforts resulted in gross margin of 59.6% and an expansion of 160 basis points and an adjusted operating margin of 30.9% and expansion of 70 basis points, which is after reinvesting in our high-growth adjacencies. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 17.1%, 50 basis points below prior year quarter. For the full year, it was 16.2%.Our average share count came in at 59.3 million shares, which is about 300,000 less than the fourth quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were $3.62. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share were $3.65. For the full year, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were $11.75. Foreign exchange headwinds lowered our non-GAAP EPS growth by 3%, and there was a 1% dilution from the Wyatt acquisition. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $10.84. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to this morning's press release and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation.Now turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flows as cash from operation, less capital expenditure, and excludes special items.In the fourth quarter of 2023, free cash flow was $192 million after funding $42 million of capital expenditures. For the full year, free cash flow was $554 million after funding $161 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from the free cash flow were payments of $72 million related to tax reform, $26 million for Wyatt assumed liabilities and $16 million related to investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operations. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation.At the end of the quarter, our net debt position further declined to $2 billion, a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 2x. This represents a decrease of approximately $150 million during the quarter as we delivered the Wyatt acquisition. As previously disclosed, our share buyback program has been temporarily suspended to enable us to pay down debt incurred as part of the Wyatt transaction. We will evaluate the resumption of our share repurchase program throughout 2024 as part of our balanced capital deployment objective.Now as we look towards the year ahead, I would like to provide you with our high-level thoughts for 2024. Similar to others in the industry, our growth in 2023 was slower than usual, driven by unprecedented weakness in China and cautious spending from customers in other regions. We view these market conditions as temporary and anticipate a gradual recovery in sales growth throughout 2024. While our customers remain healthy, market uncertainty still remains and necessitates prudence in our guide. These dynamics support full year 2024 organic constant currency sales growth guidance of negative 0.5% to positive 1.5%.At current exchange rates, currency translation is expected to result in a negative impact of just under 1% on full year sales. We expect Wyatt transaction to add approximately 1.3% M&A contribution to our full year 2024 revenues from inorganic sales incurred in the first 4.5 months of the year. Therefore, our total reported sales growth guidance is approximately 0% to 2%. We expect to extend our strong margin performance into 2024 and deliver a gross margin of 59.8% for the full year, which is 20 basis points of expansion versus 2023. We also expect to deliver 20 to 30 basis points of additional operating margin expansion versus 2023, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of slightly over 31%. We expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $80 million. Our full year tax rate is expected to remain largely consistent with 2023 levels at 16.3%. Our average diluted 2024 share count is expected to be approximately 59.7 million.Now rolling all this together, on a non-GAAP basis, our full year 2024 earnings per fully diluted share guidance is projected in the range of $11.75 to $12.05, which is approximately 0% to 3% growth and includes an estimated headwind of approximately 2% due to unfavorable foreign exchange.Turning now to our expectations for the first quarter of 2024. We believe that customer budget release timing will be slower than typical in the first quarter. In addition, current levels of market weakness in China are not fully reflected in last year's first quarter comparison. Last year's deterioration picked up significantly in the second quarter and thereafter. The first quarter also last year benefited from A&G stimulus in China. As a result, we expect our China business to decline approximately 40% year-over-year in Q1.Given these dynamics, we expect organic constant currency sales growth in the range of negative 11% to negative 9%. At current rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 1%, while Wyatt is expected to add approximately 3.5% to sales for the quarter. Therefore, our total first quarter reported sales growth guidance is negative 8.5% to negative 6.5%. Based on these revenue expectations, first quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range $2.05 to $2.15, which includes a negative currency impact of approximately 4 percentage points at current FX rates.Now I would like to turn the call back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?"", 'Udit Batra', ""Thank you, Amol. So in summary, another transformative year for Waters. We will continue to navigate the current market environment well and deliver earnings growth for our shareholders in 2024. Before I close, I would like to share a few updates on our ESG efforts. We've made strong progress towards our environmental goals with 70% -- 77% of our electricity now sourced from renewable or low carbon sources. In 2023, we started working with the science-based targets initiative to build on this progress and develop further emissions reduction targets. We've also enhanced our climate-related disclosure with our TCFD-related reporting.Waters was recognized as one of the best companies to work for by the U.S. News & World Report, and we achieved a perfect score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index. We're also proud that our governance has been recognized. Water's Board of Directors was named the 2024 Public Company Board of the Year by National Association of Corporate Directors New England Chapter.So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Caspar."", 'Caspar Tudor', ""Thanks, Udit. That concludes our formal comments. We're now ready to open the phone lines for questions."", 'Operator', 'Our first question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.', 'Vijay Muniyappa Kumar', ""Udit, just on the annual guidance here. At the midpoint, I think it's about 50 basis points growth. What is the guide assuming for price? And can you talk about end markets, Pharma, Government & Academia, and Industrial sort of assumptions. I know you gave the China assumptions. China is expected to be down, but could you just parse out between China versus non-China for those end markets?"", 'Udit Batra', ""Sure. So thanks, Vijay, for the question. Look, I mean, a couple of high-level comments, and then I'll go to the end markets, and I'll let Amol comment on the pricing question.The 2024 guidance, in general, assumes that the trends that we saw in 2023 continue in large part, right? So you start off just looking at what happened in 2023. Outside of China, all end markets and geographies grew low single digits or thereabouts, right? So all geographies were low single digits and we assume the same trend for the balance of the year and all end markets were in the similar sort of zip code. And in China, we assume roughly sort of mid-teens to high teens decline for 2024.Now when you do the arithmetic, you basically look at the comps, the first half of the year will be slower than the second half, right? The first half of the year has significantly higher comps when you look at the Academic & Government stimulus, especially in China and then the second half of the year, that alleviates so you start to see a bit of a growth.So now to your question on the full year and the assumption for different end markets. For the full year, Pharma, we're expecting to grow low single digits, and this is again on the back of what we saw in 2023. Industrial was flat in 2023 for the full year, we expect it to be there or thereabout low single-digit growth. And A&G with a very strong year, roughly 10%, 12% for 2023, we expect it to be a low double-digit decline. Basically, in China, declining quite significantly because of high comps and the rest of the world, you sort of go back to the long-term trends of low single-digit growth. So really, overall, expecting the same execution that we saw in 2023, basically really nice performance in markets outside of China with low single-digit growth in China, mid-teens decline and by end market, sort of similar trend -- strength continuing in Pharma due to our QA/QC focus.Amol on the pricing?"", 'Amol Chaubal', ""Yes. Thanks, Vijay. And look, on pricing, when we started '23, we started with an assumption of 200, 250 basis points. But as the year panned out, our team gathered strength quarter after quarter and you see full year, we finished about 300 basis points on price, right? Now long term, we've said we'll do about 100 basis points better than what we've historically done. And historically, we had done 50 to 75 basis points. So that's where our guide assumption is starting roughly around 200 basis points of pricing gains in 2024. But again, underlying trend is -- I mean we're doing better than that. And we're better to see it, right? I mean it reflects loud and clear in our gross margin expansion, which is where it should show up."", 'Udit Batra', ""Yes. And then I think just to sort of emphasize that point even more, what gives me sort of lot of confidence is what we saw in our gross margin and our operating margin. I mean in such an environment, we took proactive cost actions, operating margin for the full year expanded by 70 basis points and gross margin by 160 basis points. I mean you can talk a good game on pricing. But at the end, it has to show up in the P&L, and that's what we're really proud of."", 'Vijay Muniyappa Kumar', ""Absolutely. That's helpful comments, Udit. Amol, one for you. Operating margin expansion, that's really pretty impressive. Considering revenues were almost flattish here organically, is that all being driven by gross margins? I think in the past, you noted FX could be -- have an impact on gross margins? Should maybe -- just talk about what's driving OMX and FX assumptions on margins?"", 'Amol Chaubal', ""Yes. Look, I mean, we expanded our full year margins by 70 basis points. And on a constant currency basis, that's 120 basis points of expansion because we had a good 50 basis points of FX headwind during the year. The negative leverage from volume was partially offset by mix and AIP. So net-net, it was negative 40 basis points. Pricing added 110 basis points, freight and material savings added another 60 basis points, cost actions added another 60 basis points. And then we invested about 70 basis points in nurturing higher growth adjacencies. So that's roughly the breakout."", 'Udit Batra', 'So all hands on deck basically.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs.', 'Matthew Carlisle Sykes', ""Maybe just the first one, a higher-level question, Udit. Just on the replacement cycle impact. Just given the outsized growth we saw in Instruments during the sort of COVID period, what kind of impact do you think this has had on replacement cycles, particularly in biopharma, given a lot of the spend was concentrated there? Do you think the replacement cycle has been pushed out? Or do you think that you'll see that impact of that coming back in this year? Or is it more of a 2025 impact?"", 'Udit Batra', ""Yes, it's a great question, Matt, and thank you, thank you for that. So let me start by first just talking about what we have seen in Q4, right? You would have seen that Q4, our sales ramped from Q3 to Q4 by about 15%, right? And this is typical in a QA/QC driven business. I mean, It's muted versus historical trends, which are roughly 24% for Waters. But in a QA/QC driven business, you do see a ramp in replacement towards the end of the year, right? So we've -- that intact is -- that trend is very much intact, especially outside of China, right? So there is -- it's I think naive to think that replacement cycles have suddenly stopped, right? This Q4 ramp tells us the replacement cycles are still ongoing.Now the question -- the underlying question is what are driving these replacement cycles and when -- and how do you trigger them, right? So when you -- in a muted capital -- in a muted CapEx environment, the conversations we've had with customers on replacements have largely centered around new products, right, Arc HPLC and Alliance iS, which have both gained a lot of nice receptivity, right? So new products allow you to continue to have that conversation. And you see that reflected in our sort of Pharma results outside of China and as you compare it to our peer group.Now to your question on did we see an outsized replacement during the post-COVID years? I mean it's very difficult to tell. We think it was more a pushback from the depression that you saw in the -- during COVID and outsized execution that we saw due to the replacement cycle that we had not had in -- from 2018 to 2020. So pent-up demand sort of helped us get really outsized growth. Now to corroborate that point, if you just look at LC, LC is 70% replacement business. And if you look at how we ended the full year 2023, right? So LC -- and again, one should look at long-term trends, on a long-term basis is roughly 1% growth on a 4-year CAGR. So LC is growing roughly 1% on a 4-year CAGR basis, which is well below the long-term average of about 4% to 5%. And you add pricing. So it's actually 4-ish percent sort of below in volume versus the long-term trend of 4% to 5% LC growth. So we do expect LCE replacement to start imminently.Now don't ask me exactly when that inflection point is. Short term, we have a ton of visibility with a lot of data and a lot of conversations with customers. Long term, we think the trends are going to revert back to the mean or even better given what we've talked about in our prepared remarks. The inflection point, you don't get any extra marks to call it. So in 2024, we've assumed the same trends as 2023 to persist. But definitely, we believe LC is due to come up in growth rates. So a long answer, but I hope that gives you a lot of context on how we're thinking about it."", 'Matthew Carlisle Sykes', ""Yes, that's great color. And then just a quick one on PFAS. You mentioned in the slide deck that the market is starting to expand into food, which is probably earlier than we had expected. Just given the potential size of the market of food relative to water. One, how big do you assume the food market to be over the long term? And two, how much of that 30 basis points annual contribution from PFAS actually comes from food relative to water in your assumptions?"", 'Udit Batra', ""Early days, Matt. I mean, we've assumed roughly $50 million to $75 million for now in the food market. And over time, we expect it to expand as you well pointed out, that could be a pretty significant market. We want to be a bit cautious here, right? So the 30 basis points is largely on the back of water testing and not much from food testing at this point. But that said, the PFAS market is super dynamic. So we've gone from water testing to expansion into food testing, into tissue samples, into soil samples, into sewage and into industrial companies sort of purchasing mass specs to analyze their effluent stream. So it's a market that's going to significantly expand.We're a bit cautious in trying to guess exactly what that size is, what we're focused on is sort of going after each and every opportunity in these segments. And you see that with roughly 40% growth. So stay tuned. I mean as we find out more, you'll progressively see the increased market sizes or better information emerge."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan.', 'Rachel Marie Vatnsdal Olson', 'I may just want to dig into this 1Q guide a little bit. This is weaker than most of us had anticipated. Appreciate that the market is pretty dynamic, and you have some really difficult comps in China during 1Q. But are there any other one-timers in terms of why you would have that level of sequential step down? And was there any pull forward that may have helped 4Q that led to that softer 1Q guide as well?', 'Amol Chaubal', ""Yes. No, Rachel. Thanks for your question. I mean the one-timers are largely in China, right? I mean you had the stimulus last year in A&G and the level of weakness we're seeing now in China, last year's Q1 baseline doesn't reflect that at all. In the rest of the world, we're assuming customers will be slow out of the gate versus what we typically see. And that's based on the trend that we saw in Q4 where the budget flush was muted and that will somehow we think, reflect in how quickly budgets are released to customers. And that's sort of playing out in the guidance."", 'Udit Batra', ""Yes, it's -- Rachel, just to sort of build on what Amol has said, really no different than what we saw in Q4 overall, right? I mean Q4 was almost 7.5%, 8% down versus previous year. And we're assuming at the midpoint of the guide, Q1 is roughly 10% down. We expect, as Amol said, the trends from Q4 to persist into Q1, right, low single-digit-ish growth or flat growth in ex-China. And in China, roughly 40% decline due to the heavy comps from -- especially from A&G last year where we had the benefit of the stimulus was coming through.So no real challenge. And I mean, I'll just sort of say one more thing, in Pharma in China, in particular, we're starting to see a bit of stabilization, right? We're starting to see biotech spending start to reemerge. We're starting to see CDMO spending on recurring revenues. And we're also in the branded generics segment, which is roughly 50% of our pharma market, where more and more cities and more and more hospitals are starting to open up. So we see that trend, but we're cautious in calling that at this point in Q1. So Q1 basically similar trends to Q4."", 'Amol Chaubal', 'And just keep in mind, Q1 is our smallest quarter, right? So small changes have a meaningful impact on the pattern.', 'Rachel Marie Vatnsdal Olson', ""Great. That's helpful. And then just my follow-up on this assumed gradual improvement that you guys are embedding throughout the year. Can you just dig a little bit more into those assumptions? Which markets and which geographies are you assuming more of an improvement than others? And you talked about some of the China and the comp dynamic. So how much do comps really have to do with that improvement that you're expecting throughout the year as well?"", 'Amol Chaubal', ""Yes. I mean, great question. And look, I mean, we've sort of looked at it from various different vantage points. If you look at sort of how we've performed ex-China, we've grown sort of low single digits, and we expect that to be the case for the full year with some slow out of the gate with how the budgets are released in Q1. And then you sort of face a muted budget flush baseline towards the later part of the year.China, you will see decline as we talked about in Q1 because the baseline is pretty strong. But as we get into the second half of China, we think things will normalize because a lot of the demand slowness is reflected. So if you sort of look at it from that vantage point, for the first half, we sort of decline mid-single digits, for the second half, we sort of grow mid-single digits. When you look at it on a 5-year stack versus 2019, roughly it's mid-single digits growth, both for the first half as well as the second half."", 'Udit Batra', 'Yes. I mean, similar trends in Q1 -- in the first half and second half, just the arithmetic is that the comps in Q1 are higher than -- comps in half -- the first half are higher than the second half.', 'Operator', 'Okay. And our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research.', 'Douglas Anthony Schenkel', ""Actually, I want to look at China a different way, and I'm just doing some quick math on the fly, which is always dangerous. But one thing, as I look back the last few years, I've noticed is I think Q1 revenue in China is typically about 70% of Q4 revenue in China. Just kind of thinking about the historical sequential pattern to the extent you can do that over the last few years given how different that has been. But if we use that as precedent, it seems like you're essentially embedding that pattern into your guidance this year again.So when I keep that in mind and I look at Q3 and Q4 revenue in China, which were about $100 million each. Well, the comps are really tough and the growth is not going to look great in the first half of the year. Are you at some level, kind of assuming a normalization of sequential growth over the course of 2024 relative to Q4 on a sequential basis?"", 'Udit Batra', ""Yes, it's a great question and welcome back, Doug. Look, it's -- you nailed it, right? I mean we've -- and when we gave our Q4 guidance also last year, there was a lot of questions on how did you come up with the guidance. And we use similar sort of math, right? Two, you basically look at 15 years of data, which is what we have, and you look at sequential changes mathematically. Then you look at the funnel itself and look at what the funnel is saying in terms of the orders. And third, you have conversations with customers and during a difficult time, the visibility, I mean, ironically, people say visibility is pretty low. Well, visibility in the short term is incredibly high. We just don't like what we're seeing. And so people think the visibility is slow. The visibility is pretty high.Analytically, we're looking at things very carefully. We're talking to a ton of customers. We're just executing really, really well just getting every opportunity that's in front of us. So to answer your question, yes, we're using that math of sequential growth quarter-on-quarter, and that's embedded in the full year guidance. Now if that improves, so I mean, I'm sort of anticipating the next question, if that improves, of course, you see upside, right? And we're starting to see trends from Q4, especially in China, look a bit better in Q1, especially in the largest end market, which is China -- which is pharma.In the ex-China geographies, in Q1, we've assumed that the same trends continue from Q4 and customers are cautious like they were cautious in Q1, which is what we're sort of hearing from many of our customers. They want to see how Q1 lands before they start releasing CapEx. But you've got one of the elements of our guide philosophy nailed, yes."", 'Douglas Anthony Schenkel', ""Okay. Super helpful. And then Udit, either for you or for Amol. I was wondering if you'd be willing to delineate between large and small molecule growth on the chemistry side. I'm just curious how that's been trending and what's incorporated into guidance. That may be cutting things in an unfair way. But if you're willing to indulge us, I think that would be really interesting just to hear how that's been trending and how you're thinking about it for 2024?"", 'Udit Batra', ""I think -- let's look at clean results ex-China, which is where things are not sort of -- not affected by shutdowns and the like, right? Overall, I mean, I can give you the overall statistic. Back in 2020 our -- the revenues from biologics out of our total pharma revenues were less than 20%. Now that number is in excess of 35%. 400 basis points of that is wired, but the rest of it is the base organic acceleration in large molecule applications.Now I can't tell you off the top of my head how much of that comes from chemistry and how much of that comes from instruments. It's a mix. I would argue at this point, it's basically a mix of the 2, BioAccord sort of picking up, XEVO G3 picking up. But in chemistry, what I can tell you is roughly 70% to 80% of our R&D spend is now on large molecule and biologics applications. MaxPeak Premier Column in its third year is growing in excess of 30%. We've introduced a new gene therapy column. So really, really pleased with what we're doing on large molecule applications with 35% of our pharma revenues now coming from biologics."", 'Operator', 'Okay. And our next question comes from Dan Brennan with TD Cowen.', 'Thomas Patrick Stevens', ""This is Tom Stevens on for Dan Brennan today. I guess my first one is just on the industrial guide. And given the strength of that category with PFAS testing and battery testing the like, what kind of gives you confidence that momentum kind of continues in the back half and why we shouldn't see maybe a rest of world cyclical slowdown? So that would be my first one, and then I got a couple of others to follow up."", 'Udit Batra', ""So Tom, thank you for the question. Look, I mean industrial finished 2023 roughly flat, right? And flat in a year where there were significant macro challenges, right? And this was largely due to PFAS and battery testing offsetting the other macro sensitive segments in our industrial business, right? And TA, I mean we've not talked about that business in a while, but the TA business for the full year grew 3% right, in a year where growth was very difficult to get, and that included, that number includes China, right?Now as you look into 2024, we assume that the full year will be there or thereabouts, low single-digit growth. The ex-China growing low single digits really on the back of PFAS, battery and a bit of recovery on food and environmental. And China really now given this large -- the large comps in 2023, in the negative territory in the low single -- low to mid-single digits. So expecting 2024 to look similar to 2023 overall, especially ex-China, a little bit of stronger sort of comps in China make maybe a bit of muted growth. So you should assume that industrial will be sort of flat to low single-digit growth in 2024."", 'Thomas Patrick Stevens', ""Great. That's really, would be helpful. Just to pivot to LCs and that kind of long-term trajectory, could you remind us kind of what the net contribution of China was in the kind of prior 4 years on a trend basis? And then maybe how you think that kind of long-term market trajectory is different with the potentially muted China going forward and/or your kind of mix into kind of larger molecule applications?"", 'Amol Chaubal', ""Yes. So look, I mean, China, if you look at 2019 or 2022 was roughly 17% to 19% of our revenue. Now where we finished in '23, it's about 15% of our revenue. When you look at sort of -- there are different issues compounding the current situation in China, but we generally feel barring maybe 1 or 2 smaller issues. Most of these issues are cyclical rather than structural. So for example, CDMOs struggling with overcapacity as well as geopolitical challenges or branded generics, pulling back spend because of anticorruption campaigns or industrial business, especially food and environmental slowing down because of government pulling back reimbursement. We think these issues are largely cyclical. They will all come back. It's just a question when and it's very hard to predict when that will happen.On the other hand, the biotech funding and the resultant volume they placed on Tier 2, Tier 3 CDMOs that we think is structural. And in the near term, they're not going to be at the levels of '21, '22 spending. But at least on that issue, which is structural, the good news is we think we found the bottom on that issue because newer molecules are starting to see funding. But there is going to be sort of $30 million to $40 million correction to our '22 baseline. The remaining issues, we think eventually will come back, and that's the business that is today. And then as we've said before, right, what we're super excited about is this whole push for innovative medicines. And there's a whole new vector opening up in China, and we think that will create significant value and we absolutely want to be part of that equation, and we're taking steps so that we have local presence and participate in that journey more closely."", 'Udit Batra', ""Yes. And then just to sort of embellish on that, Amol has covered it extremely well. Tom, LC, as I mentioned earlier, I mean, 2 or 3 factors to keep in mind. On a long-term basis, it's traversing well below our long-term averages, right? So in general, on a 4-, 5-year stack basis, you should expect LC to be mid-single digits. It's actually flat to 1%. You look at that number for 2023, LC overall declined almost 10%, 11%. And bulk of that decline came from China, right? So China declined roughly 30%, 40% -- maybe actually close to 40%, 45% in LC. Outside of China, we were sort of low single-digit decliners in LC, right?So to your question on how will the recovery be impacted with coming back to growth in China? We expect that in the first half of the year, we'll see similar trends that we saw in the second half of the year in LC, and in the second half of the year, we will start to see a bit of a relief in growth. And as we talk to our customers to our largest customer segment, which is pharma, we're starting to see biotechs start to spend again. We're starting to see CDMOs, especially recurring revenue come back. And in branded generics, more and more hospitals are opening up. So it's going to be a mix of replacement cycles beginning again in ex-China markets and in China recovery in pharma. So put those 2 together, and you should start to see LC come back. We're not assuming it -- assuming that in our guide at this point. But definitely, there are trends in that direction."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Catherine Schulte with Baird.', 'Catherine Walden Ramsey Schulte', ""Maybe first, just touching on some of your commercial initiatives. Any comments on what you're targeting for service attachment rates or e-commerce improvements in '24?"", 'Udit Batra', ""Sure. Thank you for that question, Catherine. So really continuing the trend, right? So we went from about 20%, it's for e-commerce from about 20% to 35% already, 35-plus percent already in e-commerce, and we expect that to grow closer to 40% by the end of 2024. And in service attachment, I mean, having already seen roughly 500 basis points of service attach increase from the time we started the initiative 3 years ago, we're planning for another 100 basis points of service attachment increase in 2024. So continuing on with our commercial initiatives."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.', 'Derik De Bruin', ""So I've got a couple. Could you comment on order trends in Q4, if I missed it, I apologize. I mean did you see orders pick up sequentially? And how should we think about the tax rate sort of in 2025 as we work through the Pillar 2 stuff? And I have one more follow-up."", 'Udit Batra', ""Sure. So I'll start with the order and then I'll let Amol talk about the tax piece. Orders are in line with sales, again, Derik. So no real difference between the 2 for Q4. And the trend from Q3 to Q4, I mean, it's almost a 15% ramp from Q3 to Q4. Same thing we saw with orders really as expected. So Q4 really landed as we had talked about. Amol on tax."", 'Amol Chaubal', ""Derik, great question on tax. So look, I mean, if you trace last few years with us, the tax rate has gone up roughly about 150 to 200 basis points. And bulk of that is really coming from the U.S. R&D capitalization. And as a company, we've sort of taken a position that Section 174 changes have an ongoing effect on our P&L and absent of future legislation, we're not excluding those charges from our non-GAAP P&L, which is different from some of us in the sector, right? But we think those expenses are part of our non-GAAP P&L, and that's the bulk of the change.The other things that are creeping in there is Singapore going from 0% to 5% and Ireland adopting Pillar 2 going to 15%. I think '25, the big one is, will Singapore adopt and in what form and in what offsets they provide when they do adopt that. So that remains to be seen. We're closely watching that. And as that plays out, we will provide more commentary when that happens."", 'Derik De Bruin', ""Great. And one final one, if I may. I would have expect that Wyatt was a great deal, nice fit in. Your leverage is down, I would expect you to potentially restart the buyback program. Could you just sort of talk about what other technologies you could potentially be thinking about in terms of how to augment? It's -- I'm just sort of curious in terms of what your capital deployment outlay is?"", 'Udit Batra', ""So look, I mean Derik, fantastic question. I mean, our goal in bioanalytical characterization is to make it as simple as it is in small molecules. The QA/QC environment for large molecules and cell and gene therapy should become just as simple. And to do that, you need to take some mature -- some high-end technologies simplify them, move them into downstream applications, so they're simple to use. LC is already there. Mass spec with BioAccord has made great strides. Light scattering is ahead of mass spec, so it's going to enter QA/QC sooner. And there are a couple of other technologies like Raman, like cellular analysis that also belong in the QA/QC and the process analytical testing domain. But all of this hinges on having a simple software that the regulators trust like Empower.So our single largest initiative with Wyatt after commercial -- delivering our commercial results is to get wired light scattering software on to Empower. And we will have a beta version of that by the end of the year. And I think that's the primary requirement for QA/QC in large molecules to become like small. So stay tuned, a really exciting area, and we're investing in the future while we're navigating the present really, really carefully."", 'Caspar Tudor', ""Thank you very much. That concludes our Q&A session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Udit to deliver our closing remarks."", 'Udit Batra', ""So thank you, Caspar. Thank you, Amol. Thank you, everyone, for listening. Look, it's -- 2023 has been an unprecedented and challenging year. We've navigated extremely well as you look at our results outside of China, every end market, every geography grew, which is unusual in this environment amongst our peer group as well. And what is even more pleasing is our focus on cost management. So really third 70 basis points of margin expansion in the year, where the top line went down dramatically, is quite an achievement. And we've done that while setting ourselves up very well for the future. We expect the long-term growth of our business to be very much intact and accelerate based on what Amol and I described to you. So thank you again for your interest and your attention."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. That concludes today's conference. You may all disconnect at this time.""]"

The robotic surgery leader ended Fiscal 2023 on a high note, showcasing high revenue growth and expanding margins. Despite Intuitive hitting new all-time highs post-earnings, I believe the stock may have more room to run, moving forward. With the company’s market-leading position providing an ample runway for continued success, I remain bullish on the stock.', 'It’s quite impressive how Intuitive Surgical has managed to maintain such strong investor confidence in its stock. Its most recent results underscored why, showcasing an impressive acceleration in growth. In the fourth quarter, revenues soared by 17%, reaching $1.93 billion. Noteworthy is not only the company’s surpassing of Wall Street estimates by $30 million but also the strong acceleration in growth, outpacing both Q3-2023’s 12% and the previous year’s 6.7%.', 'Intuitive Surgical’s sustained leadership in robotic surgery for over two decades is genuinely intriguing. How they’ve managed to keep growing, even as the industry matures, boils down to a simple factor, in my view: they’ve been riding the rising wave of global adoption in robotic surgery. The robotic surgery industry is still in its early phases, holding immense potential for expansion.', 'Taking a closer look at the industry landscape reveals a clear trend toward the rising popularity of minimally-invasive procedures. Following years of rigorous R&D and continuous improvements, robotic surgery has become quite cost-effective.', 'It makes sense for hospitals to adopt this technology, as they see the potential for boosted surgical revenues and reduced expenses attributed to lower complication rates and shorter hospital stays. At the same time, the demand for more comfortable procedures is growing. Thus, you can see why Intuitive’s performance currently benefits from a strong secular growth tailwind.', 'To add some context to this argument through numbers, in Q4, Intuitive installed 415 da Vinci surgical systems in hospitals compared to 369 last year. This clearly shows the gradually growing demand from hospitals to start offering robotic surgery or expand their capabilities.', 'In fact, Intuitive’s da Vinci surgical system installed base reached 8,606 systems at the end of the quarter, up 14% versus 7,544 at the end of 2022. The combination of a higher installed base and growing patient demand for invasive procedures resulted in worldwide da Vinci procedures growing by about 21% year-over-year, fueling Intuitive’s revenue growth acceleration.', 'With revenue growth accelerating and Intuitive achieving improving unit economies, its profits have started to snowball. I believe that this trend challenges the elevated concerns of some investors, who argue that Intuitive stock could be overvalued. Let’s examine.', 'Intuitive achieved a net income margin of 31.4% in Q4. This is one of the highest reported margins in the medical devices industry I have encountered in my research. It’s also notably higher than the prior quarter’s net income margin of 23.8% and 19.6%, which the company posted in the previous quarter and last year, respectively. It clearly underscores Intuitive’s ongoing margin expansion, which, along with its strong revenue growth, enabled an extraordinary net income increase of 86.5% to $606.2 million.', 'This was Intuitive’s most profitable quarter since its inception, boosting its Fiscal 2023 net income to a new all-time high of $1.8 billion. Interestingly, about $192.1 million of this amount can be attributed to Intuitive’s massive net cash position of $7.34 billion, generating solid interest income due to rising interest rates. This comes bundled with Intuitive essentially having no debt on its balance sheet, highlighting its financial soundness even further.', 'The significance of this lies in its contribution to investors’ willingness to pay a premium for the stock. Intuitive’s remarkable earnings growth, coupled with its clean, cash-rich balance sheet, has prompted many to pursue the stock, pushing its valuation to seemingly hefty levels. Currently trading at about 16x and 59x Fiscal 2024’s projected sales and earnings per share, respectively, it’s evident why some investors view the stock as overvalued.', 'However, I believe that Intuitive’s dominant market position, ongoing acceleration in growth, and the compounding effect on earnings explain these multiples. Even in the scenario of a considerable deceleration in earnings growth, the stock should gradually grow into its valuation. While high expectations imply a thinner margin of safety, Intuitive has historically delivered to high standards.', 'Looking at Wall Street’s sentiment on the stock, Intuitive Surgical features a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 14 Buys and six Holds assigned in the past three months. At $409.56, the\xa0average ISRG stock price target suggests 5.8% upside potential.', 'If you’re not sure which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell ISRG stock, the most accurate analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is\xa0Richard Newitter\xa0from Truist Financial, with an average return of 29.73% per rating and a 93% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.', 'In conclusion, Intuitive Surgical’s stellar Q4 performance reflects its sustained leadership in the rapidly growing field of robotic surgery. With impressive revenue growth, expanding margins, and a solid global adoption trend, the company continues to ride a strong secular growth tailwind.', 'Despite concerns about its high valuation, Intuitive’s snowballing profits and financial soundness present a compelling investment case. As the industry evolves, the company’s dominant market position and ongoing growth acceleration suggest that there might be more room for the stock to flourish in the future.', 'Disclosure']"

The article delves into the promising trajectories of three robotics stocks, each with the potential for a staggering 250% growth by 2025.', 'The first one’s focus on industry verticalization, with 70 tailored solution accelerators, positions it uniquely as a solution provider. On the other hand, the second one showcases robust growth in placements and utilization, coupled with strategic moves like the impending launch of a decisive product. Meanwhile, the third one navigates market challenges with a proactive cost restructuring approach and strategic collaborations, signaling resilience amid declining sales.', 'Read more to explore these three robotics stocks’ innovative strategies and growth prospects, each illuminating a distinct path toward solid growth potential.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: dennizn / Shutterstock.com', 'UiPath’s (NYSE:PATH) focus on industry verticalization as a strategic priority may serve as a vital fundamental. The availability of\xa070 solution\xa0accelerators in the marketplace tailored to specific industries showcases UiPath’s focus on capitalizing on unique challenges faced by organizations in various domains.', 'Fundamentally, this industry-focused approach broadens UiPath’s market reach. Also, it positions the company as a solution provider rather than a one-size-fits-all automation platform. This is particularly crucial in industries with specific regulatory requirements, where a tailored solution can deliver more significant value. The number and popularity of downloads for accelerators such as IT Service Management Software user provisioning and\xa0two-way match\xa0invoice processing for Coupa (NASDAQ:COUP) and SAP (NYSE:SAP) indicate a strong market demand for industry-specific solutions.', 'Furthermore, UiPath’s collaboration with SAP and strategic partnerships with companies like The Arnott’s Group suggests the company’s lead in expanding its reach through synergistic relationships. The strategic integration with SAP enables UiPath to tap into SAP’s customer base and offer complementary automation solutions. Also, the selection of UiPath by The Arnott’s Group (an Australian giant in biscuit and snack food) to optimize business processes and reduce operating costs demonstrates the practical value of UiPath solutions.', 'This opens new revenue streams by enhancing UiPath’s credibility and market positioning. The expanded partnership with Deloitte further strengthens UiPath’s presence in the SAP ecosystem. In detail, Deloitte embeds UiPath’s AI-powered Business Automation Platform into its service delivery platform. At a broader level, UiPath’s FX-adjusted dollar-based net retention rate of\xa0123%\xa0suggests it leads to expanding revenue from existing customers.', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'To begin with the capital front, Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) placed\xa01,313\xa0multi-port systems in 2023, reflecting decisive growth from 2022. Ion placements increased from 192 to 213, and SP placements grew from 23 to 57 for the full year. Placements were strong in the United States and Japan. The use of flexible financing arrangements, especially in the U.S., played a significant role in supporting the expansion of DaVinci system portfolios.', 'In 2023, system utilization (procedures per installed clinical system per quarter) grew globally, reaching a new high for the multi-port platform. Utilization is crucial to patient demand, care team satisfaction, and hospital financial health. At the top line, the revenue marked 14% year-over-year growth.', 'Fundamentally, capital and operating expenses were on the upper end of the\xa0guidance. This reflects continued investments in R&D, expansion of manufacturing and commercial footprints, and capital amortization. Critically, there is demand strength in procedures, growth in the clinical install base, and increased utilization. Hence, this suggests continued preference by customers for Intuitive’s platforms.', 'Looking ahead to 2024, the company has submitted its\xa0510(k)\xa0application for its next-generation multi-port platform, DaVinci 5. The design priorities for DaVinci 5 include bringing better minimally invasive care to more patients. The design may improve platform performance, enhance care team satisfaction, and lower the total treatment cost per patient episode. Thus, the phased launch plan post-Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance suggests the company’s supply and manufacturing readiness.', 'Lastly, conversations with regulators in Japan and Korea have been initiated. This further boosts the company’s top line (based on regulatory outcomes) through progress toward commercialization in countries outside the U.S. This is easily one of the top robotics stocks out there.', 'Source: Michael Vi/ShutterStock.com', 'Zebra (NASDAQ:ZBRA) focuses explicitly on cost restructuring and net annualized savings. The company implemented significant cost restructuring actions in late Q3 and early Q4. These actions are expected to yield net annualized cost savings of\xa0$100 million, surpassing the initial expectation of $85 million. This demonstrates Zebra’s proactive approach to optimizing its cost structure for improved profitability.', 'Despite the overall decline in sales (30% decline), services and software emerged as bright spots in the quarter. The diversification across products and services helps Zebra mitigate the impact of declines in specific product categories. Also, Zebra is reallocating resources to accelerate growth in underpenetrated markets, including Japan, government, and manufacturing sectors.', 'Additionally, there are collaborations with\xa0partners\xa0like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). These are to demonstrate generative AI without cloud connectivity, reflecting Zebra’s focus on staying at the edge. Further, there are multiple wins with global technology providers, large healthcare systems, retail pharmacy chains, and North American retailers. These wins highlight Zebra’s solutions’ continued relevance and importance across various industries.', 'Financially, there was a negative free cash flow of\xa0$193 million\xa0for Q1–Q3 2023. However, the reasons behind this negative cash flow include higher interest costs, restructuring actions, and settlement payments. These issues are temporary and may not impact Zebra’s liquidity in the long term.', 'Finally, the 2.2x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio with the availability of approximately $1 billion of capacity on a revolving credit facility demonstrates Zebra’s financial flexibility. Therefore, these developments may support Zebra’s value growth in the upcoming years.

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?"", ""Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together."", ' View our latest analysis for Royal Caribbean Cruises ', 'The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Royal Caribbean Cruises had debt of US$21.5b at the end of December 2023, a reduction from US$23.0b over a year. On the flip side, it has US$497.0m in cash leading to net debt of about US$21.0b.', 'According to the last reported balance sheet, Royal Caribbean Cruises had liabilities of US$9.40b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$20.8b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$497.0m as well as receivables valued at US$405.0m due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$29.3b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.', ""This deficit is considerable relative to its very significant market capitalization of US$31.1b, so it does suggest shareholders should keep an eye on Royal Caribbean Cruises' use of debt. Should its lenders demand that it shore up the balance sheet, shareholders would likely face severe dilution."", 'We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).', ""While Royal Caribbean Cruises's debt to EBITDA ratio (4.8) suggests that it uses some debt, its interest cover is very weak, at 2.1, suggesting high leverage. So shareholders should probably be aware that interest expenses appear to have really impacted the business lately. One redeeming factor for Royal Caribbean Cruises is that it turned last year's EBIT loss into a gain of US$2.9b, over the last twelve months. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Royal Caribbean Cruises can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts."", ""Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So it is important to check how much of its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) converts to actual free cash flow. Looking at the most recent year, Royal Caribbean Cruises recorded free cash flow of 20% of its EBIT, which is weaker than we'd expect. That weak cash conversion makes it more difficult to handle indebtedness."", ""On the face of it, Royal Caribbean Cruises's net debt to EBITDA left us tentative about the stock, and its interest cover was no more enticing than the one empty restaurant on the busiest night of the year. But at least its EBIT growth rate is not so bad. Overall, it seems to us that Royal Caribbean Cruises's balance sheet is really quite a risk to the business. So we're almost as wary of this stock as a hungry kitten is about falling into its owner's fish pond: once bitten, twice shy, as they say. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. Be aware that  Royal Caribbean Cruises is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those shouldn't be ignored..."", ""If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet."", 'Have feedback on this article?

Today we will analyse the most recent data on Analog Devices’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Analog Devices ', 'According to our valuation model, Analog Devices seems to be fairly priced at around 3.5% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Analog Devices today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $196.51, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Analog Devices’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.', 'Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of Analog Devices, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 3.3%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.', 'Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in ADI’s future outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ADI, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.', ""Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

In 2023, we saw the US really outperform most analysts' expectations on supply growth based on better efficiency, better use of capital, longer laterals."", ""So when we look at 2024, we are, and we're hearing this from the companies, they're expecting supply to continue to grow, but it's at a slower rate. And if the US grew a million barrels of supply last year, they're looking at something like 400,000 to 600,000 barrels of supply growth coming out of the US this year."", ""So that is really a key number. We got burned a little bit last year thinking supply growth would be capped in the US and they were able to kind of pull the rabbit out of the hat and really outperform. And so I think there is an expectation growth will slow down. But if you think about where analysts are looking at crude and looking at that very finely balanced market of 1.3 million barrels a day to 1.6 million barrels a day of demand growth and a very similar amount of non-OPEC supply growth, they're looking at the US as a potential to continue to outperform there."", ""It's really a tricky, tricky market in terms of nailing down those numbers. But I think most analysts are pretty confident that the market is well-supported and crude fundamentally kind of around that $70 a barrel in WTI. But they're very closely watching what's happening in China and what's happening with the US supply growth."", '- So then Rebecca, you mentioned staying in this sort of $70 range. Do you think then oil prices have peaked barring sort of any big movements or as you mentioned, the China factor here?', ""REBECCA BABIN: I actually don't think they've peaked. And here's the thing. Everyone seems to be very focused on these downside risks. US supply growth, China demand, and really kind of taking their eye off the ball of there are a couple of things that could go right for crude this year. We could actually see demand outperform. And if you look at the demand numbers in 2023, they consistently were revised higher from the weekly data that comes out from the EIA."", ""So we could continue to see this kind of worrying yourself into a lower market, but then seeing demand come in stronger. The second thing I'd say is we do have the SPR being refilled, they have been more active this year. There seems to be a commitment to continue to be active. And we have a very disciplined OPEC, which I think will absolutely extend their cuts through the first half of '24 and maybe even throughout the whole year, if they need to."", ""So I actually think the market should be trading closer to 75%, 80%. I think we'll probably see 80% as we get closer to summer when the balance is starting to tighten up and the market is overly kind of worrying themselves on these downside risks on a day in and day out basis.""]"

They can provide you with a recurring source of income that (ideally) rises over time and helps build up your wealth. Three stocks that pay more than double the S&P 500 average yield of 1.5% and that could be great places to invest in right now include Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ), Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), and Realty Income (NYSE: O). If you can afford to invest $33,000, here's how you can spread that out over these three stocks to generate at least $2,000 in annual dividends."", 'Telecom giant Verizon Communications pays an incredibly high yield of 6.4% right now, which is far higher than normal for this top dividend stock. Investing $15,000 into the stock would mean you can expect to collect $970 annually from the dividend Verizon pays.', ""Verizon has also increased its dividend payments for 17 consecutive years, which is the longest streak in the U.S. telecom industry. The company's CEO believes that the stock is a potential substitute for bonds given its reliable dividend income. That suggests that if interest rate cuts happen this year, Verizon's stock could be in high demand as investors potentially pivot from bonds into dividend stocks."", ""Rising interest rates haven't helped Verizon's stock, as it is down 1% in the past 12 months. But what's important is that the payout remains safe. In 2023, the company's free cash flow rose to $18.7 billion versus $14.1 billion a year earlier. While operating revenue was down 2% to $134 billion, the improved cash position suggests that not only is the current yield safe, but also that Verizon's dividend growth steak is likely to continue."", ""Another stock that's paying a higher-than-normal yield is Pfizer. The pharma giant's shares have fallen close to 40% in just the past 12 months. Its dividend yield is slightly lower than Verizon's at 6.2%, but that's still a fairly high payout for investors. If you were to buy $13,000 worth of Pfizer shares, your annual dividend income from that investment could total approximately $792."", ""Pfizer recently boosted its dividend by a penny to $0.42. It has steadily increased its payout since 2010, and the healthcare company has paid a dividend for more than 340 consecutive quarters -- that's a span of more than 85 years."", ""The risk with the stock today is that Pfizer is in the midst of a transition as it moves away from COVID-19 products and focuses on new growth opportunities, which are partly fueled through acquisitions. In 2023, the company's sales were down 42% to $58.5 billion, largely due to a significant decline in COVID vaccinations."", 'Last year, Pfizer closed a mammoth $43 billion acquisition of cancer specialist Seagen, which will be a big part of its long-term turnaround plan.', ""There's some risk with Pfizer due to the uncertainty that lies ahead, but given its track record and ability to innovate and grow over the years, this is still a fairly proven and established company to invest in. Plus, with an estimated forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 12, investors are getting the stock at a good discount."", 'A real estate investment trust (REIT) like Realty Income makes for another promising dividend investment. Like Verizon, it has struggled due to rising interest rates, as its share price is down 22% over the past year. Its yield is around 5.7%, and investing $5,000 in the REIT would mean that you could earn around $286 in dividends over the course of a full year. When combined with the other investments on this list, your annual dividend income would now total at least $2,048.', ""What makes Realty Income attractive is its diversification. The REIT's portfolio isn't heavily exposed to one industry or area of the economy; its tenants are in 85 industries. Its occupancy rate is also just under 99%. Despite what its struggling share price may suggest, Realty Income isn't a highly risky investment to be holding."", ""When the company last released earnings in November, Realty Income's funds from operations, a key metric for REITs, increased by 7% to $1.04 per share for the quarter ending Sept. 30, 2023. And what may sweeten the deal for investors is that unlike most other dividend stocks, Realty Income distributes payments to investors on a monthly basis. Currently it pays nearly $0.26 per share in its monthly dividend."", 'Realty Income can make for a great dividend stock to buy and hold for the long term given both its high yield and its diverse portfolio mix.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Verizon Communications right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Verizon Communications, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Verizon Communications wasn’t one of them.

VZ, a frontrunner in embracing virtualized and open RAN (Radio Access Network) technologies, has propelled the deployment of more than 130,000 O-RAN capable radios, including massive MIMO radios. This significant milestone reinforces Verizon's dedication to fostering O-RAN standards and technology, marking a pivotal shift toward a more open and interoperable network ecosystem.The transition to Open RAN holds the promise of multifaceted benefits, ranging from enhanced deployment flexibility to accelerated innovation within an open environment. By fostering competition and encouraging new entrants, Verizon aims to diversify its supplier base, ultimately translating into superior service options for consumers.Verizon's strategic move toward O-RAN is rooted in its extensive network modernization efforts, which encompass virtualization and orchestration. The deployment of a cloud-native, container-based, virtualized architecture has already led to increased flexibility, scalability and cost efficiency across Verizon's network.Furthermore, Verizon's early adoption of VRAN (Virtualized Radio Access Network) serves as a precursor to O-RAN integration. By virtualizing core network functions and baseband units, Verizon has laid a robust foundation for future deployment flexibility and rapid integration of services.The seamless integration of O-RAN into Verizon's network architecture is poised to revolutionize the telecommunications landscape. This transition not only underscores Verizon's commitment to technological advancement but also positions the company at the forefront of innovation within the industry.With one of the most efficient wireless networks in the United States, Verizon deploys the latest technologies to deliver faster peak data speeds and capacity for customers, driven by customer-focused planning, disciplined engineering and constant strategic investment. The company remains focused on making necessary capital expenditures due to the expansion of 5G mmWave in new and existing markets, the densification of the 4G LTE wireless network to cater to huge traffic demands across multiple verticals and the continued deployment of the fiber infrastructure.Verizon’s 5G mobility service offers an unparalleled experience that impacts industries as diverse as public safety, health care, retail and sports. The company’s 5G network hinges on three fundamental drivers to deliver the full potential of next-generation wireless technology.

But Nvidia's long-term story looks just as bright. Let's discuss the strategies this technology giant can use to maintain its momentum over the next five years and beyond. "", ""Over the last two years, one product type has powered most of Nvidia's growth: AI-capable graphics processing units (GPUs) like the a100 and h100, which help train and run generative AI applications like ChatGPT. Nvidia records sales of these chips under its data center segment, which expanded by an eye-watering 279% year over year to $14.51 billion in the third quarter. However, the company could soon play a bigger role in the software side of the fast-growing AI industry. "", 'According to analysts at IT analytics and investment firm Melius Research, Nvidia could be on the cusp of an ""Apple-like transformation"" as it uses its hardware business as a springboard to expand into software, much like the iconic smartphone maker used its iPhone to drive adoption of iOS and the app store. ', ""Nvidia has developed a supercomputer called DGX Cloud designed to give enterprise clients access to the infrastructure needed to train and run their AI applications on the cloud without the hassle of building their own on-premises system. While this move could bring the company into direct competition with cloud service providers, Nvidia's industry-leading hardware business could create synergies with its software and services. "", ""CEO Jensen Huang waxed poetic about the DGX Cloud service's long-term prospects at the launch in March, 2023."", '""We are at the iPhone moment of AI. Startups are racing to build disruptive products and business models, and incumbents are looking to respond,"" Huang said in a written statement. ""DGX Cloud gives customers instant access to NVIDIA AI supercomputing in global-scale clouds.""', ""Nvidia's biggest customers are American tech giants like Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Alphabet, which typically use its hardware to develop large language models and enterprise services for their cloud computing divisions. But while these companies can buy huge amounts of expensive hardware, they are also developing their own AI chips for internal use to reduce their reliance on third-party suppliers like Nvidia. "", 'The good news is that Nvidia is diversifying its revenue streams. CEO Jason Huang expects a ""second wave"" of AI-related demand as national governments address the need for ""sovereign AI"" to suit their unique characteristics and national security concerns. ', ""Recently, Nvidia inked a partnership with Singtel, the Singaporean state-owned Telecom, which aims to use Nvidia GPUs to bring AI services to companies in the Southeast Asian nation. More importantly, this deal will involve the use of Nvidia's AI software solutions, which could help the company gain market share and compete against traditional cloud service providers."", ""Despite being the sixth most valuable company in the world with a $1.69 trillion market cap, Nvidia's stock is still relatively affordable. While the company's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 33 is slightly higher than the Nasdaq-100 average of 30, this is a small premium to pay for a business growing at a triple-digit rate in an innovation-led industry. "", ""The discount could be a response to Nvidia's overreliance on h100 chip sales. Over the next five years, the company's investments in different sides of the AI opportunity (like software and international expansion) could help diversify its revenue streams and unlock a higher valuation."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

But can Nvidia get close to that mark and hit a stock price of $1,000, which would be a gain of only 47%? And if it can, then how fast? Let's find out."", ""Major technology companies have been lining up to buy Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) to train large language models (LLMs). The company's flagship H100 data center GPU is being scooped up by multiple customers ranging from Meta Platforms to Amazon to Microsoft to Alphabet, creating a shortage of these chips that may take between 36 weeks and 52 weeks to deliver."", 'These tech giants are looking to ramp up their spending on AI hardware, as their latest earnings calls and reports indicate. Meta Platforms, for instance, increased its 2024 capital expenditure forecast by $2 billion to a range of $30 billion to $37 billion. Management pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that the increased investment ""will be driven by investments in servers, including both AI and non-AI hardware.""', ""Meta's 2023 capital expenditure stood at $28 billion. And, there is a good chance that a nice chunk of the increased capex will be directed toward Nvidia's H100 processors, as per CEO Mark Zuckerberg's recent statement."", 'Similarly, Microsoft management also remarked on the latest earnings call that it expects ""capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis, driven by investments in our cloud and AI infrastructure."" Meanwhile, Amazon management also remarked that it sees capital expenditure levels increasing in 2024, ""driven by increased infrastructure capex, support growth of our AWS business, including additional investments in generative AI and large language models.""', ""However, these tech giants aren't the only ones after Nvidia's AI chips. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang remarked in an interview with Bloomberg Television that many countries, such as Japan, Canada, France, and India, are looking to invest in AI infrastructure."", ""Meanwhile, the company is also looking for ways to supply its chips in China and remain on the right side of the U.S. government's restrictions at the same time. The company is reportedly taking preorders for the H20 AI processor and other chips, which have been specially designed for the Chinese market."", ""In all, there are indications that the demand for Nvidia's AI processors could continue to improve in 2024. Not surprisingly, Nvidia has been looking to significantly improve the supply of its flagship processor in 2024, as a result of which it could generate $50 billion in revenue from the sales of this chip this year. That's why it is not surprising to see analysts anticipating a solid jump in Nvidia's revenue in fiscal 2025 (which has just begun)."", ""Analysts are expecting Nvidia's revenue to increase 58% in fiscal 2025 to $93.4 billion. Meanwhile, its earnings are anticipated to jump from $12.30 per share in the previous fiscal year to $20.80 in the current one. The company is expected to sustain its healthy growth in fiscal 2026 as well."", 'Nvidia is currently trading at 37 times sales and 90 times trailing earnings. However, if we assume that it trades at a discounted 25 times sales at the end of fiscal 2026 thanks to its solid top-line growth and achieves $109 billion in revenue, its market cap could increase to $2.72 trillion. That would be a 67% jump from current levels.', ""So, based on Nvidia's current stock price of around $660 and the potential upside that it could deliver on the back of its impressive growth, its shares could be worth $1,000 apiece in the next couple of years. That's why investors should consider buying this AI stock right now, especially considering the cheap forward multiples it is trading at."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

That's a big bump from the prior expectation of $2 billion, clearly indicating that customers are warming up to its new chips."", ""In other words, AMD's quarterly revenue run rate from the data center GPU business could stand at almost $900 million in 2024 as per the $3.5 billion annual revenue forecast from this segment. That's more than double the revenue AMD generated by selling data center GPUs last quarter."", 'However, analysts were expecting AMD to call for $4 billion to $8 billion in AI revenue for 2024, and the company\'s guidance has fallen short of that mark. Savvy investors, however, should note that AMD significantly increased its revenue guidance from AI chip sales in the space of just one quarter. It won\'t be surprising to see the company further raise its AI revenue guidance as the year progresses given that it has ""made significant progress with our supply chain partners and have secured additional capacity to support upside demand.""', 'Nvidia is the leading player in the AI chip market with a market share of more than 80%. AMD, however, is expected to make its presence felt in this market in 2024 and corner between 15% and 25% of the AI chip market.', 'However, there are a couple of factors that could help AMD corner a bigger share of the AI chip space.', ""First, according to a DigiTimes report, AMD could corner a significant portion of foundry partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's advanced packaging capacity so that it can make more AI chips. More specifically, the Taiwanese publication expects that AMD's share of TSMC's advanced packaging capacity could be half of Nvidia's in 2024. If that's indeed the case, AMD could corner a third of TSMC's manufacturing capacity for making AI chips."", ""Second, if AMD does manage to manufacture a sizable number of AI chips this year, it could fill the supply gap in this market. That's because Nvidia's AI processors reportedly command a waiting period of nine to 12 months. Given the robust specs of AMD's flagship MI300X processor and its ability to provide stiff competition to its Nvidia counterpart, consumers looking to get their hands on fast AI hardware could turn to AMD."", ""Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri estimates that AMD could ship somewhere between 250,000 and 500,000 units of its MI300 Instinct data center chips this year. AMD hasn't revealed the price point of its latest AI chips, but there is a good chance that it has priced them competitively to win share from Nvidia, whose flagship H100 processor is reportedly priced between $25,000 and $40,000 depending on the configuration."", ""Assuming AMD prices its AI processors at $25,000 -- the lower end of the H100's price range -- and sells 250,000 units this year (based on Raymond James' estimate), it could generate $6.25 billion in revenue from this market. The higher end of Raymond James' shipment estimate indicates that AMD's data center GPU revenue could land at $12.5 billion."", 'So, there is a good chance that AMD may have played it safe while issuing its AI-related revenue guidance for the year. As the company gets its hands on more supply and receives greater customer commitments to deploy its AI processors, it could continue raising its AI revenue guidance as the year progresses.', ""So, savvy investors would do well to look past AMD's latest results since its fast-growing AI chip business is anticipated to lead to robust growth in 2024 and beyond. This is evident from the following chart:"", ""It is worth noting that AMD's annual revenue was down 4% in 2023 to $22.7 billion. Of that, only around $400 million came from sales of AI chips. So, there is a good chance that AMD may be able to grow at a faster pace than Wall Street's expectations this year considering the significant jump in AI revenue, and that could help this tech stock sustain its rally in the long run."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Against such a backdrop, investors are increasingly exploring strategies that will help them to protect their portfolios from downside risk. Nothing seems better than the strategy of dividend investing.Picking stocks with a history of dividend growth leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Installed Building Products Inc. IBP, PACCAR Inc. PCAR, McKesson Corporation MCK, Republic Services Inc. RSG and PulteGroup Inc. PHM — that could be solid choices amid market volatility.', 'Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just nine.Here are five of the nine stocks that fit the bill:Ohio-based Installed Building Products operates as a residential insulation installer in the United States.

(NYSE:APD), which a week ago released some disappointing first-quarter results that could have a notable impact on how the market views the stock. Air Products and Chemicals missed analyst forecasts, with revenues of US$3.0b and statutory earnings per share (EPS) of US$2.73, falling short by 6.6% and 7.6% respectively. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on Air Products and Chemicals after the latest results."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals ', 'After the latest results, the 21 analysts covering Air Products and Chemicals are now predicting revenues of US$12.9b in 2024. If met, this would reflect a reasonable 3.7% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to expand 20% to US$12.55. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$13.4b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$13.01 in 2024. The analysts are less bullish than they were before these results, given the reduced revenue forecasts and the small dip in earnings per share expectations.', ""The consensus price target fell 7.5% to US$286, with the weaker earnings outlook clearly leading valuation estimates. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. The most optimistic Air Products and Chemicals analyst has a price target of US$355 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$240. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await Air Products and Chemicals shareholders."", ""These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Air Products and Chemicals' past performance and to peers in the same industry. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Air Products and Chemicals' revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2024 expected to display 4.9% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 9.7% over the past five years. Juxtapose this against the other companies in the industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenues (in aggregate) 3.3% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while Air Products and Chemicals' revenue growth is expected to slow, it's still expected to grow faster than the industry itself."", ""The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. Regrettably, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, but the latest forecasts still imply the business will grow faster than the wider industry. The consensus price target fell measurably, with the analysts seemingly not reassured by the latest results, leading to a lower estimate of Air Products and Chemicals' future valuation."", ""With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year.

The company, known for its robust portfolio including Fox News, FOX broadcast network, and a suite of sports and entertainment assets, faced a challenging quarter with a noticeable decline in revenue and earnings compared to the same period last year.', ""Fox Corp (NASDAQ:FOXA) reported a total quarterly revenue of $4.23 billion, a decrease from the $4.61 billion reported in the prior year quarter. The dip in revenue was primarily due to a 20% decrease in advertising revenues, which was attributed to the absence of the FIFA Men's World Cup, lower political advertising revenues, and other market challenges. Despite this, affiliate fee revenues saw a 4% increase, driven by growth in the Television segment."", ""The company's net income for the quarter stood at $115 million, down from $321 million reported in the prior year quarter, with earnings per share (EPS) falling from $0.58 to $0.23. Adjusted net income attributable to Fox Corporation stockholders was $165 million ($0.34 per share), compared to $259 million ($0.48 per share) in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA also saw a reduction, coming in at $350 million compared to $531 million reported in the prior year quarter."", ""The Television segment's affiliate fee revenues increased by 10%, led by higher rates at the company's owned and operated stations and third-party FOX affiliates. However, the segment reported a quarterly EBITDA loss of $138 million, compared to an EBITDA contribution of $256 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to the aforementioned revenue impacts."", ""Cable Network Programming reported a slight increase in segment revenues, rising to $1.66 billion, with affiliate fee revenues increasing marginally. The segment's EBITDA improved significantly, reaching $564 million, a 60% increase from the prior year quarter, mainly due to lower sports programming rights amortization and production costs."", 'Despite the financial headwinds, Fox Corp (NASDAQ:FOXA) declared a dividend of $0.26 per Class A and Class B share and continued its share repurchase program, with approximately $5.1 billion of its Class A and Class B common stock repurchased to date.', 'Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer Lachlan Murdoch commented on the results, stating, ""At the halfway point in our fiscal year, our results demonstrate the strength and durability of our core brands and their ability to deliver solid audiences across our portfolio. FOX Sports continues to benefit from the power of live sports programming and FOX News has maintained its leadership in cable news, while Tubi has been resilient in an increasingly competitive market. Combining this steadfast portfolio of assets with a best-in-class balance sheet underpins our ability to deliver value for our shareholders.""', ""The company's balance sheet remains robust, with a strong cash position and a disciplined approach to capital allocation.

The company's focus on live sports and news, coupled with its digital expansion through platforms like Tubi, positions it to potentially rebound in future quarters."", 'Explore the complete 8-K earnings release (here) from Fox Corp for further details.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

As a result, many broadcasting companies have evolved by forming distribution agreements with major streaming platforms so they can get in on part of the action, but will these subscription revenues be as high quality and high margin as their legacy revenues? Only time will tell which of these broadcasters will survive the sea changes of technological advancement and fragmenting consumer attention.', ""A company's long-term performance can indicate its business quality. Any business can enjoy short-lived success, but best-in-class ones sustain growth over many years. FOX's annualized revenue growth rate of 5.8% over the last 5 years was weak for a consumer discretionary business."", ""Within consumer discretionary, product cycles are short and revenue can be hit-driven due to rapidly changing trends. That's why we also follow short-term performance. FOX's recent history shows the business has slowed, as its annualized revenue growth of 3.5% over the last 2 years is below its 5-year trend."", ""We can dig even further into the company's revenue dynamics by analyzing its most important segments, Cable Network Programming and Television, which are 39.2% and 60% of revenue. Over the last 2 years, FOX's Cable Network Programming revenue (licensing, retransmission, advertising) was flat while its Television revenue (advertising) averaged 7.3% year-on-year growth."", ""This quarter, FOX reported a rather uninspiring 8.1% year-on-year revenue decline to $4.23 billion of revenue, in line with Wall Street's estimates. Looking ahead, Wall Street expects revenue to remain flat over the next 12 months."", 'Here at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing.

The company's free cash flow margin has averaged 12%, slightly better than the broader consumer discretionary sector."", ""FOX burned through $615 million of cash in Q2, equivalent to a negative 14.5% margin, in line with its cash burn last year. Over the next year, analysts predict FOX's cash profitability will improve. Their consensus estimates imply its LTM free cash flow margin of 8.1% will increase to 11.6%."", ""We were impressed by how significantly FOX blew past analysts' EBITDA and EPS estimates this quarter. Its revenue, although down year on year, also slightly beat thanks to better-than-expected affiliate (retransmission fee) and advertising revenue. Revenue was down this quarter because of the absence of FIFA Men's World Cup games. This headwind, however, was partially offset by its renewed NFL contract. Overall, this quarter's results seemed fairly positive and shareholders should feel optimistic. The stock is up 5% after reporting and currently trades at $33.2 per share."", ""So should you invest in FOX right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free."", 'One way to find opportunities in the market is to watch for generational shifts in the economy.

With that out of the way, I'll turn you over to our Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey, to kick us off."", 'Jennifer W. Rumsey', ""Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a summary of 2023 and discuss our fourth quarter and full year results, and then I'll finish with the discussion of our outlook for 2024. Mark will then take you through more details of our fourth quarter and full year financial performance and our forecast for this year. As I reflect back on 2023, I am incredibly proud of what Cummins and our employees accomplished for our stakeholders, and I feel energized about the opportunities ahead for us as we continue to demonstrate our relentless focus on being a global leader in clean energy technology and innovation. We made significant progress in achieving our Destination Zero strategy, and it continues to be clear that this dual-path approach to reducing greenhouse gas and air quality impacts of our products is the right approach to meet our customers' needs today and continue to grow our business and impact. We did this by advancing our core business as well as developing new 0 emission solutions through Accelera by Cummins. Most notably for our Power business in 2023, we committed to investing more than $1 billion across our U.S. engine manufacturing network to support the industry's first fuel-agnostic engine platforms as well as unveiled the X10 fuel-agnostic series launching in North America in 2026. Additionally, we initiated several collaborations with our natural gas X15 engine, which will launch in North America this year and further enables our customers to achieve their decarbonization goals. This is the industry's first natural gas engine design specifically for heavy-duty and on-highway truck applications, offering customers the opportunity to realize reductions in nitrous oxides and greenhouse gas without compromising performance. We are continuing to see strong interest from both OEMs and end users ahead of the launch later this year. In our Accelera business, we announced a joint venture with Daimler Trucks and Buses, PACCAR and EV Energy to accelerate and localize battery cell production in the battery supply chain in the U.S. We further announced this quarter the selection of Marshall County, Mississippi for the 21-gigawatt hour factory that is expected to create more than 2,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs with production anticipated to begin in 2027. Accelera also reached a further milestone this year of electrolyzer order backlog totaling over $500 million. In order to meet the growing electrolyzer demand, we began production at our first U.S. manufacturing location for electrolyzers in principle to resolve U.S. regulatory claims regarding our mission certification and compliance process for certain engines primarily used in our pickup truck applications. After 4.5 years of working diligently with the regulators, reaching an agreement was the best way for us to achieve certainty on this matter and move forward with certifying our new products and advancing our Destination Zero strategy. We have expanded and strengthened our emissions compliance program to help ensure our products comply with increasingly stringent emissions regulations around the world. Our Product Compliance and Regulatory Affairs organization, which we launched in 2019, has a reporting line directly to me and positions come us to meet global product compliance requirements and deliver solutions for our customers that are safe and lead to a cleaner environment. Now I will comment on the overall company performance for the fourth quarter of 2023 and cover some of our key markets. Demand for our products remain strong across many of our key markets and regions. Revenues for this quarter totaled $8.5 billion, an increase of 10% compared to 2022, driven by strong demand across most global markets. EBITDA was a loss of $878 million or negative 10.3% compared to positive $1.1 billion or 14.2% a year ago. Fourth quarter 2023 results included $2.04 billion of costs related to the agreement to resolve U.S. regulatory claims, $42 million of costs related to a voluntary retirement and separation programs, and $33 million of costs related to the separation of the Atmus business. This compares to the fourth quarter 2022 results, which included $19 million of costs related to the separation of the Atmus business. Excluding those items, EBITDA was $1.2 billion or 14.4% of sales compared to $1.1 billion or 14.5%. EBITDA dollars increased from a year ago as increased pricing and higher volumes more than offset increased selling, administrative research and development expenses and inflation costs. Research and development expense increased in the fourth quarter as we continue to invest in the products and technologies that will create advantages in the future, particularly in the Engine, Components and Accelera segments. In addition, operating cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2023 was very strong at $1.5 billion, compared to $817 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 as we continue to focus on working capital management within the business. 2023 revenues were a record $34.1 billion, 21% higher than 2022, driven by the addition of Meritor and strong demand across most global markets. EBITDA was $3 billion or 8.9% of sales compared to $3.8 billion or 13.5% of sales in 2022. 2023 results include $2.04 billion of costs related to the agreement to resolve U.S. regulatory claims, the voluntary headcount reduction program I noted previously and $100 million of costs related to the separation of the Filtration business. This compares to our 2022 results, which included $111 million of costs related to the indefinite suspension of operations in Russia and $81 million of costs related to the separation of the Filtration business. Excluding those items, EBITDA was a record $5.2 billion or 15.3% of sales for 2023, compared to $4 billion or 14.2% of sales for 2022 as the benefits of higher volume and pricing exceeded, increased selling and administrative, research and development and inflation costs. EBITDA percent improved year-over-year in the Distribution, Components and Power Systems segment. Our Power Systems business, in particular, finished 2023 with a full year EBITDA of 14.7% of sales, up from 12.2% in 2022. This segment completed the first year of their focused business transformation effort, and the improvement in performance is encouraging. You will see from our guidance that we expect further margin gains this year. In addition to our segments, Meritor finished 2023 with full year EBITDA of 10.8% of sales, up from 7.4% in 2022 as our employees did a tremendous job of executing value capture opportunities across the business. I'm very pleased with the performance of Cummins Meritor to date as we continue our program to improve margins in that business and expand its global reach. In addition, operating cash flow for 2023 was a record of $4 billion, a significant increase from $2 billion in 2022. I'm proud of our leaders and employees' efforts in 2023 as they help deliver on one of our primary focus areas. Strong cash generation will continue to be a top priority moving forward. Now let me provide our overall outlook for 2024 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. Our 2024 guidance continues to include Atmus for the full year, but excludes any cost or benefits associated with the planned separation of that business. We are forecasting total company revenue for 2024 to be down 2% to 5% compared to 2023, and EBITDA to be in the range of 14.4% to 15.4% of sales as we anticipate slowing demand in some of our key regions and markets, particularly North America heavy-duty truck. Early in 2024, we expect the heavy-duty market to continue at its current rate, which is slightly off the peak of the first half of 2023 with further softening in our forecast in the second half of the year. Industry production for heavy-duty trucks in North America is projected to be 245,000 to 265,000 units in 2024, a 10% to 15% decline year-over-year. In medium-duty truck market, we expect market size to be 140,000 to 150,000 units, down 5% to flat compared to 2023. Our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 135,000 to 145,000 units in 2024, a 5% to 10% decline year-over-year as we prepare to launch our model year 2025 in the fourth quarter. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 3% in 2024. We're projecting a range of down 5% to up 10% in heavy-duty and medium-duty truck demand and expect a range of down 5% to up 5% and demand in light-duty truck market. We expect replacement demand to be the biggest driver, but the effect may be weakened by a sluggish economy and moderating export demand. Despite the slow pace of recovery in the China truck market, we expect to see continued strong performance for the 15-liter natural gas engine as we achieved approximately 20% share for 2023 in the heavy-duty market. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures to increase 9% in 2024, primarily driven by strong power generation and on-highway demand. We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. For global construction, we expect a 5% to 15% decline year-over-year, primarily driven by weak property investment and shrinking export demand in China. We project our major global high horsepower markets to remain strong in 2024. Revenues in the global power generation market are expected to increase 5% to 10% driven by continued increases in the data center, and mission-critical markets. Sales and mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%. While a small market for us, demand for oil and gas engines is expected to decrease by 40% to 50% in 2024, primarily driven by decreased demand in North America. And for aftermarket, we expect the range of flat to an increase of 5% for 2024, as we expect to be largely through inventory management efforts and destocking that happened throughout the industry in the second half of 2023. In Accelera, we expect full year sales to be $450 million to $500 million compared to the $354 million in 2023. We have a growing pipeline of electrolyzer orders, which we expect to deliver over the course of the next 12 to 18 months as well as expect continued growth in electrified components. In summary, 2023 was a record year for revenues and operating cash flow. Excluding the impacts related to the agreement to resolve U.S. regulatory claims, 2023 was also a record year for EBITDA, net income and earnings per share. While 2023 revenues were at the high end of our expectations, we anticipate moderating demand in North America truck production in the second half of 2024. We expect this moderating demand to be partially offset by a strong power generation market, resiliency in our Distribution business, given the strong aftermarket presence and improved Accelera sales. In addition, we are taking steps to reduce cost, optimize our business and position Cummins for continued success in 2024. We are in a strong position to keep investing in the future, bringing new technologies to customers and returning cash to our investors. As I close, I would like to officially announce that our Analyst Day is now scheduled for May 16 in New York City. I look forward to further discussing our strategy and expect invitations to be sent out shortly. Now let me turn it over to Mark, who will discuss our financial results in more detail. Mark?"", 'Mark A. Smith', ""Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. I will acknowledge I've a heavy cold this morning. So if I sound more dour than usual and a little rougher, please take that into consideration. We delivered solid operational results in the fourth quarter, exceeding our expectations for revenue and delivering EBITDA margins in line with our guidance. Compared to 2022, our full year sales grew 21% and our operating cash flow more than doubled to a record $4 billion, reflecting the strong focus of our employees on meeting customer demand and improving working capital.Now let me go into more details on the fourth quarter and full year performance. Q4 revenues were $8.5 billion, and EBITDA was a net loss of $878 million or negative 10.3% of sales. For the full year, we reported revenues of a record $34.1 billion, and EBITDA was $3 billion or 8.9% of sales. As Jen mentioned, we recorded a onetime charge of $2.04 billion in Q4 to settle the previously disclosed U.S. regulatory claims. Fourth quarter results also included $42 million of costs associated with the voluntary retirement and separation programs. Costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus were $33 million in the fourth quarter and $100 million for the full year, compared to $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and a total of $81 million in the previous year. Full year 2022 results also included $111 million of costs related to the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. To provide clarity on the fourth quarter and 2023 full year operational performance of our business and now excluding the costs associated with the regulatory settlement, voluntary retirement separation programs, planned separation of Atmus and the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia in my following comments. Q4 revenues were $8.5 billion, an increase of 10% from a year ago. Sales in North America increased 8% driven by improved pricing across multiple end markets and stronger demand for power generation products. International revenues increased 13%, driven by strong global power gen demand, particularly for data centers. EBITDA was $1.2 billion or 14.4% of sales for the quarter compared to $1.1 billion or 14.5% of sales a year ago. Improved pricing was offset by higher compensation costs, increased investment in development and capabilities now in Accelera segment. Higher variable compensation costs were driven primarily by stronger operating cash flow, which exceeded our expectations for the quarter and the full year. Now I'll go into each line item with a little bit more detail. Gross margin was $2 billion or 23.7% of sales, an increase of $201 million or 30 basis points from the prior year. The improved margins were driven by favorable pricing and higher volumes, partially offset by higher product coverage costs and compensation expenses. Selling, admin and research expenses increased by $154 million or 15% as we continue to invest in the development, new products that will drive future growth and also due to higher variable compensation costs. Joint venture income increased $25 million due to slowly recovering demand in China from a low base in 2022. Other income was $50 million, an increase of $17 million from a year ago, primarily due to the recovery of technology fees from customers in the fourth quarter. Interest expense was $92 million, an increase of $5 million from the prior year, driven by higher interest rates on the floating rate portion in our debt. The all-in effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was negative 13.3%, principally due to nondeductible costs associated with the regulatory settlement. All-in net loss for the quarter was $1.4 billion or negative $10.01 per diluted share, which includes $2.04 billion or $13.76 per diluted share of costs associated with the regulatory settlement, $42 million or $0.22 per diluted share of costs associated with the voluntary retirement and separation programs and $33 million or $0.17 per diluted share of costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus. Operating cash flow was an inflow of $1.5 billion, $642 million higher than the fourth quarter last year, driven by strong earnings and a lower expansion of our working capital across the business. For the full year 2023, revenues were a record $34.1 billion, up 21% or $6 billion from a year ago, driven by the inclusion of a full year of Meritor results and strong organic growth. Sales in North America increased 22% and international sales increased 20%. Within those numbers, organic sales growth was 12%, driven by improved pricing, strong global demand for power generation products, continued strength in the North American truck market and slowly improving economic conditions in China. EBITDA for the year was $5.2 billion or 15.3% of sales for 2023, an increase of $1.2 billion or 110 basis points from the prior year. The increase in EBITDA percent was driven by higher volumes, favorable pricing and logistics costs and a modest-to-favorable mark-to-market impact from investments that underpin our company-owned life insurance plans, all of that partially offset by higher compensation expenses. All-in net earnings were $735 million or $5.15 per diluted share compared to $2.2 billion or $15.12 per diluted share a year ago. 2023 net earnings include $2.04 billion or $13.78 per diluted share of costs related to the regulatory settlement, $100 million or $0.54 per diluted share of costs related to the separation of Atmus, $42 million or $0.22 per diluted share of costs related to the voluntary separation programs that we implemented during the fourth quarter. Full year cash from operations was a record inflow of $4 billion, doubling from a year ago as a result of higher operating income and much lower expansion of working capital across the company. Capital expenditures in 2023 were $1.2 billion, in line with our forecast and an increase of $297 million from 2022, as we continue to invest in the new products and capabilities to drive growth, particularly related to the fuel-agnostic platforms within our core business. Our long-term goal is to deliver at least 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders. And over the past 5 years, we've returned 56% of operating cash flow in the form of share repurchases and dividends. If we -- all-in -- I jumped on Page 2, sorry about that. I've gone the wrong way. That can happen some times. In 2023, we focused our capital allocation on organic investments and dividend growth, returning $921 million to shareholders via the dividend and debt reduction following the acquisition of Meritor. We currently expect that our priorities for cash deployment in 2024 will mirror those of last year. I'll now summarize the 2023 results for the operating segments and provide guidance for 2024. If I need to say it again, I will that the results that I'm going to discuss going forward exclude the costs related to the separation of Atmus, the costs associated with the voluntary retirement and separation and the costs associated with the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia in 2022. Components segment record revenues were a record $13.4 billion, 38% higher than the prior year. EBITDA was 14.4% of sales compared to 14.2%, an increase of $540 million or 40%. For 2024, we expect total revenue for the Components business to decrease 2% to 7% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 13.9% to 14.9%. For the Engine segment, 2023 revenues increased 7% to a record $11.7 billion, and EBITDA was 14.1% of sales compared to 14.3% a year ago. In dollar terms, EBITDA increased $74 million or 5%. In 2024, we project revenues for the Engine business will decrease 2% to 7%, due to expected moderation in the North American truck -- heavy-duty truck market, most likely in the second half or most prominently in the second half of the year. 2024 EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5%. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 15% from a year ago to a record $10.2 billion. The EBITDA increased by 28%, and improved as a percent of sales to 11.8% compared to 10.6% a year ago. We expect Distribution revenues to be down -- between down 3% and up 2% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 11.4% to 12.4% for the full year. In the Power Systems segment, revenues were also a record of $5.7 billion or 13% higher than last year. EBITDA was 14.7% or 250 basis points higher than 2022, driven by favorable pricing, strong volume and certain cost reduction actions. In 2024, we expect Power Systems revenues to be down 3% to up 2%, and EBITDA in the range of 15.2% to 16.2%. Accelera revenues increased to $354 million in 2023 with a net loss at the EBITDA level of $443 million. In 2024, we expect -- Accelera -- we anticipate that Accelera revenues will increase in the range of $450 million to $500 million and net losses to reduce to between $400 million and $430 million as we continue to make targeted investments in future technologies whilst improving the operating performance of our current products. We currently project 2024 company revenues to be down 2% to 5%, and company EBITDA margins in the range of 14.4% to 15.4%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% in '24, excluding any discrete items. Capital investments will likely be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion as we continue to make critical investments to support future growth. To summarize, we delivered record sales and strong operating profits in 2023. Cash generation has been and will continue to be a strong focus as we enter 2024, enabling us to continue investing in new products even during terms of economic uncertainty, returning cash to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. As Jen indicated, we do expect moderation in several of our key markets in 2024, especially in the U.S. truck market as reflected in our guidance. We've already taken actions to reduce costs in the business and in a good situation to navigate the economic cycle, improve our cycle-over-cycle performance in 2024. Subject to our mark-to-market conditions, our intention is to split off the remaining ownership in Atmus through an exchange offer as our next step in the separation as we seek to reposition our portfolio for the future. As per part of the proposed exchange offer, Cummins' shareholders will have the choice to exchange all, some or none of their shares of common stock for shares of Atmus common stock, subject to the terms of the offer. The exact timing of our decision to launch an exchange offer will, as stated earlier, depend on market conditions, but the launch of the tender could occur as early as in the coming days. Our guidance for Cummins for this year assumes the inclusion of Atmus now consolidated results for the entirety of 2024 and exclude any costs or benefits of the separation. The benefits to Cummins are expected to include a lower number of shares outstanding upon completion of the exchange. We will update our guidance as and when the separation is completed. Thank you for your interest today. Now let me turn it back over to Chris."", 'Christopher C. Clulow', ""Thank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have an additional question, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we're ready for our first question."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.', 'Jerry David Revich', ""Jennifer, Mark, Chris, so normally, when you folks have new engine regulations, we tend to see higher margins from you folks. I know we're a couple of years out from the '27 regulations, but can you just share some high-level thoughts? It looks like the average selling price of engine could double given the embedded warranty increase. And I'm wondering if you could just comment on that and then broadly just talk about the parameters of how do you expect the dynamic to play out for your business compared to the margin expansion we've seen on prior emission cycles where you folks have increased your value add."", 'Jennifer W. Rumsey', ""Yes. Thanks for the question, Jerry. So as you've seen from us in the past, as we launch product with new emissions regulations, typically, we see a content increase, of course. And then also look at creating value for our customers and have an opportunity to price accordingly with them. So we are looking to continue to do that as we launch new products, in particular, these fuel-agnostic engine platforms. Of course, we also typically see a bump up in our warranty costs because we are speaking to accrue at a high rate until we've demonstrated capability of that platform. So that's the other factor to watch as we launch those products. But what you see us doing right now is really focusing on improving operating performance of the business as well as investing in these key platforms for the future that we believe will bring value to our customers and position the company for profitable growth."", 'Jerry David Revich', 'Okay. Super. And then can I ask separately, given the high logistics costs that the industry saw in 2023, can you comment on where your labor hours per unit stand today versus normal? And to what extent could that be a source of upside relative to the guide?', 'Christopher C. Clulow', ""Yes, Jerry, I think that has been -- as we've progressed through 2023, continue to drive more and more efficiency. Some of the supply chain hiccups that we have experienced are beginning to iron out. We're getting better on time to delivery. And that does allow us to drive more efficiency in our plans. So I think we're continuing to see that as we progress through the latter half of the year. As we expect, as both Jen and Mark mentioned, volumes to -- particularly in the North America heavy-duty truck space come down a bit and moderate a bit, we can continue to drive those efficiencies. So I think the cost per labor hour will continue to get better. And I would say the overall cost on labor have somewhat leveled out. We went through, as you know, a long period of them rising. And through the course of the last 6 months, that has settled down and become much more of a flat."", 'Mark A. Smith', ""Yes, I would say in the near term, there's a little bit of increased anxiety about events in the Middle East and some shipping delays and some reversing of the trend we've seen in the logistics costs, which have been actually going down for us, Jerry. I don't want to overstate that. It's obviously -- it's a little bit of a concern in the near term."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Tim Thein with Citigroup.', 'Timothy W. Thein', 'And maybe just one, a bit of a clarification. But on the comments on -- for engine shipments in North America for on-highway, Mark, you said -- call it, 140,000, down 5% to 10%. Is that -- was that relative to the total heavy and medium-duty market? Or was that a comment just on heavy-duty in terms of...', 'Christopher C. Clulow', ""So on the medium -- yes, on the medium-duty, Tim, we had a down 5% to flat, and that's 140,000 to 150,000. The heavy-duty market, we have been down at 10% to 15%, and that's our guide for the year. So..."", 'Jennifer W. Rumsey', ""And I'll just give a little color. I mean this has been an unusual cycle. I think you're all seeing that with very high usage of trucks in the '21, '22 time frame and supply constraints that prevented the industry from fully meeting customer demand and that has improved over the course of 2023. We saw the markets peak really in the second quarter and saw some slight dropoff in the second half, but to the high end of our guide, it was not as much as we had forecast going into Q1. Backlogs look strong, in particular, feeling quite good about the medium-duty market and continuing to watch what happens. We are still predicting a shallow cycle and further softening as we go into the second half of the year. So that -- just some color behind those numbers is how I would describe that."", 'Timothy W. Thein', ""Okay. I had a question on kind of what that implied in terms of the market share, but I can follow up with Chris after. And then maybe the second one is just on the implied decrementals for the Engine segment in '24. And obviously, the -- you got kind of a high 30s percent number. The JV income will certainly be a drag on that. But maybe not to go through every single piece, but the Parts headwind was pronounced in '23 for Cummins. And I'm just curious, for that piece specifically, you outlined the guidance for the off-highway parts outlook. But for that and anything else that maybe you'd call out that's relevant to the year-over-year margin performance for Engines."", 'Mark A. Smith', ""Good question, Tim. And the main thing that you didn't cover there was just our assumptions around product coverage. We're not expecting any significant change, but baked into our guidance is a little bit higher product coverage or warranty as a percent of sales in the Engine business. We'll see how that plays out, but that's the other factor that's in there that you didn't list."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from David Raso with Evercore ISI.', 'David Michael Raso', ""Just sort of a bigger-picture question. I know there's been a lot of costs involved and you're right in the course of a, call it, a decade-long energy transition that there's a lot of expenses. I'm just curious, if you look out over the next year or 2, is there an inflection point that you see your cost begin to recede? And if not, is there a thought of maybe a larger cost out program? I recognize the separation program you discussed. But just something maybe more substantial size just given relative to other names we look at, they've had a real strong run on profitability in the last couple of years, and it's been a little more of a challenge for your margins. So just curious if you see something on the horizon that really changes that, be it cost inflection or maybe an idea of -- you've proactively -- I mean our spend inflection coming down or something on the cost side that maybe you can do?"", 'Jennifer W. Rumsey', ""Yes, David, thanks for the question. First, I'll say, I think you said decade-long energy transition, I would just put an S on that, decades long, right? It's going to take time. The reality is if you look across the different markets and regions, it's going to take time for that transition to occur. We are in a period though of really peak investment in the Engine business as we invest in these fuel-agnostic Engine platforms, we've got a major investment in R&D and capital to do that. And we think that those engines are going to really position us well with high-efficiency diesel products as customers have and continue to decide not to invest in their own platforms and to use Cummins. And then also the fuel flexibility that will help customers as they begin to transition, whether it's natural gas or hydrogen-based engine solutions. And so the next few years until we launch those platforms in the '26, '27 time frame, we're seeing higher levels of R&D in those products. And then of course, we're also in a period where we've got somewhat lower revenue and higher investments in the Accelera business. And we are pacing that investment based on how we see the market moving. We're looking at opportunities to share investments while having a leading solution like you saw us do with the battery cell joint venture. As revenues grow, we improve parts of those businesses and electrified components. We've now delivered 1,500 buses with Blue Bird and ramping up the electrolyzer that will help improve margin performance of the business there. And then the last thing I'd say is, as Cummins has done and we will continue to do, we're looking at how do we improve different parts of our business. And so following the acquisition of the North America Distribution business, we had a focused investment on improving margin there, and you see that playing out in the Distribution business performance. I talked about the focus last year that started in our Power Systems business. You see that playing out there. The Meritor integration, and we're continuing to look at places that we can improve operating performance of our business and then watch market demands and cost. And so the voluntary reduction actions that we took last year help us as we see some reduction in revenue this year. So all those things come together to allow us to continue to improve our returns to our investors, while making sure we're investing in key products and technologies for the future."", 'David Michael Raso', ""All right. And just if I'll be real quick and I'll hop off, the cadence of the declines in North America truck that you're looking to experience as the year goes on, can you give us a little sense of the cadence, maybe from an industry perspective and would your declines, the cadence be any different? Just the idea of the lead lag between what's an inventory, how early you shipped? Just trying to get a sense for the cadence and how you relate to the industry cadence."", 'Jennifer W. Rumsey', ""Yes. Great. So obviously, there's some lead that we have in supplying engines into truck build. So our engine build rates will slightly lead truck build rates. But as I said earlier, from a guide perspective, we think where we were running as we ended the year is going to hold pretty steady through the first part of the year, and then we're forecasting some softening toward the end of second quarter and into the second half of the year."", 'Mark A. Smith', ""In a medium-duty truck, there really isn't that much difference between the two, market and hours. And then heavy-duty, that's where we see a little bit more vulnerability for the market and would largely expect us to move in line with the market."", 'Jennifer W. Rumsey', ""And then the last dynamic is in pickup. We've got the product changeover that will drive Q4 volumes lower in pickup."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Angel Castillo with Morgan Stanley.', 'Angel Castillo', ""I just wanted to unpack that cadence for the second half a little bit more. I think last quarter, you had indicated aftermarket was an area that maybe was giving you a bit of a signal that there was a bit of a softening. I think you indicated that things came in at maybe the higher end of your expectations, and you kind of see that continuing into the first half. So as we kind of position that second half slowdown and now an expectation for aftermarket to actually pick up from kind of flat to up 5% through the year, can you tell us, I guess, what you're seeing in terms of customer commentary and any kind of signs or what kind of gives you confidence in that second half slowdown as we think about the year?"", 'Mark A. Smith', ""Yes. I'll have a go -- first go with that question. First of all, I'd just say on aftermarket, we saw a very pronounced -- I would say, some element of destocking or lower production across our lower demand in Parts in Q4, which we largely attribute to customer cash flow management. We don't expect that to be a continuing trend. We expect to recover from Q4 levels on Parts and be pretty steady across the year. On the truck builds, well, of course, you've heard from most of our major customers, so we really don't have much more to say other than the backlog of trucks has been slowly edging down. And then the thing that gives us the broader concern is the spot rates and the health of the truck fleet operators. That's our principal concern. It's not our OEM customers. And right now, the backlog and the orders still continue at quite decent levels. It's what's happening to the underlying economics of freight activity, that's what's giving us the concern combined, which hasn't been moving in the right direction, combined with the slowly easing heavy-duty backlog. So it isn't kind of pronounced downturn we might have seen in prior cycles at this point, but that's -- those are the factors that are weighing into our consideration. And I think our guidance isn't more conservative than anybody else's, and we don't have any other observations beyond those, really."", 'Angel Castillo', ""Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe pivoting to Accelera. I just wanted to maybe unpack that a little bit in terms of -- curious what you're seeing in the backlog trends from 3Q to 4Q? And as you kind of deliver on at least electrolyzers over the next 12 to 18 months, can you talk to us, I guess, about the cadence of the profitability of that business as we kind of exit 2024 and you start to have higher deliveries on those? And maybe what kind of foresee the exit rate will be in terms of that profitability?"", 'Jennifer W. Rumsey', ""Yes. So we are in a period of still pretty heavy investment and the Accelera businesses are really making both R&D and manufacturing investments to scale up the product. And we're fortunate we have existing plant in Fridley, that we can invest within to do that to begin to produce electrolyzers. And we continue to see growing demand and backlog is, as I noted, at a record level for electrolyzers. So that production rate is going to begin to grow, and then you'll see margin performance in the electrolyzer portion of the business improving as the revenues grow and we deliver that backlog out into the market. Same thing in our Electrified Components business as we see revenue growth there. You'll see margin performance improvement. One thing we have now included in our 2024 investment, of course, is beginning to invest in the battery cell joint venture. And we believe that, that is a key investment that we're making together to ensure we have a leading sell for commercial vehicles here in the U.S. and domestic supply, which will both allow us and our customers to take advantage of incentives that are available and ensure security of supply over time into this market."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.', 'Robert Cameron Wertheimer', ""I wonder if you could give us some thoughts on what's happening in the data center and large engine market. I mean, obviously, it's very strong. I don't know how many years of visibility you have or what that market looks like. Your primary competitor announced a capacity expansion. I don't know where your capacity and your room to grow into that market if it is a multiyear kind of curve. Like -- so I wonder if you could kind of give us an update on dynamics there."", 'Jennifer W. Rumsey', ""Yes. Data center market is an exciting growth market, has been for several years, the trend with increasing cloud data storage in the cloud and now with artificial intelligence and other investments. We continue to see very strong demand. We guided up 10% to 15%, backlog for that market is very, very strong. We're looking at our capacity to make sure that we can meet the market demand and feeling good about the product offering that we have. And of course, that business and the focus on improving underlying the performance of that business will help us as that market grows."", 'Mark A. Smith', 'Probably the clearest secular trend over the next couple of years.', 'Jennifer W. Rumsey', 'Yes, I think it will continue.', 'Robert Cameron Wertheimer', ""And then do you have room to grow in '25 and '26? Maybe you don't want to share too much on your capacity, but it seems as though you're probably being asked to the quote or to think about capacity that far out, right?"", 'Jennifer W. Rumsey', ""Yes, I will just say we expect that, that trend of data center market growth will continue, and we are and we'll continue to look at our capacity and how we positioned to meet that demand."", 'Robert Cameron Wertheimer', ""Okay. Perfect. I'll stop there. If I can sneak one more in on medium-duty, there's a bit of a narrative that as [coverages] constrained production, the OEMs prioritized large Class 8 over the medium-duty. And that's reflected somewhat in industry outlooks and year out. I'm just wondering if medium-duty has more inherent demand than that being helped by interest rates or anything else. Or if that's kind of where the market is kind of flattish?"", 'Jennifer W. Rumsey', ""Yes. I mean there were -- certainly, the OEMs experienced a number of supply chain constraints and continued in '23 and even into the early part of this year, frame rails, in particular. So we are, as you saw, really expect the medium-duty market to continue to hold pretty flat to where it is now. It's quite strong. We, of course, have a strong position in that market, and we're seeing continued demand and pent-up demand from some of the customers in that market for our product, the [left-off] in there than heavy-duty."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan.', 'Tami Zakaria', ""So I think you highlighted the adoption scenarios at your last Analyst Day. As of today, I know you're hosting another Analyst Day this year, but as of today, which scenario, the fast versus slow seems more likely? And how do you think that affects your Accelera target of $6 billion to $13 billion revenue by 2030? So any updates on that?"", 'Jennifer W. Rumsey', ""Yes. As you said, we did a kind of a low and a high scenario for adoption at our last Analyst Day, and you can expect that we're going to refresh our view of that as we go into the Analyst Day in May. What I would say is that there are regulations and incentives that are helping to start to drive that adoption, maybe more towards the lower end of those scenarios is what we would think. And we are continuing to look at pacing of investment to make sure that we're managing that in line with how we see adoption actually occurring."", 'Tami Zakaria', ""Got it. So if it's more leaning towards, let's say, the floor version, does that have a dampening or somewhat negative, a slowing impact on the Accelera targets that you have out there?"", 'Jennifer W. Rumsey', ""Yes. I mean we're still within -- that would still fall within the range that we gave in the Analyst Day consistent with those range of scenarios that we suggested and recall that a portion -- a large portion of that revenue in 2030 for Accelera is in the growth of the electrolyzer business as well."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer & Company.', 'Noah Duke Kaye', ""First sort of a housekeeping question. I'm just trying to understand cash flow dynamics as we exit the year and the leverage profile. Obviously, the settlement impacts that a bit. But you typically have a target to return 50% of cash flow to shareholders. How are we thinking about return to capital this year? And where you're kind of aiming to end the year on average?"", 'Mark A. Smith', ""Yes. Noah, so we're going to start the year with the same stance as last year, invest in the business, dividend focus and some more delevering. That's the way we start in the year. We'll continue to evaluate that with our Board as we see how the cycle unfolds. But at least that's our initial stance. Of course, part of our -- in years where we've generated more cash than we've needed then we've returned significantly more than the 50% in any given year. But anyway, we think this is the wisest approach right now until we see a little bit more in the cycle."", 'Noah Duke Kaye', 'Right. So you do expect to delever as we get to the end of the year?', 'Mark A. Smith', 'Yes.', 'Noah Duke Kaye', ""Okay. And then just the guide for China truck seems a bit wide. Can you kind of talk us through the low end and then the high end of the range in terms of the scenarios you're envisioning? Is it high end contingent on stimulus? Just walk us through what you're seeing and assuming."", 'Mark A. Smith', ""Yes. That really reflects low visibility, right? So we've come off of a very weak base, but there just isn't clear signals yet from the market as to what's actually going to happen. So we can build -- hard for me to think of a case that's a lot lower than where we are today. But just the overall pace of the economy continues to be sluggish. And so that upside really leaves room for something than expected on the stimulus side, which has happened from time to time in China. But we don't have brilliant insight at this point in time. The outlook is cloudy and the conviction from OEMs is not quite there yet. We're doing well with our customers, launching more products. We're bullish on continuing to outgrow the market in China, both consolidated revenues and in the performance of the JVs. So we're all set to outperform. We just need a little bit of help from the market overall. But it's not as tangible as we'd like at the start of the year. Of course, we'll look at the same data points and provide you with an update, hopefully, by the end of Q1 tend to have a stronger view of the year."", 'Jennifer W. Rumsey', 'Coming out of the...', 'Mark A. Smith', 'Yes. And my voice is done for the rest of the morning.', 'Jennifer W. Rumsey', 'Chris and I will answer the rest of the questions.', 'Operator', 'Our final question is from Michael Feniger with Bank of America.', 'Michael J. Feniger', ""Just the share count has been kind of flat to slightly up. There was a comment in the release about a focus on debt reduction, payment of dividends. Can you just flesh out the priorities in 2024? Because I know Mark mentioned, with Atmus, I heard buybacks. Just maybe you can reiterate the framework of how we should kind of think about Atmus in '24 as we move through the year, some of the puts and takes there?"", 'Mark A. Smith', ""Yes. The main impact of Atmus operation will be, obviously, they all set up on their own and pursuing their growth strategy and there is this final step, we will swap Cummins shares for -- investors will retire Cummins shares in exchange for Atmus shares. So our share count will go down if the exchange is successful. The reason our share count here in the past 18 months hasn't been changing our drifting up is because we stopped the share repurchase as well. We delevered post the Meritor acquisition, which we've been telegraphing to investors.We've got a little bit more of deleveraging to go, and then we'll continue to evaluate whether we -- what our opportunities are to generate the best returns for investors either through organic growth or through more capital returns. But that's the basic way it's going to work. The share count will go down on the separation."", 'Michael J. Feniger', ""Fair enough. And Mark, I want to let you go and get better. Just a quick question for you is just on Meritor, I think '23, I think there's revenue about $4.8 billion, maybe EBITDA a little bit above $500 million. Just when we think of the guide for '24 on Components, anything you can help us unpack about how that Meritor in '23, how that kind of trends in '24 relative to your overall Components guide?"", 'Mark A. Smith', ""Got it. And I will say I'm feeling better than I sound, and that's largely because of the record cash flow. So as I said at the start, don't read into my breaking voice. Meritor achieved the goals we had for this year. It is not a segment on its own. We provided that data for the first full year for transparency purposes to make sure investors had a read on how we were doing after a little bit of a bumpy start when we first acquired Meritor. So that's all rolled into the guidance, but it's safe to say we've got further improvement in Meritor going into 2024, and we're really pleased with how the team is doing there, Ken Hogan and his team. So we're excited about that going forward. So thank you. Thanks, everybody. Appreciate it."", 'Jennifer W. Rumsey', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', 'This will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris for closing comments.', 'Christopher C. Clulow', 'Thank you, everybody. That concludes our teleconference for the day. I appreciate all of you participating and your continued interest. As always, the Investor Relations team will be available for questions after the call. Take care.', 'Operator', ""Thank you.

Bath towels are one of the most essential consumer goods used daily in almost every household. Qualities including absorbability, durability, ease of use, and drying capability, add value to a towel and make it preferable over other alternative products. The demand for bath towels and the overall growth of this industry are tied to other markets, including personal care, fitness clubs, hotels, hospitals, and spas. Moreover, the growing trend of home swimming pools and consumer demand for luxury spa experiences has also contributed to the rising demand for more absorbent high-quality towels.', 'The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic had both negative and positive impacts on the global bath towel industry. The production almost came to a halt due to factors including lockdowns, travel restrictions, disrupted supply chains, and barriers in raw material procurement However, rising awareness regarding personal hygiene during and after the pandemic boosted the demand for towels, particularly for residential use. Moreover, the shutdown of physical stores during COVID-19 led companies to emphasize on online marketing and social media presence, thus contributing to resilient sales both during and after the pandemic.', 'Growing demand for high-quality towels from end markets such as hotels and spas is propelling the growth of the industry.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Thus, you can purchase Helmerich & Payne's shares before the 12th of February in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 27th of February."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.42 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.81 to shareholders.

Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing."", ' View our latest analysis for Helmerich & Payne ', 'Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Helmerich & Payne is paying out just 24% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It distributed 50% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.', ""It's positive to see that Helmerich & Payne's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Companies that aren't growing their earnings can still be valuable, but it is even more important to assess the sustainability of the dividend if it looks like the company will struggle to grow.

It's not encouraging to see that Helmerich & Payne's earnings are effectively flat over the past five years. Better than seeing them fall off a cliff, for sure, but the best dividend stocks grow their earnings meaningfully over the long run."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Helmerich & Payne has increased its dividend at approximately 12% a year on average."", ""Is Helmerich & Payne worth buying for its dividend? While it's not great to see that earnings per share are effectively flat over the 10-year period we checked, at least the payout ratios are low and conservative.

Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in this release.', 'We believe that our use of these non-GAAP measures helps investors understand and evaluate the Company’s performance and financial position. The presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of the results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our businesses. Trends in the underlying profitability of our businesses can be more clearly identified without the fluctuating effects of the items described below. Adjusted book value augments the understanding of our financial position by providing a measure of net worth that is primarily attributable to our business operations separate from the portion that is affected by capital and currency market conditions, and by isolating the accounting impact associated with insurance liabilities that are generally not marked to market and the supporting investments that are marked to market through accumulated other comprehensive income under GAAP. However, these non-GAAP measures are not substitutes for income and equity determined in accordance with GAAP, and the adjustments made to derive these measures are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations and financial position. The schedules accompanying this release provide reconciliations of non-GAAP measures with the corresponding measures calculated using GAAP. Additional historic information relating to our financial performance is located on our website at investor.prudential.com.', 'Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP measure used by the Company to evaluate segment performance and to allocate resources. Adjusted operating income excludes ""Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related charges and adjustments"". A significant element of realized investment gains and losses are impairments and credit-related and interest rate-related gains and losses. Impairments and losses from sales of credit-impaired securities, the timing of which depends largely on market credit cycles, can vary considerably across periods. The timing of other sales that would result in gains or losses, such as interest rate-related gains or losses, is largely subject to our discretion and influenced by market opportunities as well as our tax and capital profile.', 'Realized investment gains (losses) within certain businesses for which such gains (losses) are a principal source of earnings, and those associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings and current period yield adjustments, are included in adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income generally excludes realized investment gains and losses from products that contain embedded derivatives, and from associated derivative portfolios that are part of an asset-liability management program related to the risk of those products. Adjusted operating income also excludes gains and losses from changes in value of certain assets and liabilities relating to foreign currency exchange movements that have been economically hedged or considered part of our capital funding strategies for our international subsidiaries, as well as gains and losses on certain investments that are designated as trading. Adjusted operating income also excludes investment gains and losses on assets supporting experience-rated contractholder liabilities and changes in experience-rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes, because these recorded changes in asset and liability values are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. Additionally, adjusted operating income excludes the changes in fair value of equity securities that are recorded in net income.', 'Adjusted operating income excludes ""Change in value of market risk benefits, net of related hedging gains (losses)"", which reflects the impact from changes in current market conditions, and market experience updates, reflecting the immediate impacts in current period results from changes in current market conditions on estimates of profitability, which we believe enhances the understanding of underlying performance trends. Adjusted operating income also excludes the results of Divested and Run-off Businesses, which are not relevant to our ongoing operations, and discontinued operations and earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, each of which is presented as a separate component of net income under GAAP. Additionally, adjusted operating income excludes other items, such as certain components of the consideration for acquisitions, which are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service periods, and goodwill impairments. Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests is presented as a separate component of net income under GAAP and excluded from adjusted operating income. The tax effect associated with pre-tax adjusted operating income is based on applicable IRS and foreign tax regulations inclusive of pertinent adjustments.', 'Adjusted operating income does not equate to ""Net income"" as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and our definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies. The items above are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations. However, we believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our businesses. Trends in the underlying profitability of our businesses can be more clearly identified without the fluctuating effects of the items described above.', 'Adjusted book value is calculated as total equity (GAAP book value) excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), the cumulative change in fair value of funds withheld embedded derivatives, and the cumulative effect of foreign currency exchange rate remeasurements and currency translation adjustments corresponding to realized investment gains and losses. These items are excluded in order to highlight the book value attributable to our core business operations separate from the portion attributable to external and potentially volatile capital and currency market conditions.', 'FOOTNOTES', '(1)', '\xa0', 'On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted Accounting Standard Update 2018-12 for Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts, which provided new authoritative guidance impacting the accounting and disclosure requirements for long-duration insurance and investment contracts issued by the Company.

This volatility has led to fluctuations in the performance of dividend stocks and other types of assets. In 2023, we witnessed a similar trend where investor focus shifted towards technology stocks, overshadowing the appeal of dividend stocks amidst the unpredictability of the year. Dividend stocks, including those with a track record of steady growth in dividends, showed a notable underperformance compared to the overall market last year. Despite this, some investors saw this as an opportunity to acquire dividend stocks at discounted prices, ensuring a continued stream of income from their investments. As of September 2023, findings from a survey by Visual Capitalist reveal that dividend investing emerged as the top choice among retail investors, with 50% of respondents expressing interest in this strategy."", 'Analysts predict that the trend of investing in dividend stocks will persist throughout 2024. According to strategies outlined by BofA, 2024 has the potential to be a standout year for dividends. BofA cited optimism regarding dividends this year, attributing it to the tendency for high dividend yield stocks to excel during recoveries. They point to a global macro indicator they monitor, suggesting that markets are poised for a ""risk-on"" recovery rather than the feared downturn. Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy at BofA Securities, spoke with Barron’s about dividend stocks in detail:', '“Typically what happens is that all the stocks that were considered risky in a recessionary or pre-recessionary environment now have a lifeline from less credit and earnings risk and tend to outperform and bounce back from the dire expectation levels.”', ""Another factor highlighted by the strategist is the significant amount of cash reserves, amounting to trillions of dollars, currently held on the sidelines. It's anticipated that if short-term interest rates decline, as projected in the upcoming months, investors may shift their funds away from money-market funds and cash equivalents towards investments offering equity income."", ""Apart from their optimistic forecast for 2024, dividend stocks have played a substantial role in bolstering the market's overall performance. As per a study conducted by S&P Dow Jones Indices, spanning from 1926 to July 2023, dividend earnings accounted for 32% of the S&P 500's monthly total return, with capital appreciation making up the remainder. The report also highlighted the significance of dividends in terms of the compounding effect. It emphasized that excluding dividends, the initial return of the S&P 500 on January 1, 1930, would have increased to $214 by July 2023. However, with dividends reinvested, the return of the S&P 500 during the same timeframe would have grown substantially higher to $7,219."", 'Walmart Inc.

Intel is betting that integrating dedicated AI hardware into its CPUs will give it an edge and boost demand for PCs, while Microsoft is unleashing AI-powered assistants to supercharge its Windows operating system.', ""The two strategies don't quite converge. Intel's latest Meteor Lake laptop CPUs include powerful AI hardware capable of enabling AI features in third-party software, but there's not nearly enough horsepower to drive something like OpenAI's GPT-4, the advanced large language model that Microsoft uses for its Copilot AI assistant. Microsoft's AI assistants thus call out to a cloud service for processing."", ""Two downsides of using a cloud service are latency and cost. It takes time for a cloud-based AI model to respond, especially if it's overloaded with requests. This latency impacts the user experience. It's also expensive. While Microsoft offers a basic version of Copilot for free, Copilot Pro is priced at $20 per user per month for those already subscribed to its cloud-based Microsoft 365."", 'For software developers looking to integrate AI into their products, there are two options: Run the AI processing locally and incur no ongoing cost, or call out to a cloud service and pass that cost onto the user. For free software, the first option is the only viable one.', ""Intel is likely to include AI hardware in most of its future CPUs, and that hardware will become more powerful over time. But AI PCs will also need far more memory to run advanced AI models locally. That's where memory chip manufacturer Micron (NASDAQ: MU) comes in."", 'The memory chip industry is pulling out of a severe downturn that saw demand and prices plummet. One thing that will help firm up pricing is the soaring demand for the ultra-fast memory used by AI accelerators running in cloud data centers. As Micron and its competitors prioritize this memory, the supply of standard memory chips destined for PCs will languish.', 'While this will boost prices in the short term, the requirements of the AI PC will drive up demand in the long term. Laptops that come with just 8 GB of random-access memory (RAM) are still common today, but Microsoft has reportedly indicated that any Windows PC must have at least 16 GB of RAM to be called an AI PC.', ""Even 16 GB doesn't get you very far. A large language model powerful enough to be useful as an AI assistant can require far more memory. The Llama 2 family of AI models created by Meta, for example, requires 30 GB of RAM at a minimum for the scrawniest variant, and 320 GB for the beefiest version."", ""Intel's push to include AI hardware in its CPUs will eventually enable powerful AI assistants to run on PCs without the need for cloud-based AI services. This will require vast increases in the amount of RAM inside a typical PC, a boon for Micron."", 'Even if it takes years for the AI PC to gain traction, Micron can benefit now from strong demand for memory chips used in powerful AI accelerators that train and run AI models in the cloud.', ""While Micron is a clear beneficiary of the AI revolution, it's important to remember that memory chips are a commodity, and pricing is a function of supply and demand. Predictions for the size of the AI accelerator market are extremely optimistic. AMD, for example, expects $400 billion of AI accelerators to be sold in 2027."", ""It's these kinds of pie-in-the-sky forecasts that will plant the seeds of the next downturn in the memory chip industry. As supply is ramped up to meet expected demand, all it takes to produce a price-stomping glut of memory chips is for these forecasts to prove slightly too optimistic."", ""The size of the market for memory chips is likely to rise as the demands of AI, both in the cloud and on personal devices, push up the memory chip content in PCs and servers. But pricing, and thus Micron's profitability, depends on demand relative to supply."", ""Micron is in a great position to benefit from the growth of AI, but that doesn't necessarily mean that its profits will soar permanently higher.

This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Hasbro?', ""For Hasbro, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +4.33%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.', 'So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Hasbro will beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Hasbro would post earnings of $1.64 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering no surprise.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", ""Hasbro doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

The results hurt by the war in the Middle East."", 'So as we look ahead to some of the other results that we will be getting, including Yum!

Greg, it's great to have you here. So let's talk about what we just heard from McDonald's, whether or not that is the start of a larger trend. Do you expect some of the other rivals within this space to be hurt by the pushback that we're seeing amid the ongoing war in the Middle East?"", ""GREGORY FRANCFORT: Yeah, I think it's very clear this is likely to happen. We put out a note last week expecting pressure across the Middle East. But not just the Middle East, you're seeing pressure out of Malaysia and Indonesia, they're two countries with heavily Muslim populations that-- I think those areas of the world are seeing pressure against American brands. And we don't expect it to be any different for Yum! Maybe a little bit lighter because McDonald's is generally the beacon for American sentiment, but we expect pressure internationally for sure."", ""BRAD SMITH: Is there one subsidiary-- I mean, we're talking KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut for Yum! Is there one subsidiary that has perhaps more of a risk that we'll see show up in some of the worldwide system sales performance?"", ""GREGORY FRANCFORT: Yeah, so Yum! has four brands. They have KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and Habit Burger, Habit being much smaller than the other three. KFC is a global restaurant business. I mean, you and I have, I'm sure, eaten at a KFC in the US, pizza in the US, Taco Bell--"", 'BRAD SMITH: Too much!', ""GREGORY FRANCFORT: Yeah, I know. My girlfriend tells me that all the time. But no, I think KFC is really very strong internationally. They have large presences in Asia, the Middle East, Europe. And it's actually 13% of the overall Yum! business comes out of China. So I think sometimes we forget that this is really a global expansion story."", 'They are growing units 5% to 6% a year around the world. I mean, this is a very powerful growth story, but we expect a little bit of a hiccup in terms of same store sales here in the near term.', 'SEANA SMITH: How big of a hiccup are you expecting that we could potentially see here?', ""GREGORY FRANCFORT: Yeah, we-- I mean, if you go back three months ago, we were expecting a pretty solid beat on KFC in the next year and even in the quarter. Now we're expecting-- our model is for 2% same store sales growth in the quarter. The Street has 4.8%. So we're sizably below the Street."", ""And I think that's going to come out of a 20% to 30% slowdown in the Middle East, which is 6% of KFC's global sales. We expect double digit slowdown in parts of Southeast Asia, which Malaysia, Indonesia are each 2% of KFC's global sales. But again, this-- we think this is somewhat a factor in the stock. The stock trades at 22.5 times earnings for double digit earnings growth. Other companies with a similar profile trade at 24 to 26 times. So we think that it's getting factored in here."", ""BRAD SMITH: Where are we seeing menu innovation efforts for Yum! Brands, and more broadly perhaps, across some of the quick service restaurants actually be in those efforts realized by the companies as consumers are trying to evaluate, OK, a fresh farm to table option versus something that they know might not be as fresh and perhaps never frozen-- I'll use that, I guess-- as they're kind of evaluating what is healthy versus what actually fits in with just trying to get something quick, eat it, keep going?"", ""GREGORY FRANCFORT: Yeah, it's funny. I think sometimes consumers want to eat healthy, but a lot of the decisions they make sometimes don't necessarily reflect that. I think one of the things that's really important for a lot of these businesses is to have the best value to the consumer. And you look at some of the strongest growth businesses in the restaurant industry, you look at Wingstop, you look at Texas Roadhouse-- these are businesses that price 10% to 15% below their competitors and make up for it on traffic volume. So I what's very clear to us is the US consumer values price more than anything else."", 'BRAD SMITH: Do you believe that the US consumer as well is also going to moderate perhaps lower a little bit for some of the quick service restaurants as a result of GLP-1s and other weight loss or obesity-related drugs?', ""GREGORY FRANCFORT: I suspect that that's going to be a factor over time. We think it will be a small factor, because it will get slowly-- we expect GLP-1s to slowly grow, and that to slowly pressure the restaurant businesses. But we don't expect necessarily a sharp slowdown anytime in 2024 or 2025 because of that."", ""We are seeing a little bit of a-- McDonald's noted this. There is a little bit of a push back from lower income consumers just given tightness on the wallet. So I think we are seeing some evidence of a little bit of a slow start to 2024 because of that. It's going to be very hard to disaggregate some of these factors like GLP-1s versus value and other factors."", 'BRAD SMITH: Fair point. Greg, always a pleasure to get some of your insights.

In 2023, we achieved global comp sales growth of 9%.

For example, we've expanded loyalty to 50 markets around the world and reached over 20 billion in annual loyalty system-wide sales in 2023. Our user base continues to grow with over 150 million users that have been active in the last 90 days, making us one of the largest loyalty programs in the world.

Our chicken category now represents $25 billion in annual system-wide sales, on par with beef. And about a year ago, we formed a new business ventures team designed to operate as an entrepreneurial startup within McDonald's. The team quickly identified an opportunity in a $100 billion category across our top six markets that comprised of beverage-led occasions where our core McDonald's business underindexes.

The data come from a trial of patients in Canada and Europe, but an interim look at a U.S. study shows the performance is currently consistent across geographies.', 'J&J subsidiary Biosense Webster is working to become the third company, after Medtronic and Boston Scientific, to bring a PFA device to the U.S. market.

The need for PFA mapping has been a subject of debate,\xa0but latecomers Abbott and J&J are pitching their integrations as positives.\xa0', 'J&J put its device to the test in the Inspire study, a clinical trial that enrolled 272 people with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AFib) at sites in Canada and Europe. After 12 months, just over 75% of subjects were free from atrial arrhythmia recurrence. The figure rose to 80% in patients who received a level of PFA application that J&J called “optimal.” BTIG noted the optimal level of PFA applications was at least 48.', 'The proportion of patients free from atrial arrhythmia recurrence after 12 months was higher than in the pivotal studies of rival devices. Around 73% of patients in Boston Scientific’s PFA trial met the 12-month efficacy endpoint. The figure in the paroxysmal AFib cohort of Medtronic’s trial was just over 66%.\xa0', 'However, cross-trial comparisons can be misleading because differences between the studies, as well as differences between the interventions, influence the results.

The average age in the J&J trial was around 59 years, compared with over 62 and 63 years, respectively, in the Boston Scientific and Medtronic studies.', 'J&J presented final data from Inspire alongside interim results from the pilot phase of the Admire study it is running in the U.S. Eighty percent of the 20 patients with 12 months of follow up were free from atrial arrhythmia. BTIG analysts told investors they “view these results as favorable, but with just a few patients evaluated, we await results from the pivotal phase, which enrolled up to 408 patients, in the near future.”', 'The U.S. data could position J&J to start competing for the PFA portion of an AFib market that RBC Capital Markets analysts predict will grow to $5.8 billion by 2026. The RBC analysts expect “a rapid shift to PFA,” although their counterparts at BTIG noted concerns including the price of pulsed field ablation that could slow the transition. Physicians said PFA costs twice as much as radiofrequency ablation in Europe.', '“With [electrophysiology] typically a profit center for hospitals and hospital margins under pressure, this is a concern,”\xa0the analysts wrote. “These doctors expect pricing to decrease as PFA volume increases. Combining ablation and mapping in one catheter may also be preferred, since that is one less catheter to pay for.” ', 'This story was originally published on MedTech Dive.

From homemade remedies to the thriving industry it is today, hair care and cosmetics have evolved significantly over time, reflecting both cultural practices and technological advancements.', 'The global hair care and beauty industries have traditionally been considered recession-resistant, as they fall within the consumer staples category, alongside essential items like groceries and cleaning supplies. In addition, given that numerous hair care and beauty brands also qualify as luxury products, the sector operates as a hybrid, blending features of consumer staples and luxury goods to provide the advantages of both. However, the COVID-19 pandemic challenged this perception. Lockdowns and consumer concerns about infection prompted widespread closures of retail and salon stores, resulting in weakened sales across the beauty and personal care product market back in 2022. In response to these challenges, industry leaders were forced to devise strategies to attract more consumers.', ""In 2022, the average American consumer spent approximately $86 on hair care products. Among these, shampoo emerged as the most profitable, generating sales of approximately $3.6 billion, followed by hair conditioner and hair coloring, with unit sales reaching 172 million units in the women's hair coloring category. More prevalently, hair growth treatments have gained significant attention in the beauty industry. As more consumers express interest in products that combat hair loss and thinning, the hair growth category has seen a surge in both unit and dollar sales in the United States. In 2022, dollar sales of hair growth products amounted to about $121 million. This category encompasses various product types, including oils such as rosemary oil, as well as more conventional hair care items like shampoo and conditioner, formulated with ingredients aimed at promoting hair growth or preventing hair loss."", 'The evolving fashion trends and growing awareness of new, safer, and more effective hair care products have fueled a notable surge in their usage, consequently driving growth in the global hair care market.

With the latest clinical-trial data pointing to possible development of a winning medicine, there's reason to believe that more revenue could be on the way."", ""But as smart investors know, it matters when precisely that revenue will arrive, and how much it'll actually be in comparison to expectations. So let's unpack the importance of this program, and realistically evaluate its ability to win in the massive market for pain relief."", 'Vertex is known for its collection of therapies for cystic fibrosis (CF), a rare inherited disease of the lungs. But its ambitions are larger than CF alone; in collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics, it also recently commercialized a gene therapy called Casgevy to treat or cure both sickle cell disease (SCD) and beta thalassemia. Diversifying beyond CF is a necessity in the long term, as there are only around 92,000 known CF patients in the Western world, the majority of whom the company is already treating.', ""So for a few years now, the company's research and development (R&D) efforts have centered around programs that would give it an opportunity to enter other lucrative markets. It now looks like those efforts are on the verge of succeeding yet again, and perhaps with a win even larger than launching Casgevy."", ""Enter VX-548, a non-opioid analgesic (painkiller) that could well represent the next big step forward in pain management. The candidate just concluded phase 3 clinical trials for acute pain, and it's being investigated in a phase 2 trial for neuropathic pain related to diabetes as well. In the trial data, the candidate looks to be effective at relieving patients of their severe pain, but not quite as effective as the opioid drugs it was intended to outdo or replace."", ""Nonetheless, it's important to recognize the usefulness of the drug's non-opioid mechanism of action. Opioids get a bad rap because they're habit-forming and can cause fatal overdoses; they're also arguably overprescribed."", ""Since there are 80 million people in the U.S. who need treatment for acute pain, there's a huge market waiting for any competitor who can create a medicine with opioid-like efficacy, but without the risks. And because the candidate's mechanism of action is different not only from those of opioids but also from the mechanisms of analgesics like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), there's a chance that it can be safely co-administered with other painkillers if patients need extra relief."", ""Right now, Vertex's trailing-12-month revenue is $9.6 billion. Financial analysts estimate that if it gets approved, VX-548 could generate between $5 billion and $10 billion annually by 2030. That means the program would have a massively beneficial financial impact for the company at the lower bound of those estimates, and a transformative one at the higher end."", ""Either way, it's a given that an approval would mark the definitive end of Vertex as just a cystic fibrosis medicine company, and the start of its life as a major diversified pharmaceutical business, a transition that's been in the making for a few years now. It's hard to imagine how its shares wouldn't climb upon news of the approval, not to mention in the following years as sales rolled in."", 'Vertex plans to submit the paperwork and work with regulators at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to get their approval for commercialization of VX-548 before the end of the first half of this year. That means it could be within 12 months of launching the drug. In the long term, expect management to devote resources to exploring what other pain indications VX-548 might be used to treat.', ""With such a high-impact approval looming on the horizon, don't expect to find this stock priced at a bargain, especially not since Vertex just launched Casgevy for two indications over the last three months. The stock's trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is already high at 32, but could go even higher once the market notices the revenue tailwind which could soon arrive."", ""Of course, getting a rejection from the FDA would cause the stock to crater. But given Vertex's smooth sailing through the clinical trial process with this program so far, that isn't very likely. And even if there's a setback, it has plenty of resources to correct any issues and try again, so it wouldn't be the end of the road for the program."", ""In other words, if you're thinking about buying shares, you may want to do so sooner than later as it isn't clear that the stock's valuation will come down anytime soon.."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Vertex Pharmaceuticals right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Vertex Pharmaceuticals, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vertex Pharmaceuticals wasn’t one of them.

That was outpaced by 3% growth in sparkling water and juice brands. In other regions, traditional Coke sales growth was outmatched by water, tea, sports drinks and coffee.', 'Coke doesn’t often add new permanent flavors to its lineup: Spiced joins just a few other flavors it always sells, including its flagship flavor, cherry and vanilla.', 'Spiced was selected because it’s “all about being on category trend and responsive to our consumer preferences,” who are craving bolder and punchier flavors, Sue Lynne Cha, Coke’s vice president of marketing for North America, told CNN.', 'Coke’s research found that an “increase in consumer willingness to try a spiced beverage” and that raspberry was selected more than 5 million times on its Freestyle drink machines in 2022, which the company “often uses for inspiration” for new flavors, she said.', '“Consumers are looking for more bold flavors and more complex flavor profiles. That’s a trend we started to see in food, but also in beverage and we though that was a unique space for us to play in,” she said, adding that there’s been of a “desire of discovery” with people wanting to try something new.', '“It appears Coca-Cola is looking to splice that trend onto its flagship with hopes of getting young consumers to consider the entire franchise,” he told CNN.', 'Coca-Cola Spiced goes on sale February 19 in both cans and bottles in various sizes at most national retailers.', 'This story has been updated with additional context', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

Coke won’t name the spices it added – it guards its recipes closely – but they taste like amped-up versions of the spices in regular Coke.', '“If you go to the aisles, you’ll see the amount of spiciness has gone up because consumers’ taste palettes have evolved. We realized that could be an opportunity for us,” Coca-Cola’s North American marketing chief Shakir Moin told The Associated Press in a recent interview. “Can we dial up something which is already part of our formula and bring in a taste profile that is interesting, unique, and brings in the next generation of consumers?”', 'Coke has been exploring ways to get younger drinkers excited about its signature cola. In 2022, it launched Coca-Cola Creations, a series of eight limited-edition Coke flavors in colorful cans and bottles. Coke experimented with adding hints of coconut, strawberry, watermelon and other flavors to the drinks.', 'The latest example, Coca-Cola Happy Tears, contains salt and mineral flavors. It will be sold only through TikTok on Feb. 17 in the U.S. and Great Britain.', 'Moin said customer research for Coca-Cola Creations fed into the development of Coca-Cola Spiced. It usually takes Coca-Cola at least a year to develop a new beverage, he said, but Coca-Cola Spiced took just seven weeks. Moin said the company hopes to replicate that speed with future new products.', '“Consumers are moving faster. The market is moving forward faster.

Smoke-free products generated 36.2% of PM’s net revenues in the third quarter of 2023. Toward this end, the company’s IQOS, a heat-not-burn device, counts among one of the leading RRPs in the industry. Total IQOS users at the end of the third quarter were estimated at roughly 27.4 million (including nearly 19.7 million who switched to IQOS and stopped smoking).Among other initiatives, Philip Morris became the majority owner of Swedish Match on Nov 11, 2022.

The offer represents an 18% premium to MorphoSys’ €57.40 closing price Monday on the German stock exchange. While that figure is on the lower end of biopharmaceutical deal premiums, MorphoSys shares had surged Monday after a Reuters report revealed Novartis was closing in on an acquisition.', 'Meanwhile, biotechnology company Incyte is paying $25 million for rights to the lymphoma drug tafasitamab that it doesn’t already own. Incyte has been developing tafasitamab with MorphoSys since 2020. The drug is approved for a form of relapsed lymphoma and is in advanced testing for other blood malignancies. Following the deal, Incyte won’t have to make future milestone payments to MorphoSys or split profits.', 'For Novartis, the deal is something of a surprise. Reports over the last month had indicated the company was considering a much larger acquisition of heart drug developer Cytokinetics. But a buyout hasn’t materialized and, on a conference call last week, CEO Vas Narasimhan emphasized the company is focused on “bolt-on acquisitions in the sub $5 billion space.”', 'MorphoSys fits that description, but represents a gamble by Novartis on the future of a bone cancer drug called pelabresib. MorphoSys has been developing it for myelofibrosis, a condition that can cause severe anemia and related symptoms of weakness and fatigue. A combination of the drug and Incyte’s Jakafi succeeded in late-stage testing last year, improving markers of health important to myelofibrosis patients. In a statement, Novartis described its expectations the regimen could be “practice changing.”', 'Still, pelabresib faces questions. The drug didn’t significantly reduce symptom scores in testing, missing a key secondary study goal. Novartis pointed to “favorable trends” in symptom improvements and said a U.S. approval filing is expected later this year. Nonetheless, the results leave the drug’s regulatory prospects uncertain and make the timing of Novartis’ buyout a “potential risk,” wrote Leerink Partners analyst Andrew Berens, in a research note.', 'The Federal Trade Commission, which has been more aggressively scrutinizing pharmaceutical deals in recent years, could also challenge the deal given therapeutic “overlaps” and financial ties between MorphoSys and Novartis in myelofibrosis, he added.', '“We do not foresee another bidder emerging at these levels given the risks,” Berens wrote.', 'The deal would add to Novartis’ hematology portfolio, which currently includes non-U.S. rights to Jakafi, as well as drugs for sickle cell disease, leukemia and other disorders. Novartis would also get a cancer therapy in early-stage testing and experimental drugs partnered with drugmakers like Eli Lilly and Ultragenyx.', 'For Incyte, acquiring tafasitamab is “probably not the deal investors were looking for,” as it followed speculation the company lost a bidding war to Novartis, wrote William Blair analyst Matt Phipps. The company faces competition for Jakafi, its primary revenue driver, and has been trying in recent years to expand into areas like dermatology.', 'Still, the deal is a “cheap” bet MorphoSys’ drug, which is currently approved for refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma, can prove itself in other indications, he wrote. Key to those prospects are a pair of trials in follicular and marginal zone lymphoma that should produce results in 2024, as well as a study in newly diagnosed patients with DLBCL that will read out next year.', 'Monjuvi generated $92 million in U.S. sales in 2023.

Management uses these measures when analyzing both GAAP and non-GAAP results to improve its understanding of trends in the underlying business and to help avoid incorrect or misleading assumptions and conclusions about the success or failure of company strategies. Management adjustments to GAAP measures generally: apply to non-recurring events that are unrelated to business performance and distort short-term results; involve values that fluctuate based on events outside of management's control; supplement reporting segment disclosures with disclosures for a subsidiary company or for a combination of subsidiaries or reporting segments; or relate to accounting refinements that affect comparability between periods, creating a need to analyze data on the same basis."", ""Non-GAAP operating income: Non-GAAP operating income is calculated by excluding investment gains and losses (defined as investment gains and losses after applicable federal and state income taxes) and other significant non-recurring items from net income. Management evaluates non-GAAP operating income to measure the success of pricing, rate and underwriting strategies. While investment gains (or losses) are integral to the company's insurance operations over the long term, the determination to realize investment gains or losses on fixed-maturity securities sold in any period may be subject to management's discretion and is independent of the insurance underwriting process. Also, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, gains and losses are recognized from certain changes in market values of securities without actual realization. Management believes that the level of investment gains or losses for any particular period, while it may be material, may not fully indicate the performance of ongoing underlying business operations in that period.\xa0For these reasons, many investors and shareholders consider non-GAAP operating income to be one of the more meaningful measures for evaluating insurance company performance. Equity analysts who report on the insurance industry and the company generally focus on this metric in their analyses. The company presents non-GAAP operating income so that all investors have what management believes to be a useful supplement to GAAP information."", 'Consolidated property casualty insurance results: To supplement reporting segment disclosures related to our property casualty insurance operations, we also evaluate results for those operations on a basis that includes results for our property casualty insurance and brokerage services subsidiaries.

The stock hit a new 52-week high of $249.62 in the previous session. Chubb has gained 10.3% since the start of the year compared to the 0.1% move for the Zacks Finance sector and the 9.3% return for the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry.', ""What's Driving the Outperformance?"", ""The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on January 30, 2024, Chubb reported EPS of $8.3 versus consensus estimate of $5.07 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 3.92%."", 'For the current fiscal year, Chubb is expected to post earnings of $20.93 per share on $54.45 billion in revenues. This represents a -7.14% change in EPS on a 6.65% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $23.16 per share on $58.3 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 10.66% and 7.07%, respectively.', 'Valuation Metrics', 'Chubb may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.', 'On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.', ""Chubb has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are C and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A."", ""In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 11.9X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 12.5X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 10.5X versus its peer group's average of 16.1X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.19. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective."", 'Zacks Rank', ""We also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Chubb currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates."", 'Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Chubb meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Chubb shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.', 'How Does CB Stack Up to the Competition?', 'Shares of CB have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is The Progressive Corporation (PGR). PGR has a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of D, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of D.', 'Earnings were strong last quarter. The Progressive Corporation beat our consensus estimate by 24.37%, and for the current fiscal year, PGR is expected to post earnings of $8.59 per share on revenue of $70.74 billion.', 'Shares of The Progressive Corporation have gained 10.2% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 21.2X and a P/CF of 39.17X.', 'The Insurance - Property and Casualty industry is in the top 37% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for CB and PGR, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But the stock is feeling the hangover from that gold rush ending, which puts investors in a predicament."", ""The company's revenue and earnings are plummeting, and Wall Street has sent the stock to near decade-lows.

Additionally, it just completed a whopping $43 billion acquisition of oncology drug company Seagen, which injects more long-term potential into Pfizer's pipeline."", 'While you wait out this transition phase, Pfizer pays a dividend yielding 6.2% at its current share price, and management has confirmed its intent to grow that payout with an increase in December.', ""It's hard to access America's healthcare and not bump into UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH). The company is one of the United States' largest health insurance companies. It provides various other services, including pharmacy benefit management (PBM), consulting, healthcare technology, and data analytics. To put it differently, UnitedHealth is a core cog in America's $4.5 trillion healthcare machine."", ""The stock has returned a remarkable 440,000% over its lifetime. It isn't likely to repeat that as it approaches a $500 billion market cap. However, there is still plenty of growth for investors. Healthcare is so big that there is an ocean of expansion in front of UnitedHealth, and the company's enormous size and deep pockets make it hard to compete with."", ""Analysts believe the company will grow earnings by an average of 11% annually over the long term, and the company's dividend yields 1.5% and has been increased for 14 straight years. Steady growth and just a 26% dividend payout ratio mean UnitedHealth could be a dividend rockstar for decades."", 'Healthcare conglomerate Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) has a history spanning nearly 150 years. An employee at the company, Grace Groner, died a multi-millionaire by simply buying three shares of the stock in 1935 and holding and reinvesting the dividends for decades. Abbott Labs looks slightly different today than back then, but this is still a gem of a healthcare stock.', 'The company brings in $40 billion annually, selling various products worldwide. Its business units span nutrition and consumer products, diagnostics technology, medical devices, and established pharmaceuticals (generics). Abbott Labs is also a legendary Dividend King, with a 52-year streak of consecutive increases.', ""Abbott Labs is a get rich slowly stock.

Humana disclosed similar concerns\xa0in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday.', 'Analysts on Tuesday peppered Centene executives with a string of queries about MA, a sector facing notable turbulence from shifting regulations and elevated medical costs. The bombardment prompted an attempt from Asher to redirect the line of questioning to Centene’s other business lines.', '“Isn’t it interesting — we’re spending so much time on 12% of our revenue,” Asher said. “Important lever, but we actually have some pretty good other businesses.”', 'Analysts said they were looking to reconcile differing narratives in MA. Managed care companies that have reported fourth-quarter earnings so far — UnitedHealth,\xa0Humana, Cigna\xa0and Elevance\xa0— have reported a mixed bag of Medicare utilization trends.', 'UnitedHealth and Humana, which together hold almost half of total MA market share, say that seniors are continuing to seek outpatient care in droves, including procedures like orthopedic surgeries and seasonal needs like vaccinations for the flu or respiratory virus RSV. Both also reported higher inpatient utilization, though UnitedHealth blamed expensive COVID-19 admissions while Humana said it was seeing more short stays in hospitals across the board.', 'Though outpatient care has remained elevated, Centene didn’t see an increase in inpatient care in the fourth quarter, according to management.', 'The only unexpected element in MA was higher spend on influenza-like illnesses, but the insurer is confident it’s factored in ongoing medical trends into its plan bids for 2024, Asher said.', 'Overall, Centene recorded a medical loss ratio of 87.7% in 2023, the same as in 2022. Lower medical costs in its Affordable Care Act marketplace plans were offset by a $250 million premium deficiency reserve recorded in the fourth quarter.', 'A premium deficiency reserve is how much an insurer expects they might need if premiums collected aren’t sufficient to meet future claims expenses.', 'Centene booked that $250 million reserve to account for a potential MA cost increase in 2024. The reserve gives Centene “another bite at the apple” to reevaluate medical trends and, in the chance costs continue to rise, will provide a financial cushion, Asher said.', 'Despite expressing confidence in Centene’s 2024 bids, preliminary rates released by the CMS for 2025 are “insufficient,” CEO Sarah London told investors on the call.', 'Centene is focusing on margin expansion in MA, not growing its footprint, so if regulators finalize the unfavorable rates “we’ll just adjust the bids accordingly,” Asher said. “The\xa0products may be a little less attractive for seniors from an industry standpoint if we don’t make a lot of progress on the final rates.”', 'To Asher’s point, Medicare makes up a relatively small chunk of Centene’s annual revenue. The lion’s share of its premiums are brought in from Medicaid, another government program that’s facing ongoing volatility as states continue to recheck beneficiaries’ eligibility. Centene is the largest Medicaid managed care organization in the U.S., and contracts with 31 states to offer the coverage.', 'As of the end of 2023, 80% of Centene’s members had their eligibility redetermined.\xa0Centene ended the year with 14.5 million Medicaid beneficiaries —\xa0down 1.5 million people since the end of 2022.', 'In the fourth quarter, the payer’s Medicaid premiums were down slightly year over year, but still up in 2023 overall compared to 2022.', 'Despite the loss of members, Centene continues to notch contract wins. Last month,\xa0Centene\xa0resigned a Medicaid contract\xa0with New Hampshire to provide physical and behavioral health, along with pharmacy services, in the state.\xa0And,\xa0in December, the insurer received a Medicaid long-term care contract in Arizona.', 'Even as Medicaid membership slid, Centene’s marketplace enrollment was up 1.8 million people — a whopping 88% increase compared to 2022. Commercial revenue jumped 68% in the fourth quarter and 43% in the full year.', 'The ACA exchanges are a key growth market for the payer, and were a major source of discussion during Centene’s\xa0investor day in December.', 'Overall,\xa0Centene ended the year with 27.5 million members.', 'The insurer beat Wall Street expectations for 2023 on revenue of $154 billion, up almost 7% year over year, but missed earnings forecasts slightly. Centene brought in profit of $2.7 billion in 2023, more than double its profit in 2022.', 'Centene increased its 2024 premium and services revenue guidance in light of stronger than expected marketplace enrollment, and reiterated its earnings guidance for this year.', 'This story was originally published on Healthcare Dive.

(NYSE:EL) shareholders, with its shares surging 11% to US$146 in the week since its latest second-quarter results. Revenues were US$4.3b, approximately in line with whatthe analysts expected, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) crushed expectations, coming in at US$0.87, an impressive 59% ahead of estimates. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year."", ' See our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from Estée Lauder Companies' 27 analysts is for revenues of US$15.8b in 2024. This reflects a modest 4.4% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to bounce 68% to US$2.19. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$15.7b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$2.20 in 2024. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates."", ""With the analysts reconfirming their revenue and earnings forecasts, it's surprising to see that the price target rose 9.6% to US$159. It looks as though they previously had some doubts over whether the business would live up to their expectations. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. There are some variant perceptions on Estée Lauder Companies, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$208 and the most bearish at US$115 per share. These price targets show that analysts do have some differing views on the business, but the estimates do not vary enough to suggest to us that some are betting on wild success or utter failure."", ""These estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Estée Lauder Companies' past performance and to peers in the same industry. It's clear from the latest estimates that Estée Lauder Companies' rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 9.0% annualised revenue growth to the end of 2024 noticeably faster than its historical growth of 2.6% p.a. over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 7.1% per year. It seems obvious that, while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past, the analysts also expect Estée Lauder Companies to grow faster than the wider industry."", ""The most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. Fortunately, they also reconfirmed their revenue numbers, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Additionally, our data suggests that revenue is expected to grow faster than the wider industry. We note an upgrade to the price target, suggesting that the analysts believes the intrinsic value of the business is likely to improve over time."", ""Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings.

If you want to skip our industry background and jump ahead to the top five stocks in this list, then take a look at the 5 Best Hair Care Stocks To Buy Now.', 'While hair care products may appear to be a modern phenomenon, their origins trace back thousands of years. Throughout history, humans have utilized various products to enhance their appearance. From homemade remedies to the thriving industry it is today, hair care and cosmetics have evolved significantly over time, reflecting both cultural practices and technological advancements.', 'The global hair care and beauty industries have traditionally been considered recession-resistant, as they fall within the consumer staples category, alongside essential items like groceries and cleaning supplies. In addition, given that numerous hair care and beauty brands also qualify as luxury products, the sector operates as a hybrid, blending features of consumer staples and luxury goods to provide the advantages of both. However, the COVID-19 pandemic challenged this perception. Lockdowns and consumer concerns about infection prompted widespread closures of retail and salon stores, resulting in weakened sales across the beauty and personal care product market back in 2022. In response to these challenges, industry leaders were forced to devise strategies to attract more consumers.', ""In 2022, the average American consumer spent approximately $86 on hair care products. Among these, shampoo emerged as the most profitable, generating sales of approximately $3.6 billion, followed by hair conditioner and hair coloring, with unit sales reaching 172 million units in the women's hair coloring category. More prevalently, hair growth treatments have gained significant attention in the beauty industry. As more consumers express interest in products that combat hair loss and thinning, the hair growth category has seen a surge in both unit and dollar sales in the United States. In 2022, dollar sales of hair growth products amounted to about $121 million. This category encompasses various product types, including oils such as rosemary oil, as well as more conventional hair care items like shampoo and conditioner, formulated with ingredients aimed at promoting hair growth or preventing hair loss."", 'The evolving fashion trends and growing awareness of new, safer, and more effective hair care products have fueled a notable surge in their usage, consequently driving growth in the global hair care market. According to a market report by Fortune Business Insights, the global hair care market is forecasted to expand from $99.53 billion in 2023 to $147.49 billion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.8% during the forecast period.', 'Investors are increasingly turning to shares of hair care companies as a hedge against potential periods of inflation.

Please note that these 256 index members collectively account for 69.6% of the index's total market capitalization. Total Q4 earnings for these companies are up +4.4% from the same period last year on +3.2% higher revenues, with 81.6% beating EPS estimates and 64.1% beating revenue estimates. "", 'The earnings and revenue growth pace for these 256 index members represents a notable acceleration from other recent quarters, wih the Q4 earnings growth rate the highest for this group of companies since +5.7% in 2022 Q2 and the revenue growth pace the highest the +3.8% in 2023 Q1.

The company is navigating the challenging macroeconomic conditions by leveraging its PPI Business System to deliver strong financial results.The company advanced its proven growth strategy by launching a range of high-impact, innovative new products. The recent launch of the Thermo Scientific Meridian EX System and the Thermo Scientific Aquanex Ultrapure Water Purification System are likely to drive the company’s future growth.The company also opened a customer experience center for battery manufacturing in Seoul to support its material science customers as they accelerate the development of the next generation of environment-friendly energy solutions.However, the year-over-year decline in revenues in Life Science Solutions and Laboratory Products looks disappointing. The contraction of gross margins looks discouraging, too.(You can read the full research report on Thermo Fisher Scientific here >>>)Philip Morris shares have declined -3.0% over the past six months against the Zacks Tobacco industry’s decline of -3.8%. The company has been benefiting from its pricing power. Higher pricing variance was an upside to the company’s performance in the third quarter of 2023 and is likely to remain a driver.A focus on reduced-risk products, especially IQOS, has been working well for Philip Morris, which is well-placed to become a majority smoke-free company by 2025. Strength in ZYN is also expected to drive performance in 2023. Management expects net revenues to increase by nearly 8% on an organic basis in 2023. Philip Morris expects to make additional growth-oriented investments in 2023, including the commercialization of ILUMA.However, this may impact margins. Apart from this, soft cigarette shipment volumes have been a concern. In 2023, cigarette shipment volumes are expected to decline by 1-2%. Shares of Philip Morris have lagged the industry year to date.(You can read the full research report on Philip Morris here >>>)Shares of General Dynamics have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past six months (+18.2% vs. -3.9%). The company’s R&D expenses in product development will strengthen its footprint in the business jet market. Its G400 is expected to enter service in 2025.General Dynamics has a solid solvency position and a strong international presence. An impressive backlog of $93.63 billion at the end of the fourth quarter indicates solid demand for the company’s products. Its shares have outperformed its industry in the past year.However, higher fuel prices continue to pose risks to its operations.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates."", 'The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 13. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', ""This world's largest beverage maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.48 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +6.7%."", 'Revenues are expected to be $10.63 billion, up 5% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.3% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.

This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Coke?', ""For Coke, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.70%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.', 'So, this combination indicates that Coke will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Coke would post earnings of $0.69 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.74, delivering a surprise of +7.25%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", 'Coke appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Mark Marron. Mark?"", 'Mark Marron', ""Thank you, Erica, and thank you, everyone, for participating in today's call to discuss our third quarter fiscal 2024 results. Our year-to-date performance has been solid, with net sales growth of 6% outpacing the industry and our peers. Customers' adoption of digital transformation technologies, security solutions, and IT infrastructure to support AI remain strong. Quarter-to-quarter top-line performance has been more variable than in prior years mostly due to supply chain fluctuations, which affected both customer behavior as well as our ability to ship equipment. Over the past few years, large enterprise customers ordered equipment well in advance of expected need in order to safeguard their mission-critical projects. As a result, we built a backlog of booked orders, and as the supply chain eased, we were able to ship this backlog equipment, helping to drive strong 22% sales growth in the first half of the fiscal year. Following that wave of shipments, we saw some customers pause new orders in Q3 as they deploy these delivered products. As a result, in our third quarter, net sales were down 18%, but it's important to note that our gross profit held more stable and was down only 3.3%. A contributing factor to the gross profit was our service revenues, which were up 10.7% as we deployed projects for our customers. And our services gross profit increased 21% year over year, driven by double-digit gross profit gains in both professional and managed services. Overall, our services gross margin was up 340 basis points, and we had another strong quarter with our managed services revenue up 22%. Given the mission-critical nature of managed services we provide, this business is characterized by recurring and predictable revenue streams. This revenue not only enhances our financial visibility, but also offers new opportunities for growth as we provide existing customers with additional managed service offerings that address their evolving IT needs. The services growth noted above, along with solid product margins and strong contribution from our financing segment, helped our consolidated gross margin increased by 410 basis points. It's also important to note that our year-to-date consolidated gross profit increased 9% on an increase of 6% in net sales. Net income declined 23.6% for the quarter and increased 8.4% year to date. Net earnings were affected by lower product sales, higher acquisition related amortization expenses, and higher personnel costs. We continue to invest strategically in building out our AI sales and consultative resources, AI optimized solutions and lab capabilities, which underscores our confidence in our growth prospects. While sales cycles have lengthened somewhat, we do not view this quarter's sales decline as a trend, and our annual guidance remains unchanged. It is worth noting again that we faced a tough compare with gross billings up almost 30% last year in this quarter. We believe fundamental demand parameters remain intact and consider the variability in our quarterly sales this year as primarily a timing issue on when and how deals fell between quarters. We expect sales growth in our fourth quarter, enabling us to achieve the lower end of our guidance range. While still early in its evolution, generative AI represents a promising long-term growth opportunity for both our product and services business. We have deep credentials in the AI world, and AI is in a new solution set for ePlus. We have been strategizing, building engineering expertise, and aligning with top vendors for years. In March of 2018, we were named Elite Level as a deep learning partner for NVIDIA were also an early distribution partner for Aerie. The AI. ready infrastructure architected by Pure Storage and in video, which recognized our vision and integration capabilities. We are excited about the possibilities for AI. And we recently announced our AI. Ignite program that will help customers explore, adopt and optimize AI. It will help show what is possible with their data and applications, ensure their business and strategy is aligned and help drive scale efficiencies and cost savings. Our AI capabilities, including consulting, managed services and training, enable our customers to implement complex AI architectures that are cost effective, scalable and secure. We continue to work closely with our ERP partners to develop innovative AI, optimized infrastructure for our customers that can include working on voice recognition projects or autonomous driving initiatives, scanning physical images to provide a better patient experience or just help customers embark on their artificial intelligence and machine learning plans. Our financing segment reported solid third quarter results, fueled primarily by high transactional gains and portfolio earnings during the quarter, we executed on several large contracts resulting in strong year-on-year volume growth, accompanied by even higher growth in the third quarter. Segment adjusted EBITDA financing remains an important competitive differentiator for ePlus offering flexibility for our customers, particularly in more challenging economic periods. Acquisitions remain a key element of our growth strategy, and we continuously evaluate potential opportunities that would enhance our offerings, strengthen our capabilities and expand our geographical presence. We were also pleased to complete the acquisition of Peak Resources on January 26th because as a solution provider in Denver and the Mountain West with enterprise customers and a corporate culture that parallels our own. This is another example of a geographic strategic acquisition that provides a platform for us to build out the Mountain West region, we believe we can deploy our broader solutions portfolio to their customer base, which should help drive incremental growth in the future. Our strong balance sheet, including third quarter ending cash of $142 million. The highest level in the past seven quarters provides us with the flexibility to opportunistically pursue acquisitions that both align with our strategic objectives and are financially accretive. I'd like to thank the E-Plus team for their continued dedication in a challenging operating environment. I will now turn the call over to Wayne to discuss our financial results in more detail. After early in his remarks, I will provide our financial outlook for fiscal 2020 for."", 'Elaine Marion', ""Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide additional details about our financial performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, consolidated net sales amounted to 509.1 million compared to 623.5 million in the prior year quarter. Technology business net sales were $494.2 million, down from $611.8 million reported in last year's third quarter. The decline was due to lower product sales as improved product availability in the first half of the fiscal year enabled clients to complete previously delayed projects. Service revenue grew 10.7% to $74.7 million, led by double digit growth in managed services within our technology business, sales were broad-based across customer verticals. On a trailing 12 month basis, our two largest verticals continue to be telecom, media and entertainment and technology representing 24% and 17% of our technology business, net sales, respectively. Sled, health care and financial services accounted for 1613 and 10% of our technology business net sales, respectively, with the remaining 20% divided among other end markets. Net sales in our financing segment were $14.9 million, up from $11.7 million in the prior year due to higher transactional gains and portfolio earnings, although Consolidated gross profit decreased 3.3% year to year to 133.8 million. Consolidated gross margin expanded by 410 basis points to 26.3%. All three of our technology segments contributed to the improvement in gross margin, with product gross margin gaining 270 basis points to 21.9%, mainly due to a larger proportion of third party maintenance and services sold in the current quarter, which are recorded on a net basis, managed services gross margin showed a 330 basis point improvement to 31.8% due to scaled growth in these services. While professional services gross margin grew by 420 basis points to 43.3%, benefiting from a shift in mix to higher margin services. Consolidated operating expenses of $95.8 million increased 4.2% year over year, reflecting the increases in salary and benefits from additional headcount as well as increases and acquisition related depreciation and amortization expenses. Our total headcount at the end of December 2023 was 897, up 152 from a year ago, partially due to the acquisition of Network Solutions Group completed in April 2023, which added 83 employees of the 152 additional employees, 133 were in customer-facing roles on a consolidated basis, operating income declined from 46.5 million to 38 million. Earnings before taxes were 38.4 million, down from $49.4 million reported in last year's third quarter. The decrease was due to lower sales as well as the benefit in last year's third quarter from foreign currency gains and a class action payment, which together totaled 2.8 million. The effective tax rate was 29% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 27.7% in the year ago quarter consolidated net earnings were 27.3 million or $1.2 per diluted share compared to net earnings of 35.7 million or $1.34 per diluted share last year, respectively. Non-gaap diluted earnings per share were $1.18 compared to $1.38 in the year ago period. Our diluted share count at the end of the quarter was $26.7 million, unchanged from the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA decreased to 46.2 million versus $53.3 million in the prior year, due primarily to a 23.3% adjusted EBITDA decline in the technology business. Moving to our consolidated results. For the nine months ended December 31st, 2023, net sales grew 6% to $1.67 billion, led by 6.5% net sales growth in the technology business. Gross billings in the technology business were $2.5 billion, an improvement of 3.4% versus the prior year period. Consolidated gross profit rose 9.2% to $420.4 million and consolidated gross margin expanded 80 basis points to 25.2% due to improved margins for both product and services. Consolidated net earnings were $93.8 million, or $3.52 per diluted share, representing increases of 8.4% and 8.6%, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA grew 8.2% to $153.6 million, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share expanded by 9% to $3.99. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $142.2 million, the highest in two years as compared to $103.1 million at the end of fiscal 2023. Conversely, inventories declined to 218 million from $243.3 million at the end of March 2023, representing the lowest level in nearly two years. We've seen supply chain pressures continue to ease, enabling us to fulfill prior customer orders and complete related services, which should support further inventory reduction over time. Further, inventory turns continue to improve to 27 days compared to 29 days in the preceding quarter and 38 days at the end of fiscal 2023. Stockholders' equity increased 12.2% to 877.8 million from the end of fiscal 2023. Our cash conversion cycle was 54 days compared to 51 days in the year-ago quarter and 59 days at the end of fiscal 2023. Given this improvement year to date, operating cash flows were $143.5 million compared to $147 million of cash used in the same period last year. While we expect our customers to be more conservative with their IT spending in the remainder of fiscal 2024. As Mark mentioned, E-Plus remains well positioned in the market, given our strategic focus on higher growth end markets, and we remain confident in achieving the low end of our guidance range. I want to thank our talented ePlus employees for continuing to drive our solid financial performance for the first nine months of fiscal 2024. With that, I will turn the call back to Mark."", 'Mark Marron', ""Mark? Thank you, Elaine. Driven by our strategy targeting higher-growth market segments like cloud, networking, collaboration and security, E-Plus has generated strong financial performance through the first nine months of our fiscal year. Specifically, fiscal year to date, consolidated net sales are up 6%, adjusted EBITDA is up 8% and diluted earnings per share has increased 9% despite ongoing economic uncertainty and the associated impact on IT spending. Looking forward, we expect our fourth quarter results will improve sequentially from the third quarter as customer sentiment is positive. As a result, we maintain our 2024 financial guidance with an expectation that we will achieve the lower end of the range driven by a reacceleration of growth in our technology business and continued positive momentum in services. Even as the overall IT spending environment remains challenging, we remain confident in the strength of our marketing position and in our growth strategy with our many industry partners, ePlus offers innovative, scalable solutions that cost-effectively address our customers' needs today and for the future, we remain committed to driving profitable growth and building long-term value for our shareholders. Operator, let's now open the call for questions. Thank you."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Maggie Nolan, William Blair.', 'Maggie Nolan', 'I think you, Mark, you mentioned part of this quarter performance was influenced by timing of deals. Have you seen some of those deals closed so far in January or how are you feeling about the ability to close those in the coming months?', 'Mark Marron', ""Yes. Hey, Maggie, how are you? So yes, we've seen activity pick up in Q4. We've already seen some of those deals closed. And just to give you a quick recap on the quarter, Maggie. So first off, it was a volume issue where net sales was down 18.4%, but our gross profit was only down 3.3%. And a lot of that had to do with our strong margins, our services uptick, and we had a pause with our enterprise customers, but we also saw it saw an uptick in our project services. So that was kind of the offset there. And then we had a nice finance quarter as well. But really what we're seeing, Maggie, is what it came down to is timing issues between the quarters. So if you think about it with the supply chain easing, we were up 22% in the first half. What we saw was the pause with some of the some of our bigger enterprise customers. Plus, if you remember, we kind of pointed out, we had a tough compare this quarter where our adjusted gross billings sorry, our gross billings were up almost 30% last year and this quarter, but with all of that we expect the growth to be back to a little bit normal ranges in Q4 and deliver a solid fiscal year and hit the low end of our guidance range."", 'Maggie Nolan', ""That's really helpful, Mark. And then the one other piece about what you had talked about and maybe there are some lengthening sales cycles and maybe that's some of the enterprise commentary that you were giving, but you felt like that wasn't necessarily indicative of a trend yet. Can you elaborate on why that may not be a trend and what you're seeing out there in the market?"", 'Mark Marron', ""Yes, Maggie, you know, it's funny what we soaring in the calendar year end, the end of our Q. three was not the normal year end budget flush that we see. But since the fourth quarter beginning of January, January has picked up. We've seen orders pipeline all pick up nicely. So some of the enterprise deals have actually some of the deals that moved pushed from Q3 into Q4 have closed and some of the time lines people seem to whether it's a budgeting issue or not have started to move forward a little bit quicker in terms of their sales cycle. Still not back to I'll call it pre-COVID levels, if you will, as it relates to the sales cycle, but definitely improved from Q3."", 'Maggie Nolan', 'Thank you, Bill.', 'Mark Marron', ""Hey, Maggie. One other thing to just to point out, you note it's an interesting time with the supply chain. So what we believe happened at least with us is we had a lot of customers that were deploying technology that we delivered in the first half, especially in this Q three. So it's a it really is a timing issue between the quarters with the supply chain, deploying that technology and then customers starting to invest, whether it's in security or AI or things along those lines."", 'Maggie Nolan', ""Okay. That's helpful. Thank you."", 'Mark Marron', 'Thanks, Maggie.', 'Operator', 'Matt Sheerin, Stifel.', 'Matt Sheerin', ""Yes, thank you, Mark. I just wanted to follow up on Maggie's question regarding your outlook. I'm looking at my model here in going back seven years. You've been down sequentially every March quarter and it does sound like you didn't see the seasonal trends that you typically expect. So I guess a question other than that, you've seen some pickup here in January. Is your backlog or any other sort of tangible evidence that you can point to this saw this rebound here?"", 'Mark Marron', ""Yes. Hey, Matt, good question. So what we've seen is some of the deals that we just discussed with Maggie that pushed from Q3 into Q4, the demand parameters have really not changed that as it relates and I got to admit, Matt, this is a little bit different than our normal seasonal in OQ. three to q four and a lot of this is timing. The other thing I'd ask you to kind of keep in mind as you go through your models, if you look at the first half, our net sales were up 22%. I think it was in the first half and our net sales year to date are up 6%. And our gross profits up 9%. So it's in line with what we were thinking for the quarter. A lot of it just came down to timing issues and a lot of it's supply chain related and customers pushing deals out from Q3 to Q4 for whatever reasons."", 'Matt Sheerin', ""Got it. But it wouldn't seem that supply chain would be an issue, right? Because everyone saying that products are readily available. Cisco's talked about that your networking sales were down 24% year over year. So I'm trying to figure out is it supply chain or just customers being more cautious?"", 'Mark Marron', ""Yes, hey, Matt. Two things. If you think about it, what I'm saying on the supply chain is that a lot of customers in our first half, we were up 22%. And some of our bigger customers were actually installing implementing deploying that technology as compared to buying new technology. So some of those bigger customers, as you know, had the wherewithal and the capabilities to order in advance. So that's what we're seeing in the quarter. And then if you look at it for the year, we're still up 6% on the net sales and 9% on our gross profit. So the other factor that comes into play is if you look at our services, they were up 10.7% and our project services were up nicely, both from a revenue and from a gross margin standpoint. So some of that ties to what I'm talking about with the projects being deployed as come as compared to buying new technology. Second, part of that is what I had said to Maggie a little bit earlier is that some of these deals some of these enterprise deals or customers pushed into Q4, and we've seen an early pickup, and we don't think the demand parameters are changing both in terms of our pipeline, our backlog and what we're hearing from our sales teams related to their forecast for Q4."", 'Matt Sheerin', 'I got it. Okay. And could you remind me on the revenue contribution from the in this quarter from the acquisition that you just completed, does that have much of an impact?', 'Mark Marron', 'It was a Matt. It was immaterial to net sales, maybe 3% to 4% of net sales. So it was immaterial for the quarter.', 'Matt Sheerin', 'Okay. I mean but for the March quarter, Allied, I could you just you just you just closed the acquisition, right? So you have a quarter where revenues also?', 'Mark Marron', ""Yes, sorry, that's immaterial to Matt. That's a a small acquisition, roughly 35, 36 employees. What it does for us, it gives us a platform for the Mountain West. And they've got skill sets in the kind of data center cloud security space that we can we can build upon and then bring all the other things that E-Plus brings to the table. So we think it's a nice platform to build on, but it's immaterial for Q4. Okay."", 'Matt Sheerin', ""Fair enough. And just relative to your EBITDA guidance for the year at the low end, that would imply that your EBITDA or operating margin for the March quarter would be or an operating profit would be down year over year despite a good revenue growth because your revenue growth is going to be up double digits year over year. So what's Vinita what's happening there and why is that down?"", 'Mark Marron', ""Well, I think if you look at it, Matt is probably some of the things that we talk about. We're investing for the future. So we believe we're a growth company. So we didn't touch on AI. yet, but we've made some big investments as it relates to resources, AI, optimized solutions. We built out a lab, a customer innovation center. So a lane touched on our head count was up. I think it was 152 employees, I'd say about 130 to 100, 35 were customer facing. So and you'll see our salaries and benefits still up based on the investments we're making there. And then over time, I think you'll start to see operating leverage, but we still believe we'll be in the range on the adjusted EBITDA and the net sales on the low end that we talked about. Okay."", 'Matt Sheerin', 'Very good. Thank you very much.', 'Mark Marron', 'All right. Thanks, Matt.', 'Operator', 'Greg Burns, Sidoti.', 'Greg Burns', ""Craig, your line is open faster and sort of a kind of follow-up on the on the product sales. Is just a little bit of a bottleneck. You saw this quarter, Cisco imply that maybe there was a couple of quarters like it was going to be longer duration here to work through some of this bottleneck of product that's been shipped, but it seems like you feel that you're going to rebound pretty quickly in the next quarter. Can you just help us understand what gives you confidence there? I know you touched on a little bit, but Cisco in particular seem to think that it was going to be a little bit of a longer term headwind for them to work through this product product that's out in the market?"", 'Mark Marron', ""Yes, hey, Greg, how are you? So a couple of different things. So I don't I don't think we have the I'll say, supply chain issues that Cisco has. Now. Obviously, it's a portion of what we do, but we've seen our open orders continue to go down on a regular basis overall. So I think some of it is open. Orders are getting closer. I won't say they're at pre-COVID levels, but they're a little more. I don't know if normalized, but at more natural levels that we think. So we've got a good handle on our open orders slash backlog. You know, the supply chain easing really eased up a lot for us. I can't speak to Cisco, but for us in the first half, if you think about it being up 22%, I don't think there were too many companies out there up 22% in the first half on net sales. So you had that supply chain easing. And then the other thing for the quarter is we've seen the activity pickup. We've got the forecast from our sales team and the demand parameters really haven't changed for us. We feel we're in the right value added areas with cloud security network modernization, AI and all those services we're predicting. So that would be the reason behind it."", 'Greg Burns', 'Okay. And then with some your AI practice, a Ignite, is that mainly a services opportunity like a professional service opportunity. Is there hardware associated with that? And do you feel like you have the the capabilities in-house to grow that business? Or is that something that you need to maybe add inorganic inorganic expertise to grow that part of your business?', 'Mark Marron', ""Yes. So Hey, Greg, a couple of different things there. One is in the early innings, if you think about it, but I think it's going to change how companies operate as they go forward in the future. The other thing, and it kind of fits right in our wheelhouse. So if you think about converged infrastructure, hyper-converged AI. optimized infrastructure is the same thing in terms of compute, networking, storage and all the things that kind of plays to our strengths. So a lot of that we have resources, but we have invested in additional resources. And I had mentioned the lab and the customer innovation center, but it's not just a services play. So it's actually the services is the first part of it where we help them kind of explore, adopt and optimize AI. And that means, you know, are they ready for AI envisioning workshops, really it's about the data. It's kind of a data strategy. First is you've got all this data that's expanding exponentially, if you will. So then you've got to think through governance and risk. Once you've decided on your AI strategy, then it gets into what I call the IT optimized infrastructure, which is the hardware play and to be honest, Greg, the it's a big play where it's a big opportunity in the market. So I think I'm saying what anybody else would say related to a I know it's early innings, but it's both the services and a product play for us. And the product play kind of fits with our heritage and our history. And what we're good at are perfect."", 'Greg Burns', 'Thank you.', 'Mark Marron', 'Okay. All right, Greg, thank you and everybody. Thank you for joining us today for our quarterly earnings report. We appreciate that you took the time and have a good night. Take care.', 'Operator', ""Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now who knows me move in. Yes, yes.""]"

Truist Co-Chief Investment Officer and Chief Market Strategist Keith Lerner explains how he is advising clients around the presidential election, including how much farther the AI hype can drive Magnificent Seven leaders.', '""I tell clients today... markets have done good and bad under both Democrats and Republicans. More important for this economy and the stock market, is the Fed going to be able to stick the soft landing?"" Lerner says.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: When you talk to clients, how concerned are they about the election? Do you hear a change in their tone when they ask you about this? And are they making changes to their portfolio today?', ""KEITH LERNER: Yeah, as a strategist, my least favorite year is around the election time, because people tend to make the wrong decision based on their political views. And we write a paper every four years saying, don't mix portfolio and politics. To your question, it's starting. It will get-- as we go further in the year, we'll start having that as one of the main conversation."", 'But I tell clients today, markets have done good and bad under both Democrats and Republicans. More important for this economy and the stock market will-- is the Fed going to be able to stick the soft landing?', 'I remember back in 2020, I mean, that was a heated election as well. And we wrote a note back then saying, I know you have a sensitivity around the election. But what happens with COVID? What happens with the vaccinations and so forth?', ""And it was notable in November, right after the election, Pfizer came out with their vaccine and the market took off. So again, I'm not saying it's not important. And it could certainly drive different industries and so forth. But I think the direction of the economy is more important."", ""BRIAN SOZZI: Keith, are they raising cash now? If they're sitting on the Magnificent Seven paper gains, are they selling a little bit now or in moving to treasuries or not?"", ""KEITH LERNER: No, we're not seeing anything really directly related to the election yet. I think-- listen, we haven't really seen all the rhetoric that's coming. We know as we get deeper into the year, that's going to drive more of those conversations. We have seen over the last year-- obviously, a lot of money and money markets and treasuries. And I always tell people that everyone loves 5% treasuries until the market's up 20% itself."", ""SEANA SMITH: Keith, well, one thing that we have seen is there's still a lot of excitement surrounding AI. When you take a look at Palantir, the results that we got last night, that stock up about 20% here shortly after the open. There's been so much talk of an AI bubble, and whether or not that is maybe at risk of popping any time soon. Is there still an investment opportunity in AI? And I guess how are you advising clients to identify those more attractive opportunities?"", ""KEITH LERNER: Yeah, it's a great question, and I think one we're all wrestling with as you talked earlier about that Magnificent Seven. So, I don't think there's an AI bubble yet. There's definitely parts of the market that's speculative. But I think, if you think about AI, we're still in the early phases. I mean, we've had the infrastructure, the chips, and so forth. The next phase of this is going to be the adopters and what businesses are able to amplify this."", ""If you think about-- I think about-- and I got in the business in '97. I equate it back then-- you had like the Cisco Systems of the world building the infrastructure, and then you had the Amazons leveraging. So I think what we're going to see over the next year-- the next few years is really the transition on who's really leveraging AI the best.""]"

They are on the move, though, as we're taking a look at the S&P 500. That is flat, just barely to the upside here. The Dow also trying to hold onto gains. The NASDAQ, though, in the red. Investors await more Fed speak from officials like Loretta Mester and Neel Kashkari. That's set to come later today."", ""SEANA SMITH: All right, let's get to some of those individual names. First up, it's Hertz. Shares now up about 3.5%, reversing some of the earlier declines that we saw in the stock. Now there was initial concern about the company's warning about higher repair costs and also the drop in residual value that was related to its Tesla fleet."", ""Now we know that Hertz offloaded about 20,000 EVs in the quarter. And that contributed to a wider than expected loss. The CEO there saying though that cost cuts is going to help a better position. Hertz looking ahead to 2025. Again, you're looking at gains of about 3.5%."", ""BRAD SMITH: We're also watching GE Healthcare this morning, out with results. The company reporting better than expected profit and revenue for the fourth quarter, offsetting a soft growth forecast and sending shares higher here right now. They're up by about 8%. The CEO saying he is confident in an improved landscape."", ""SEANA SMITH: And Cisco shares popping on news that it's teaming up with NVIDIA. We're looking at gains of nearly 1%. We can call it a pop, I guess. OK, NVIDIA on a cloud-based AI initiative for enterprise. Now the two tech giants are going to help companies build in-house AI computing as part of the effort to spread AI computing to a wider market increase, that wider market adoption there. But again, you're looking at Cisco shares up about 1%.""]"
