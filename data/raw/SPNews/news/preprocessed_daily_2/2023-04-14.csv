While Interactive Brokers is focused on faster-growing international markets and more sophisticated traders, Charles Schwab is a more mature US business focused on retirement accounts and wealth managers.My view changed when it became clear that liquidity would become a greater issue for all banks in early March. We believe Schwab has enough liquidity to operate its business, but we no longer believe the company is in a position to return capital. Furthermore, Schwab saw a higher degree of deposit flight in Q4 than we expected leading us to believe the problem could get worse before it gets better. Schwab may even need to raise additional equity capital to reassure the market of its liquidity position which would drastically change the risk/reward calculation of investing in the stock. While we realized a ~6% loss on our investment, our ability to quickly recalibrate our views during the early stages of the March banking crisis prevented us from losing an additional 20%+ if we had held on until today.This episode strengthened our conviction in Interactive Brokers (our largest holding), which we view as having a superior business model. Schwab’s model relies on capturing a disproportionate share of the upside from higher interest rates because it does not charge additional fees. Interactive Brokers shares most of the upside from higher interest rates because it primarily monetizes accounts with low-cost commission revenue. IB is now offering an industry-leading rate of 4.33% on uninvested cash which they are proudly advertising on TV and radio. The cherry on top is that Interactive Brokers does all this while taking virtually zero risk with its balance sheet. This allows Interactive Brokers to play offense and take market share while its competitors scramble to preserve liquidity.""Story continuesCreative Collage Of Business Team Working On Project And Stock Markets Data On Trasparent Screen, Financial Statistics Layered Over Man Using Laptop For Trading On Forex, PanoramaInteractive Brokers Group, Inc.

Even though Schwab noted that there might still be pricing risk if inflation continued to rise, the risk then was offset somewhat by the Fed’s tightening efforts.A year later, inflation has finally begun to move lower and the Fed’s rate hikes have eased, at least somewhat. Meanwhile, Schwab’s own exposure to bonds — it held about $28 billion in bond losses on paper at the end of 2022 — pulled it into the recent financial crisis that first hit Silicon Valley Bank, The New York Times reported.As the NYT noted, the bond losses were tied to rapidly rising interest rates. Many financial institutions held long-term bonds with low interest rates, which made them less attractive amid a rise in new bonds with higher interest rates.“The Federal Reserve raised rates more than they have in 40 years. That caused massive losses inside of bonds,” Robert Gilliland, managing director at Concenture Wealth Management, told CNBC. “It’s important to understand that bonds are generally secure, but not necessarily safe.”Does that mean you should shy away from long-term bonds now?Not necessarily.Take Our Poll: Are You Concerned About the Safety of Your Money in Your Bank Accounts?Because of what happened in 2022, bonds now offer more attractive interest payments to investors. Six-month Treasury bonds currently pay an interest rate of 4.985%, according to CNBC — well up from 1.188% a year ago.And because the Fed raised interest rates so high and so fast in 2022, many experts expect the central bank to slow its pace considerably this year.Story continuesThat doesn’t mean you should start moving great sums of money into bonds — especially if your portfolio is heavily geared toward stocks. But if your investment plan already includes a bond allocation, you might consider moving to longer-dated bonds, according to Derek Pszenny, cofounder of Carolina Wealth Management.The reason is that bonds with longer maturities are usually more sensitive to moves in interest rates. If the Fed begins decreasing interest rates, long-term bonds will be the biggest beneficiaries, Pszenny told CNBC.More From GOBankingRates10 Aldi Brand Products Worth BuyingLearn To Master Your Money With These Financial TipsHow to Build a Financial Plan From ZeroFinancial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily NewsletterThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Charles Schwab Recommended Adding This Asset to Your Portfolio for Better Returns — Should You Still Do It?]"

Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.11%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 4.08%.Coming into today, shares of the chipmaker had gained 2.36% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 9.46%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 6.51%.Texas Instruments will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be April 25, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.76, down 25.11% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $4.36 billion, down 11.07% from the prior-year quarter.TXN's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $7.53 per share and revenue of $18.11 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -19.81% and -9.6%, respectively.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Texas Instruments. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Texas Instruments currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).In terms of valuation, Texas Instruments is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 23.89. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 18.44, which means Texas Instruments is trading at a premium to the group.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that TXN currently has a PEG ratio of 2.56. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account.

These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Texas Instruments have gained +6.7% over the past year against the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry's gain of +12.8%. The company is benefiting from growing demand for embedded technologies across the automotive and industrial markets. Moreover, a solid rebound in the automotive market remains a positive.Further, the strengthening demand in industrial, communication equipment and enterprise systems markets is a tailwind. Notably, solid investments in new growth avenues and competitive advantages remain tailwinds. Further, its portfolio of long-lived products and efficient manufacturing strategies are other positives.However, pandemic-led supply-chain disruptions and imposition of new export regulations are headwinds. Further, weakness in the Analog segment of the company is a concern. Additionally, softness in the personal electronics end-market remains an overhang.(You can read the full research report on Texas Instruments here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of TotalEnergies have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry over the past year (+33.5% vs. +17.4%). The company continues to benefit from startups, well-spread LNG assets and an expanding upstream portfolio that has exposure to fast-growing hydrocarbon-producing regions. Lower exposure to mature assets acts as a tailwind.TTE streamlines its portfolio through acquisitions, partnerships and divestitures. TTE has enough liquidity to meet its near-term debt obligations. TTE is making investments to expand the renewable operation and aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.However, TTE's production is impacted by the security-related production cuts in some regions. TTE remains exposed to acquisition-related risks as these assets contribute a sizable volume to production. A natural decline in production and TTE's withdrawal from Russia might affect profitability.(You can read the full research report on TotalEnergies here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Raytheon Technologies' shares have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense Equipment industry over the past six months (+21.4% vs. +18.1%). The company continues to receive ample orders for its combat-proven defense products and expects both domestic and international program growth to remain robust for its defense business.This should boost the revenue generation prospects for its defense business. A steady recovery in commercial air traffic continues to boost commercial OEM as well as commercial aftermarket sales for it. The stock holds a solid solvency position.Yet, economic sanctions imposed by governments in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine might hurt Raytheon. A comparative analysis of its trailing 12-month Price/Book ratio indicates a relatively gloomy picture, which may concern investors'. The appreciating U.S. dollar has been burdening airlines, which may hurt the stock.(You can read the full research report on Raytheon Technologies here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Morgan Stanley and The Progressive Corp..Story continuesZacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double"" From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come.

Two, the banking system has started to stumble amid sharply higher interest rates. While this has been rough for bank investors, we’re now seeing a rotation out of financials and back into growth stocks. From here, if inflation starts to come down and interest rates reverse course, we could see a meaningful recovery in growth stocks.In any case, many growth stocks are priced for attractive returns after steep declines in 2022.

Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockVisa (NYSE:V) along with Mastercard (NYSE:MA) have a tremendous business model which reliably earns some of the highest EBITDA profit margins of any S&amp;P 500 constituent companies.What makes Visa’s business model so great is that it doesn’t take credit risk. Rather, the bank that issues a credit card shoulders the risk if a client fails to pay. Visa, by contrast, is paid on transactions. As volumes go up, so do Visa’s profits. With inflation setting in globally, that leads to an increase in Visa’s business as well as average transaction size goes up.Visa was hampered over the past few years due to the pandemic. It charges much higher fees on international cross-border transactions, which were necessarily limited in recent times. With global travel roaring back, however, Visa’s next leg up should be upon us. Meanwhile, V stock has been flat over the past two years, making for a more attractive entry point today.Unity Software (U)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comUnity Software (NYSE:U) is the operator of a leading graphics engine. Game developers use Unity as the framework for designing video games. All because the company is highly flexible, allowing developers to build a game that will work cross-platform across PC, consoles, mobile, and even augmented and virtual reality.Reportedly, Mark Zuckerburg wanted to acquire Unity for Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) to be a central piece of Meta’s virtual reality plans. However, that never came to fruition and Unity remains an independent company today.Analysts expect for Unity to reach profitability in 2023. Better, top-line revenue growth is expected to run nearly 20%/year over the next few years, which is an impressive base for a company that already generates $2 billion per year in annualized revenues. With Meta shares on the rebound, and potential revival of interest in the metaverse or augmented reality could bode well for U stock.Dutch Bros (BROS)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Dutch Bros (NYSE:BROS) is a small, but rapidly growing coffee chain. The firm is seeking to shake up the industry and take some significant market share from Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX).Starbucks has long dominated the American coffee market. However, the pandemic caused people to reimagine their daily routines. Now, some people may not want to linger at Starbucks stores like they did before. Dutch Bros is well-positioned for this, as it operates small stores that emphasize serving folks quickly rather than being a place to hang out for extended periods.Dutch Bros has also focused on customer service. It is known for having upbeat personable staff. Given Starbucks’ current issues with labor unions and potential worker strikes, Dutch Bros’ focus on its employees could be a strong feature.It remains to be seen just how much purchasing power and economic activity the next generation will account for. That said, Dutch Bros looks like an early entrant in the category of growth stocks that will win as Gen Z — aka the “zoomers” — start to make their presence felt in the economy.Toast (TOST)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comSticking with restaurants, there’s Toast (NYSE:TOST), which offers a cloud-based digital technology platform for restaurants, bars, and other such related types of businesses.Toast offers its clients a sophisticated point-of-sale (POS) system that handles ordering and payments for restaurants. The company also offers other related products and services such as its mobile order and pay offerings, its kitchen display system, and a management tool that allows restaurants to set and change menus across multiple locations and channels. Within payments, Toast has other features such as a card-reader which enable contactless payments.Toast has had success in recent years, growing from about $665 million in revenues in 2019 to an estimated $3.5 billion in sales in 2023. The pandemic, in particular, drove a great deal of adoption as restaurants needed to enable contactless payments, digital ordering, and other such features that Toast offers.Toast is still unprofitable, which can be risky given current market conditions. However, shares have pulled back from $25 to $17 since February. That has TOST stock at a market capitalization of less than $9 billion, which works out to less than three times revenues. That’s not a bad price.Texas Instruments (TXN)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is the world’s largest analog semiconductor company. Analog semiconductors are of vital importance, since they can take real-world information, such as climatological observations, and convert them into data that software can utilize.These analog semiconductors will be vital for many emerging industries and technologies such as connected and self-driving cars, Internet of Things devices, remote monitoring and security, and many other such functions. The analog chips are also less cyclical than other parts of the industry, like memory, since analog feeds into many industrial applications rather than just fast-moving consumer electronics devices.Texas Instruments’ unceasing focus is on growing its free cash flow generated per share. This has allowed the firm to repurchase large amounts of stock while also giving shareholders generous dividend increases. With TXN stock flat over the past year, shares are at a reasonable 23x forward earnings. That’s a fine price given that Texas Instruments has put up an incredible 20%/year compounded earnings growth rate over the past decade.Concentrix (CNXC)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comConcentrix (NASDAQ:CNXC) is a technology firm which offers data processing and outsourcing services for its clients.

As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Western Digital’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. See our latest analysis for Western Digital Is Western Digital Still Cheap?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 19% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Western Digital today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $45.29, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Western Digital’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from Western Digital?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with an extremely negative double-digit change in profit expected next year, near-term growth is certainly not a driver of a buy decision. It seems like high uncertainty is on the cards for Western Digital, at least in the near future.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Currently, WDC appears to be trading around its fair value, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to reduce the risk in your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock beneficial for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on the stock, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on WDC for a while, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The stock appears to be trading at fair value, which means there’s less benefit from mispricing. Furthermore, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help gel your views on WDC should the price fluctuate below its true value.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

15,87af0baa-6cda-3f96-8055-a76cf55b7bb3,NUE,2023-04-14,Steel Dynamics (STLD) to Post Q1 Earnings: What's in the Offing?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/steel-dynamics-stld-post-q1-142002884.html,1681395602,STORY,"['STLD', 'X', 'NUE']","[Steel Dynamics, Inc. STLD is set to release first-quarter 2023 results after the closing bell on Apr 19.Steel Dynamics’ earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 11.3%, on average. The company posted an earnings surprise of 21.4% in the last reported quarter. The company’s first-quarter results will likely reflect the benefits of strong demand in major end markets. However, weaker selling prices might have impacted its performance. Shares of the company have gained 20.7% in the past year compared with 3.8% decline of the industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What do the Estimates Say?Steel Dynamics envisions first-quarter earnings in the range of $3.47-$3.51 per share. It expects adjusted earnings for the quarter to be between $3.78 and $3.82 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for Steel Dynamics for the to-be-reported quarter is at $4,931 million, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 11.5%.The consensus estimate for average external product selling price for the company's steel operations is pegged at $1,076 per ton, indicating a year-over-year decline of 31% and a decline of 4.3% on a sequential comparison basis.A Few Factors to WatchHigher sequential profitability in the company’s steel operations might have aided first-quarter results. Steel Dynamics, last month, said that it expects first-quarter profits from its steel operations to be stronger than the fourth quarter as higher level of shipments across all its platforms more than mitigate the impacts of metal spread compressions due to lower average realized selling prices associated with a lag in indexed contracts. Pricing for steel strengthened in the first quarter and steel producer lead times extended on strong demand.The company noted that it is seeing higher demand from the automotive, non-residential construction, energy and industrial sectors. The non-residential construction sector also remains solid, as reflected by a strong order backlog and healthy forward pricing for its steel fabrication business.Meanwhile, U.S. steel prices rebounded in the first quarter after tumbling in the fourth quarter of 2022. The benchmark hot-rolled coil prices strengthened during the March quarter driven by U.S. steel mills’ price hike actions, low import levels, supply tightness partly due to mill outages and a recovery in demand.Despite the recovery in U.S. steel prices, the impacts of weaker selling prices are likely to reflect on Steel Dynamics’ performance in the quarter to be reported. Lower average realized selling prices are expected to have weighed on its top line and margins.Story continues Steel Dynamics, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Steel Dynamics, Inc.

16,9c1d0b87-d6d3-3b68-9fa6-6127397facdb,NUE,2023-04-14,Earnings Preview: Nucor (NUE) Q1 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-nucor-nue-q1-140102371.html,1681394462,STORY,"['NUE', 'STLD']","[Nucor (NUE) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 20, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis steel company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.81 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -50.3%.Revenues are expected to be $8.17 billion, down 22.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 8.81% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nucor?For Nucor, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Nucor will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Nucor would post earnings of $4.18 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.89, delivering a surprise of +16.99%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Nucor doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Steel - Producers industry, Steel Dynamics (STLD), is soon expected to post earnings of $3.81 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -36.7%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $4.93 billion, down 11.5% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Steel Dynamics has been revised 30.7% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, reflecting an equal Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Steel Dynamics will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It can be applied to choose the best momentum stocks. No doubt, it's a successful investment strategy that helped Richard Driehaus make a place in Barron's All-Century Team.To that end, stocks like AAON, Taylor Morrison Home and Nucor have been selected as the momentum picks for the day using the Driehaus strategy.A Detailed Look Into the Driehaus StrategyRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said, ""I would much rather invest in a stock that's increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that's already in decline and try to guess when it will turn around."" In line with this insight, the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) considered the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus' philosophy.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator — positive relative strength — has also been included in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.Here are three of the 16 stocks:AAON is a manufacturer of air-conditioning and heating equipment consisting of rooftop units, chillers, air-handling units, condensing units, and coils. AAON has a Momentum Score of B. The trailing four-quarter earnings surprise for AAON is 5.7%, on average.Story continuesTaylor Morrison Home is a homebuilder and land developer engaged in building single-family detached and attached homes for first-time buyers and move-up families to luxury and active adult customers.

18,dc3c9c8a-e62d-39f2-8c16-a27c8735088a,NUE,2023-04-14,3 Must-Buy Momentum Stocks Banking on the Driehaus Strategy,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-must-buy-momentum-stocks-114411767.html,1681299851,STORY,"['AAON', 'NUE', 'TMHC']","[The “buy high and sell higher” theory can be associated with the Driehaus strategy. It can be applied to choose the best momentum stocks. No doubt, it’s a successful investment strategy that helped Richard Driehaus make a place in Barron’s All-Century Team.To that end, stocks like AAON AAON, Taylor Morrison Home TMHC and Nucor NUE have been selected as the momentum picks for the day using the Driehaus strategy.A Detailed Look Into the Driehaus StrategyRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said, “I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in decline and try to guess when it will turn around.” In line with this insight, the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) considered the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus’ philosophy.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator — positive relative strength — has also been included in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.Screening ParametersTo make the strategy more profitable, we have considered only those stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Momentum Score of A or B. Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.

AYI is benefiting from product vitality, acquisitions and divestitures along with cost-efficiency initiatives.Recently, AYI reported second-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Feb 28, 2023) results, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20.5% and grew 19.1% year over year. Revenues increased 3.8% year over year.Earnings estimates for fiscal 2023 have moved north to $13.69 per share from $13.48 over the past 30 days, depicting analysts' optimism over the company’s growth prospects.However, this manufacturer and distributor of lighting fixtures and related components is facing high production cost and inflation that is restricting its growth. Shares of AYI have declined 3.3% over the past six months compared with the Zacks Building Products - Lighting industry’s decline of 10.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet us consider the factors broadly.TailwindsAcuity Brands’ diversified portfolio of innovative lighting control solutions and energy-efficient luminaries bodes well for the company. The company’s focus on innovation through product vitality and increasing service levels for the benefit of customers has delivered strong results. Acuity Brands’ vitality efforts include improvements to existing products and the introduction of new ones. The company mainly focuses on three areas — strategic supplier relationships, empowerment of teams to prioritize access and speed over cost on available components and redesigning of products according to the available components by its highly-skilled engineers. In its NEXT 23 press conference, it introduced various products, including the new nLight AIR System Input Device and nLight AIR rPOD Micro.Acuity Brands is committed to expanding its geographic borders and product portfolio through acquisitions and joint ventures. Also, it is engaged in portfolio optimization through divestitures to drive growth. Although there were no acquisitions during the first six months of fiscal 2023, it sold Sunoptics prismatic skylights business during the first quarter of fiscal 2023.Acuity has taken actions to reduce costs, including the realignment of headcount with current volumes, a freeze on all non-essential employee travel, efforts to decrease discretionary spending and planned reductions in its real estate footprint. In the fiscal second quarter, the adjusted EBITDA rose 6.5% to $144.8 million from the year-ago period. Adjusted operating profit was $133.3 million, implying an increase of 5% from the prior-year figure.Story continuesHeadwindsAcuity Brands has been facing high costs in its production activities for quite some time now. Energy-efficient lighting products like LED fixtures need extensive research and development and hence involve costs. Again, inflation and higher cost of the inputs and labor are most likely to dampen its overall results. The company is going through supply chain challenges and rising cost of some components. Although the incremental cost of the technology is relatively low, real cost of installation of that technology is still growing.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksAYI currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

21,c2fda108-906b-3c93-883e-1805956a6def,ARE,2023-04-14,20 Biggest Real Estate Companies in USA,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-biggest-real-estate-companies-103854415.html,1681468734,STORY,"['AMT', 'PLD', 'UDR', 'EQIX', 'ARE', 'DLR', 'EQR', 'RKT', 'CSGP', 'SPG', 'SBAC', 'INVH', 'AVB', 'VICI', 'WELL', 'CBRE', 'O']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 20 biggest real estate companies in USA. For more real estate companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Real Estate Companies in USA. Two children, a car, and a white picket fence - so goes the American dream. Looking at this, you'll realize that the automotive and real estate industries are at the center of American culture. Most people dream to own their house one day and often end up taking out multi-decade long mortgages to afford their own place of living. Apart from houses, several other buildings and properties make up the real estate sector. These range from public places such as parks, to apartment complexes, office buildings, and giant skyscrapers.Naturally, this also means that the real estate industry is among the most closely watched sectors by both governments and the wealthy. The rich are crazy about real estate since they invest copious amounts of wealth in it. After all, having a villa in Beverly Hills has a much different bling to it than a house in a village. Speaking numbers, a report from McKinsey shows that two thirds of global net worth were invested in real estate as of 2020. Within these two thirds, residential and private real estate accounted for almost half, or 46%, of global net worth, with government and public buildings making up another 23%. Growth rates in net worth with respect to the overall gross domestic product (GDP) show that this plowing of funds into a notoriously unproductive asset has led to significant net worth growth as well. McKinsey's data shows that between 2000 and 2020, net worth compared to GDP was a stunning 104% higher than in the three decades between 1970 and 1999. On the most extreme end, France's richest benefited from the real estate boom, as it grew by an eye popping 371% higher than the GDP! Within the net worth growth between 2000 and 2020, two thirds were due to higher asset prices, with saving and investment both accounting for a rather tame 28%.Story continuesAs this should make it clear, real estate is quite lucrative indeed. But just how lucrative is estimated in a research report from Grand View Research. In this report, the firm estimates that the global real estate industry was worth $3.69 trillion in 2021 and despite this huge size, the segment is expected to post a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.2% between 2022 and 2030 to sit at $5.85 trillion by the end of the forecast period. Within the market, the commercial real estate market was the largest constituent segment as it accounted for 35% of the entire market. Apart from residential, the commercial real estate market is another large component of the industry and it will match the broader sector's growth rate by growing at a 5.1% CAGR during the forecast period. Additionally, Grand View Research also highlights that sales by property type, such as villas and second homes, will outpace the broader market in terms of growth by growing at 6.1%. It adds that the Middle East and Africa will also outpace market growth, but Asia Pacific is the largest segment in terms of geography with more than half the market share.In America, the real estate sector is facing some stress these days, This is due to the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes that aim to make borrowing costs for firms and individuals higher to kill GDP growth and fight inflation. The U.S. real estate sector is worth $20 trillion (this is the total value of the properties and not the revenues) and prices dropped by 15% in March 2023 from their peak values. Rising interest rates are playing a role in this, as commercial real estate purchases are rarely made out of pocket and instead, they rely on bank loans and funding. While a 15% drop in itself sounds high, experts worry that prices could drop as much as 30% in case of an economic downturn or a recession.Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD)'s earnings call for its fourth quarter of 2022 provides valuable insight. During the event, management outlined:With regard to our markets and leasing activity, the bottomline is that conditions remain healthy and there is little we see across our results or proprietary metrics that point to a meaningful slowdown. We see a normalization of demand and when combined with low vacancy, it continues to translate to a meaningful increase in rents. Across our markets, rent growth was nearly 5% during the quarter, driving the full year to 28%. Proposal activity for available space was consistent with our recent history, and given persistent low vacancy, there is simply a very small number of units to even propose deals on. As evidenced, over 99% of our portfolio is either currently leased or in negotiation. Utilization remains high at 86%, near its all time record and deal gestation ticked up over the quarter, indicative of more careful consideration and time being taken in leasing decisions.While we are watching e-commerce carefully, its share of overall retail sales have increased to 22%, which is 600 basis points above its pre-pandemic level. Putting the nuance of mix, timing and other factors aside, as measured by retention, occupancy or rent change, it is clear that customers need to commit to space to market conditions, which offer them very little choice. In terms of supply, the development pipeline across our market stands at 565 million square feet and our expectation for the year is that the pipeline will decline. Deliveries will put modest upward pressure on vacancies from 3.3% today towards 4% later in the year. However, new development starts are slowing in response to the market environment, which will reduce vacancies in late 2023 or 2024.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the biggest real estate companies in America, out of which the top ones are Equinix, Inc.

23,de15bd20-ee53-3baa-b751-ce4af441c1f1,ARE,2023-04-14,Alexandria (ARE) Transfers Partial Interest in 15 Necco Street,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alexandria-transfers-partial-interest-15-130501143.html,1681391101,STORY,"['ARE', 'LLY']","[Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. ARE recently transferred a partial interest in 15 Necco Street, a 345,995 rentable square feet (RSF) Class A property presently under construction, to a U.S. affiliate of Mori Trust Co., Ltd. The transfer was done through an affiliate.The proceeds from the transaction will be used to fund the development of the property located in the Seaport Innovation District submarket of Greater Boston. The delivery is anticipated to take place in late 2023. This highlights Alexandria’s prudent capital-management practices.Eli Lilly and Company LLY, one of Alexandria’s longtime tenants, had chosen this state-of-the-art facility for its Lilly Institute for Genetic Medicine. The institute will leverage promising RNA- and DNA-based technologies to develop therapies with the potential to treat or prevent diseases in a way that is either challenging or not possible with traditional medicines.Strategically located adjacent to Cambridge's Kendall Square, 15 Necco Street provides convenient access to major transportation hubs. Developed in partnership with National Development, this amenity-rich building with a uniquely inspiring design and building-activation program is likely to help Eli Lilly attract and retain people from Greater Boston's deep life science talent pool.Per Hunter L. Kass, executive vice president and regional market director of Greater Boston at Alexandria, “Our dominant one-of-a-kind platform, in combination with a scarcity of high-quality life science real estate assets, continues to drive demand for investment opportunities arising from our value harvesting and capital recycling strategies.”Moreover, the building leverages geothermal energy to reduce fossil fuel use and utilizes 100% renewable electricity generated on and off-site. This is an example of Alexandria's efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.Further, keeping in mind the overall physical and mental well-being of its occupants, the transformative facility will include several wellness features. It is also targeting LEED Gold Core &amp; Shell, Fitwel Life Science and WiredScore Platinum certifications.Alexandria’s Class A properties are situated in North America's AAA innovation cluster locations, with significant market presence in Greater Boston, San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, San Diego, Seattle, Maryland and Research Triangle. The advantageous locations of its properties have been driving demand, resulting in high occupancy levels.Amid the growing need for drug research and innovation, the company has been experiencing healthy leasing activity on solid demand for its high-quality office/laboratory space. This has been aiding the company’s rental rate growth. In 2022, it registered rental rate growth of 31% and 22.1% (cash basis).Also, Alexandria has been focusing on the acquisition, development and redevelopment of new Class A properties in AAA locations. In 2022, it completed acquisitions in its key life-science cluster submarkets totaling 10.2 million square feet (SF) for $2.8 billion. Its encouraging development pipeline bodes well for its long-term growth.With a solid balance-sheet position and ample financial flexibility, ARE is well-positioned to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 7.6% in the past six months against its industry’s growth of 9%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are VICI Properties VICI and Terreno Realty TRNO, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Alexandria Real Estate Equities in FocusHeadquartered in Pasadena, Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of -15.54% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $1.21 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 3.93%. In comparison, the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield is 4.78%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.72%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $4.84 is up 2.5% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Alexandria Real Estate Equities has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 5.84%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Alexandria Real Estate Equities's current payout ratio is 57%. This means it paid out 57% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, ARE expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $8.95 per share, with earnings expected to increase 6.29% from the year ago period.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, ARE is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

PVH and EnerSys ENS.Buy These 5 Low Price-to-Book-Value Stocks in AprilValue investors prefer price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) ratios for identifying low-priced stocks with exceptional returns. However, the underrated price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use valuation tool for the purpose. The ratio is used to compare a stock's market value/price to its book value.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market price per share/book value of equity per shareThe P/B ratio reflects how many times book value investors are ready to pay for a share. So, if the share price is $10 and book value of equity is $5, investors are ready to pay two times the book value. Ideally, a P/B value under 1.0 is considered good, indicating a potentially undervalued stock. However, value investors often consider stocks with a P/B value under 3.0.The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Deutsche Bank, General Motors, Unum Group, PVH Corp. and EnerSys are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What's Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company's balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders' equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company's balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.Story continuesA P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock's price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Here are our five picks out of the eight stocks that qualified the screening:Headquartered in Frankfurt am Main, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, also called Deutsche Bank AG, is the largest bank in Germany and one of the largest financial institutions in Europe and the world, as measured by total assets.Deutsche Bank has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A.

State Street Corporation (STT), which belongs to the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, could be a great candidate to consider.When looking at the last two reports, this company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 2.59%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, State Street Corporation came out with earnings of $2.07 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2 per share, representing a surprise of 3.50%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.79 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.82 per share, delivering a surprise of 1.68%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor State Street Corporation, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.State Street Corporation has an Earnings ESP of +0.68% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on April 17, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

This made the March sell-off painful, but we do not believe that this has meaningfully changed the value of most of our financial equity holdings. In fact, we were adding to financial positions throughout March. We believe that one way to analyze our financial holdings is to look at them in different buckets given their various business models and risk profiles. Almost 30% of our financial exposure is in insurance companies and insurance brokers. Insurance companies have very stable liability profiles, so the main risk is a change in asset values. We are comfortable with their investment portfolios and think these stocks are quite attractive. Around 5% of our financials are asset managers. This leaves a little over 40% of the financials exposure in a varied group of banks and lenders. About 5% of that portfolio is in Bank of America and State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT). These two banks are designated as Systematically Important Financial Institutions and are held to higher regulatory standards.

This led to a dull year-over-year performance in fourth-quarter 2022.The company has also been witnessing pressures related to global supply-chain disruptions, energy costs, and rising raw materials, freight and logistic costs. All these factors marred WHR’s margin performance across most regions in fourth-quarter 2022.The company generated a gross profit of $645 million, down 39.3% from $1,063 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Ongoing EBIT of $171 million declined 66% from $502 million in the year-ago quarter. The ongoing EBIT margin of 3.5% contracted 510 bps year over year.Management expects continued investments in marketing and technology, as well as currency headwinds, to negatively impact margins by 125 basis points in 2023. An unfavorable price/mix is likely to affect the ongoing EBIT margin by 225 basis points.For 2023, net sales are anticipated to decline 1-2% to $19.4 billion, in sync with our estimate of a 1.7% decrease. On a GAAP and ongoing basis, Whirlpool expects earnings per share of $16-$18. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Consequently, shares of WHR have lost 13.1% in the past three months, underperforming the industry’s decline of 12.6%.Pricing Actions, Much-Needed SupportThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been on track with early and decisive actions to protect margins and productivity amid the ongoing supply-chain constraints and significant inflationary pressures. It has implemented cost takeout actions, including curtailing structural and discretionary costs, capturing raw material deflation opportunities, effectively managing working capital, and syncing supply chain and labor levels with demand.The company announced significant cost-based price increases of 5% to 18% in various countries. WHR also launched a cost takeout program worth $500 million, which is likely to reduce fixed and variable costs in 2023. Keeping in these lines, management is on track with its cost takeout actions, and expects $800-$900 million related to gains from the aforementioned measures and eased raw material inflation. The company expects to generate $500 million in net cost takeout actions via premium cost reductions of more than $250 million and supply-chain inefficiencies.In fourth-quarter 2022, the company concluded the strategic review of EMEA. As part of this, the company’s Europe major domestic appliance business will form a new entity with Arçelik. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2023. The new company is likely to generate more than €6 billion in annual sales and above €200 million in cost synergies.Story continuesConclusionWe believe that Whirlpool’s productivity and pricing actions will help offset the ongoing supply-chain constraints and significant inflationary pressures. Topping it, a VGM Score of B reflects its inherent strength. Also, earnings estimates for the current financial year have risen 0.6% in the past 60 days.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies are Ralph Lauren RL, PVH Corp PVH and H&amp;R Block HRB.Ralph Lauren, a footwear and accessories dealer, has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

The company’s efforts to expand digital and omni-channel capabilities through investments in mobile, omni-channel and fulfillment bode well. It is well-poised to attain its targets under the “Next Great Chapter” plan. These initiatives are likely to go a long way in continuing to bolster the company’s performance.An uptrend in the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate echoes a positive sentiment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ralph Lauren’s fiscal 2023 sales and earnings per share (EPS) is pegged at $6.37 billion and $8.11, respectively. Sales estimates suggest growth of 2.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure, while the EPS estimate indicates a 3.2% decline. The consensus estimate for the next fiscal year’s sales and EPS of $6.72 billion and $9.25 implies year-over-year increases of 5.5% and 14%, respectively.Buoyed by the aforesaid tailwinds, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s shares have appreciated 9% against the industry’s 17.6% decline. The stock also compared favorably against the Consumer Discretionary sector’s decline of 14.8% and the S&amp;P 500’s fall of 7.1%. An impressive long-term projected EPS growth rate of 9.3% further highlights the strength of this lifestyle goods retailer.Let’s take a look at the factors that make the stock an attractive pick. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Factors to Aid GrowthRalph Lauren has been making significant progress in expanding digital and omni-channel capabilities, which are aiding the top line. In third-quarter fiscal 2023, the digital business continued to be a key growth driver, with accelerated digital sales across all regions. The company’s global digital ecosystem witnessed year-over-year high-single-digit revenue growth and more than 40% on a two-year stack basis. This includes 10% growth within the owned Ralph Lauren and digital sites on top of more than 30% growth last year.RL has been focused on further digital investments to continue content creation for all platforms, enhancing digital capabilities to improve the user experience, and continuing to leverage AI and data to serve its consumers more efficiently. Ralph Lauren continues to scale and expand its connected retail capabilities, including virtual selling appointments, “buy online, pick up in store,” and endless aisle product availability.The company launched its first-ever full-catalog Ralph Lauren mobile app during the holiday season, efficiently leveraging its connected retail capabilities to deliver the most personalized and content-rich platform. It introduced additional digital sites in key markets, including Korea and Australia, in the fiscal third quarter. A positive mix of products, investments in AI-powered targeting and consumer acquisition bode well. Also, its online search grew year over year and exceeded 51 million social media followers on a global basis.Ralph Lauren has also been on track to exceed its top and bottom-line targets under the “Next Great Chapter” plan announced in June 2018. Later, it announced measures to accelerate its “Next Great Chapter plan,” which includes creating a simplified global organizational structure and rolling out improved technological capabilities.As part of the plan, RL completed the transition of Chaps to a licensed business, thus concluding its portfolio realignment announced last year. The move will likely enable it to focus on core brands, as part of the Next Great Chapter elevation strategy.For fiscal 2023, RL anticipates year-over-year revenue growth (cc) in the high-single digits on a 52-week comparable basis. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the company expects year-over-year revenue growth of mid to high-single digits at constant currency.The company earlier revealed plans of returning 100% free cash flow to shareholders in the next five years, amounting to $2.5 billion on a cumulative basis through fiscal 2023 in the forms of dividends and share repurchases.Story continuesOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector are Crocs CROX, Kontoor Brands KTB and PVH Corp PVH.Crocs currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: PVH Corp. PVH, On Holding AG ONON, PlayAGS, Inc. AGS, Skillz Inc. SKLZ and Bragg Gaming Group Inc. BRAG.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Consumer Discretionary Stocks Are In Play: 5 PicksAs you might expect from the still-strong employment numbers, consumer spending remains amazingly resilient amidst uncertain macro conditions. And that means good news for retail, restaurants, hospitality, airlines and so on. Consumer Discretionary spending in general will remain as long as the labor market is supportive.Additionally, the CPI data for March shows the smallest increase (5.0%) in overall inflation since May 2021. What is even more encouraging for consumers is that food prices did not increase from February, although they were up 8.5% from last year, as declines in food at home were offset by food away from home.Energy prices were down overall and it remains to be seen what happens as a result of the OPEC cuts. As regards the other items, new vehicles, services, shelter and transportation were the sticking points and these are the items the Fed will likely focus on.NY Fed President Williams recently commented that they are closely monitoring the latest data, including on credit availability. In all probability there will be a 25 bps increase in rates when the Fed meets next month. But April Fed minutes could shed more light.Therefore, there's every reason to think that consumer discretionary spending will continue. And the following picks allow you to play the sector:PVH Corp.New York-based PVH Corp. is an apparel company offering men's, women's and children's apparel and accessories, fragrance, bed and bath furnishings, small leather goods and other products under well-known brands like Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, Van Heusen, IZOD, ARROW, Warner's, Olga, Geoffrey Beene and True&amp;Co. It sells products under these and other owned, licensed and private label brands in the U.S. and internationally.Story continuesProducts are sold at wholesale, in department, chain and specialty stores, as well as through warehouse clubs, mass market, and off-price and independent retailers. They're also sold through company-operated stores and online.The shares carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and Value, Growth and Momentum Scores of A, B and B, respectively. They belong to the Textile-Apparel industry, which is in the top 41% of Zacks-classified industries. Buy-ranked stocks in the top 50% of industries generally outperform the bottom 50%.Analyst estimates are encouraging considering the environment. For the years ending January 2024 and 2025, PVH will grow both revenue and profits. Its 2024 estimate is up $1.02 (11.6%) and its 2025 estimate is up 90 cents (9.0%) in the last 60 days.Since its surprise history is robust with an average beat of 23.4% in the last four quarters, it's safe to say that estimates err on the side of conservatism. This makes the shares particularly attractive.On Holding AGZurich, Switzerland-based On Holding develops and distributes sports products like athletic footwear, apparel and accessories. The company offers its products through independent retailers and distributors, online, and in stores across the world.The Zacks Rank #2 stock belongs to the Leisure and Recreation Products industry (bottom 29%). Therefore, we can say that industry-wide factors aren't particularly conducive to its growth. Zacks has allotted an A for both Growth and Momentum, which means that it isn't all bad news.Analyst estimates support this view. Analysts currently expect the company to generate 44.7% revenue growth and 89.7% earnings growth this year, followed by 32.3% revenue growth and 44.7% earnings growth in the next. The 2023 estimate is up 9 cents (19.6%) in the last 60 days. The 2024 estimate is up 8 cents (11.3%).While the surprise history is not exciting (On Holding has missed estimates in the last two quarters), the four quarter average surprise is +354.2%, which should be a consideration.PlayAGS, Inc.Las Vegas-based PlayAGS designs and supplies gaming products and services in the U.S. and internationally. It operates through three segments: Electronic Gaming Machines (EGM), Table Products and Interactive Games. The Table Products brands include In Bet Gaming, Buster Blackjack, Double Draw Poker and Criss Cross Poker. The Interactive segment is a platform for business-to-business content aggregation used by real-money gaming and sports-betting partners. It also offers business-to-consumer social casino games through its mobile app, Lucky Play Casino.The Zacks Rank #2 stock has an A each for Value, Growth and Momentum. The Gaming Industry to which it belongs is in the top 27% of Zacks-classified industries.The company's estimates had been going down, but in the last 60 days they've changed course. The 2023 estimate is now flat with the prior year while the 2024 estimate is up from a loss of 2 cents 60 days ago to a profit of 19 cents today.It has a solid history of beating estimates and has topped analyst expectations in each of the last four quarters at an average rate of 133.33%.Skillz Inc.San Francisco-based Skillz is a mobile game platform with operations in the U.S. and internationally. The company primarily develops and supports a proprietary technology platform that enables independent game developers to host tournaments and competitive games for end-users. Skillz distributes games through direct app downloads from its website, as well as through third-party platforms.The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has an F for Value but Growth and Momentum Scores of B and A, respectively. Like PlayAGS, Skillz too belongs to the Gaming industry.Despite a substantial decline in revenue, it is expected to halve its losses this year. Revenues are expected to grow strong double-digits in 2024, with losses down slightly. Loss estimates for 2023 and 2024 are down 41.3% and 33.3%, respectively in the last 60 days.The company has a good history of beating estimates. It has topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters at an average rate of 10.6%.Bragg Gaming Group Inc.Toronto, Canada-based Bragg Gaming is an online gaming content supplier offering slot, table, card, video bingo, scratch card and virtual sports, as well as live dealer games. Through content distribution agreements with leading studios, it provides proprietary third-party gaming content. It also operates a player account management platform under iCasino and sportsbook brands.#2 ranked Bragg is another member of the Gaming industry and has a B for Value and A for momentum.Analysts expect the company to generate double-digit revenue growth and triple-digit earnings growth in both 2023 and 2024. Its 2023 estimate has gone from a loss of 3 cents to a profit of 5 cents in the last 60 days. The 2024 estimate is up from 10 cents to 23 cents.Its surprise history leaves something to be desired however with the company missing in two of the last four quarters and the four-quarter average surprise at -102.1%.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

34,3381e648-6007-3545-93fd-845556f5e5c7,PVH,2023-04-14,Here's Why lululemon (LULU) is Marching Ahead of Its Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-lululemon-lulu-marching-144902608.html,1681310942,STORY,"['LULU', 'HRB', 'PVH', 'RL']","[lululemon athletica LULU has been gaining from continued business momentum, as well as robust traffic trends in stores and e-commerce. The company’s Power of Three ×2 growth strategy bodes well.The above-mentioned factors led to strong fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results, with revenues and earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimates. Earnings beat estimates for the 11th straight quarter in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022. Its sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth straight quarter. The top and bottom lines improved year over year.lululemon’s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings increased 30.6% from the year-ago quarter. The company’s adjusted earnings improved 25% on a three-year CAGR basis. Revenues advanced 30% year over year, driven by the strong momentum in its business, backed by a favorable response to its products. On a constant-dollar basis, revenues improved 33%. On a three-year CAGR basis, net revenues increased 26%.The company’s net revenues grew 29% in North America and 35% internationally. On a three-year CAGR basis, revenues improved 24% in North America and 39% internationally. lululemon’s total comparable sales rose 27% year over year and 30% on a constant-dollar basis.Consequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 15.9% in the past three months against the industry’s decline of 2.6%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research That said, let’s delve deeper into the other factors aiding LULU.Key Growth Driverslululemon witnessed a rebound in brick-and-mortar sales, driven by increased store traffic as consumers returned to stores for shopping. In the company’s store channel, sales increased 26% year over year and 10% on a three-year CAGR basis. At stores, comparable store sales increased 15% and 17% on a constant-dollar basis.The company witnessed more than 30% traffic growth at stores. On a three-year CAGR basis, traffic was up 7% in stores. Management highlighted that store productivity in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 continued to trend above the 2019 level. The company has been focused on investments to enhance the in-store experience. It has been leveraging its stores to facilitate omni-channel capabilities, including buy online pick up in store (BOPUS) and ship from store.LULU has implemented several strategies to improve the guest experience and reduce wait time. These include virtual waitlist, mobile POS and appointment shopping. These functionalities enable reducing the time of waiting in line to enter the store, as well as allow customers to complete some transactions like returns, exchanges and purchase of gift cards without entering the store.lululemon expects to capture the growing online demand and ensure a robust shopping experience through its accelerated e-commerce investments. Increased focus on developing sites, building transactional omni functionality and increasing fulfillment capabilities bode well. The company has been strengthening omni-channel capabilities, such as curbside pickups, same-day deliveries and BOPUS. It is enhancing its mobile app in a bid to offer the curbside pickup service and train its store associates to speed up transactions. Free online digital educator service for people that cannot make it into the company’s stores bodes well.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, direct-to-consumer net revenues climbed 37% (up 39% on a constant-dollar basis). In the digital channel, revenues accounted for 52% of the company’s net revenues compared with 49% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. E-commerce traffic improved more than 45% in the fiscal fourth quarter and 40% on a three-year CAGR basis.Digital revenues amounted to $1.4 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter. The company’s e-commerce business delivered an impressive performance, with revenues increasing 46% on a three-year CAGR basis. Digital comps increased 39% on a constant-dollar basis.lululemon has been on track with its Power of Three ×2 growth strategy. The move is likely to double its revenues from $6.25 billion in 2021 to $12.5 billion by 2026. The plan focuses on three key growth drivers —product innovation, guest experience and market expansion. The five-year plan is likely to quadruple international sales, along with doubling digital and menswear sales. Also, the women’s business and North America operations are each anticipated to witness a low-double-digit CAGR in revenues, with store channel growth in the mid-teens in the next five years. As part of its strategy, the company intends to expand in China and Europe markets, with plans to open stores in Spain and Italy.For 2021-2026, the total net revenue CAGR is expected to be 15%, with a slight expansion in the operating margin on an annual basis. lululemon anticipates bottom-line growth to outpace revenue growth. Although the 2026 targets seem too bold, the company believes that these are achievable due to its strong financial position.Story continuesHurdleslululemon has been grappling with elevated costs, hurting the gross margin. The gross margin contracted 300 basis points (bps) to 55.1% in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022. The adjusted gross profit increased 28.7% to $1,590.5 million, while the gross margin declined 70 bps to 57.4%. The decline in the gross margin can be attributed to a 50-bps deleverage from foreign currency, offset by a 30-bps decline in the product margin.Income from operations declined 47% year over year to $314.4 million. The operating margin fell significantly to 11.3% from the prior-year quarter’s 27.7%. The adjusted income from operations rose 33% year over year in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 to $785.3 million. The adjusted operating margin contracted 50 bps to 28.3%.It continues to witness higher SG&amp;A costs. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, the company’s SG&amp;A expenses of $803.1 million increased 25.1% from the year-ago quarter due to higher corporate SG&amp;A, and a slight increase in depreciation and amortization. For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, management anticipates a 60-80 bps deleverage in the SG&amp;A expense rate for the fiscal first quarter, driven by higher investments. For fiscal 2023, LULU expects the SG&amp;A rate to deleverage 120-140 bps year over year.The deleverage is likely to be driven by increased investments to support market expansion, improve the guest experience by enhancing omni-channel capabilities and making foundational investments to support growth. The company anticipates higher depreciation for fiscal 2023 due to ongoing and prior investments.lululemon's elevated inventory levels at the end of the quarter hurt investors’ sentiment. The company’s inventory grew 49.8% to $1,447.4 million at the end of fiscal 2022. This included a $62.9-million provision against inventory related to lululemon Studio, which reduced the inventory growth rate by seven percentage points. The company noted that the off-season accounted for about 45% of its inventory.For fiscal 2023, management expects moderate inventory growth, while maintaining its full-price selling model and remaining well-positioned to fulfill guest demand. lululemon expects the inventory growth rate at the end of the fiscal first quarter to increase 30-35% from that reported in the last year. The company expects inventory growth to be in line with sales growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.ConclusionWe believe that robust sales, led by solid online and store traffic, will help offset cost headwinds. Encouragingly, management expects the strong business momentum to continue in fiscal 2023. We estimate the company’s net revenues for the current fiscal year to reflect growth of 15.9% to $9,396.7 million. This is in sync with the company’s guidance of $9.300-$9.410 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 15-16%. lululemon’s revenue view represents slightly better sales than its target under the Power of Three x2 growth plan. GAAP EPS is projected to be $11.50-$11.72 for fiscal 2023.lululemon anticipates a gross margin increase of 140-160 bps for fiscal 2023 due to lower air freight expenses. For the fiscal year, the company expects air freight to decline 150 bps year over year. However, the company expects fiscal 2023 markdowns to be in line with those reported in the last year and fiscal 2019. The company expects the operating margin for fiscal 2023 to increase 20-40 bps from that recorded in the last year. The increase is expected to be slightly higher than the Power of Three x2 long-term target of a modest expansion annually.For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, management anticipates net revenues of $1,890-$1.930 billion, indicating 17-20% year-over-year growth. The company projects EPS of $1.93-$2 for the fiscal first quarter. The fiscal first-quarter gross margin is likely to expand 290-320 bps year over year. The gross margin is expected to benefit from lower air freight expenses, offset by currency headwinds and strategic investments in the supply chain and distribution centers. lululemon expects the operating margin to increase 200 bps in the fiscal first quarter.Topping it, earnings estimates for the current financial year have grown 1% to $11.43 in the past 30 days. Also, a VGM Score of B and a long-term earnings growth rate of 20% reflect its inherent strength.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies are Ralph Lauren RL, PVH Corp PVH and H&amp;R Block HRB.Ralph Lauren, a footwear and accessories dealer, has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

PVH and EnerSys ENS.Buy These 5 Low Price-to-Book-Value Stocks in AprilValue investors prefer price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) ratios for identifying low-priced stocks with exceptional returns. However, the underrated price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use valuation tool for the purpose. The ratio is used to compare a stock's market value/price to its book value.The P/B ratio is calculated as below:P/B ratio = market price per share/book value of equity per shareThe P/B ratio reflects how many times book value investors are ready to pay for a share. So, if the share price is $10 and book value of equity is $5, investors are ready to pay two times the book value. Ideally, a P/B value under 1.0 is considered good, indicating a potentially undervalued stock. However, value investors often consider stocks with a P/B value under 3.0.The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Deutsche Bank, General Motors, Unum Group, PVH Corp. and EnerSys are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What's Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company's balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders' equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company's balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.Story continuesA P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock's price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Here are our five picks out of the eight stocks that qualified the screening:Headquartered in Frankfurt am Main, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, also called Deutsche Bank AG, is the largest bank in Germany and one of the largest financial institutions in Europe and the world, as measured by total assets.Deutsche Bank has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A.

36,651fbe56-eb59-398d-a69b-7cf431fb58c2,USB,2023-04-14,Earnings Preview: KeyCorp (KEY) Q1 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-keycorp-key-q1-140002010.html,1681394402,STORY,"['USB', 'KEY']","[The market expects KeyCorp (KEY) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 20, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.41 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -8.9%.Revenues are expected to be $1.79 billion, up 5.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 21.87% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for KeyCorp?For KeyCorp, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.68%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that KeyCorp will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that KeyCorp would post earnings of $0.55 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.38, delivering a surprise of -30.91%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.KeyCorp doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsU.S. Bancorp (USB), another stock in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.13 for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +14.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $7.13 billion, up 28% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for U.S. Bancorp has been revised 3.7% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.86%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that U.S. Bancorp will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 76% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of U.S. Bancorp. See our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About U.S. Bancorp?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in U.S. Bancorp. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at U.S. Bancorp's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in U.S. Bancorp. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 7.8% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.6% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 3.9% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of U.S. BancorpThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of U.S. Bancorp. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$108m worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 23% stake in U.S. Bancorp. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for U.S. Bancorp   you should know about.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Yesterday (Apr. 13), New York-based brand management firm WHP Global and fashion retailer Express announced they were acquiring the 16-year-old brand from the big-box retailer for a mere $75 million. As part of the deal, which is expected to conclude in July 2023, Express will license the Bonobos brand from WHP in exchange for royalty fees.Read moreWhole Foods has shut down a store in downtown San Francisco on safety concernsYour anxiety brings 4 distinct superpowersAmericans may have seen the last of big rent hikesBefore Bonobo, Walmart dropped another brand from its portfolio earlier this year. In February, outdoor retailer Moosejaw was sold to Dick’s Sporting Goods for an undisclosed amount. Walmart had paid $51 million for the brand in 2017.At the time, Walmart was on a direct-to-consumer (DTC) acquisition spree, which was followed by a selling spree. It scooped up women’s retailer Modcloth, only to sell it off within two years. It bought and sold lingerie retailer Bare Necessities and Shoes.com swiftly, too.Largely, it looks like the Bonobos and Moosejaw sales aren’t about how well the brands are doing individually. Walmart appears to be pivoting away from hoarding a bunch of retail brands, focusing instead on growing as a “tech-powered omnichannel retailer” and on services that have better margins, such as healthcare and fintech.Quotable: Bonobos is a growing brand“Bonobos is delivering double-digit sales growth and we plan to continue that momentum while also realizing operating synergies and other economies of scale.”—Express CEO Tim BaxterExpress and WHP’s Bonobo deal, by the digits$200 million: Bonobos’ sales in 2022240+: Unique sizes per pant fit that Bonobo offer, 2-3 times more than competitors60+: Bonobos guideshop locations, where customers can get a personalized shopping experienceStory continues3.25%: The royalty rate the Ohio-based firm will pay WHP on retail sales for years 1-5, which’ll increase to 3.5% thereafter8%: The royalty rate on wholesale sales10: The total number of brands under WHP Global portfolio, which already includes the likes of toy- and baby-product retailer Toys “R” Us, sportswear label Lotto, and womenswear brand Anne Klein, after the Bonobos deal is completedPerson of interest: Marc LoreWhen Walmart bought Jet.com for $3.3 billion in August 2016, it bagged Marc Lore as part of the deal.

That is because the May 19, 2023 $60.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Raymond James shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Raymond James is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Financial - Investment Bank industry that ranks in the Bottom 20% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $2.23 per share to $2.20 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Raymond James right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

57,9f5bef38-47df-3f80-aad3-af1a2300fef4,MMC,2023-04-14,Earnings Preview: Marsh & McLennan (MMC) Q1 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-marsh-mclennan-mmc-140002662.html,1681394402,STORY,['MMC'],"[The market expects Marsh &amp; McLennan (MMC) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 20, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis global professional services firm providing strategy, risk and people solutions is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.29 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -0.4%.Revenues are expected to be $5.73 billion, up 3.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.49% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Marsh &amp; McLennan?For Marsh &amp; McLennan, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -14.96%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Marsh &amp; McLennan will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Marsh &amp; McLennan would post earnings of $1.40 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.47, delivering a surprise of +5%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Marsh &amp; McLennan doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For more real estate companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Real Estate Companies in USA. Two children, a car, and a white picket fence - so goes the American dream. Looking at this, you'll realize that the automotive and real estate industries are at the center of American culture. Most people dream to own their house one day and often end up taking out multi-decade long mortgages to afford their own place of living. Apart from houses, several other buildings and properties make up the real estate sector. These range from public places such as parks, to apartment complexes, office buildings, and giant skyscrapers.Naturally, this also means that the real estate industry is among the most closely watched sectors by both governments and the wealthy. The rich are crazy about real estate since they invest copious amounts of wealth in it. After all, having a villa in Beverly Hills has a much different bling to it than a house in a village. Speaking numbers, a report from McKinsey shows that two thirds of global net worth were invested in real estate as of 2020. Within these two thirds, residential and private real estate accounted for almost half, or 46%, of global net worth, with government and public buildings making up another 23%. Growth rates in net worth with respect to the overall gross domestic product (GDP) show that this plowing of funds into a notoriously unproductive asset has led to significant net worth growth as well. McKinsey's data shows that between 2000 and 2020, net worth compared to GDP was a stunning 104% higher than in the three decades between 1970 and 1999. On the most extreme end, France's richest benefited from the real estate boom, as it grew by an eye popping 371% higher than the GDP! Within the net worth growth between 2000 and 2020, two thirds were due to higher asset prices, with saving and investment both accounting for a rather tame 28%.Story continuesAs this should make it clear, real estate is quite lucrative indeed. But just how lucrative is estimated in a research report from Grand View Research. In this report, the firm estimates that the global real estate industry was worth $3.69 trillion in 2021 and despite this huge size, the segment is expected to post a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.2% between 2022 and 2030 to sit at $5.85 trillion by the end of the forecast period. Within the market, the commercial real estate market was the largest constituent segment as it accounted for 35% of the entire market. Apart from residential, the commercial real estate market is another large component of the industry and it will match the broader sector's growth rate by growing at a 5.1% CAGR during the forecast period. Additionally, Grand View Research also highlights that sales by property type, such as villas and second homes, will outpace the broader market in terms of growth by growing at 6.1%. It adds that the Middle East and Africa will also outpace market growth, but Asia Pacific is the largest segment in terms of geography with more than half the market share.In America, the real estate sector is facing some stress these days, This is due to the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes that aim to make borrowing costs for firms and individuals higher to kill GDP growth and fight inflation. The U.S. real estate sector is worth $20 trillion (this is the total value of the properties and not the revenues) and prices dropped by 15% in March 2023 from their peak values. Rising interest rates are playing a role in this, as commercial real estate purchases are rarely made out of pocket and instead, they rely on bank loans and funding. While a 15% drop in itself sounds high, experts worry that prices could drop as much as 30% in case of an economic downturn or a recession.Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD)'s earnings call for its fourth quarter of 2022 provides valuable insight. During the event, management outlined:With regard to our markets and leasing activity, the bottomline is that conditions remain healthy and there is little we see across our results or proprietary metrics that point to a meaningful slowdown. We see a normalization of demand and when combined with low vacancy, it continues to translate to a meaningful increase in rents. Across our markets, rent growth was nearly 5% during the quarter, driving the full year to 28%. Proposal activity for available space was consistent with our recent history, and given persistent low vacancy, there is simply a very small number of units to even propose deals on. As evidenced, over 99% of our portfolio is either currently leased or in negotiation. Utilization remains high at 86%, near its all time record and deal gestation ticked up over the quarter, indicative of more careful consideration and time being taken in leasing decisions.While we are watching e-commerce carefully, its share of overall retail sales have increased to 22%, which is 600 basis points above its pre-pandemic level. Putting the nuance of mix, timing and other factors aside, as measured by retention, occupancy or rent change, it is clear that customers need to commit to space to market conditions, which offer them very little choice. In terms of supply, the development pipeline across our market stands at 565 million square feet and our expectation for the year is that the pipeline will decline. Deliveries will put modest upward pressure on vacancies from 3.3% today towards 4% later in the year. However, new development starts are slowing in response to the market environment, which will reduce vacancies in late 2023 or 2024.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the biggest real estate companies in America, out of which the top ones are Equinix, Inc.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 20. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis regional bank holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.37 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +15.6%.Revenues are expected to be $1.9 billion, up 15.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.81% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Huntington Bancshares?For Huntington Bancshares, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.42%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Huntington Bancshares will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Huntington Bancshares would post earnings of $0.41 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.43, delivering a surprise of +4.88%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Huntington Bancshares doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Banks - Midwest industry, Mercantile Bank (MBWM) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.15 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +57.5%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $53.43 million, up 33% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Mercantile Bank has been revised 0.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.87%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Mercantile Bank will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

62,f60cef3d-d387-3f81-904d-da29af8e84bd,MET,2023-04-14,Those who invested in MetLife (NYSE:MET) three years ago are up 106%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-metlife-nyse-met-130016506.html,1681390816,STORY,['MET'],"[MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 16% in the last quarter. But that shouldn't obscure the pleasing returns achieved by shareholders over the last three years. After all, the share price is up a market-beating 85% in that time.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for MetLife To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over the last three years, MetLife failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 21% (annualized).So we doubt that the market is looking to EPS for its main judge of the company's value. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.Do you think that shareholders are buying for the 1.3% per annum revenue growth trend? We don't. While we don't have an obvious theory to explain the share price rise, a closer look at the data might be enlightening.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthMetLife is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. You can see what analysts are predicting for MetLife in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, MetLife's TSR for the last 3 years was 106%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 8.8% in the twelve months, MetLife shareholders did even worse, losing 12% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 9% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand MetLife better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - MetLife has   2 warning signs  (and 1 which shouldn't be ignored)  we think you should know about.For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

For more real estate companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Real Estate Companies in USA. Two children, a car, and a white picket fence - so goes the American dream. Looking at this, you'll realize that the automotive and real estate industries are at the center of American culture. Most people dream to own their house one day and often end up taking out multi-decade long mortgages to afford their own place of living. Apart from houses, several other buildings and properties make up the real estate sector. These range from public places such as parks, to apartment complexes, office buildings, and giant skyscrapers.Naturally, this also means that the real estate industry is among the most closely watched sectors by both governments and the wealthy. The rich are crazy about real estate since they invest copious amounts of wealth in it. After all, having a villa in Beverly Hills has a much different bling to it than a house in a village. Speaking numbers, a report from McKinsey shows that two thirds of global net worth were invested in real estate as of 2020. Within these two thirds, residential and private real estate accounted for almost half, or 46%, of global net worth, with government and public buildings making up another 23%. Growth rates in net worth with respect to the overall gross domestic product (GDP) show that this plowing of funds into a notoriously unproductive asset has led to significant net worth growth as well. McKinsey's data shows that between 2000 and 2020, net worth compared to GDP was a stunning 104% higher than in the three decades between 1970 and 1999. On the most extreme end, France's richest benefited from the real estate boom, as it grew by an eye popping 371% higher than the GDP! Within the net worth growth between 2000 and 2020, two thirds were due to higher asset prices, with saving and investment both accounting for a rather tame 28%.Story continuesAs this should make it clear, real estate is quite lucrative indeed. But just how lucrative is estimated in a research report from Grand View Research. In this report, the firm estimates that the global real estate industry was worth $3.69 trillion in 2021 and despite this huge size, the segment is expected to post a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.2% between 2022 and 2030 to sit at $5.85 trillion by the end of the forecast period. Within the market, the commercial real estate market was the largest constituent segment as it accounted for 35% of the entire market. Apart from residential, the commercial real estate market is another large component of the industry and it will match the broader sector's growth rate by growing at a 5.1% CAGR during the forecast period. Additionally, Grand View Research also highlights that sales by property type, such as villas and second homes, will outpace the broader market in terms of growth by growing at 6.1%. It adds that the Middle East and Africa will also outpace market growth, but Asia Pacific is the largest segment in terms of geography with more than half the market share.In America, the real estate sector is facing some stress these days, This is due to the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes that aim to make borrowing costs for firms and individuals higher to kill GDP growth and fight inflation. The U.S. real estate sector is worth $20 trillion (this is the total value of the properties and not the revenues) and prices dropped by 15% in March 2023 from their peak values. Rising interest rates are playing a role in this, as commercial real estate purchases are rarely made out of pocket and instead, they rely on bank loans and funding. While a 15% drop in itself sounds high, experts worry that prices could drop as much as 30% in case of an economic downturn or a recession.Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD)'s earnings call for its fourth quarter of 2022 provides valuable insight. During the event, management outlined:With regard to our markets and leasing activity, the bottomline is that conditions remain healthy and there is little we see across our results or proprietary metrics that point to a meaningful slowdown. We see a normalization of demand and when combined with low vacancy, it continues to translate to a meaningful increase in rents. Across our markets, rent growth was nearly 5% during the quarter, driving the full year to 28%. Proposal activity for available space was consistent with our recent history, and given persistent low vacancy, there is simply a very small number of units to even propose deals on. As evidenced, over 99% of our portfolio is either currently leased or in negotiation. Utilization remains high at 86%, near its all time record and deal gestation ticked up over the quarter, indicative of more careful consideration and time being taken in leasing decisions.While we are watching e-commerce carefully, its share of overall retail sales have increased to 22%, which is 600 basis points above its pre-pandemic level. Putting the nuance of mix, timing and other factors aside, as measured by retention, occupancy or rent change, it is clear that customers need to commit to space to market conditions, which offer them very little choice. In terms of supply, the development pipeline across our market stands at 565 million square feet and our expectation for the year is that the pipeline will decline. Deliveries will put modest upward pressure on vacancies from 3.3% today towards 4% later in the year. However, new development starts are slowing in response to the market environment, which will reduce vacancies in late 2023 or 2024.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the biggest real estate companies in America, out of which the top ones are Equinix, Inc.

The Credit Suisse bonds, known as Additional Tier 1 notes, were purchased by customers from Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co.A spokesperson for the bank confirmed the losses.Other LendersA representative for Mizuho Financial Group Inc.’s brokerage unit said its clients have lost more than 4 billion yen on Credit Suisse AT1s. Daiwa Securities Group Inc.’s client lost less than 1 billion yen on the instruments, according to a spokesperson.A representative for Nomura Holdings Inc. said it hadn’t sold any of the Swiss lender’s AT1s in Japan. A spokesperson for SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. declined to comment.MUFG is also checking that wealth managers at the brokerage - one of the two joint ventures between the Japanese institution and the Wall Street giant - appropriately explained to the buyers the risks associated with the debt, the spokesperson said.The development illustrates how the fallout from Credit Suisse’s rescue by rival UBS Group AG and the resulting wipeout of about 16 billion Swiss francs ($18 billion) of its AT1 bonds is being felt across global finance. The deal to save the bank rendered the notes worthless, allowing Credit Suisse shareholders to recoup some value.Story continuesThe AT1 notes were risky and designed to be written down in the event of Credit Suisse needing capital in a hurry. Some holders argue that they were treated unfairly and are looking for legal remedies.Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley has been working to boost profit through wealth management services in Japan, where banks have been increasingly competing to manage a larger slice of the nation’s roughly 2 quadrillion yen in household financial assets.“We are very sorry that we are causing our clients concern,” Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley said by email. “We will continue to offer thorough explanations to the customers who have been affected.”--With assistance from Takako Taniguchi, Catherine Bosley, Ayai Tomisawa and Tom Metcalf.(Adds losses at other Japanese firms in fifth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekA Smart Gun Is Finally Here, But Does Anyone Want It?There Are No Fees at America’s Smallest BankDeath, Taxes and ‘Teflon Don’Inside the IRS’s Shrinking Band of Wealth HuntersWomen Tackle Football With a Full-Contact League of Their Own©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

While chief executives of banks have the task of reassuring customers and shareholders alike, another endeavor lies in wait.  Bank CEOs such as JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon being at the helm for a over a decade, stirs up the question of succession plans. The path of succession is “much cloudier” at both Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan (JPM), William Cohan, Pucknews Founding Partner told Yahoo Finance Live.Cohan explains how “a lot of talent” has left JPMorgan waiting for Dimon to step down, and says “succession is the most important thing that a CEO can do.”The Financial Times’ Gillian Tett echos the same sentiment on the need for succession plan discussions, noting “the fact that Jamie has not groomed visible successors… is in some ways a black mark against his name.”Yahoo Finance’s Julie Hyman and Brad Smith speak with Gillian Tett and William Cohan in a full interview here.Key video moments:00:00:36 Comparing succession plans00:01:25 Succession conversationsVideo TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Bill, your recent piece where you talked about Jamie Dimon, the Jamie and Janet show, as he went, once again, down to DC to try and work on this latest rescue, it got me thinking a little bit about his tenure at JPMorgan, for that matter, Brian Moynihan of Bank of America.Some of these bank CEOs have been around for a long time, and it made me wonder a little bit about when we might see a changing of the guard. I guess Jane Fraser's newer at Citi, for example. But I do wonder when we're going to see that next phase because these people are so entrenched and so really iconic at many of the banks. What's your thinking on that, Bill? And then, Gillian, I'm going to ask for your thinking on it as well.WILLIAM COHAN: At least in Morgan Stanley, there's a clear succession program underway. It might be a few years. Much cloudier at both Bank of America and at JPMorgan Chase. A lot of talent, a lot of talent has left JPMorgan Chase, waiting for Jamie Dimon to perhaps be selected Treasury Secretary to succeed Janet Yellen or to retire. It's a bank loaded with talent. But who it's going to be and when is a big open question. Bank of America same thing. So succession is the most important thing that a CEO can do, Julie. And Jamie Dimon and Brian Moynihan need to get it right.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: Gillian, do you think that this is something that investors are paying enough attention to?GILLIAN TETT: I think they certainly are. But it's been going on for such a long time that these conversations feel a bit like Groundhog Day. And be honest, the entire crisis in March, in some ways, felt like Groundhog Day because so many of the characters that Bill and I spoke to in 2008 and wrote about are still there in some form. It's good because you do have a depth of experience.It's bad because, actually, as and when they do move on, it's going to potentially create a bit of a shock. So I strongly agree with Bill that there needs to be more discussion about succession. And the fact that Jamie has not groomed visible successors who we've managed to keep in the stable is, in some ways, a black mark against his name.]"

Either way, IBM Vice Chair and Former White House chief economic advisor Gary Cohn tells Yahoo Finance he thinks we're ""at the end of the cycle"".His comments come in the aftermath of another 'sticky' inflation readout; despite the headline figure cooling, the core number leaves the Fed's next rate decision in some doubt. U.S. consumer prices rose just slightly in March, marking the slowest pace of increases since May 2021, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.The former number two at Goldman Sachs - a position he held during the height of the financial crisis - isn't breaking from the pack on the central bank's next move however.""I'm more or less in the 25 basis point camp now,"" he says.Cohn made clear he's waiting to see how Jay Powell sizes up the tighter credit landscape in May, and a new set of data at his fingertips. ""With the 5% reading, banks stabilizing, we've seen a lot of movement in deposit funds. We have to...evaluate that,"" he adds.Cohn spoke with Brad Smith and Julie Hyman. Watch the entire interview here.Key Takeaways00:00:18: 25 basis points00:00:38: Banking system00:01:28: End of the cycleVideo TranscriptGARY COHN: I think we're in this-- I don't know if it's a holding pattern or at the end of the cycle pattern. It feels to me like we're at the end of the cycle pattern. The debate is 25 basis points, pause, pause, pivot, or are we getting ready to pause? Is the 25 basis points not going to happen? I think I'm more or less in the 25 basis point camp now because I think with the 5% reading here, banks are somewhat stabilizing. We've seen a lot of movement in deposit flows.And we have to sort of evaluate that because one of the things that the chairman said during the last press conference-- and I think this is very important-- is that lending conditions in the banking community are changing and changing quite rapidly. We've seen a lot of deposits move around the system. We've seen deposits move from small regional banks to larger banks, and then we've seen deposits move out of larger banks into money markets in Treasury funds. So there's less money in the system to be lent out. Once banks have to hold their excess reserves, they can lend the remaining balances. But the remaining balances today at banks are relatively low.So the banks themselves are contracting the economy. The Federal Reserve Board understands that. I think they're trying to understand what the magnitude of that is. I've seen reports where the magnitude is of that is equal to somewhere between 25 and 75 basis points of increased interest rates. So we have to understand where that is. So I think we're sort of at the end of the cycle.And that's why we're in this sort of holding pattern. We're holding to see what the Fed's going to say, what Powell is going to say now that we have this banking-- the sort of banking data behind us, that we've seen reserves come out of the system, that we've seen this flight to money markets. We've seen a flight to treasuries. How do they evaluate the tighter lending conditions? And how does that influence their decisions? That's why I think even when you see a more positive inflationary report today, you didn't really see a large interest rate move. You didn't see the moves that we might expect.]"

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Morgan Stanley in FocusHeadquartered in New York, Morgan Stanley (MS) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 0.08% so far this year. The investment bank is paying out a dividend of $0.77 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.64% compared to the Financial - Investment Bank industry's yield of 0.5% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.72%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $3.10 is up 5.1% from last year. Morgan Stanley has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 28.47%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Morgan Stanley's current payout ratio is 49%. This means it paid out 49% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, MS expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $6.99 per share, with earnings expected to increase 9.91% from the year ago period.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, MS is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

76,84a90835-a488-316c-92e5-0e082ee36e46,MS,2023-04-14,"Trading, Higher Rates to Aid Morgan Stanley's (MS) Q1 Earnings",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trading-higher-rates-aid-morgan-143902130.html,1681310342,STORY,['MS'],"[The performance of Morgan Stanley’s MS trading business (constituting a significant portion of its top line) is expected to have been robust in the first quarter of 2023. Hence, the company’s first-quarter results, scheduled to be announced on Apr 19 before the opening bell, are expected to reflect the benefits of strong trading performance.Similar to 2022, market volatility and client activity have been robust in the first quarter. Several factors, including the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, continued supply-chain disruptions, bank runs, fears of an economic downturn/recession and the central banks’ hawkish monetary policy stance to stem out “sticky” inflation, led to ambiguity among investors.These factors resulted in heightened volatility in the equity markets and other asset classes, including commodities, bonds and foreign exchange. Therefore, Morgan Stanley is likely to have recorded an improvement in trading revenues this time around.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter equity trading revenues is pegged at $3.13 billion. The estimate figure suggests a rise of 44% from the previous quarter’s reported number. The consensus estimate for fixed-income trading revenues of $2.23 billion indicates a sequential increase of 57.5%. Our estimates for equity trading revenues and fixed-income trading revenues are $3 billion and $2.04 billion, respectively.Other Key Factors and Estimates for Q1Net Interest Income (NII): Lending activities have continued at a decent pace in the to-be-reported quarter. Per the Fed’s latest data, the demand for real estate loans and consumer loans improved in January and February, while commercial and industrial loans witnessed muted demand. However, following the bank runs in the first week of March, the demand for loans decelerated as recessionary fear gained ground.Nevertheless, the Federal Reserve continued with the tightening of its monetary policy (though the pace has slowed down), raising rates by another 50 basis points in the quarter. The policy rate reached 4.75-5%, the highest since 2008. This is likely to have had a favorable impact on MS’s net interest margin (NIM) and NII. However, the inversion of the yield curve in the March-end quarter is expected to have weighed on NIM to some extent.The consensus estimate for NII is pegged at $2.47 billion, suggesting an increase of 6.6% on a sequential basis. Our estimate for NII is $2.42 billion.Investment Banking (IB) Income: Like 2022, global deal-making continued to shrink in the first quarter. A host of factors, such as geopolitical tensions, inflation, rising interest rates and fears of a global recession, acted as headwinds for M&amp;As.Thus, both deal volume and total value numbers crashed in the quarter. While Morgan Stanley’s position as one of the leading players in the space is likely to have provided some leverage, overall growth in advisory fees is not expected to have been that impressive in the quarter.The consensus estimate for advisory fees is pegged at $804 million, suggesting a rise of 13.1% from the prior quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for the same is $803.8 million.For the same reasons, IPOs and follow-up equity issuances dried up in the to-be-reported quarter. Bond issuance volume witnessed a decline, too, as investors turned pessimistic. Hence, Morgan Stanley’s underwriting fees are expected to have been hurt in the quarter under review. Nevertheless, compared with the previous quarter’s performance, underwriting revenues are not expected to have declined much.The consensus estimate for fixed-income underwriting fees is pegged at $362 million, suggesting a rise of 15.3% sequentially. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity underwriting fees of $217 million indicates a decline of 4.4%. The consensus estimate for total underwriting fees of $579 million implies a rise of 7%.Our estimate for fixed-income underwriting fees is $362.2 million, while that for equity underwriting fees is $217 million.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for IB income of $1.24 billion indicates a decline of 1% from the previous quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for IB income is $1.39 billion.Expenses: Cost reduction, which has long been the main strategy of Morgan Stanley to remain profitable, is unlikely to have provided major support in the March-end quarter. As the company has been investing in franchises, overall costs are anticipated to have flared.Story continuesWhat Our Quantitative Model PredictsAccording to our proven model, the chances of Morgan Stanley beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings this time are low. This is because it doesn’t have the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for Morgan Stanley is -1.35%.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter earnings has moved 1.2% lower to $1.70 over the past seven days. The estimate suggests a 17.5% decline from the year-ago reported number.

77,c69ca3fa-684c-3438-918c-db4d343ed1e8,MS,2023-04-14,Analysts Estimate Morgan Stanley (MS) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-morgan-stanley-ms-140002243.html,1681308002,STORY,"['MS', 'IBKR']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Morgan Stanley (MS) reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 19. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis investment bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.71 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -17%.Revenues are expected to be $14.04 billion, down 5.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.84% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Morgan Stanley?For Morgan Stanley, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.73%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Morgan Stanley will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Morgan Stanley would post earnings of $1.25 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.31, delivering a surprise of +4.80%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Morgan Stanley doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (IBKR), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.40 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +70.7%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.04 billion, up 61.7% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. has been revised 1.4% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, reflecting an equal Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

LOUIS, April 10, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- FleishmanHillard's global Culture Unit today released The Youth Kaleidoscope Report, which sees Gen Alpha and Gen Z shapeshifting their quest for balance in today's tumultuous conditions.To date, much of the research surrounding Gen Z and Gen Alpha presents a fairly one-dimensional view. Both groups are often portrayed as 'freedom fighters' rebelling against systems and structures they have inherited. But much of this sentiment inadvertently puts pressure on these young people to conform and doesn't look to their individual and nuanced characteristics. It presumes young people to be a uniform monolith instead of a generation pulsating with ideas and passions for their futures.""The defining traits of this generation will continue to evolve as they begin to adjust to the world around them, from the world of work, to entering the housing market or even just experiencing their first true heartbreak,"" said Candace Peterson, global head of Brand at FleishmanHillard. ""Young people are ultimately seeking out balance in their endeavour to rationalize the all-too-often chaotic world around them. Responding to this balance by broadening how we look at and define this generation will be of the utmost importance in building rapport and engaging with this generation.""The report uncovers how these ""digital natives"" have grown up in a different landscape than previous generations – more intersectional, with an abundance of technology and social platforms, connections and information; they are the epitome of the cross-culture kid and are widely considered as having greater cultural intelligence, or CQ, than their predecessors. They have different ideals, expectations and approaches to identity than other cohorts, and internal and external stressors significantly affect how they view the world.Story continuesBroken down across Mind, Meta and Why it Matters, the report gives first-hand insights to help understand and authentically engage with this generation as they continue to be shaped by, and are themselves shaping, the world around them.The Youth Kaleidoscope Report was produced in conjunction with an assortment of talented, perceptive and pioneering young thought leaders from around the world who are using social media to connect with their peers. FleishmanHillard teamed up with youth influencer specialists, Youth Marketing Connection, to identify the next wave of expert social media talent across the U.S. and UK who helped address key themes and topics throughout the report, speaking directly to their audiences to discover their thoughts and feelings. The project also continues the agency's partnership with specialist talent agency Zebedee to increase the representation of people with disabilities, alternative appearances and trans/non-binary in the media.Partners include the likes of Ellie Goldstein, a model with Down Syndrome who helped create Kami, the first digital avatar with Down Syndrome; Heather Moradeyo, an advocate for mental health who has used TikTok to create a supportive community for people with schizophrenia to share their stories; and Nemesis Lacroix, a transgender drag artist and full-time gamer who is passionate about challenging stereotypes of gamers and making the LGBTQ+ community visible in online spaces. By collaborating with this young cohort, The Youth Kaleidoscope Report offers an unfiltered and expert view of what brands and organizations need to do to win with them.""The next generation are breaking traditional boundaries, and I've loved being able to do this within the modelling world,"" Goldstein said. ""It's incredible hearing people say that I've inspired them, but we still have a lot to do to show true representation – this is just the start!""Monique Jones, who shares finance and investing advice through @myfinancescrapbook on TikTok, added, ""We are breaking down barriers, banishing binaries and saying a resounding 'No!' to the same old generational BS. I spoke to my audience about the rising financial anxiety, and the pressures to save and spend when all we are being told is doom and gloom. Social media allows me to socialize, play, collaborate and create like no generation before us, and I love being able to share advice that's targeted to my followers, where we can interact in real-time and express ourselves in completely new ways.""Download The Youth Kaleidoscope Report here.About FleishmanHillard FleishmanHillard specializes in public relations, reputation management, public affairs, brand marketing, digital strategy, social engagement and content strategy.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) (Michael M. Santiago via Getty Images)Stabilizing the AWS business is mission critical in the minds of Wall Street.""Slowing cloud demand remains a key concern as businesses shift focus from accelerating cloud migration to optimizing cloud costs,"" Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote in a client note earlier this week. ""AWS estimates continue to contract, with consensus implying year over year growth troughs in 2Q23. Given AWS comprises the vast majority of Amazon's operating income, a stabilization in cloud is crucial for shares to outperform.""Thill's analysis shows 2023 sales estimates for AWS continue to decline, with projections currently 12% lower than they were in February 2022 and 5% lower compared to the start of the year. Operating margin estimates for AWS are alarmingly falling faster, Thill noted, with AWS operating margin estimates for 2023 slashed by 27% compared to where they were in February 2022.Thill cut his 2023 AWS operating margin estimate by 3.5% in the new note. The analyst doesn't see operating margins improving for AWS until 2024.Story continuesOther stats on AWS to consider from Thill's analysis:Consensus estimates imply that the AWS growth rate will bottom in the second quarter of 2023.AWS year-over-year net sales growth has decelerated for four straight quarters.AWS backlog growth has decelerated for three straight quarters.AWS's operating margin remains under pressure since peaking at 35% in the first quarter of 2022, with the fourth-quarter 2022 AWS operating margin of 24.4% representing the lowest level since the second quarter of 2017.Thill contends the slowdown in AWS is the primary reason Amazon's stock has badly underperformed tech rivals over the past year.Amazon stock has shed 35% in the past year, lagging slight drops in cloud rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Salesforce (CRM).And Amazon stock has dropped 44% since Jassy took over as CEO, compared to a 6% decline for the S&amp;P 500 during that time.Jassy, meanwhile, has hauled in about $250 million in total compensation, according to the company's proxy statement also filed today.Amazon executive compensation in 2022.

87,fcdee818-13c7-327a-b684-d337506f11cd,CRM,2023-04-14,Jeremy Grantham and Goldman Sachs Have One Thing in Common: They Both Like These 3 Stocks,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jeremy-grantham-goldman-sachs-one-133020826.html,1681306220,STORY,"['GS', 'CARR', 'SEDG', 'CRM']","[Market watchers are waiting for the day the Fed starts cutting rates, but those hoping such an act will signal the beginning of a bull market are in for a rude awakening. At least, that is the opinion of Jeremy Grantham.Across decades of investing, Grantham’s reputation has been built on predicating market meltdowns, and the legendary investor and GMO co-founder thinks the bear will only be halfway through its wrecking job once the Fed changes it inflation-combating strategy.“Most of the decline in these great bear markets only happens after the first interest rate cut,” Grantham recently said. “So you tell me when the first interest rate cut is, and I will tell you when the second half of the pain is going to start.”However, that doesn’t mean that Grantham has lost hope for all stocks. His portfolio still includes big bets on several names and he’s not the only one showing confidence in these equities. Banking giant Goldman Sachs has also been singing the praises of 3 Grantham-owned stocks, believing they are primed to push ahead from here. Let’s take a closer look.SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG)We’ll start with SolarEdge Technologies, the biggest supplier of photovoltaic inverters in the world. By creating a device that attaches to the back of the solar panel and increases the amount of power generated, the company essentially became the first to make power optimizers a commercially viable product, helping to reduce the cost of the energy the system creates.Given Europe is looking to become less dependent on Russian natural gas, the company is well setup up to cater to increasing demand in the region, which now accounts for nearly 60% of its total solar inverter volume.SolarEdge is showing strong growth, with its revenue soaring by 61.4% year-over-year to $890.7 million in Q4. This impressive increase was largely fueled by the solar segment’s record sales of $837 million. Adj. EPS climbed from $1.10 in the same period a year ago to $2.86. Both the top-and bottom-line displays came in ahead of the forecasts. For Q1, revenue is expected to come in between $915 million and $945 million. The Street was looking for just $914.70 million.Story continuesGrantham obviously thinks SolarEdge has what it takes to outfox the bear. In Q4, GMO increased its position by 59% and holds a total of 657,660 SEDG shares. These are currently worth $189.6 million.Mirroring Grantham’s confidence, Goldman Sachs analyst Brian Lee believes the future is bright for this smart energy leader. He writes: “SEDG’s gross margin recovery story is still only in the middle innings with more drivers of upside yet to fully play out (e.g. freight, Sella 2 manufacturing, IRA credits), while the specter of potential upside and leverage to any further European policy support (e.g. IRA) would make SEDG well-positioned to see further upside in numbers, in our view. At the same time, the Euro could prove to be a tailwind again in the near-term.”These comments form the basis for Lee’s Buy rating on SEDG, while his $420 price target suggests the shares will climb 46% higher over the coming months. (To watch Lee’s track record, click here)Elsewhere on Wall Street, the stock garners an additional 14 Buys and 7 Holds for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Going by the $369.57 average target, investors will pocket returns of 30% a year from now. (See SEDG stock forecast)Salesforce, Inc. (CRM)The next name endorsed by Grantham and Goldman is another leader in its field. Salesforce is a software colossus, specializing in customer relationship management (CRM). Its software and apps provide its client base with the means to offer their own clientele a higher level of service.The offerings focus on sales, analytics, and automation to bespoke customer service, community management, and relationship intelligence, amongst others. The company touts itself as the world’s premier CRM platform for businesses, and with a market cap over $192 billion, that’s no idle boast.After weathering some tough times like many other mega-tech names, Salesforce’s fiscal fourth quarter (January quarter) results were impressive. Revenue reached $8.38 billion, for a 14.4% year-over-year increase while beating the Street’s forecast by $390 million. Adj. EPS also trumped consensus expectations of $1.36, coming in at $1.68. for FQ1, Salesforce guided for revenue in the range between $8.16 – $8.18 Billion, also above the $8.03 billion expected by the analysts. Moreover, via shares repurchases, the company returned $2.3 billion to shareholders.That must all be very pleasing to Grantham. GMO’s stake in Salesforce stands at 1,385,522 shares, currently worth $265.3 million.For Goldman Sachs analyst Kash Rangan, when considering this tech giant’s future, there’s plenty to be upbeat about.“We reiterate the company’s impressive organic growth rate given the company’s size at +$30bn estimated revenues (GSe) in FY23,” Rangan said. “We remain bullish on the company’s ability to drive continued y/y operating margin expansion beyond FY23. We would point out that companies such as Microsoft, Adobe, Intuit and Autodesk which embarked on a journey towards improving OM all benefited from their valuation multiples getting re-rated significantly higher on an EV/Sales basis. We think CRM could join this list especially as the company grows into a formidable $50 billion business in F26/C25, benefiting from a much lower starting point for OM relative to other companies, which on the flip side also offers plenty of room for improvement.”How does this translate to investors? Rangan rates CRM shares a Buy, backed by a $320 price target. That figure makes room for 12-month gains of 69%. (To watch Rangan’s track record, click here)Turning now to the rest of the Street, where CRM has robust support among Rangan’s colleagues. Based on 25 Buy ratings, 11 Holds and just 1 Sell, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average price target stands at $223.21, implying shares will appreciate by 18% over the coming months. (See CRM stock forecast)Carrier Global (CARR)Last but not least on our Grantham-Goldman backed list, we have Carrier Global, a company formed way back in 1915 as a specialist in the making and distribution of HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems.While Carrier is most famous for its residential and commercial air conditioners, its remit has expanded since its early days and now includes the manufacturing of commercial refrigeration and food service equipment, while the company is also an expert in fire and security technologies.For the most part, over the past couple of years, Carrier has managed to beat bottom-line expectations, and while it did not manage to do so in the most recent quarterly update, for 4Q22, at $0.40, adj. EPS still met the analysts’ forecast. Likewise at the top-line; the company might have seen revenue drop by 1% year-over-year to $5.1 billion, but that figure edged ahead of the consensus estimate by $30 million. Looking ahead to the full year 2023, the company guided for sales of $22 billion, also improving on Wall Street’s $20.39 billion forecast, while adj. EPS is expected in the range between $2.50 and $2.60 – at the mid-point, the same as consensus at $2.55.Jeremy Grantham is clearly upbeat about Carrier. His GMO fund currently owns 1,138,546 shares worth $49.55 million.When assessing Carrier’s prospects, Goldman Sachs analyst Joe Ritchie thinks the company is playing it safe with regards to its outlook. He writes, “Improving price/cost, ongoing cost savings, and continued strength in Commercial HVAC suggest EPS guide is likely conservative, and we remain bullish on the company in the long-term given the self-help opportunity coupled with strong growth tailwinds from education stimulus, healthy building orders, and heat pump demand.”Putting these words into ratings and numbers, Ritchie says Buy CARR shares while his $53 price target suggests upside of 22% could be in the cards over the coming year. (To watch Ritchie’s track record, click here)Overall, CARR gets a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 9 Buys vs. 4 Holds. The forecast calls for one-year returns of ~15%, considering the average target stands at $50.

Though the sector was under duress amidst the stock market rout last year, the potential for cloud-computing growth stocks remains stronger than ever. As the market sentiment shifts, investors can open positions in the best growth stocks in the cloud computing sphere at historically low prices.Cloud computing has revolutionized how organizations operate, enhancing efficiency levels for digital operations. Companies worldwide are harnessing the power of cloud computing to analyze data, develop cutting-edge machine-learning models, and facilitate seamless collaboration among teams.Market estimates have shown that the cloud computing industry was valued at around $483 billion last year and could triple to over $1.5 trillion by 2030. Given these staggering numbers, investing in top cloud-computing growth stocks could yield massive returns for savvy investors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCloud-Computing Growth Stocks To Buy: Amazon (AMZN)Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stockSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the undisputed leader in the multi-billion dollar cloud infrastructure services market. Amazon Web Services (AWS) sits comfortably as the most dominant player in the cloud, with a 33% market share, almost double that of the next two competitors.Over the years, it’s consistently generated double-digit revenue growth from its cloud division, essentially becoming a cash cow for its business. Recent results have shown a marked slowdown in growth rates from the division on the back of the challenging macro conditions. Nevertheless, it still posted a 20% increase on a year-over-year basis in sales, contributing $21.4 billion to its overall revenue base.Over the long term, research firms such as Redburn believe the division could be a stand-alone entity with a valuation of over $3 trillion. Moreover, with Amazon trading at a market cap of roughly $1.04 trillion, it could represent a colossal 200% bump in value for just its cloud division.Story continuesSalesforce (CRM)lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco.

Moreover, it boasts a highly sticky user base that has helped generate robust cash flows each year.Despite the post-pandemic slowdown and elongated software purchase decisions from customers, the company has proven to be resilient in growth. In the fourth quarter, the company reported revenues of $8.4 billion, a 14% YOY increase, with more than 90% of revenues being generated from subscriptions. Furthermore, the tech giant saw full-year sales increase by an impressive 18%, reaching $31.4 billion.Furthermore, CRM has recently demonstrated a shift towards prioritizing shareholder returns. On the back of its strong cash flow performance, it has bumped its stock buyback plan from $10 billion to $20 billion. Additionally, the appointment of Elliott Management directors to the board further reinforces its commitment to its investors.

Strong demand for automated equipment and sustainable packaging solutions will drive Sealed Air’s food and protected packaging segments.However, the company has been witnessing a decline in volume over the past quarters. The decline in the food retail market is impacting the Food segment, whereas recessionary pressures in the industrial and fulfillment markets are denting the Protective segment’s margin.  Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 31.5% in a year compared with the industry’s fall of 5%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Strong demand for automated equipment and sustainable packaging solutions is expected to drive Sealed Air’s food and protected packaging segments. Its protein automation pipeline continues to grow across all regions, with major food producers committing to its SEE Touchless Automation future. Its fluid solutions portfolio, which consists of Cryovac Barrier Bags and pouches, for condiments, soups and sauces, is witnessing growth on demand rebound. In the protective segment, continued growth in e-commerce and fulfillment, and higher demand in industrial end markets will contribute to growth.Around 63% of Sealed Air’s revenues come from the packaging of protein, foods, fluids and goods for the medical and life sciences industries. The food care business continues to benefit from the shift in demand for case ready, shrink bags, and pre-packaged meals and snacks designed for home consumption. In the medical and life sciences portfolio, demand for protected packaging solutions for medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, and personal protective equipment is high. SEE is also benefiting from growth in online shipments of medical equipment and pharmaceuticals.For 2023, Sealed Air expects net sales between $5.85 billion and $6.10 billion. The guidance indicates an year-over-year increase of 4-8%,  which includes a favorable impact of 6% from the Liquibox acquisition and an unfavorable currency impact of 1%. SEE anticipates adjusted EBITDA of $1.25-$1.30 billion. Adjusted earnings per share are forecast to be $3.50-$3.80. Notably, the company earlier stated $4.05-$4.20. Sealed Air projects a free cash flow of $475-$525 million for 2023.However, Sealed Air has been facing supply-chain disruptions and higher raw material costs from various factors, including general inflationary pressure, limited availability of certain raw materials, and global transportation disruptions. On top of this, the company has faced higher freight costs associated with the sourcing and movement of raw materials due to overall tight market conditions. These factors have been weighing on its margin performance. The company has increased its R&amp;D investments for innovation and automation, which will weigh on margins.In 2022, Sealed Air witnessed a 6% year-over-year overall volume decline. In the Food segment, volumes decreased 3% in the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by food retail market declines across the Americas and EMEA regions, and the adverse impacts of prior supply disruptions. In Protective, volumes were down 20% in fourth-quarter 2022, resulting from recessionary pressures in the industrial and fulfillment markets. The company anticipates pressure on volume growth to persist in the upcoming quarters.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the Industrial Products sector are Encore Wire Corporation WIRE, OI Glass, Inc.

This led to a dull year-over-year performance in fourth-quarter 2022.The company has also been witnessing pressures related to global supply-chain disruptions, energy costs, and rising raw materials, freight and logistic costs. All these factors marred WHR’s margin performance across most regions in fourth-quarter 2022.The company generated a gross profit of $645 million, down 39.3% from $1,063 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Ongoing EBIT of $171 million declined 66% from $502 million in the year-ago quarter. The ongoing EBIT margin of 3.5% contracted 510 bps year over year.Management expects continued investments in marketing and technology, as well as currency headwinds, to negatively impact margins by 125 basis points in 2023. An unfavorable price/mix is likely to affect the ongoing EBIT margin by 225 basis points.For 2023, net sales are anticipated to decline 1-2% to $19.4 billion, in sync with our estimate of a 1.7% decrease. On a GAAP and ongoing basis, Whirlpool expects earnings per share of $16-$18. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Consequently, shares of WHR have lost 13.1% in the past three months, underperforming the industry’s decline of 12.6%.Pricing Actions, Much-Needed SupportThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been on track with early and decisive actions to protect margins and productivity amid the ongoing supply-chain constraints and significant inflationary pressures. It has implemented cost takeout actions, including curtailing structural and discretionary costs, capturing raw material deflation opportunities, effectively managing working capital, and syncing supply chain and labor levels with demand.The company announced significant cost-based price increases of 5% to 18% in various countries. WHR also launched a cost takeout program worth $500 million, which is likely to reduce fixed and variable costs in 2023. Keeping in these lines, management is on track with its cost takeout actions, and expects $800-$900 million related to gains from the aforementioned measures and eased raw material inflation. The company expects to generate $500 million in net cost takeout actions via premium cost reductions of more than $250 million and supply-chain inefficiencies.In fourth-quarter 2022, the company concluded the strategic review of EMEA. As part of this, the company’s Europe major domestic appliance business will form a new entity with Arçelik. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2023. The new company is likely to generate more than €6 billion in annual sales and above €200 million in cost synergies.Story continuesConclusionWe believe that Whirlpool’s productivity and pricing actions will help offset the ongoing supply-chain constraints and significant inflationary pressures. Topping it, a VGM Score of B reflects its inherent strength.

The company’s efforts to expand digital and omni-channel capabilities through investments in mobile, omni-channel and fulfillment bode well.

These initiatives are likely to go a long way in continuing to bolster the company’s performance.An uptrend in the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate echoes a positive sentiment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ralph Lauren’s fiscal 2023 sales and earnings per share (EPS) is pegged at $6.37 billion and $8.11, respectively. Sales estimates suggest growth of 2.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure, while the EPS estimate indicates a 3.2% decline.

The stock also compared favorably against the Consumer Discretionary sector’s decline of 14.8% and the S&amp;P 500’s fall of 7.1%. An impressive long-term projected EPS growth rate of 9.3% further highlights the strength of this lifestyle goods retailer.Let’s take a look at the factors that make the stock an attractive pick. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Factors to Aid GrowthRalph Lauren has been making significant progress in expanding digital and omni-channel capabilities, which are aiding the top line. In third-quarter fiscal 2023, the digital business continued to be a key growth driver, with accelerated digital sales across all regions. The company’s global digital ecosystem witnessed year-over-year high-single-digit revenue growth and more than 40% on a two-year stack basis. This includes 10% growth within the owned Ralph Lauren and digital sites on top of more than 30% growth last year.RL has been focused on further digital investments to continue content creation for all platforms, enhancing digital capabilities to improve the user experience, and continuing to leverage AI and data to serve its consumers more efficiently. Ralph Lauren continues to scale and expand its connected retail capabilities, including virtual selling appointments, “buy online, pick up in store,” and endless aisle product availability.The company launched its first-ever full-catalog Ralph Lauren mobile app during the holiday season, efficiently leveraging its connected retail capabilities to deliver the most personalized and content-rich platform. It introduced additional digital sites in key markets, including Korea and Australia, in the fiscal third quarter. A positive mix of products, investments in AI-powered targeting and consumer acquisition bode well. Also, its online search grew year over year and exceeded 51 million social media followers on a global basis.Ralph Lauren has also been on track to exceed its top and bottom-line targets under the “Next Great Chapter” plan announced in June 2018. Later, it announced measures to accelerate its “Next Great Chapter plan,” which includes creating a simplified global organizational structure and rolling out improved technological capabilities.As part of the plan, RL completed the transition of Chaps to a licensed business, thus concluding its portfolio realignment announced last year. The move will likely enable it to focus on core brands, as part of the Next Great Chapter elevation strategy.For fiscal 2023, RL anticipates year-over-year revenue growth (cc) in the high-single digits on a 52-week comparable basis.

94,3381e648-6007-3545-93fd-845556f5e5c7,RL,2023-04-14,Here's Why lululemon (LULU) is Marching Ahead of Its Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-lululemon-lulu-marching-144902608.html,1681310942,STORY,"['LULU', 'HRB', 'PVH', 'RL']","[lululemon athletica LULU has been gaining from continued business momentum, as well as robust traffic trends in stores and e-commerce. The company’s Power of Three ×2 growth strategy bodes well.The above-mentioned factors led to strong fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results, with revenues and earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimates. Earnings beat estimates for the 11th straight quarter in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022. Its sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth straight quarter. The top and bottom lines improved year over year.lululemon’s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings increased 30.6% from the year-ago quarter. The company’s adjusted earnings improved 25% on a three-year CAGR basis. Revenues advanced 30% year over year, driven by the strong momentum in its business, backed by a favorable response to its products. On a constant-dollar basis, revenues improved 33%. On a three-year CAGR basis, net revenues increased 26%.The company’s net revenues grew 29% in North America and 35% internationally. On a three-year CAGR basis, revenues improved 24% in North America and 39% internationally. lululemon’s total comparable sales rose 27% year over year and 30% on a constant-dollar basis.Consequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 15.9% in the past three months against the industry’s decline of 2.6%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research That said, let’s delve deeper into the other factors aiding LULU.Key Growth Driverslululemon witnessed a rebound in brick-and-mortar sales, driven by increased store traffic as consumers returned to stores for shopping. In the company’s store channel, sales increased 26% year over year and 10% on a three-year CAGR basis. At stores, comparable store sales increased 15% and 17% on a constant-dollar basis.The company witnessed more than 30% traffic growth at stores. On a three-year CAGR basis, traffic was up 7% in stores. Management highlighted that store productivity in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 continued to trend above the 2019 level. The company has been focused on investments to enhance the in-store experience. It has been leveraging its stores to facilitate omni-channel capabilities, including buy online pick up in store (BOPUS) and ship from store.LULU has implemented several strategies to improve the guest experience and reduce wait time. These include virtual waitlist, mobile POS and appointment shopping. These functionalities enable reducing the time of waiting in line to enter the store, as well as allow customers to complete some transactions like returns, exchanges and purchase of gift cards without entering the store.lululemon expects to capture the growing online demand and ensure a robust shopping experience through its accelerated e-commerce investments. Increased focus on developing sites, building transactional omni functionality and increasing fulfillment capabilities bode well. The company has been strengthening omni-channel capabilities, such as curbside pickups, same-day deliveries and BOPUS. It is enhancing its mobile app in a bid to offer the curbside pickup service and train its store associates to speed up transactions. Free online digital educator service for people that cannot make it into the company’s stores bodes well.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, direct-to-consumer net revenues climbed 37% (up 39% on a constant-dollar basis). In the digital channel, revenues accounted for 52% of the company’s net revenues compared with 49% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. E-commerce traffic improved more than 45% in the fiscal fourth quarter and 40% on a three-year CAGR basis.Digital revenues amounted to $1.4 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter. The company’s e-commerce business delivered an impressive performance, with revenues increasing 46% on a three-year CAGR basis. Digital comps increased 39% on a constant-dollar basis.lululemon has been on track with its Power of Three ×2 growth strategy. The move is likely to double its revenues from $6.25 billion in 2021 to $12.5 billion by 2026. The plan focuses on three key growth drivers —product innovation, guest experience and market expansion. The five-year plan is likely to quadruple international sales, along with doubling digital and menswear sales. Also, the women’s business and North America operations are each anticipated to witness a low-double-digit CAGR in revenues, with store channel growth in the mid-teens in the next five years. As part of its strategy, the company intends to expand in China and Europe markets, with plans to open stores in Spain and Italy.For 2021-2026, the total net revenue CAGR is expected to be 15%, with a slight expansion in the operating margin on an annual basis. lululemon anticipates bottom-line growth to outpace revenue growth. Although the 2026 targets seem too bold, the company believes that these are achievable due to its strong financial position.Story continuesHurdleslululemon has been grappling with elevated costs, hurting the gross margin. The gross margin contracted 300 basis points (bps) to 55.1% in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022. The adjusted gross profit increased 28.7% to $1,590.5 million, while the gross margin declined 70 bps to 57.4%. The decline in the gross margin can be attributed to a 50-bps deleverage from foreign currency, offset by a 30-bps decline in the product margin.Income from operations declined 47% year over year to $314.4 million. The operating margin fell significantly to 11.3% from the prior-year quarter’s 27.7%. The adjusted income from operations rose 33% year over year in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 to $785.3 million. The adjusted operating margin contracted 50 bps to 28.3%.It continues to witness higher SG&amp;A costs. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, the company’s SG&amp;A expenses of $803.1 million increased 25.1% from the year-ago quarter due to higher corporate SG&amp;A, and a slight increase in depreciation and amortization. For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, management anticipates a 60-80 bps deleverage in the SG&amp;A expense rate for the fiscal first quarter, driven by higher investments. For fiscal 2023, LULU expects the SG&amp;A rate to deleverage 120-140 bps year over year.The deleverage is likely to be driven by increased investments to support market expansion, improve the guest experience by enhancing omni-channel capabilities and making foundational investments to support growth. The company anticipates higher depreciation for fiscal 2023 due to ongoing and prior investments.lululemon's elevated inventory levels at the end of the quarter hurt investors’ sentiment. The company’s inventory grew 49.8% to $1,447.4 million at the end of fiscal 2022. This included a $62.9-million provision against inventory related to lululemon Studio, which reduced the inventory growth rate by seven percentage points. The company noted that the off-season accounted for about 45% of its inventory.For fiscal 2023, management expects moderate inventory growth, while maintaining its full-price selling model and remaining well-positioned to fulfill guest demand. lululemon expects the inventory growth rate at the end of the fiscal first quarter to increase 30-35% from that reported in the last year. The company expects inventory growth to be in line with sales growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.ConclusionWe believe that robust sales, led by solid online and store traffic, will help offset cost headwinds. Encouragingly, management expects the strong business momentum to continue in fiscal 2023. We estimate the company’s net revenues for the current fiscal year to reflect growth of 15.9% to $9,396.7 million. This is in sync with the company’s guidance of $9.300-$9.410 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 15-16%. lululemon’s revenue view represents slightly better sales than its target under the Power of Three x2 growth plan. GAAP EPS is projected to be $11.50-$11.72 for fiscal 2023.lululemon anticipates a gross margin increase of 140-160 bps for fiscal 2023 due to lower air freight expenses. For the fiscal year, the company expects air freight to decline 150 bps year over year. However, the company expects fiscal 2023 markdowns to be in line with those reported in the last year and fiscal 2019. The company expects the operating margin for fiscal 2023 to increase 20-40 bps from that recorded in the last year. The increase is expected to be slightly higher than the Power of Three x2 long-term target of a modest expansion annually.For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, management anticipates net revenues of $1,890-$1.930 billion, indicating 17-20% year-over-year growth. The company projects EPS of $1.93-$2 for the fiscal first quarter. The fiscal first-quarter gross margin is likely to expand 290-320 bps year over year. The gross margin is expected to benefit from lower air freight expenses, offset by currency headwinds and strategic investments in the supply chain and distribution centers. lululemon expects the operating margin to increase 200 bps in the fiscal first quarter.Topping it, earnings estimates for the current financial year have grown 1% to $11.43 in the past 30 days. Also, a VGM Score of B and a long-term earnings growth rate of 20% reflect its inherent strength.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies are Ralph Lauren RL, PVH Corp PVH and H&amp;R Block HRB.Ralph Lauren, a footwear and accessories dealer, has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

ALGN need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Apr 21, 2023 $95 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Align Technology shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Align Technology is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Medical - Dental Supplies industry that ranks in the Top 18% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.70 per share to $1.68 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Align Technology right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

Think of it as cloud-based alternative to OpenAI’s conversational chatbot ChatGPT or text-to-image AI software DALL·E, but with more options.Read moreWhole Foods has shut down a store in downtown San Francisco on safety concernsYour anxiety brings 4 distinct superpowersAmericans may have seen the last of big rent hikesInstead of building massive AI models in house, Amazon’s Bedrock will give customers “easy access to foundation models (FMs)” from top AI startup model providers, which they can customize with their own data and deploy in their apps. These include fledgling startups like AI21, Anthropic, and Stability AI. Amazon’s own Titan family of FMs is also on the roster.“Bedrock is the easiest way for customers to build and scale generative AI-based applications using FMs, democratizing access for all builders,” Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of data and machine learning at Amazon Web Services (AWS), wrote in a blogpost. Consultancy and IT firms like Accenture, Deloitte, Infosys, and Slalom are already building practices to “help enterprises go faster with generative AI,” he added.The goal is to equip AWS customers across industries such as healthcare, finance, tech, manufacturing, filmmaking, and more, with “flexibility and choice to use the best models for their specific needs,” the company said.The need for Amazon Bedrock, according to CEO Andy Jassy“Most companies want to use these large language models, but the really good ones take billions of dollars to train and many years and most companies don’t want to go through that. So what they want to do is they want to work off of a foundational model that’s big and great already and then have the ability to customize it for their own purposes.

This will help them promote stability and security for residents, nations and multinational alliances.”It comes as investment in fighter jet technology continues to grow. The Ministry of Defence said it will release another £656m of funding for the £2bn next-generation Tempest warplane programme, led in the UK by BAE Systems.Story continuesThe programme kicked off with £250m of funding in 2021 as BAE and partners including Rolls-Royce prepare a prototype for flight later this decade.The supersonic aircraft will offer next-generation radar together with the ability to control drone swarms and is expected to fly with the Royal Air Force from 2035. Tempest is expected to replace the Eurofighter Typhoon in RAF service.Italy and the UK, the two nations collaborating on the Tempest project, brought Japan on as a partner last year.]"

As part of the collaboration, Walgreens will leverage its national footprint, portfolio of industry-leading healthcare companies and compliance framework to match patient populations to this Prothena clinical trial for PRX012, which has been granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230413005191/en/""Alzheimer’s disease is an incredibly complex disorder and requires all stakeholders to work together to develop and evaluate effective therapies,"" said Ramita Tandon, chief clinical trials officer, Walgreens. ""Through Walgreens trusted community pharmacy presence and daily interactions with millions of patients across America, we believe we can have a meaningful impact in helping Prothena with their clinical trial recruitment efforts. Our aim is to help build a more representative patient population for Alzheimer’s research, particularly among underserved and diverse communities, to create a better understanding of this disease.""""The Alzheimer’s community is at the beginning of a transformational change as more treatment options become available to slow the progression of this devastating and fatal disease. At Prothena, we’re excited about PRX012 and the impact it could have as a next-generation Alzheimer’s disease treatment with the potential for more convenient administration for patients and caregivers,"" said Hideki Garren, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer, Prothena. ""This innovative partnership will allow Prothena to leverage Walgreens unique capabilities to engage a broader and more representative patient population for potential enrollment in ASCENT-2 and accelerate the development of the PRX012 program to bring this potential best-in-class anti-amyloid beta antibody to patients as soon as possible.""Story continuesOperating in nearly 9,000 locations, nearly half of which are in socially vulnerable areas, Walgreens pharmacy teams can help address patients’ specific needs and barriers to care. Using the company’s pharmacy and patient-authorized clinical data, Walgreens will identify and engage with potentially eligible patients and their caregivers where it is most convenient for them – in the pharmacy, at home or digitally – to educate them on Prothena’s ASCENT-2 clinical trial. Walgreens will then invite interested patients or their caregivers to complete a pre-screen to determine eligibility for participation at one of Prothena’s clinical trial sites.These efforts align with the Equity in Neuroscience and Alzheimer’s Clinical Trials (ENACT) Act’s objectives of boosting the participation of underrepresented populations in Alzheimer’s and dementia clinical trials. In the United States, it is estimated more than 6.5 million people over the age of 65 are living with Alzheimer's disease1. Studies show that Black and Hispanic older adults are at a significantly higher risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease than White older adults2, yet these populations have been historically left out of clinical trials3.Prothena’s Phase 1 PRX012 single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) studies are ongoing with topline data expected year end 2023.For more information on Alzheimer’s disease, please visit Walgreens.com.For more information about the ASCENT clinical trial, visit ASCENT-AD.com.About WalgreensWalgreens (www.walgreens.com) is included in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy and U.S. Healthcare segments of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

(NASDAQ:WBA) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 60% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walgreens-boots-alliance-inc-nasdaq-120020603.html,1681300820.0,STORY,['WBA'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Walgreens Boots Alliance implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceA total of 15 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership Insiders have been buying lately A look at the shareholders of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 60% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Walgreens Boots Alliance. See our latest analysis for Walgreens Boots Alliance ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Walgreens Boots Alliance?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Walgreens Boots Alliance already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Walgreens Boots Alliance's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Walgreens Boots Alliance. The company's largest shareholder is Newcip S.A., with ownership of 17%. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.1% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 7.0% of the company stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 15 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Walgreens Boots AllianceWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.. However, it's possible that insiders might have an indirect interest through a more complex structure. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$163m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 23% stake in Walgreens Boots Alliance. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Private Company OwnershipIt seems that Private Companies own 17%, of the Walgreens Boots Alliance stock. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Walgreens Boots Alliance   you should know about.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

The stock has gained 32.8% in the past year compared with the industry’s rally of 14.8%.In 2023, we expect the company’s sales to increase 11.1% year over year to $35,842.9 million. Our model estimates North America and International sales to increase 13.6% and 2.6% year over year, respectively. The adjusted operating margin is anticipated to be 15.8%.However, dismal China results, higher-than-expected inflationary pressures, increased costs and a tight labor market continue to weigh on SBUX’s performance.Let’s delve deeper.Growth DriversThe company’s North America comps impressed investors for the eighth straight quarter by improving 14% in first-quarter fiscal 2023. The uptick was driven by 10% growth in company-operated comparable store sales, new store growth and higher contribution from licensed store sales. Average ticket and transaction increased 9% and 1%, respectively.Despite unfavorable economic conditions, Starbucks is focusing on expansion efforts. In the fiscal first quarter, it opened 459 net new stores worldwide, bringing the total store count to 36,170. In fiscal 2023, the store count in the United States and China is expected to grow 3% and 13%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.SBUX expects global store growth to be 7%. Capital expenditure in fiscal 2023 is estimated to be $2.5 billion.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is strengthening its product portfolio with significant innovation around beverages, refreshment, health and wellness, tea and core food offerings. It is leaning toward fast-growing categories like Cold Brew, Draft Nitro beverages, and plant-based modifiers, including almond, coconut and soy milk alternatives. Apart from the numerous beverage innovations, Starbucks has been making efforts to offer more nutritional and healthy products to its customers.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research ConcernsCOVID-19 has negatively impacted SBUX’s performance in China. In the fiscal first quarter, comps in China declined 29% year over year (compared with a 16% fall in the previous quarter). The downtick was caused by declines of 28% and 1% in transactions and average tickets, respectively. The pandemic is expected to affect Starbucks’ performance in China in the near term as well.Inflationary pressures, along with increased investments in labor growth (including enhanced store-partner wages and partner training), limited the company’s margin in first-quarter fiscal 2023. Reduced traffic in China (due to COVID-19 restrictions) added to the woes. On a non-GAAP basis, the operating margin in fiscal first quarter was 14.4%, down from 14.6% in the prior-year quarter.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector are Chuy's Holdings, Inc.

For one, it seems that the Federal Reserve’s rate hiking campaign is approaching its limits. Two, the banking system has started to stumble amid sharply higher interest rates. While this has been rough for bank investors, we’re now seeing a rotation out of financials and back into growth stocks. From here, if inflation starts to come down and interest rates reverse course, we could see a meaningful recovery in growth stocks.In any case, many growth stocks are priced for attractive returns after steep declines in 2022. In fact. these seven growth stocks, in particular, should offer investors a favorable outlook for the rest of 2023.DDOGDatadog$65.52VVisa$225.93UUnity Software$30.66BROSDutch Bros$32.57TOSTToast$16.87TXNTexas Instruments$179.22CNXCConcentrix$111.41Datadog (DDOG)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comDatadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) operates a cloud-based platform that enables firms to manage their monitoring and security functions with just one product.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith Datadog, its clients can monitor and secure their servers, workflows, databases, and other IT hardware from just one application — a stark contrast to traditional systems which are compartmentalized. The company also gets rid of blind spots and vulnerabilities within the enterprise, making it easier to monitor and secure just about everything. As hacking and cyberwarfare are pressing concerns, firms like Datadog should enjoy a strong tailwind in coming years.Datadog has been one of the industry’s most remarkable success stories. The company has grown revenues from a modest $101 million in 2017 to $1.7 billion in its latest fiscal year. Analysts expect the strong growth to continue, with Datadog set to top $2 billion in sales this year.Datadog is already profitable, which puts it ahead of many of its peers. DDOG stock is down more than 50% over the past year, making shares a far more reasonable bargain at today’s price.Story continuesVisa (V)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockVisa (NYSE:V) along with Mastercard (NYSE:MA) have a tremendous business model which reliably earns some of the highest EBITDA profit margins of any S&amp;P 500 constituent companies.What makes Visa’s business model so great is that it doesn’t take credit risk. Rather, the bank that issues a credit card shoulders the risk if a client fails to pay. Visa, by contrast, is paid on transactions. As volumes go up, so do Visa’s profits. With inflation setting in globally, that leads to an increase in Visa’s business as well as average transaction size goes up.Visa was hampered over the past few years due to the pandemic. It charges much higher fees on international cross-border transactions, which were necessarily limited in recent times. With global travel roaring back, however, Visa’s next leg up should be upon us. Meanwhile, V stock has been flat over the past two years, making for a more attractive entry point today.Unity Software (U)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comUnity Software (NYSE:U) is the operator of a leading graphics engine. Game developers use Unity as the framework for designing video games. All because the company is highly flexible, allowing developers to build a game that will work cross-platform across PC, consoles, mobile, and even augmented and virtual reality.Reportedly, Mark Zuckerburg wanted to acquire Unity for Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) to be a central piece of Meta’s virtual reality plans. However, that never came to fruition and Unity remains an independent company today.Analysts expect for Unity to reach profitability in 2023. Better, top-line revenue growth is expected to run nearly 20%/year over the next few years, which is an impressive base for a company that already generates $2 billion per year in annualized revenues. With Meta shares on the rebound, and potential revival of interest in the metaverse or augmented reality could bode well for U stock.Dutch Bros (BROS)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Dutch Bros (NYSE:BROS) is a small, but rapidly growing coffee chain. The firm is seeking to shake up the industry and take some significant market share from Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX).Starbucks has long dominated the American coffee market. However, the pandemic caused people to reimagine their daily routines. Now, some people may not want to linger at Starbucks stores like they did before. Dutch Bros is well-positioned for this, as it operates small stores that emphasize serving folks quickly rather than being a place to hang out for extended periods.Dutch Bros has also focused on customer service. It is known for having upbeat personable staff. Given Starbucks’ current issues with labor unions and potential worker strikes, Dutch Bros’ focus on its employees could be a strong feature.It remains to be seen just how much purchasing power and economic activity the next generation will account for. That said, Dutch Bros looks like an early entrant in the category of growth stocks that will win as Gen Z — aka the “zoomers” — start to make their presence felt in the economy.Toast (TOST)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comSticking with restaurants, there’s Toast (NYSE:TOST), which offers a cloud-based digital technology platform for restaurants, bars, and other such related types of businesses.Toast offers its clients a sophisticated point-of-sale (POS) system that handles ordering and payments for restaurants. The company also offers other related products and services such as its mobile order and pay offerings, its kitchen display system, and a management tool that allows restaurants to set and change menus across multiple locations and channels. Within payments, Toast has other features such as a card-reader which enable contactless payments.Toast has had success in recent years, growing from about $665 million in revenues in 2019 to an estimated $3.5 billion in sales in 2023. The pandemic, in particular, drove a great deal of adoption as restaurants needed to enable contactless payments, digital ordering, and other such features that Toast offers.Toast is still unprofitable, which can be risky given current market conditions. However, shares have pulled back from $25 to $17 since February. That has TOST stock at a market capitalization of less than $9 billion, which works out to less than three times revenues. That’s not a bad price.Texas Instruments (TXN)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is the world’s largest analog semiconductor company. Analog semiconductors are of vital importance, since they can take real-world information, such as climatological observations, and convert them into data that software can utilize.These analog semiconductors will be vital for many emerging industries and technologies such as connected and self-driving cars, Internet of Things devices, remote monitoring and security, and many other such functions. The analog chips are also less cyclical than other parts of the industry, like memory, since analog feeds into many industrial applications rather than just fast-moving consumer electronics devices.Texas Instruments’ unceasing focus is on growing its free cash flow generated per share. This has allowed the firm to repurchase large amounts of stock while also giving shareholders generous dividend increases. With TXN stock flat over the past year, shares are at a reasonable 23x forward earnings. That’s a fine price given that Texas Instruments has put up an incredible 20%/year compounded earnings growth rate over the past decade.Concentrix (CNXC)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comConcentrix (NASDAQ:CNXC) is a technology firm which offers data processing and outsourcing services for its clients.

These include products which help clients manage customer lifecycles, data analytics, customer experience and design, and so on.Concentrix has a wide customer base, serving clients across retail, e-commerce, travel, banking, and healthcare, among other industries. Customer experience isn’t the most glamorous vertical for software and outsourcing, but it is vital to making enterprises work over the long-term. As such, Concentrix should enjoy steady and recurring revenue streams.The company has grown revenues from $2.5 billion in fiscal year 2018 to $6.3 billion last year. Analysts expect the company to continue to grow at a high single digits rate, despite the current industry slowdown, while shares sell for just 10 times forward earnings today.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in U, V, TXN stock.

A few names have reported strong quarterly results and hit new highs. However, the underperformance of this group has left several undervalued consumer stocks.For instance, the SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF (NYSEARCA:XRT) is up just 2.2% so far this year. That lags the 7% and 15% return from the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq, respectively.In fact, before the broad-based market rally that came in the second half of March, this sector looked downright concerning. At one point, it even looked like these stocks were flashing some sort of recessionary warning sign.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith the latest rally, that worry has died down a bit. If it comes to fruition — a recession that is — then most of these stocks will get even cheaper. Let’s look at a few undervalued consumer stocks now.SBUXStarbucks$104.68HDHome Depot$288.61DKSDick’s Sporting Goods$137.94Starbucks (SBUX)Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a StrategySource: monticello / Shutterstock.comStarbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) has been one of my favorite long-term holdings over the last 10-plus years.It has been (mostly) consistent and continues to generate strong sales and earnings results. It resonates well with young and old customers alike and when you think about the sales it generates in a day, it’s hard to pass on a high-quality consumer company like this.When the Covid-19 pandemic unfolded, how many Starbucks locations did you see with lines wrapped around it? Enough to make you realize that not even a global pandemic can stop this business.The problem? Now trading near 29 times earnings, it’s hard to call this stock cheap. I look at it like this, though.Shares trade at roughly 25 times next year’s earnings estimates. It’s expected that the firm’s revenue will increase by 11.5% this year and the following year, with 15% earnings growth in 2023 and 20% growth in 2024.China is as Starbucks’ second-largest market. If there’s a steady uptick in this region, then Starbucks stock could exceed all current consensus estimates. Wouldn’t it be great to accumulate some shares around $85?Story continuesHome Depot (HD)the outside of a home depot storeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comMoving down the valuation ladder, we get Home Depot (NYSE:HD).However, with the lower valuation comes lower growth rates, as the pause in the housing sector has finally caught up to the home improvement retailers.That’s as Home Depot is up just 8.5% from its 52-week low. I’m not sure why there’s a lack of love for this name, but that’s the case right now. It may be due to forecasts calling for flat revenue growth this year and a 5% earnings dip.It leaves shares trading at roughly 18 times this year’s earnings expectations, which is not all that bad. Particularly when the stock pays out a 2.9% dividend yield.The dividend has been a proper focus over the years, with management raising the annual payout for 13 straight years. The five-year growth rate is at an impressive 16% to boot.Finally, even if we see a housing slowdown over the next year or two, what do you think all of the people who locked in 30-year mortgages with sub-4% rates are going to do? They’re going to stay put and fix up their houses.Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS)Exterior of Dick's Sporting Goods retail store including sign and logo.Source: George Sheldon via ShutterstockEven though Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) recently hit an all-time high, it’s one that investors may still consider as undervalued.When the company reported earnings on March 7th, the retailer delivered a top- and bottom-line beat, growing revenue about 7.4% year over year.Even better, it provided strong full-year earnings guidance that topped analysts’ expectations and more than doubled its dividend payout. Shares now yield close to 3%.Perhaps the best part about all of this?Dick’s Sporting Goods stock trades at just over 10 times this year’s earnings estimates! While consensus expectations only call for mild single-digit revenue growth this year and next year, estimates call for almost 12% earnings growth.While that’s not quite the pace Starbucks is running at, Dick’s comes at a much lower price.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This company, which is in the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This maker of motion and control products has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 10.59%.For the most recent quarter, Parker-Hannifin was expected to post earnings of $4.45 per share, but it reported $4.76 per share instead, representing a surprise of 6.97%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $4.15 per share, while it actually produced $4.74 per share, a surprise of 14.22%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Parker-Hannifin, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Parker-Hannifin currently has an Earnings ESP of +4.59%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Sysco’s diversified operations have also been an upside. Moreover, gains from acquisitions have been strengthening the company’s brand portfolio.That said, SYY has been battling cost inflation. On its second-quarter earnings call, management lowered its bottom-line guidance for fiscal 2023. Let’s delve deeper.Factors Working WellSysco’s Recipe for Growth program involves five strategic priorities aimed at enabling the company to grow 1.5 times faster than the market by FY24 end. The five strategic pillars include enhancing customers’ experiences via digital tools. In this regard, the company’s Sysco Shop platform and the new pricing software are working well. Further, SYY is focused on improving the supply chain to cater to customers efficiently and consistently with better delivery and omnichannel inventory management.Sysco aims at providing customer-oriented merchandising and marketing solutions to augment sales. The company also targets having team-based selling, with an emphasis on important cuisines. Finally, Sysco is focused on cultivating new capacities, channels and segments alongside sponsoring investments via cost-saving initiatives.SYY has been carrying out various acquisitions over the years to grow its distribution network and customer base and boost long-term growth. In February 2022, the company concluded the acquisition of The Coastal Companies, which operates under Sysco’s specialty produce business – FreshPoint. Before this, the company acquired Greco and Sons in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. We note that these acquisitions go in tandem with Sysco’s Recipe for Growth.Sysco Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseSysco Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Sysco Corporation QuoteCost Woes HurtSysco has been encountering product cost inflation in the U.S. Foodservice unit for a while now. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the company witnessed product cost inflation of 8.3%, which was measured by estimated changes in product costs, mainly in the dairy, frozen food and fresh produce categories. The persistence of such trends poses threats to margins.Management’s updated view for fiscal 2023 includes factors, such as softer-than-originally-planned market volumes, greater-than-planned operating costs, solid margin management and gross profit per case and lower corporate expenses. Management stated that the third quarter is usually the lowest volume quarter, while the fourth quarter is the highest volume quarter.Sysco now expects earnings per share (EPS) in the band of $4-$4.15, suggesting 23-28% growth from the year-ago period. On its first-quarter earnings call, management guided adjusted EPS in the range of $4.09-$4.39 for fiscal 2023, suggesting 26-35% growth. The guidance includes the expectations of macroeconomic volatility and a potential decline in food-away-from-home demand.Story continuesWrapping UpSysco is a diversified company, which covers every part of the food-away-from-home market. The company’s operations are diversified across different customer types, product categories and geographies.Sysco caters to restaurants of all price-point spectrums and types. It also caters to health care and education facilities alongside travel and recreation facilities in office buildings. Travel and recreation facilities are seeing a continued revival and are likely to be a growth area in the coming years.We believe that these upsides are likely to work well for Sysco amid cost headwinds.

Specifically, during the week ending March 22, Yahoo Finance reported that depositors drained $126 billion from U.S. banks. Unlike prior such transactions, this time around, the outflow originated from the nation’s largest institutions.Put another way, regular folks are reading between the lines. Additionally, with banking jitters going abroad and surprise production cuts spiking the price of crude oil, the Federal Reserve’s problems overflow the table. There’s only so much that one entity can do, contributing to the pessimism. About the only solution now may be to consider these safe stocks to buy.MSFTMicrosoft$289.39PGProcter &amp; Gamble$150.96MCDMcDonald’s$283.78OLLIOllie’s Bargain Outlet$59.10INTUIntuit$444.72ALLAllstate$116.11ADMArcher Daniels Midland$80.05InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMicrosoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comAs a technology giant, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) might not be everyone’s idea for safe stocks to buy. After all, the mass layoffs that have been occurring since last year mostly impacted the tech sector. Nevertheless, Microsoft is also indispensable in the business world. Basically, if you operate a PC, you must be fluent in Microsoft’s core applications or risk falling behind.Another factor that makes MSFT one of the safe stocks to buy centers on its financial resilience. For example, on the balance sheet, Microsoft features a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.61, above nearly 63% of software companies. Also, its Altman Z-Score pings at 9.14, indicating high stability and very low risk of bankruptcy.As well, the enterprise benefits from a solid revenue trek and a net margin of 33%, well above the competition. Finally, covering analysts peg MSFT as a consensus strong buy. On average, their price target comes out to $297.25, implying 2% upside potential.Story continuesProcter &amp; Gamble (PG)Procter &amp; Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&amp;G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods CompanySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comA multinational consumer goods corporation, Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) specializes in a wide range of personal health/consumer health, personal care and hygiene products. Let’s put it another way. No matter what goes on with the economy, people still need to take care of themselves (physically). Therefore, PG ranks among the safe stocks to buy.Yes, Procter &amp; Gamble is a boring company – there’s no question about it. But it’s also this nature that makes it enticing during this hour. For example, the company enjoys solid stability in the balance sheet, marked by an Altman Z-Score of 5.35.Operationally, the company gets the job done with a three-year revenue growth rate of 5.8%. Here, the enterprise beats out 51.12% of its rivals, which is okay. However, its net margin storms out of the gates at 17.79%, beating out almost 92% of sector peers. Lastly, analysts peg PG as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $157.85, implying nearly 4% upside potential.McDonald’s (MCD)Source: ShutterstockA fast-food icon and a symbol of American capitalism, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) really needs no introduction. As a result, you might say that MCD represents an obvious choice for safe stocks to buy. Fundamentally, the company benefits from the trade-down effect. Rather than picking up your morning coffee (and breakfast items) at an expensive café, you can head down to a cheaper McCafe.Financially, McDonald’s delivers the core elements of a leading example of safe stocks to buy. On the balance sheet, the company enjoys an Altman Z-Score of 4.94, sitting in the safe zone of fiscal stability. Operationally, the Golden Arches prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 3.8%, beating out 72.81% of its peers.Perhaps most significantly, McDonald’s is hugely profitable. Its net margin stands at 26.65%, above 96.57% of companies in the restaurants industry. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg MCD as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $296.04, implying nearly 5% upside potential.Ollie’s Bargain Outlet (OLLI)Woman at the supermarket checkout, she is paying using a credit card, shopping and retail conceptSource: ShutterstockA favorite idea among safe stocks to buy, Ollie’s Bargain Outlet (NASDAQ:OLLI) enjoys significant relevance as a discount retailer. However, it’s more than just that. With Ollie’s offering unsold or overstocked items with brand-name labels, the business is simply more attractive to consumers. Indeed, since the start of the year, OLLI gained over 24% of equity value. In the trailing year, it’s up nearly 14%.Financially, Ollie’s continues to entice onlookers. Notably, the company benefits from fiscal stability. Its equity-to-asset ratio is 0.67 times, above 83.17% of its peers. Further, its Altman Z-Score pings at 5.25, reflecting low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate is 10.9%, above 75.44% of the field.As well, its net margin comes out to 5.63%, ranked better than 85% of firms in the defensive retail industry. Looking to the Street, analysts peg OLLI as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target is $62, implying almost 7% upside potential.Intuit (INTU)Stacks of coins hold up wooden blocks that spell out ""TAX."" FairTaxSource: ShutterstockA business software company, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) specializes in financial software. Intuit’s products include the tax preparation application TurboTax, personal finance app Mint, the small business accounting program QuickBooks, the credit monitoring service Credit Karma and email marketing platform Mailchimp. Since the start of the year, INTU gained over 14% of equity value.Yes, it’s down more than 7% in the trailing one-year period. Still, as the nature of work evolves and people consider jumping to the gig economy, the tax implications associated with gig workers (independent contractors) should bolster INTU. For now, it ranks as one of the safe stocks to buy because of high stability in the balance sheet and strong operational metrics.In particular, it’s worth pointing out the three-year revenue growth rate of 20.4% and net margin of 14.22%. Both stats rank above their respective industry median values. To close out, analysts peg INTU as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $478.94, implying over 7% upside potential.Allstate (ALL)Allstate Insurance officeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAs a major player in the insurance business, Allstate (NYSE:ALL) easily ranks among the safe stocks to buy. It’s not that it has sterling financials. Rather, the company benefits from extreme relevance. Under any circumstance, acquiring financial protection represents a common-sense virtue. But in the wildness associated with the post-pandemic ecosystem, financial protection becomes even more pertinent.To be fair, though, investors don’t quite see the connection between the narrative and the price action. Since the Jan. opener, ALL slipped almost 16%. In the trailing year, it fell nearly 19%. Nevertheless, the company could make a comeback following the Covid-19 malaise.Notably, Allstate’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 14.2%, ranked above 79% of its peers. Also, ALL trades at 0.61-times trailing sales. In contrast, the sector median value is 0.93 times.Finally, analysts peg ALL as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $137.17, implying 19% upside potential.Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)Source: ©iStock.com/AndreyPSA multinational food processing and commodities trading company, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) – commonly known as ADM, which is also its ticker symbol – offers an enticing idea for safe stocks to buy. Fundamentally, humans need to eat. Therefore, if we incur a hard economic landing, ADM should be somewhat insulated from the worst of the pain. However, since the start of the year, ADM stock dipped more than 12%.It’s even worse against the trailing year, with ADM shedding more than 17%. Still, the company benefits from strong operational metrics. In particular, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 16.4%, above 80.78% of companies in the consumer packaged goods industry. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period is an impressive 30.8%.Enticingly, the market prices ADM at a forward multiple of 11.67. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 73.45% of the competition. Lastly, analysts peg ADM as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $102.50, implying over 30% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

In a conversation with Yahoo Finance's Brad Smith, Bastian says he's optimistic for the year ahead, after Delta's first quarter earnings came in lower than forecasted. A weak first quarter appears to be the status quo among major airlines; earlier this week American Airlines' (AAL) forecasted their first-quarter EPS would land below market expectations. They're scheduled to report April 20th.With peak travel season approaching, Bastian says Delta isn't seeing ""any signs of a slowdown"" when it comes to air travel, adding that consumers are ""wanting to travel."" TSA passenger volume was up in Q1 2023, above pre-pandemic markers. TD Cowen Senior Research Analyst Helane Becker also downplayed Delta's weak Q1 earnings, reminding that ""the first quarter is the worst of the year."" She expects ""near record revenues"" for the second and third quarter from Delta. Still, whether earnings will be high ""remains to be seen."" Becker predicted rising fuel, labor, and maintenance costs will continue to weigh on airline's bottom line.Key Video Moments:00:00:15 - Bastian: ""Outlook for summer is strong""00:00:58 - No signs of a slowdown in air travel00:02:10 - Delta's positive Q2 forecast pulls stock up in premarket00:02:45 - Going to see a ""multi-year resurgence"" in travel: Bastian00:03:03 - Costs are the issue, not demand00:03:51 - Delta's big push to hire, train pilotsFor more on Delta's Q1 earnings report, check out Brad Smith's full breakdown here.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: We're getting back to that first thing. Delta is out with its first-quarter earnings. The company missed on the top and bottom lines, as it faced uncertainty and volatility over the past few months. I spoke with Delta CEO Ed Bastian about the quarter. He remains optimistic about future travel demand and economic impacts. Take a listen.ED BASTIAN: The outlook for summer is strong, particularly international. Our consumers are prioritizing spend on premium experiences and that's our sweet spot. We deliver some of the best experience in the sky. And consumers are wanting to-- wanting to travel.Story continuesWhen we look at the second quarter coming up, we're going to have a good performance. We expect an operating margin of about 15%. We expect to grow our top line mid-double-digits and generate another net billion of free cash. So I'm encouraged by what I see. And we're not seeing any signs of a slowdown, at least on air travel.Remember, we had our recession. We had the worst recession any industry could ever have over the last few years when our revenues went to basically $0.00. So our product is one that people need to be accessing for many, many reasons. It's something that consumers are prioritizing. And even to the extent that consumers are deciding to reduce their spend, it's not coming out of travel or certainly not coming out of the experience economy.You can go to any restaurant, go to any hotel, get on board any aircraft and you can see that with your own eyes. What I think you're gonna see is that it's gonna be a pretty strong, steady pull in the latter part of the year.BRAD SMITH: And so airlines really kicking off this earnings season. And for any investors wondering why the stock is moving higher in reaction to the miss on the top and bottom line compared to what the consensus estimates were from Wall Street and analysts who cover the stock, it is really about what that forecast looks like for summer travel, some of the trends that are remaining intact.I was running some figures, running some calculations based on TSA Traveler throughput numbers, and found that during the first quarter, the entirety of the first quarter, passenger volumes, they average above prepandemic markers for the first time for the entirety of that quarter. About 2.1 million passengers screened every day during the first three months of the year.And so you kind of factor in that broader trend that Delta is really looking into and what Bastian offered even further during our conversation, saying I think what you're going to see is a multiyear resurgence in travel. It's going to continue. And not seeing anything in the economic outlook that suggests travel is going to be stalled. And really kind of a nod to where consumer spending has been prioritized now among some of those discretionary dollars into services and into that experience economy.JULIE HYMAN: It doesn't seem like demand is the problem. But it does seem like costs could be an issue. And that really was flagged by American Airlines yesterday, right? That was the issue for American and why it's maybe not gonna meet its quarter.It looks like the Delta's costs are going OK. Unit costs are gonna be up 1% to 3% in the second quarter. It's non-fuel cost to fly each seat a mile were up by 4.7%. So, you know, I think there's gonna continue to be some scrutiny there, even as demand does seem to be holding up. What is gonna happen with costs?We're gonna have to continue to watch what happens with pilots and pay. That's gonna be a big issue for the airline. So it's not as though it's smooth sailing, so to speak, right, even if demand is strong.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, and on the pilot front that you were mentioning, he did give a nod to the last couple of years. They've hired between 3,000 and 4,000 pilots. And really the issue there in just getting them onto flight schedules, it just has been training and having enough of the different seats that they can sit pilots into to make sure that they're getting the necessary amount of training prior to being added to routes and flight schedules.And it's important to remember that this is, as well as many of the other airline operators, they're not at prepandemic capacity. Even though you're hearing about them cutting some regional routes here and there, it's really more of the negotiations within certain cities and certain hubs that they can get into and get out of and then kind of trimming where it seems appropriate.But I think in this near-term period of time-- especially as we're thinking about Delta, too, and some of those costs. Sure, on the pilot front, they had to acknowledge that. We spoke about that. But then additionally, how they maintain some of the costs on the oil front, as well-- or at least on the fuel, I should say front, is they have their own refinery operations, too, that help them mitigate some of the exposure that other airlines have, as well.JULIE HYMAN: Right, and they do a lot of hedging, also. All the airlines do, for that matter.]"

Moreover, strengthening AWS offerings, which are constantly driving the company’s cloud customer momentum, remains the key catalyst.Experian’s latest selection of AWS as the preferred cloud provider is a testament to the aforesaid fact and highlights the efficiency and reliability of AWS's innovative cloud products and services.With the aid of AWS’s robust portfolio of cloud technologies and global infrastructure, Experian intends to shift its core business operations, consumer-services products, analytics tools and on-premises servers to AWS in a bid to support its multiyear information technology modernization initiative.Additionally, it intends to build customized programs and offer real-time financial services by expanding the usage of AWS cloud computing services.Amazon.com, Inc.

(LUV) is benefiting from its rising air-travel demand as well as solid liquidity. However, rising fuel prices is a headwind.Factors Favoring LUVContinued recovery in air-travel demand (mainly on the leisure front) bodes well for Southwest Airlines. In the fourth quarter of 2022, air traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles, rose 5.4% year over year to $31.30 billion. Anticipating the trend to continue, Southwest Airlines’ management expects first-quarter 2023 operating revenues to register 21-23% year-over-year growth.Available seat miles (a measure of capacity) are estimated to improve 10% from the year-ago reported figure. Capacity for full-year 2023 is anticipated to increase in the 15-16% range. Southwest Airlines' liquidity position raises optimism in the stock. At the end of the fourth quarter, the carrier’s cash and cash equivalents was $9,492 million, higher than the long-term debt (fewer current maturities) of $8,046 million, implying that the company has enough cash to meet its debt obligations.Key RiskEscalating fuel prices represent a concern. In fourth-quarter 2022, fuel cost per gallon (inclusive of fuel tax: economic) rose 41.3% to $3.18. For first-quarter 2023, economic fuel costs per gallon are expected to be between $3.10 and $3.20.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best 5% Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Analysts. High-dividend stocks can be an attractive option for investors who are seeking regular income from their investments. However, it's important to note that a high dividend yield can sometimes indicate that the stock price has fallen significantly, which may indicate a riskier investment. It's also important to consider the company's financial health and growth potential, as well as the overall market conditions. According to analysts, dividend yields between 3% to 6% are considered healthy.The current high-interest rates environment has turned investors’ attention toward high-dividend stocks because of their ability to generate stable income. Historically, dividend stocks have massively contributed to the market returns overall, especially during periods when interest rates were high. Since 1926, dividend stocks represented nearly one-third of the S&amp;P 500’s total return and accounted for over 50% during decades with elevated interest rates and slowing growth, as reported by iShares. Last year’s returns show the outperformance of dividend stocks over the wider market. The iShares Core High Dividend ETF, which tracks the performance of relatively high-dividend-paying US equities, gained 7.1% in 2022, compared with an 18.1% decline in the S&amp;P 500. Moreover, the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Payers fell by only 7.6% last year, which is less severe than a 21.1% drop in the S&amp;P 500 Non-Dividend Payers.United Overseas Bank published a report in collaboration with JPMorgan Asset Management, stressing the positive performance of high-dividend stocks over the years. The report mentioned that the MSCI World High Index gained 3.7% from July 2007 to August 2022 with a volatility of 13.3%. In comparison, MSCI World returned 2.1% during this period with high volatility of 16%.Story continuesAnalysts are also presenting a positive stance on quality dividend companies during this period of financial uncertainty. Michael Clarfeld, ClearBridge Investments portfolio manager, spoke to CNBC about dividend companies. Here are some comments from the analyst:“High-quality dividend growers are a good place to be. The upfront yield provides strong downside support and the dividend growth provides a meaningful headwind against rising interest rates and preserves purchasing power.”Some of the best dividend stocks with high yields include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) because of their strong dividend policies.

From the resultant list, we selected companies that have raised their dividends for at least 5 years. We then found the average price targets and ratings of these stocks placed by Wall Street analysts and other investment firms and narrowed them down to the stocks with strongest upside potential based on their current share price and their average price targets. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the upside potential as of April 12.11 Best 5% Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Analysts11. Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO)Upside Potential as of April 12: 8.29%Average Price Target Based on Analyst Ratings: $48.8Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) deals in the manufacturing of tobacco, cigarettes, and other related products. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the company posted net revenue of over $6.1 billion, which showed a 2.3% decline from the same period last year. It remained committed to its shareholder obligation, returning $1.7 billion to investors during the quarter, which places it as one of the best dividend stocks on our list.In addition to Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) are other high-dividend stocks favored by investors.Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.94 per share and has a dividend yield of 8.39%, as of April 12. The company maintains a 53-year streak of consistent dividend growth. According to analysts, the stock has an upside potential of 8.29%, as of April 12.At the end of Q4 2022, 45 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO), compared with 47 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a total value of over $1.8 billion.Broyhill Asset Management mentioned Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We rebalanced our tobacco exposure during the year, reducing our investment in Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) as the future of the company’s combustible cigarette business became increasingly questionable given pending US legislation and a lackluster portfolio of reduced risk products. We reinvested the proceeds in Philip Morris so that relative position sizing is more consistent with our increased conviction.”10. Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)Upside Potential as of April 12: 14.3%Average Price Target Based on Analyst Ratings: $112.7Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is an American multinational tobacco company that also specializes in other nicotine-containing products. On March 9, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $1.27 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend. It is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as it holds a 14-year track record of consistent dividend growth. As of April 12, the stock has a dividend yield of 5.14%.In March, JPMorgan upgraded Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) to Overweight and also raised its price target on the stock to $116, presenting a positive outlook on the company's earnings growth.In the fourth quarter of 2022, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) reported revenue of $8.1 billion, which showed a 0.59% growth from the same period last year. At the end of December 2022, the company had over $3.2 billion available in cash and cash equivalents.As per Insider Monkey's Q4 2022 database, 47 hedge funds owned stakes in Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), with a total value of over $6.2 billion. Among these elite funds, GQG Partners was the company's leading stakeholder in Q4.Artisan Partners mentioned Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Our top individual contributors were Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), EOG Resources and Merck. Despite being US-based, tobacco company PM derives all its sales from outside the US. As a result, foreign exchange impacts can be an important driver of near-term returns, and the recent weakening in the US dollar should provide a strong tailwind for earnings due to translation effects. However, our investment case is not tied to currency movements. By virtue of its globally known brands, PM is the best-in-class operator with a well-diversified business, particularly by geography. We believe its next generation heat-not-burn product IQOS should gain share as consumers continue migrating to safer tobacco delivery systems. The company is progressing toward its acquisition of Swedish Match, a Swedish tobacco and nicotine products maker, which was previously held in the portfolio. The deal is a good fit for PM as it reduces PM’s dependence on cigarettes—a category in steady decline—and accelerates the company’s transition to smokeless “reduced-risk” products (RRPs)—a category that has experienced rapid growth over the past five years. PM can also leverage its global scale to generate significant revenue synergies from these complementary product sets, as well as quickly gain access to the US market—the world’s largest market for RRPs and one where regulators have embraced RRPs and other less harmful nicotine products. Looking at PM through our margin-of-safety criteria, the business trades for an undemanding valuation and has extraordinary business economics and a strong credit profile.”9.

Cable and telecommunication companies have been an area that has lagged the broader market as their worlds are increasingly colliding. Companies such as Verizon (NYSE:VZ) has been impacted as wireless operator is spending heavily to attract internet subscribers with fixed wired access and the cable companies are trying to build wireless businesses.”7.

Shares are down about 6% since I first wrote about it. However, we have received $8.93 per share in dividends, which is about 34% of the 2018 share price. So, with dividends included we’ve made 28% cumulatively over 5-years. Still not good, but not an impairment of capital either.Since 2018, EPD’s dividend yield has gone from 6.5% to 8% with the annual per share payout growing from $1.72 to $1.96, +14%. The pace of dividend growth has recently increased from about 2% to 5%+. Additionally, Distributable Cash Flow per share (what could be paid to us if management wanted to) has increased 22%, from $2.73 to $3.33, while leverage has come down a little over ½ a turn. So, the balance sheet and cash flow metrics are in better shape than they were 5-years ago, and they were pretty good 5-years ago.The competitive dominance of the asset base, industry leading low leverage, and a founding family with multiple billions of dollars invested alongside us keep it a core holding in the portfolio. We’ll continue to own this company unless the shares become meaningfully overvalued, and if it gets cheaper, we would be very comfortable owning more.”6. The Williams Companies, Inc.

The company’s current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 10.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In November 2022, PMI acquired Swedish Match – a leader in oral nicotine delivery – creating a global smoke-free champion led by the companies’ IQOS and ZYN brands. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized versions of PMI’s IQOS Platform 1 devices and consumables and Swedish Match’s General snus as Modified Risk Tobacco Products (MRTPs). As of December 31, 2022, PMI's smoke-free products were available for sale in 73 markets, and PMI estimates that approximately 17.8 million adults around the world had already switched to IQOS and stopped smoking. Smoke-free products accounted for approximately 32% of PMI’s total full-year 2022 net revenues. With a strong foundation and significant expertise in life sciences, PMI announced in February 2021 its ambition to expand into wellness and healthcare areas and, through its Vectura Fertin Pharma subsidiary, aims to enhance life through the delivery of seamless health experiences.

136,08ad32b4-5a18-3222-b4c8-c504f1abd1a4,PM,2023-04-14,Philip Morris (PM) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/philip-morris-pm-expected-beat-140002802.html,1681394402,STORY,['PM'],"[The market expects Philip Morris (PM) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 20. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.33 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -14.7%.Revenues are expected to be $8.06 billion, up 4.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.8% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Philip Morris?For Philip Morris, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.76%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Philip Morris will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Philip Morris would post earnings of $1.29 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.39, delivering a surprise of +7.75%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Philip Morris appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:PM) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Philip Morris International What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$9.50bUS$10.8bUS$11.6bUS$12.2bUS$12.7bUS$13.1bUS$13.5bUS$13.9bUS$14.2bUS$14.6bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x5Est @ 4.82%Est @ 4.00%Est @ 3.42%Est @ 3.01%Est @ 2.73%Est @ 2.53%Est @ 2.39% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.5% US$8.8kUS$9.3kUS$9.4kUS$9.2kUS$8.9kUS$8.5kUS$8.2kUS$7.8kUS$7.5kUS$7.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$85bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$15b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.5%– 2.1%) = US$276bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$276b÷ ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$135bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$219b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$98.6, the company appears quite good value at a 30% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Philip Morris International as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.906. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Philip Morris InternationalStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatTotal liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

However, particularly high yielding dividends can also be a sign of financial stress or trouble at a company.Often, companies that are losing money or whose share price is falling rapidly will offer a high dividend to attract and retain shareholders. This can be dangerous for investors, and is referred to as a “dividend value trap.” That’s the first clue that you own one of the dividend stocks to sell.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThere’s no sense investing in a high yielding dividend if the company behind it is in danger of going out of business or its stock is in freefall. As is often the case, if something seems too good to be true, it likely is.Investors need to be careful and perform proper due diligence on a company and stock before buying it. Here are three dividend stocks to sell before they become obsolete.WUWestern Union$11.08XRXXerox Holdings$14.56KHCKraft Heinz$39.08Western Union (WU)Logo/electronic sign for Western Union (WU)Source: 360b / Shutterstock.comWestern Union (NYSE:WU) is a familiar legacy company that has fallen on hard times. This company’s business model has been transformed by technology.Today, people can wire money to each other and businesses with the touch of a button on their smartphone. Of course, the company has been disrupted before.Starting out as a telegraph company in 1851 during the railroad boom, Western Union shifted its business away from communications and to money wire transfers in the 1980s.For a time, Western Union was known as the world’s largest money-transfer business. But that was before wireless internet, smartphones and various banking and payment apps came along.Today, Western Union’s business is struggling. So too is WU stock, which has declined 42% in the past five years. Since the 2008 financial crisis, the share price has declined 60%.Story continuesThe company offers a sky high dividend yield of 8.52% that equates to a quarterly payment of 23 cents a share. But don’t be fooled. Western Union’s best days are behind it.Xerox Holdings (XRX)A photo of the Xerox logo on a storefront.Source: Jonathan Weiss/ShutterStock.comAnother familiar name whose best days were in the 1980s is Xerox Holdings (NASDAQ:XRX), the company whose principal business is office photocopiers.Several technologies and trends have conspired to harm Xerox’s once successful business model. These include cloud computing storage, the proliferation of online document management companies such as DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU), the work from home trend, and environmental concerns about using paper.These problems explain why XRX stock has been in freefall for years. Over the last five years, the stock of Xerox Holdings has fallen nearly 50%. Since going public back in 1983, the company’s share price has declined 20%.It’s a sad situation that has many analysts predicting the eventual demise of Xerox. The company currently pays a generous dividend that yields 6.95% or 25 cents a share per quarter. While that might be tempting, it’s important to remember that this company’s stock has only moved in one direction. Down.Kraft Heinz (KHC)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Kraft Heinz (KHC) website.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comIt’s not often you hear legendary investor Warren Buffett criticize a current holding in his stock portfolio.However, the Oracle of Omaha has expressed buyer’s remorse regarding his $12 billion stake in food giant Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), saying “I was wrong… we overpaid for Kraft.”Other shareholders may have similar regrets. Eight years after Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz Company merged, KHC stock is down 56%. The share price has decreased 35% in the last five years. Even people hoarding groceries during the pandemic didn’t help.The company’s management team has also come under scrutiny, particularly after Kraft Heinz was forced to restate three years of financial results. Buffett and other shareholders might hold onto KHC stock for the 4% dividend yield that is worth 40 cents a share, but make no mistake, Kraft Heinz is a troubled company.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Joel Baglole has been a business journalist for 20 years.

The company's shares saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at TransDigm Group’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for TransDigm Group What Is TransDigm Group Worth?TransDigm Group appears to be expensive according to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that TransDigm Group’s ratio of 47.71x is above its peer average of 24.27x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Since TransDigm Group’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from TransDigm Group?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 92% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for TransDigm Group. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? TDG’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe TDG should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on TDG for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for TDG, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing. Case in point: We've spotted 3 warning signs for TransDigm Group you should be mindful of and 2 of them are a bit unpleasant.If you are no longer interested in TransDigm Group, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

For more real estate companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Real Estate Companies in USA. Two children, a car, and a white picket fence - so goes the American dream. Looking at this, you'll realize that the automotive and real estate industries are at the center of American culture. Most people dream to own their house one day and often end up taking out multi-decade long mortgages to afford their own place of living. Apart from houses, several other buildings and properties make up the real estate sector. These range from public places such as parks, to apartment complexes, office buildings, and giant skyscrapers.Naturally, this also means that the real estate industry is among the most closely watched sectors by both governments and the wealthy. The rich are crazy about real estate since they invest copious amounts of wealth in it. After all, having a villa in Beverly Hills has a much different bling to it than a house in a village. Speaking numbers, a report from McKinsey shows that two thirds of global net worth were invested in real estate as of 2020. Within these two thirds, residential and private real estate accounted for almost half, or 46%, of global net worth, with government and public buildings making up another 23%. Growth rates in net worth with respect to the overall gross domestic product (GDP) show that this plowing of funds into a notoriously unproductive asset has led to significant net worth growth as well. McKinsey's data shows that between 2000 and 2020, net worth compared to GDP was a stunning 104% higher than in the three decades between 1970 and 1999. On the most extreme end, France's richest benefited from the real estate boom, as it grew by an eye popping 371% higher than the GDP! Within the net worth growth between 2000 and 2020, two thirds were due to higher asset prices, with saving and investment both accounting for a rather tame 28%.Story continuesAs this should make it clear, real estate is quite lucrative indeed. But just how lucrative is estimated in a research report from Grand View Research. In this report, the firm estimates that the global real estate industry was worth $3.69 trillion in 2021 and despite this huge size, the segment is expected to post a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.2% between 2022 and 2030 to sit at $5.85 trillion by the end of the forecast period. Within the market, the commercial real estate market was the largest constituent segment as it accounted for 35% of the entire market. Apart from residential, the commercial real estate market is another large component of the industry and it will match the broader sector's growth rate by growing at a 5.1% CAGR during the forecast period. Additionally, Grand View Research also highlights that sales by property type, such as villas and second homes, will outpace the broader market in terms of growth by growing at 6.1%. It adds that the Middle East and Africa will also outpace market growth, but Asia Pacific is the largest segment in terms of geography with more than half the market share.In America, the real estate sector is facing some stress these days, This is due to the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes that aim to make borrowing costs for firms and individuals higher to kill GDP growth and fight inflation. The U.S. real estate sector is worth $20 trillion (this is the total value of the properties and not the revenues) and prices dropped by 15% in March 2023 from their peak values. Rising interest rates are playing a role in this, as commercial real estate purchases are rarely made out of pocket and instead, they rely on bank loans and funding. While a 15% drop in itself sounds high, experts worry that prices could drop as much as 30% in case of an economic downturn or a recession.Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD)'s earnings call for its fourth quarter of 2022 provides valuable insight. During the event, management outlined:With regard to our markets and leasing activity, the bottomline is that conditions remain healthy and there is little we see across our results or proprietary metrics that point to a meaningful slowdown. We see a normalization of demand and when combined with low vacancy, it continues to translate to a meaningful increase in rents. Across our markets, rent growth was nearly 5% during the quarter, driving the full year to 28%. Proposal activity for available space was consistent with our recent history, and given persistent low vacancy, there is simply a very small number of units to even propose deals on. As evidenced, over 99% of our portfolio is either currently leased or in negotiation. Utilization remains high at 86%, near its all time record and deal gestation ticked up over the quarter, indicative of more careful consideration and time being taken in leasing decisions.While we are watching e-commerce carefully, its share of overall retail sales have increased to 22%, which is 600 basis points above its pre-pandemic level. Putting the nuance of mix, timing and other factors aside, as measured by retention, occupancy or rent change, it is clear that customers need to commit to space to market conditions, which offer them very little choice. In terms of supply, the development pipeline across our market stands at 565 million square feet and our expectation for the year is that the pipeline will decline. Deliveries will put modest upward pressure on vacancies from 3.3% today towards 4% later in the year. However, new development starts are slowing in response to the market environment, which will reduce vacancies in late 2023 or 2024.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the biggest real estate companies in America, out of which the top ones are Equinix, Inc.

HCA, Universal Health Services Inc. UHS, Acadia Healthcare Co., Inc. ACHC and Tenet Healthcare Corp. THC.Industry: HospitalLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2076823/4-stocks-in-focus-as-hospital-industry-witnesses-improvementAfter facing multiple issues for several quarters, hospital companies are witnessing improving market conditions thanks to the easing staffing challenges and increasing non-Covid utilization. As serious medical conditions continue to rise, outpatient surgeries and patient days are likely to increase, boosting Zacks Medical-Hospital industry players' revenues. However, growing competition in this market remains a common theme. Technological innovations and adoptions are expected to provide companies with a competitive edge and improve efficiency. Leading industry players like HCA Healthcare Inc., Universal Health Services Inc., Acadia Healthcare Co., Inc. and Tenet Healthcare Corp. should benefit from these developments.About the Industry The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry comprises for-profit hospital companies that provide healthcare through different types of hospitals, such as acute care, rehabilitation and psychiatric. These hospital entities are engaged in internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery, orthopedics and obstetrics, telehealth services, mental health care and diagnostic and emergency services.Revenues of these companies depend on inpatient occupancy levels, medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and provided to patients, and the volume of outpatient procedures. These hospital companies receive payments for patient services from the government under the Medicare program, Medicaid or similar programs, managed care plans (including plans offered through the American Health Benefit Exchanges), private insurers and directly from patients.Story continues4 Key Trends to Watch in the Hospital IndustryRising Patient Volumes: With declining COVID-related utilization of resources, non-COVID admissions are expected to grow. As serious medical conditions are rising, demand for elective procedures is likely to drive patient volumes. Growth in admissions, outpatient surgeries and Medicare reimbursements, and deferred procedures can support hospital companies' revenues. However, inflationary pressures and financial constraints can force patients to delay addressing some non-emergency medical needs. The benefits of the Affordable Care Act and similar safety nets can provide patients with some respite, which can help them navigate tough times.Growing Elderly Population: Steady advancements in science, nutrition and healthcare enable the senior population to witness constant growth. This can result in rising demand for hospital services in the long term. The U.S. Census Bureau's revised report suggests that individuals above 65 years are projected to be one of the fastest-growing segments of the country's population, reflecting a climb from 17% in 2020 to 21% in 2030.By 2034, older adults are expected to outnumber children, a first in the country's history. This demographic change and the rising incidence of diseases will likely be industry drivers. Plus, the increasing number of people signing up for healthcare plans through the Affordable Care Act indicates fewer challenges to visiting hospitals in the future.Technological Advancements: Technological improvements, innovations and wider adoption will continue to support hospital players. This should optimize hospital services, minimize unnecessary expenses and elevate the patient experience. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the adoption of telehealth and telemedicine services, which will likely rise in the future.The companies are leveraging AI and automation along with real-time analytics to provide quality care. AI helps improve clinical workflow management and medical diagnosis that hospitals utilize. The industry players are using the virtual health domain to enhance efficiency by limiting the patients' waiting time and reducing their treatment costs.Rising Expenses: With rising patient volumes, operating costs are bound to go up. Increasing costs of hospital supplies due to inflation will likely reduce margins. Also, growth-project investments will keep expenses elevated, putting pressure on the bottom line. However, improving labor shortages and staffing challenges will provide hospital companies some breathing room. Moreover, renegotiating contracts with suppliers and vendors will provide an impetus.Zacks Industry Rank Depicts Promising ScenarioThe group's  Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Medical sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #103, which places it in the top 41% of nearly 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group's earnings growth potential.Before we present the stocks that you may want to watch, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Medical-Hospital industry has fared better than the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite as well as its broader sector over the past year. During this time period, the stocks in this industry have declined 4.2% compared with the S&amp;P 500's fall of 7.1% and the Zacks Medical sector's decrease of 15.2%.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing hospital stocks, the industry trades at 8.90X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 12.55X and the sector's 8.14X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 9.05X, as low as 5.57X and at a median of 7.80X.4 Stocks Worth Your AttentionWe are presenting four stocks with a Zacks Ranks #3 (Hold) from the Medical-Hospital industry.  You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.HCA Healthcare: The company provides services via surgery centers, free-standing emergency rooms, physician clinics and urgent care centers. Its inorganic growth strategies enable it to persistently expand its network across several markets, increase patient volumes and add more hospitals to its portfolio. Its telemedicine business line is expected to continue benefiting operations. HCA Healthcare also focuses on boosting shareholders' value with dividend hikes and buybacks.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HCA Healthcare's 2023 EPS indicates 1.7% year-over-year growth.

It focuses on behavioral indications like autism, eating disorders, sexual trauma and disorderliness in the military through its patriot support program. This segment holds immense scope for growth in the days ahead, considering the dire need to address behavioral health issues. UHS' plans to add new capacities in hospitals in important markets of Texas and California to address strong acute care demand are expected to be major tailwinds. It has a strong share buyback plan in place to boost shareholder value.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Universal Health's 2023 bottom line indicates 1.7% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for its revenues in 2023 signals a 5.2% increase from a year ago. UHS beat earnings estimates thrice in the past four quarters and missed on one occasion, the average surprise being 0.2%.

It has been emphasizing on buyouts and new additions for robust growth. Acquisitions added facilities, beds and hospitals to Acadia Healthcare's network and contributed to its top line. It is also actively pursuing joint ventures with renowned healthcare systems, which is helping it expand its capabilities through bed additions. The company plans to add roughly 300 beds through facility expansions and open a minimum of six CTCs in 2023. Its moves to streamline its portfolio boost operating efficiency and profitability.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ACHC's 2023 bottom line indicates 9.6% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for its revenues in 2023 signals a 9.6% increase from a year ago. ACHC beat on earnings twice in the last four quarters, met the mark once and missed estimates on another occasion, the average surprise being 2.5%. Shares of ACHC have gained 7.2% in the past month.Tenet Healthcare Corp.: The company, with its subsidiaries, provides healthcare services, primarily through general hospitals and related healthcare units. THC has made several acquisitions, and formed strategic partnerships and alliances to augment the scale of business, operating capacity and geographical presence.

The consensus mark for its revenues in 2023 signals a 3.7% increase from the prior year. Tenet Healthcare beat earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, the average surprise being 65.2%. Shares of the company have risen 18.2% in the past month.Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double"" From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come.

144,a749a3c1-a8a1-3db7-a214-2da8ddb8c37a,PPG,2023-04-14,Earnings Estimates Rising for PPG Industries (PPG): Will It Gain?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-estimates-rising-ppg-industries-162004444.html,1681402804,STORY,['PPG'],"[PPG Industries (PPG) appears an attractive pick given a noticeable improvement in the company's earnings outlook. The stock has been a strong performer lately, and the momentum might continue with analysts still raising their earnings estimates for the company.The rising trend in estimate revisions, which is a result of growing analyst optimism on the earnings prospects of this paint and coatings maker, should get reflected in its stock price. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. Our stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is principally built on this insight.The five-grade Zacks Rank system, which ranges from a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record of outperformance, with Zacks #1 Ranked stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 2008.Consensus earnings estimates for the next quarter and full year have moved considerably higher for PPG Industries, as there has been strong agreement among the covering analysts in raising estimates.The chart below shows the evolution of forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSCurrent-Quarter Estimate RevisionsThe company is expected to earn $1.42 per share for the current quarter, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.65%.Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PPG Industries has increased 7.16% because three estimates have moved higher compared to no negative revisions.Current-Year Estimate RevisionsFor the full year, the company is expected to earn $6.91 per share, representing a year-over-year change of +14.21%.There has been an encouraging trend in estimate revisions for the current year as well. Over the past month, five estimates have moved up for PPG Industries versus no negative revisions. This has pushed the consensus estimate 6.09% higher.Favorable Zacks RankThe promising estimate revisions have helped PPG Industries earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The Zacks Rank is a tried-and-tested rating tool that helps investors effectively harness the power of earnings estimate revisions and make the right investment decision. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesOur research shows that stocks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) significantly outperform the S&amp;P 500.Bottom LinePPG Industries shares have added 10% over the past four weeks, suggesting that investors are betting on its impressive estimate revisions.

145,a281e69e-3f92-358e-970a-fb365f7848e3,PPG,2023-04-14,PPG Industries (PPG) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ppg-industries-ppg-reports-next-140002713.html,1681394402,STORY,['PPG'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when PPG Industries (PPG) reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 20, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis paint and coatings maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.42 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.7%.Revenues are expected to be $4.49 billion, up 4.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 7.16% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PPG Industries?For PPG Industries, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +3.42%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.So, this combination indicates that PPG Industries will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that PPG Industries would post earnings of $1.14 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.22, delivering a surprise of +7.02%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.PPG Industries appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

PPG Industries also reported higher earnings in most of its business portfolio, including Europe, than the previous year.The company reported a higher-than-anticipated demand in PPG Comex and U.S. architectural coatings, which was attributed to a recent customer win that contributed to its quarterly performance.

147,bc17a5aa-4829-3baa-8adc-f9603d485b7b,PPG,2023-04-14,Here's Why PPG Industries (PPG) is a Great Momentum Stock to Buy,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-ppg-industries-ppg-160004920.html,1681315204,STORY,['PPG'],"[Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at PPG Industries (PPG), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. PPG Industries currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for PPG that show why this paint and coatings maker shows promise as a solid momentum pick.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor PPG, shares are up 3.36% over the past week while the Zacks Chemical - Specialty industry is down 1.43% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 7.85% compares favorably with the industry's 1.96% performance as well.While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of PPG Industries have increased 6.65% over the past quarter, and have gained 8.23% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 3.99% and -5.37%, respectively.Investors should also take note of PPG's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, PPG is averaging 1,367,879 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with PPG.Over the past two months, 4 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost PPG's consensus estimate, increasing from $6.49 to $6.84 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that PPG is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep PPG Industries on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.Over the past year, the stock has gained 8.2% against the 4.9% decline of the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Driving PPG?PPG is implementing a cost-cutting and restructuring strategy, as well as optimizing its working capital requirements. The cost savings generated by these restructuring initiatives will act as a tailwind for the company. PPG Industries has undertaken extensive restructuring efforts to reduce its cost structure, primarily focusing on regions and end-use markets with weak business conditions. The company's restructuring savings in 2022 were around $65 million. It anticipates $12 million in incremental restructuring savings in the first quarter of 2023. PPG also reduced its working capital requirements in the fourth quarter by decreasing inventory levels sequentially.PPG Industries is on track to raise selling prices across its business segments to offset the impact of rising raw material costs. The company intends to completely recover the cost inflation experienced since 2021, with continued price hikes beginning in 2023. This is likely to strengthen its margins in 2023.The company is also undertaking measures to grow business inorganically through value-creating acquisitions. Contributions from the acquisitions are expected to get reflected in its performance in 2023. Buyouts, including Tikkurila, Worwag and Cetelon, are likely to contribute to its top line this year.PPG Industries also aims to boost shareholder returns with cash deployment. It has an impressive record of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. In 2022, the company returned around $570 million to shareholders through dividends and about $190 million through share repurchases.The company recently raised its earnings guidance for the first quarter of 2023, factoring in higher volumes and prices. PPG said that it witnessed an increased pace of recovery in its operating margin during the first quarter, owing to higher sales volumes and selling prices. Sales volume surpassed expectations, with major contributions from the company's aerospace and automotive original equipment manufacturer coatings businesses.PPG Industries also reported higher earnings than the previous year in majority of its business portfolio, including Europe. The company reported higher-than-expected demand in PPG Comex and U.S. architectural coatings, which was attributed to a recent customer gain that boosted its quarterly performance. Furthermore, due to fewer distortions caused by the pandemic, sales volumes in China exceeded earlier projections.Story continuesPPG Industries, Inc. Price and ConsensusPPG Industries, Inc.

Linga, a 39-year-old managing director at Goldman, will be swapping a position where his compensation approached $5 million in some recent years for the $183,500-a-year government job.The critical push is aimed at making the US a leader in the production of advanced semiconductors — and takes a direct aim at China’s efforts to assert dominance in the competitive industry. The program is seen by the US government as key to safeguarding US technological and national security.The push has taken heightened importance as tensions mount between China and Taiwan. The prospect of hostilities poses an increasing threat to the island’s flagship semiconductor industry and to many US companies that depend on chips made abroad. The US National Security Council has projected that a Chinese invasion and the loss of Taiwan’s cutting-edge chip industry could leave a big dent in the global economy.The Commerce Department has been building a team led by KKR &amp; Co. veteran Todd Fisher as the chief investment officer of the program. The department has also tapped a pair of former Goldman Sachs partners, Kevin Quinn and Brad Koenig, to serve as liaisons with semiconductor firms that will seek a portion of the funding being offered to build plants in the US. Lynelle McKay, who previously worked at Freescale Semiconductor, is also part of the group.Story continuesA spokesperson for the Commerce Department confirmed Linga’s addition to the team.Linga, who has a master’s degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, joined Goldman Sachs in 2007. He ran the global structured-credit financing group that had a hand in some novel deals that proved lucrative for the bank.Hail MaryHis work included roles on deals such as the “hail Mary” move to help telecommunications firm Sprint Corp. raise billions backed by airwaves. More recently, his group helped devise a way for airlines to lean on their frequent-flier miles to raise more than $25 billion in the months after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. That was a first-of-its-kind use of the loyalty programs to unlock access to funding for airlines.Linga had also been tapped by Goldman’s banking heads to help find ways for Elon Musk to take Tesla Inc. private in 2018, a deal that ultimately never happened. His unique dealmaking style also was cited in a book chronicling the troubles at office-rental firm WeWork Inc.When Linga was pitching a deal to WeWork founder Adam Neumann at his Hamptons home, Neumann said no one can last in an ice bath longer than five minutes. Linga jumped in and quipped he wouldn’t get out until Neumann agreed to partner with Goldman. While he lasted almost 10 minutes in the tub, Goldman didn’t get the deal.Moving into government can force executives to unload their stock holdings to avoid conflicts and help veterans avoid taxes on capital gains under federal deferral rules. For someone like Linga, a switch to government early in his career could help foster connections that have proved fruitful for many others as they’ve returned to lucrative roles in the private sector after a public-service stint.The CHIPS program — put into place by the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors and Science Act of 2022 — allows the Commerce Department to oversee about $50 billion over five years that can be invested in companies to accelerate domestic chip production. It also has provisions to cover direct loans and loan guarantees, with the goal of attracting institutional investors as well to help raise the capital required to achieve the program’s onshoring goals.“This is the first major industrial strategy in probably 70 years,” US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has said. “And if we don’t succeed, it’ll be the last for the next 70 years.”--With assistance from Jenny Leonard.(Updates with background on government positions in 11th paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAmericans Go Deeper Into Debt as They Use Buy Now, Pay Later Apps for GroceriesVolkswagen Left Behind as China Goes All In on EVsPeople Are Using AI for Therapy, Even Though ChatGPT Wasn’t Built for ItA Decade After the Rana Plaza Collapse, Garment Workers Are Still ExploitedRepublicans Fight a Solar Boom That’s Made Texas King of Clean Energy©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

As is customary, the banks will step up first to deliver Q1’s financials and Goldman Sachs (GS) will be amongst the first batch to report.The banking giant will release its statement next Tuesday (April 18) against a backdrop of an industry rocked by multiple collapses, not that Goldman is in danger of joining that club. In fact, with a history spanning over 150 years, Singapore banking giant DBS calls this “oldie but goodie” a “world-class broker with top talent.”“Goldman has consistently occupied the top spots of investment banking league tables and meaningfully expanded the wallet share of its top trading clients, thanks to its excellent culture and ability to attract top talent via a performance-driven compensation system,” DBS analyst Ken Shih went on to explain. “Going forward, the company would trim its principal investment balance sheet while (1) refocusing on its core banking and markets business, (2) growing its asset and wealth management fees, and (3) scaling its young platform solutions business with the aim of achieving profitability.”Leaving aside the short-term outlook, Shih believes that from FY23F forward, the detrimental effects of sluggish market activity and the decline in asset values are anticipated to “bottom out,” supporting a recovery in Goldman’s income from investment banking fees and principal investments. Efficiency should also be improved by management’s strict control over its workforce and non-compensation costs.Historically, Goldman has also been good to its shareholders, returning capital both via dividends and share repurchases. Amongst its global peer group, Shih notes that both the historical and projected ROE (return on equity) are above average and during the last five years, the modified payout ratio has averaged over 41%. “Its healthy capital ratios and plans to trim its principal investment balance sheet leave room for a further uplift in shareholder return,” Shih summed up.Story continuesDown to business, what does it all mean for investors? Shih rates GS shares a Buy while his $420 price target makes room for 12-month growth of 27%. (To watch Shih’s track record, click here)And what about the rest of the Street? Most are on board here, too. The stock claims a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 12 Buys against just 2 Holds. The analysts see shares generating returns of 24% over the one-year timeframe, considering the average target currently stands at $411.54.

Either way, IBM Vice Chair and Former White House chief economic advisor Gary Cohn tells Yahoo Finance he thinks we're ""at the end of the cycle"".His comments come in the aftermath of another 'sticky' inflation readout; despite the headline figure cooling, the core number leaves the Fed's next rate decision in some doubt. U.S. consumer prices rose just slightly in March, marking the slowest pace of increases since May 2021, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.The former number two at Goldman Sachs - a position he held during the height of the financial crisis - isn't breaking from the pack on the central bank's next move however.""I'm more or less in the 25 basis point camp now,"" he says.Cohn made clear he's waiting to see how Jay Powell sizes up the tighter credit landscape in May, and a new set of data at his fingertips. ""With the 5% reading, banks stabilizing, we've seen a lot of movement in deposit funds. We have to...evaluate that,"" he adds.Cohn spoke with Brad Smith and Julie Hyman. Watch the entire interview here.Key Takeaways00:00:18: 25 basis points00:00:38: Banking system00:01:28: End of the cycleVideo TranscriptGARY COHN: I think we're in this-- I don't know if it's a holding pattern or at the end of the cycle pattern. It feels to me like we're at the end of the cycle pattern. The debate is 25 basis points, pause, pause, pivot, or are we getting ready to pause? Is the 25 basis points not going to happen? I think I'm more or less in the 25 basis point camp now because I think with the 5% reading here, banks are somewhat stabilizing. We've seen a lot of movement in deposit flows.And we have to sort of evaluate that because one of the things that the chairman said during the last press conference-- and I think this is very important-- is that lending conditions in the banking community are changing and changing quite rapidly. We've seen a lot of deposits move around the system. We've seen deposits move from small regional banks to larger banks, and then we've seen deposits move out of larger banks into money markets in Treasury funds. So there's less money in the system to be lent out. Once banks have to hold their excess reserves, they can lend the remaining balances. But the remaining balances today at banks are relatively low.So the banks themselves are contracting the economy. The Federal Reserve Board understands that. I think they're trying to understand what the magnitude of that is. I've seen reports where the magnitude is of that is equal to somewhere between 25 and 75 basis points of increased interest rates. So we have to understand where that is. So I think we're sort of at the end of the cycle.And that's why we're in this sort of holding pattern. We're holding to see what the Fed's going to say, what Powell is going to say now that we have this banking-- the sort of banking data behind us, that we've seen reserves come out of the system, that we've seen this flight to money markets. We've seen a flight to treasuries. How do they evaluate the tighter lending conditions? And how does that influence their decisions? That's why I think even when you see a more positive inflationary report today, you didn't really see a large interest rate move. You didn't see the moves that we might expect.]"

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 1.33%. At the same time, the Dow added 1.14%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 2.94%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the world's largest oilfield services company had gained 14.69% over the past month. This has outpaced the Oils-Energy sector's gain of 3.53% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6.11% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Schlumberger as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be April 21, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.61, up 79.41% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $7.53 billion, up 26.37% from the prior-year quarter.SLB's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.02 per share and revenue of $32.74 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +38.53% and +16.54%, respectively.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Schlumberger. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.2% higher. Schlumberger is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Schlumberger has a Forward P/E ratio of 17.2 right now. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 12.5.Story continuesWe can also see that SLB currently has a PEG ratio of 0.45. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Oil and Gas - Field Services industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 0.56 as of yesterday's close.The Oil and Gas - Field Services industry is part of the Oils-Energy sector.

Aptiv PLC (APTV), which belongs to the Zacks Technology Services industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 14.90%.For the most recent quarter, Aptiv PLC was expected to post earnings of $1.19 per share, but it reported $1.27 per share instead, representing a surprise of 6.72%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.04 per share, while it actually produced $1.28 per share, a surprise of 23.08%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Aptiv PLC, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Aptiv PLC currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.39%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on May 4, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Given that the stock prices usually follow long-term business performance, we wonder if the company's mixed financials could have any adverse effect on its current price price movement Specifically, we decided to study Aptiv's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Aptiv How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Aptiv is:6.5% = US$590m ÷ US$9.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.06 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Aptiv's Earnings Growth And 6.5% ROEAt first glance, Aptiv's ROE doesn't look very promising. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 14%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. Given the circumstances, the significant decline in net income by 15% seen by Aptiv over the last five years is not surprising. We believe that there also might be other aspects that are negatively influencing the company's earnings prospects. Such as - low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesThat being said, we compared Aptiv's performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 4.2% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for APTV? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Aptiv Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?While the company did payout a portion of its dividend in the past, it currently doesn't pay a dividend. This implies that potentially all of its profits are being reinvested in the business.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that the performance shown by Aptiv can be open to many interpretations. While the company does have a high rate of profit retention, its low rate of return is probably hampering its earnings growth. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 84% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Northern Trust, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Northern Trust ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Northern Trust?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Northern Trust. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Northern Trust's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Northern Trust is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 11% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.5% and 4.3%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 14 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Northern TrustWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.We can report that insiders do own shares in Northern Trust Corporation. Insiders own US$226m worth of shares (at current prices). we sometimes take an interest in  whether they have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 15% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Northern Trust. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can access this interactive graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow, for free.Ultimately the future is most important.

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. The fund generated a 9.1% return in the first quarter compared to a 7.7% return for the MSCI World Index. The fund returned an average of 7.1% since its inception in October 2006 outperforming a 6.4% annualized gain for MSCI World Index (net). In addition, you can check the top 5 holdings of the fund to know its best picks in 2023.Oakmark Global Select Fund highlighted stocks like American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) in the first quarter 2023 investor letter. Headquartered in New York, New York, American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) is an insurance company. On April 11, 2023, American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) stock closed at $51.20 per share. One-month return of American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) was 6.76%, and its shares lost 18.70% of their value over the last 52 weeks. American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) has a market capitalization of $37.564 billion.Oakmark Global Select Fund made the following comment about American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:""American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG), a U.S.-based multinational finance and insurance corporation, was a top detractor for the period. AIG’s share price declined during the quarter as a result of broader concerns stemming from the banking crisis. We have found that during times of financial stress, AIG tends to trade like a life insurer, even though we attribute only around 20% of its value to Corebridge. We do not agree with the market’s perceived assumption that life insurers’ risk profiles have increased meaningfully and will suffer asset impairments as they did during the global financial crisis. In our view, this panic is quite different from the global financial crisis. Most of today’s problems are the result of an asset and liability mismatch rather than a credit crisis. We believe that AIG’s core general insurance business drives most of the company’s value, and, in our view, underwriting has seen tremendous improvement since CEO Peter Zaffino joined the company. Since 2016, underwriting profits have improved by $7 billion, and $2 billion of that improvement occurred in 2022. The combined ratio in 2022 was in the low 90% range, and Zaffino believes that this can be below 90% in a few years. The company has accomplished this while lowering insurance limits by roughly half, which dramatically narrows the range of underwriting outcomes. In addition, AIG has been going through a major cost savings plan for the last several years in preparation for the separation. Part of this plan is to simplify and collapse the reporting structure for the general insurance operations, and we believe the lower general operating costs will have a positive effect on the combined ratio. Ultimately, we believe the company remains an attractive investment given its discount to our perception of its intrinsic value.""Story continuesAmerican International Group Inc (NYSE: AIG), Sign, American general, building, logoAndrew Scheck / Shutterstock.comAmerican International Group, Inc.

The program combines diagnostic imaging, genetic risk assessment leveraging Myriad’s MyRisk with RiskScore tools.  Along with increased access to affordable genetic testing the latest program will also help to identify and elevate high-risk patient care.The recent move is likely to fortify Myriad Genetics’ Oncology business.More on CollaborationMyriad and SimonMed will start a gradual deployment of the programme to patients at specific SimonMed women's imaging locations early next month. By this year end, the programme is anticipated to be operational in all 86 of SimonMed's women's imaging locations.

In accordance with guidelines, women at increased risk for breast cancer based on genetic testing should start having annual breast MRI screenings between the ages of 25 and 30. They are advised to get annual mammograms after turning 30.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe programme is anticipated to provide personalised insights to help influence clinical decisions for the millions of patients and families served at SimonMed by leveraging a specially constructed Myriad tool created in conjunction with SimonMed.Strategic EffortsThe partnership will combine the benefits of Myriad's hereditary cancer test, risk assessment tools, MyRisk with RiskScore, and SimonMed's extensive experience in the field of medical imaging.This cutting-edge technology platform will offer patients and their healthcare professionals a more specific picture of the cancer risk.

166,d90d76a1-ac7c-3326-acd6-11306134c902,HOLX,2023-04-14,Masimo (MASI) Hits 52-Week High: What's Aiding the Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/masimo-masi-hits-52-week-160504958.html,1681401904,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Shares of Masimo Corporation MASI scaled a new 52-week high of $192.55 on Apr 12, before closing the session marginally lower at $191.16.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has gained 41.7% against a 12.9% decline of the industry and the S&amp;P 500 composite’s fall of 7.5%.In the past five years, the company registered earnings growth of 12.7% compared with the industry’s 4.5% rise. The company’s expected growth rate of 3.5% for 2023 compares with the industry’s growth projection of 9.6%. Masimo’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 9%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMasimo is witnessing an upward trend in its stock price, prompted by its product launches. The optimism led by solid fourth-quarter 2022 performance and positive study outcomes for its products are expected to contribute. However, stiff competition and overdependence on its Signal Extraction Technology (SET) platform persist.Let’s delve deeper.Key Growth DriversProduct Launches: Investors are optimistic about Masimo’s recent series of product launches. Last month, the company unveiled the newest addition to its wearable product line, the Masimo Freedom smartwatch.On its fourth-quarter earnings call in February, Masimo discussed a series of important new product launches planned this year. The first in line will be the medical version of Masimo’s W1 watch, which is currently pending the FDA 510(k) clearance. The next product to be launched will be the STORK baby monitoring system.Positive Study Outcomes: Investors are upbeat about Masimo’s products, which have been the subject of various studies over the past few months. In March, the company announced the findings of a prospective study, where the research was related to the ability of non-invasive, continuous Masimo pleth variability index (PVi) and other dynamic parameters to predict fluid responsiveness in children of one to three years of age who were undergoing major neurosurgery.Story continuesThe same month, Masimo announced positive findings of a prospective study in which researchers assessed the use of non-invasive, continuous Masimo PVi as part of goal-directed fluid therapy to guide intraoperative fluid administration during neurosurgery.Strong Q4 Results: Masimo’s robust fourth-quarter 2022 results buoy investors’ optimism. The company’s robust uptick in the top line and healthcare business was encouraging. The company recorded robust order shipments during the reported quarter, which was promising. The expansion of its installed base was impressive. Masimo has also been benefiting from its acquisition of Sound United, raising our optimism.DownsidesOverdependence on Masimo SET: Masimo currently derives the majority of its revenues from its Masimo SET platform, Masimo rainbow SET platform and related products. Thus, the company’s business depends on the continued success and market acceptance of its proprietary Masimo SET and Masimo rainbow SET technologies, which serve as the basis of its primary product offerings.Stiff Competition: Masimo operates in an intensely competitive medical device industry and is significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. Many of the company’s competitors have substantially greater resources and built relationships with Group Purchasing Organizations and other hospital purchasing groups that may be more effective than Masimo’s.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc. HOLX, Henry Schein, Inc. HSIC and Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX, popularly known as BD.Hologic, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated long-term growth rate of 15.2%.

167,38f35c50-cdcd-37c7-94c5-1bc2875fce09,HOLX,2023-04-14,BD's (BDX) New Launch to Result in Optimal IV Placement,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bds-bdx-launch-result-optimal-155703312.html,1681315023,STORY,['HOLX'],"[Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX, popularly known as BD, recently launched a new, easy-to-use advanced ultrasound device with a specialized probe, BD Prevue II System. The device, which addresses an unmet need in intravenous (IV) access through real-time needle depth markers, has been designed to provide clinicians with optimal IV placement.The latest launch is expected to boost BD’s Medication Delivery Solutions (MDS) business unit of the broader BD Medical segment globally.Significance of the LaunchPer estimates provided by BD, more than 90% of hospitalized patients receive IV therapy via a peripheral IV catheter. However, nearly two-thirds of these patients have vessels that are difficult to visualize and access, often resulting in additional needlesticks, vessel damage and infiltration into the surrounding tissue.The BD Prevue II System features the BD Cue Needle Tracking System, which offers an ultrasound image of the needle trajectory and is compatible with BD Cue Needle Tracking-enabled catheters. Simulated studies have shown that pairing a needle-tracking system with ultrasound guidance may aid in reducing the number of attempts and time to successful vessel access, which may make vascular access procedures safer and easier for clinicians and patients.Per an expert familiar with the placement of IVs, patients living with chronic conditions (like heart failure) may suffer from poor circulation. Large amounts of scar tissue from frequent venous access make their veins more difficult to locate, thus posing a challenge for placing a good, lasting peripheral IV line. However, with the use of ultrasound guidance technology, quick and successful placement of IVs in such patients is possible. This may lead to faster treatment, fewer sticks for the patients and an improved experience.Per management, the availability of the BD Prevue II System is expected to lead to a situation where every needlestick has a pre-defined pathway for successful placement. Management also feels that first-stick success reduces the pain and anxiety often experienced by patients while undergoing multiple IV access attempts and provides clinicians with IV workflow efficiencies.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Allied Market Research, the global IV therapy and vein access market was valued at $22.8 billion in 2020 and is anticipated to reach $37.5 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 5.1%. Factors like the rise in the incidence of chronic diseases, the growing cases of road accidents and the increase in healthcare expenditure and healthcare insurance are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest launch is expected to significantly strengthen BD’s business worldwide.Notable Developments in BD Medical SegmentBD reported its first-quarter fiscal 2023 results in February, where it registered an improvement in the overall base revenues and a year-over-year uptick in bottom-line results. The MDS unit’s performance reflected the continued strong performance in vascular access management outside the United States. The segment’s Medication Management Solutions business unit’s quarterly performance was boosted by the momentum of the company’s Pharmacy Automation solutions, including both Parata and BD Rowa.The Pharmaceutical Systems unit’s performance reflected BD’s strength in pre-fillable solutions for high-growth markets, like biologic drugs and vaccines, supported by the company’s differentiated supply capabilities.Price PerformanceShares of BD have lost 5.7% in the past year compared with the industry’s 4.3% decline and the S&amp;P 500's 8.2% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksCurrently, BD carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

NFLX continues to invest heavily in a variety of original content in the U.S. and globally to help it attract and keep subscribers amid the possibly never-ending streaming wars.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNFLX’s days of huge sales growth are likely over as it reaches a certain level of saturation in many valuable markets, including the U.S. Netflix’s 2022 revenue climbed 6.5% vs. 19% in 2021 and 24% in 2020. The natural slowdown is why Netflix has rolled out an ad-based tier and is experimenting with paid sharing, as well as other offerings such as gaming.Other Fundamentals Netflix posted a strong Q4 FY22 that impressed Wall Street. Zacks estimates call for its revenue to climb 8% in 2023 and 11% in FY24 to reach $38 billion. NFLX’s adjusted earnings are projected to surge 14% and 26%, respectively. NFLX’s FY23 and FY24 earnings outlook has improved compared to where it was prior to its Q4 release, though it has remained rather stagnant recently to land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Story continuesNFLX stock is up roughly 90% off its lows 2022 lows, alongside Meta META and others. The stock has climbed by around 20% in 2023, including some large swings as it reached overbought and then oversold RSI levels. Netflix climbed again on Thursday and it trades above neutral RSI levels (50) at 60. Netflix just bounce back above its 50-day moving average and it already experienced that bullish golden cross earlier this year.Despite the rebound, NFLX trades 50% below its peaks. On the valuation front, Netflix is at a 66% discount to its 10-year median at 27.3X earnings. In fact, Netflix is now trading at levels it was at back in 2010.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom Line  NFLX is no longer forecasting its subscriber growth, which is a big change since it was the figure the stock traded almost exclusively based on. Wall Street wants to see NFLX improve its balance sheet, cash flows, and margins while pursuing fresh growth avenues.Netflix did warn last quarter that it could have a slower Q1 following what it called a significant pull forward in the fourth quarter. Some investors might not want to ‘chase’ Netflix at these levels and wait for a possible drawdown after earnings. Others, with long-term horizons, might want to consider Netflix at these levels. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

177,0e908bd0-03b8-3f41-8a89-f1b9fdb470f8,PSX,2023-04-14,Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why Phillips 66 (PSX) is a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-top-momentum-pick-why-160004121.html,1681401604,STORY,['PSX'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Phillips 66 (PSX), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Phillips 66 currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if PSX is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this oil refiner holds up.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.For PSX, shares are up 1.44% over the past week while the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry is up 0.04% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 13.22% compares favorably with the industry's 7.17% performance as well.Story continuesWhile any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Phillips 66 have risen 3.23%, and are up 27.53% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 3.2% and -5.35%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to PSX's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. PSX is currently averaging 4,042,301 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with PSX.Over the past two months, 6 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost PSX's consensus estimate, increasing from $15.15 to $15.96 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 3 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 2 downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that PSX is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Phillips 66 on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This has outpaced the Oils-Energy sector's gain of 3.28% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6.51% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Phillips 66 as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be May 3, 2023. On that day, Phillips 66 is projected to report earnings of $3.74 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 183.33%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $32.32 billion, down 11.99% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $15.96 per share and revenue of $132.93 billion, which would represent changes of -15.06% and -24.35%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Phillips 66. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 0.77 based on yesterday's closing prices.The Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry is part of the Oils-Energy sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 33, putting it in the top 14% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank includes is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.

Harbour Energy will continue to operate with a 60% interest.The imperative to reduce the consequences of climate change becomes more important with each passing day. Hence, initiatives to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and put it in underground storage have become more popular across Europe over the past few years.The project is designed to transport carbon dioxide through a newly-formed pipeline connecting Immingham to Theddlethorpe, storing it in secure offshore storage sites. Viking CCS has the ability to address one-third of the British government’s target to capture and store 30 million tons per annum of carbon dioxide by the end of the decade.The project could transform the region by unlocking up to £7 billion of investment in the carbon-dioxide value chain within the next decade. A final investment decision for the project is expected in 2024. It could be up and running as early as 2027 and store up to 10 million tons per annum of carbon dioxide by 2030.BP and Harbour Energy share an interest in the Lincolnshire Offshore Gas Gathering System pipeline, which is planned to be modified as part of the project. This provides an option to connect customers to the depleted Viking gas fields.BP’s entry into Viking CCS shows its commitment to supporting Britain achieve its net-zero goals. Viking CCS could help create employment and enable supply chains that support the growth of CCS in the U.K. The project is being developed as the U.K. government seeks to accelerate its push for net-zero emissions.Price PerformanceShares of BP have outperformed the industry in the past six months.

Grainger GWW, Olympic Steel ZEUS, Sprouts Farmers Market SFM, Veritiv VRTV and Phillips 66 PSX.Trust DuPont Analysis: Pick These 5 Stocks for Solid GainsReturn on equity (ROE) is one of the most favored metrics of investors. It is a profitability ratio that measures earnings generated by a company from its equity. Investors can follow the ROE trend in companies and compare this to historical or industry benchmarks to pick a winning stock.However, stepping beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level could lead to even better returns. Here is where the DuPont analysis comes into play. It is an analytical method, which examines three major elements – operating management, management of assets and capital structure – related to the financial condition of a company. Below, we show how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components:ROE = Net Income/EquityNet Income / Equity = (Net Income / Sales) * (Sales / Assets) * (Assets / Equity)ROE = Profit Margin * Asset Turnover Ratio * Equity MultiplierWhy Use DuPont?Although one can't play down the importance of normal ROE calculation, the fact remains that it doesn't always provide a complete picture. The DuPont analysis, on the other hand, allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE. It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover. For example, high-end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods, which rely on higher turnover.In fact, it also sheds light on the company's leverage status, which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains. A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt. Thus, the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load.So, an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio. This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock.Story continuesInvestors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company's financials.However, looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. See our latest analysis for TJX Companies How Fast Is TJX Companies Growing Its Earnings Per Share?Even with very modest growth rates, a company will usually do well if it improves earnings per share (EPS) year after year. So it's easy to see why many investors focus in on EPS growth. TJX Companies' EPS has risen over the last 12 months, growing from US$2.73 to US$3.03. There's little doubt shareholders would be happy with that 11% gain.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. TJX Companies maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 2.9% to US$50b.

You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Are TJX Companies Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of TJX Companies, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$152m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.2% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Story continuesIs TJX Companies Worth Keeping An Eye On?One positive for TJX Companies is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. That combination is very appealing.

184,9ec77b10-bdb4-3506-957f-39c40e8ad4ad,AMGN,2023-04-14,How Horizon Therapeutics sold to Amgen for $27.8 billion without ever licensing a drug of its own,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/horizon-therapeutics-sold-amgen-27-160000608.html,1681401600,STORY,"['HZNP', 'AMGN']","[The new drug looked so promising—except for that one warning sign.More from Fortune:  5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from home Looking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home At the American College of Rheumatology’s annual meeting in 2008, Duke University’s Dr. John Sundy proudly announced that pegloticase, a drug he’d helped develop, was astoundingly effective at treating severe gout, which affects perhaps 50,000 Americans. In about half of those who had taken it, the drug melted away the crystalline uric acid deposits that encrusted their joints to cause years of pain, immobility, or disfigurement.But Sundy also disclosed an unsettling detail: In one clinical trial, patients who got the drug were more likely to develop heart problems than those who didn’t. The day after Sundy’s talk, the stock price of Savient Pharmaceuticals, which developed the drug with Duke scientists, plunged 75%.That danger signal would disappear in later studies, and the FDA approved pegloticase, under the trade name Krystexxa, two years later. But the small biotech company never recovered. In 2013, Savient was sold at auction to Crealta, a private equity venture created for the purpose, for $120 million.Two years later, a young company now called Horizon Therapeutics bought Crealta and its drug portfolio for $510 million.Even at that price, it proved a good deal. Krystexxa brought in $716 million in 2022 and was expected to earn $1 billion annually in coming years.Although Horizon says it now has 20 drugs under development, in its 15 years of existence it has yet to license a product it invented. Yet the company has managed to assemble a war chest of lucrative drugs, in the process writing a playbook for how to build a modern pharmaceutical colossus.As the White House and both parties in Congress grapple with reining in prescription drug prices, Horizon’s approach reveals just how difficult this may be.Story continuesHorizon’s strategy has paid off handsomely. Krystexxa was just one of the many shiny objects that attracted Amgen, a pharmaceutical giant. Amgen announced in December that it intends to buy Horizon for $27.8 billion, in the biggest pharmaceutical industry deal announced in 2022.Horizon’s CEO, Tim Walbert, who will reportedly get around $135 million when the deal closes, has mastered a particular kind of industry expertise: taking drugs invented and tested by other people, wrapping them expertly in hard-nosed marketing and warm-hued patient relations, raising their prices, and enjoying astounding revenues.He’s done this with unusual finesse—courting patients with concierge-like attention and engaging specialist clinicians with lunches, conferences, and research projects, all while touting his own experience as a patient with a rare inflammatory disease. Walbert’s company has been particularly adept at ensuring that insurers, rather than patients, bear the costly burdens of his drugs.A federal prosecutor in 2015 began examining allegations that Horizon’s patient assistance program had worked with specialty pharmacies to evade insurers’ efforts to shun Horizon’s expensive drugs. A separate probe opened in 2019 over alleged kickbacks to pharmacy benefit managers, companies that negotiate to get Horizon’s drugs covered by insurers. Those investigations appear to be no longer active, Horizon spokesperson Catherine Riedel said. The company this year disclosed a third probe, concerning methods the company allegedly used to get prior authorization of its drugs. Justice officials did not respond to requests for comment on the investigations.To help sell its drugs, Horizon blankets specialist physicians with marketing and peer-to-peer appeals. Its payments to physicians for things like consulting, speeches, and meals totaled $8.7 million in 2021, compared with the $10 million it paid them for research, federal records show. By contrast, Seagen, a biotech company of roughly the same size, paid doctors a total of $116 million, with nearly $112 million of that pegged for research. Riedel said Horizon’s marketing and educational approaches were “necessarily unique” because of the challenges of treating rare and neglected diseases.Walbert launched Horizon in 2008 in the Chicago area by combining and refashioning generic drugs into single pills. Duexis, Horizon’s first drug, is a mixture of generic Motrin and Pepcid. Its Vimovo combines generic Aleve and Nexium. In a 2017 article, a ProPublica reporter described being prescribed Vimovo for a shoulder injury. It cost him nothing, but his insurer was billed $3,252 for pills that together cost about $40 for a month’s supply in generic form. Horizon sold more than $57 million worth of Vimovo that year.In 2014 and 2015, respectively, Horizon picked up two relatively new drugs that had no generic versions: the immunosuppressant Actimmune and Ravicti, which treats a rare genetic disorder. Soon Horizon was charging more than $50,000 a month for each, placing Actimmmune fourth and Ravicti second on GoodRx’s 2020 list of the most expensive U.S. drugs.Horizon’s net sales soared from $20 million in 2012 to $981 million in 2016; Walbert’s pay package followed suit, topping an astronomical $93.4 million in 2015 in salary and stock. Stock analysts questioned the long-term soundness of a strategy of simply selling old drugs for mind-boggling prices, but Walbert was using the cash to refashion the company as a rare-diseases franchise.His approach would make Walbert a darling of pharmaceutical investors and his board, which lavished him with over $20 million in compensation each of the past three years. While most biotechs and startups borrow heavily from venture capital to do science and have no idea how to develop and market a drug, Walbert got cash coming in quickly. “He did it backwards,” said Annabel Samimy, an analyst at Stifel Financial Corp. “Horizon built commercial platforms before they got into drug development.”Generating “robust sales of what sounded like not very interesting drugs” allowed Walbert “to start a company on not very much,” said Oppenheimer analyst Leland Gershell. All the while, Horizon funded and cultivated the patient advocacy groups that can help lobby for a drug to be approved by the FDA and placed on insurers’ formularies, the lists of drugs health plans cover for patients.As Walbert and his spokespeople often point out, Walbert and his youngest son suffer from a rare disease, and Walbert also has an autoimmune disease. Walbert won’t name the diseases, but has said he’s taken the anti-inflammatory injectable Humira since 2003—the year he led that drug’s commercial launch as a vice president at Abbott Laboratories. Humira has become the best-selling drug in history, with about $200 billion in all-time global sales.In 2014, Walbert moved Horizon’s headquarters to Ireland, which nearly halved its tax rate. A year later it gained control of Krystexxa, and in 2017 it bought, for $145 million, a failing company that produced Tepezza, a drug for thyroid eye disease, which causes unsightly eye bulging and pain.Tepezza quickly became a blockbuster, with $3.6 billion in total sales in 2021 and 2022. The company conducted additional clinical research on both Tepezza and Krystexxa, but it also spent heavily promoting these and other drugs to specialists who could prescribe them.All the while it steadily raised prices. Savient put Krystexxa on the market in 2011 at $2,300 per injection. Horizon charges roughly 10 times as much. Six months of Tepezza treatment can run more than $400,000.Horizon’s publicity emphasized the company’s sensitivity to patients, and its constant contact with disease advocates.“Our scientists are attuned to the unmet needs of patients, their diagnostic and therapeutic journey,” Bill Rees, Horizon’s vice president for translational sciences, told KHN. “It’s the marrying of the basic clinical science with a focus on the needs of the patient that differentiates us.”To make sure patients keep using its drugs, clinicians say, Horizon staffers negotiate with insurance carriers, and the company offers drug discounts to lower-income patients while swaddling them with attention from its medical staff.“Horizon has a nurse talk to each and every patient before every appointment,” said Dr. Brigid Freyne, who treats around half a dozen patients each year with Krystexxa at her Murrieta, California, rheumatology clinic. “The patients who come in here are highly motivated to get their IV. They get the message that it’s very important and they are fortunate to get the medicine.”None of the manufacturers of her other infusion drugs shower patients with this kind of attention, she said.While at Abbott, Walbert pioneered direct-to-consumer advertising for specialty drugs like Humira, a trend that aggravated insurers, who anticipated, correctly, that they would soon be shelling out billions for expensive drugs.Horizon’s marketing plan for Krystexxa includes direct-to-consumer ads aimed at driving patients to specialists. The drug is designed for recalcitrant gout patients, who often have large lumps on their fingers, feet, and kidneys. Many, though not all, are heavy drinkers of beer or soda sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup, which can increase the buildup of uric acid, the cause of gout, said Dr. Robert McLean of Yale University.While Krystexxa can help patients with advanced gout, the American College of Rheumatology views it as a drug of last resort, with plenty of cheaper, early intervention alternatives available.“I prescribe it maybe once a year,” McLean said. “From a cost-effectiveness standpoint, it warrants questioning.”Horizon recently started a publicity campaign addressed to all gout sufferers, urging them to see a rheumatologist or a nephrologist—the specialists it has targeted with Krystexxa educational materials—before the disease does too much harm.“Horizon would like you to say, ‘Everyone with serious gout should be started on Krystexxa,’” said Dr. James O’Dell, a rheumatologist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. The Horizon pitchmen he deals with are “nice guys, but we don’t believe that’s the best way.”The company defends its marketing practices. “We learn what matters most to patient communities and act. This approach has been validated by independent third-party research,” said Riedel.The Federal Trade Commission said in January it was seeking more information on the Amgen-Horizon merger. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), citing high prices for Horizon and Amgen drugs, urged the agency to nix the deal.KFF Health News, formerly known as Kaiser Health News (KHN), is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF—the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Michael Milken, chairman of the Milken Institute and a financier, says the momentum needs to continue.""We have come so far, so fast. But we have a tendency to gear up and gear down,"" he told Yahoo Finance in an interview Tuesday.Milken pointed to the burst of investment in health companies amid the pandemic in 2021 — more than $34 billion globally — which quickly fizzled out the following year.""Today we have large, what were biotech companies, Amgen (AMGN), Genentech — part of Roche (RHHBY). But as you know...November '21 was kind of the high for bioscience companies,"" he said.The industry also saw a slew of IPOs of earlier stage companies.""It was maybe too early for many of them, and then a year later we saw the prices crashing for many of these small companies. So today, we have a situation somewhat similar to where we were a little more than 20 years ago. Many of these companies have liquidity, but they sell at a discount to the cash,"" Milken said.Milken said continued investment in the life sciences is critical and now is an optimal time to focus on curing some of the most common and widespread diseases — which will in turn, bolster the overall economy.""Many people in the world of finance do not realize that the driver in the last 200 years of economic expansion has been ... public health and medical research,"" he said.""Maybe the greatest achievement of humankind has been increasing median life expectancy from 31 years to 70 some odd years, and with this, has driven the world's economy,"" Milken added.It's the focus of his latest book, ""Faster Cures: Accelerating the Future of Health."" In it, Milken recaps his personal experiences with the medical world, including family members lost to cancer.

But she noted that 90% of the new generating capacity that came online globally last year is from renewable sources.“So this is happening. The tectonic plates are shifting, and it has to happen more quickly,” she said, pointing to U.S. efforts to curb emissions in transportation and power generation and other steps toward “decarbonization” of many industries.Still, the approval of major fossil fuel projects such as the Willow project on Alaska’s petroleum-rich North Slope has drawn criticism that it runs counter to President Joe Biden’s pledges to cut carbon emissions and move to clean energy. There are also objections to the project's environmental impact.Environmentalists say Japan's strategy of relying on fossil fuels such as coal, even with technologies like carbon capture that prevent emissions from escaping into the atmosphere, and failure to more fully embrace renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power, fails to set a persuasive example for other major polluters such as China and India.Story continuesGranholm said that moves toward embracing renewable, clean energy sources, including hydrogen, nonetheless “give hope to others to be able to do it as the technology lowers the cost.""The Suiso Frontier, the ship Granholm toured Friday as it was docked in the port of Otaru, is the world's only liquefied hydrogen marine carrier. Built by Japanese ship maker Kawasaki Heavy Industries, it carries hydrogen cooled to minus 253 degrees Celsius (minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit) in a liquid form that occupies one eight hundredth of the volume it would occupy as a gas.The 8,000-ton ship was built to carry hydrogen produced at a coal gasification facility in Australia to Japan for power generation and to fuel vehicles, among other uses.The Biden administration is turning to hydrogen as an energy source for vehicles, manufacturing and generating electricity. It’s offering $8 billion to entice the nation’s industries, engineers and planners to figure out how to produce and deliver clean hydrogen.“We’re interested in taking this to the next level in making sure that it can be derived from clean sources,” Granholm said while standing on the bridge of the vessel, whose home port is Kobe.American companies made final pitches earlier this month in bidding for a new program that will create regional networks, or “hubs,” of hydrogen producers, consumers and infrastructure. The aim is to accelerate the availability and use of the colorless, odorless gas that already powers some vehicles and trains.The Department of Energy is required to fund at least four hydrogen hubs by 2026. The hubs are to demonstrate various ways of producing hydrogen, including fossil fuels, nuclear power and renewable energy sources.The challenge is to ensure such projects are commercially feasible, that there is adequate demand from industries for the hydrogen.The Department of Energy has estimated that at least $85 billion is needed to establish a U.S. hydrogen industry.Despite ambitions to turn the country into a “hydrogen society,” Japan’s own hydrogen industry is in its infancy, with the government still drawing up the legislation needed to support creation of infrastructure and supply chains for commercial use of hydrogen and ammonia.Part of that plan involves providing an estimated 7 trillion yen ($53 billion) in subsidies to help bridge the difference in prices between energy produced from hydrogen and conventional sources such as natural gas.Since hydrogen is difficult to transport it is sometimes stored as liquid ammonia, which is one part nitrogen to three parts hydrogen. Ammonia allows the hydrogen to be stored and shipped more easily and compactly.Supporters of hydrogen and ammonia say they offer a way for countries in Southeast Asia, whose combined emissions are the world’s fourth largest, to meet rising demand for power while cutting carbon emissions.Another is nuclear power.Granholm praised Japan's decision to restart many of the nuclear power plants it idled for safety concerns after a massive earthquake and catastrophic tsunami in March 2011 triggered meltdowns at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant on the northeastern coast of its main island.It's a choice that many in the energy-scarce nation view as inevitable, even as the plants near the end of their expected lifetimes.Major Japanese industries such as steelmakers, manufacturers and electrical utilities are heavily invested in fossil fuel-based technologies and have huge sway over the government and politicians, Kumiko Hirata, founder and international director of Climate Integrate (Japan), said in an online briefing.Japan's “green transformation” strategy, which includes commercializing the use of hydrogen and ammonia, mainly caters to big business interests, she said.“They always argue that using existing technology is the most economically feasible approach for decarbonization and because of that, climate policy development in Japan has been so slow,” she said. “And Japan became the laggard among the G-7.”]"

But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. For example, the General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) share price is up 71% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 45% (not including dividends).So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for General Dynamics There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.General Dynamics was able to grow its EPS at 0.8% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. In comparison, the 20% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. This indicates that the market is feeling more optimistic on the stock, after the last few years of progress. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into General Dynamics' key metrics by checking this interactive graph of General Dynamics's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, General Dynamics' TSR for the last 3 years was 85%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that General Dynamics shares lost 3.8% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 8.8%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 3%, each year, over five years. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand General Dynamics better, we need to consider many other factors.

199,e286abfd-c9cd-3d3a-aec5-9de35f9ea911,NEE,2023-04-14,PNM Resources (PNM) & AVANGRID Agree to Extend Merger Date,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pnm-resources-pnm-avangrid-agree-162404565.html,1681403044,STORY,"['PNM', 'AGR', 'NEE']","[PNM Resources PNM and AVANGRID, Inc. AGR provide their consent in further pushing the closure date by three -months to July 20, from Apr 20. The merger is likely to create a very strong clean-energy company but the ongoing delay can lower the desired returns for the companies.Announced in October 2020, this merger was expected to get completed in fourth-quarter 2021, post the approval of the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (NMPRC). However, following rejection by NMPRC, the companies filed an appeal to the New Mexico Supreme Court against it.In March 2023, PNM Resources, Avangrid, and NMPRC filed a combined request before the New Mexico Supreme Court to reject the companies' appeal of the December 2021 NMPRC refusal and return the case back to NMPRC.Merger CommitmentBoth PNM and AGR are devoted toward the merger, which will benefit New Mexico consumers and communities in excess of $300 million and provide rate relief to Texas customers of more than $16 million.The companies can speed up the development of clean energy in Texas and New Mexico and put more emphasis on customer’s reliability and resiliency. Through this merger, companies will support the areas' ongoing vibrancy and prosperity while also advancing their economic growth.Motive Behind the MovePNM Resources’ long-standing expertise in fulfilling environmental regulations and its focus on developing cost-effective generation units provide reliable and affordable power to customers. The acquisition will aid AVANGRID’s expansion of renewables business in the Southwest. Also, the scope and diversity of the combined business will augment its ability to invest in energy efficiency and new technologies.The combined entity will have an improved credit profile, greater financial flexibility and lower cost of capital. The deal will create a leading U.S. regulated utility and renewable energy platform, which seems lucrative to both companies.Renewable EnergyPer U.S. Energy Information Administration report, decline in coal usage for electricity generation is offset by an increase in renewable sources of energy, which is expected to rise from 22% in 2022 to 26% in 2024.The passage of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will support and accelerate the utilities’ transition toward clean-energy sources. IRA has removed the uncertainties relating to federal incentives provided for renewable sources usage. The Act entails an opportunity for a wide range of low-cost clean energy solutions in a predictable way for a long time and will create earnings visibility.PNM Resources and AVANGRID are both committed in lowering emission and add more renewable sources in generation portfolio. Along with PNM and AGR, some other electric power industry companies like Dominion Energy, Inc. D and NextEra Energy, Inc. NEE are adopting measures to meet clean-energy targets.Dominion Energy aims to attain net-zero carbon and methane emissions from its electric generation and natural gas infrastructure by 2050, from 2005 levels. The company aims to cut emissions by 70-80% by 2035 from the level of 2005. Nearly 87% of its investments will be dedicated in zero-carbon generation and energy storage.D’s long-term (three- to-five year) earnings growth rate is pegged at 14.9%. It had delivered average earnings surprise of 1.21% in the last four quarters.NextEra Energy is aiming to reduce total carbon emissions by 67% within 2025 from 2005 base. It continues to work on its strategy of making a long-term investment in clean-energy assets. The company expects to be able to add 33-42 gigawatts of new renewables in the 2023-2026 period to the generation portfolio via clean-energy investments.NEE’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 9.04%.

200,bd54db0a-c652-3c02-86c8-08c88ab569dc,NEE,2023-04-14,4 Stocks to Watch in the Path to Decarbonize the Future,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-watch-path-decarbonize-133701991.html,1681393021,STORY,"['BEP', 'VWDRY', 'NEE', 'CWEN-A']","[Amid heightening climate concerns, the world is on a decarbonization mission. This has resulted in a significant shift toward renewable energy sources, which are becoming increasingly crucial in battling carbon emissions. Renewable energy offers a more sustainable alternative to traditional fossil fuels.The world is already seeing a significant increase in the use of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, hydro, and biomass. As society continues to change and adapt, alternative energy use will be more common, with many energy companies already shifting their focus to renewable energy in place of oil, coal and natural gas.This increasing adoption of renewable energy sources makes investing in renewable energy a promising option. Investors can consider adding stocks like Clearway Energy CWEN, NextEra Energy NEE, Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. BEP and Vestas Wind Systems VWDRY.Rosy Prospects of the Renewable Energy MarketFactors like supportive government policies to encourage more renewable investments, plummeting cost of generating renewable electricity as well as rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EV) across the board are driving the renewable energy market. Renewable energy sources are not only cleaner than traditional fossil fuels but are also becoming more affordable and accessible.Governments are also actively focused on speeding up global decarbonization by passing aggressive climate legislation to increase investment in the clean energy sector. For instance, to fight the ongoing climate crisis and strengthen the U.S. energy infrastructure, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) entailed an investment of $369 billion over the next 10 years. The Climate Bill, part of IRA, is estimated to reduce the country’s carbon emissions by roughly 40% by 2030.Clearly, the power sector is undergoing decarbonization, as a result of the significant expansion in wind and solar energy.  Per the latest report by clean energy think tank Ember, wind and solar hit a record 12% of global electricity last year. Per the report, the world's electricity emissions intensity reached its lowest level ever in 2022.Story continuesThe International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that by 2025, renewable energy will account for around 35% of the world’s electricity generation, rising from the current levels of around 29%. Per Allied Market Research, the global renewable energy market was valued at $881.7 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach $1,977.6 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 8.4% from 2021 to 2030.Power a Safer Future by Investing in RenewablesInvesting in renewable energy is not just beneficial for the environment but can also be profitable. Renewable energy companies are typically involved in the production, distribution, and storage of energy from renewable sources. As the companies are often involved in multiple areas of the energy sector, it leads to portfolio diversification. Additionally, renewable energy firms are often subject to government incentives and subsidies, which can provide a stable and predictable source of revenues. Finally, the growth potential of renewable energy companies is massive as demand for renewable energy is only set to blossom, going forward. Thus, given the massive government investments and bright outlook for the alternative energy market, investing in renewable energy can fetch investors handsome rewards.4 Top Renewable Energy Stocks for a Sustainable TomorrowClearway along with its subsidiaries owns and operates a diverse portfolio of contracted renewable and conventional generation, along with thermal infrastructure assets in the United States. Furthermore, Clearway’s asset portfolio includes more than 9,000 megawatts (MW) of wind, solar, thermal, and natural-gas-fired power generation facilities as well as distract energy systems.In January 2023, Clearway Energy’s 36 MW solar farm in Waiawa with 144 MWh of battery storage started commercial operations. The site will generate enough clean electricity to power more than 7,600 homes each year. This should boost further CWEN’s position in the renewable energy market.The consistent performance of the company supports its shareholder-friendly moves. Clearway has been paying out dividends consistently since 2015. The utility has been increasing dividends every year since the inception of the payment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Clearway’s 2023 sales and earnings implies year-over-year growth of 15% and 149%, respectively.

Encouragingly, the company boasts a solid balance sheet and targets to deliver around 10% annual dividend growth through at least 2024.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NextEra’s 2023 and 2024 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 8% and 8.2%, respectively.

201,ecc96563-f550-3a6e-bff1-c697caf23d07,NEE,2023-04-14,U.S. Economy Suffering From Dichotomy: 5 Safe Stocks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-economy-suffering-dichotomy-5-130301817.html,1681390981,STORY,"['COTY', 'NEE', 'NJR']","[U.S. stock markets have witnessed rangebound trading in the past two weeks. Investors seem confused about the movements of the market. The primary reason is that the U.S. economy is currently facing a dichotomy. At present, the positive factors and the negative factors carry equal weight. This makes market participants decision tough.Positive Influences on MarketThe consumer price index (CPI) rose 5% year over year in March, versus the consensus estimate of 5.1%. Excluding volatile food and energy items, core CPI rose 5.6% year over year, a considerable decline from 9.1% in June 2022. However, in absolute term inflation remains well above the Fed’s 2% target.The resilient labor market has shown cracks. Nonfarm payrolls in March came in at 236,000 compared with 326,000 in February. Although the unemployment rate edged down to 3.5% in March from 3.6% in February, that was due to an increased labor force participation rate, marking the highest level from the pre-pandemic era.The hourly wage rate increased 4.2% year over year in March, reflecting its lowest monthly gain since June 2021. Moreover, job openings in February fell 632,000 month-over-month to 9.93 million. The metric fell below 10 million for the first time in nearly two years.Consumer spending especially retail sales has declined considerably. The manufacturing PMIs have been decreasing for a long period. The housing market has dwindled. All these factors indicate that the economy is cooling per the Fed’s expectations.Consequently, market participants are expecting the central bank to hike the benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points in the May FOMC meeting and thereafter keep the rate static till the end of 2023. The current Fed fund rate is 4.75 to 5%. Notably, after the March FOMC, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell also indicated that the terminal rate would be around 5.125% for this rate hike cycle.Fed and Banking Crisis Weigh on Wall StreetOn Apr 12, the Fed released the minutes of its March FOMC meeting. The minutes clearly showed that members are concerned that the banking sector crisis in early March is likely to push the economy into recession later this year. The central bank has projected that the United States may take two years to return to normalcy even if the recession is a mild one.Story continuesOn Mar 10, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) announced that regulators closed Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and took control of its deposits. This was the biggest bank failure in the United States since the collapse of Washington Mutual in 2008 and the second-biggest bank failure in the nation’s history.The 40-year-old highly respected regional bank, which lends primarily to technology and biotechnology startups, was the first major victim of the aggressive interest rate hike policies adopted by the Fed to combat record-high inflation.Market participants are highly concerned that the collapse of SVB will significantly dent the confidence of U.S. small and mid-sized banks. The SVB takes centerstage, providing seed capital, which is extremely important for early-stage startups. Following the collapse of SVB, venture capitalists and private equities will be under pressure to raise more capital.The Fed’s March FOMC minutes clearly indicated that much hyped soft landing of the U.S. economy is currently a remote possibility. More visibility regarding a near-term recession will be available following first-quarter 2023 earnings results along with management guidance and business outlook.Stock Selection ProcessAt this stage, it will be prudent to invest in defensive stocks like consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare with strong momentum.

Ahead of Q1 earnings release before the market's open this Friday (April 14th), estimates have largely been unchanged. A lot will be riding on management's characterization of business conditions following the Silicon Valley episode.Higher rates and a steady loan demand are expected to have aided net interest income (NII) growth in the Q1 report. Yet, the volatile nature of the capital markets business and higher mortgage rates are likely to have made fee income growth challenging. We expect non-interest income (managed) to be relatively stable this year.However, steadily rising costs is a major woe, and we expect the same to rise 5.8% in 2023.

A lot will be riding on management's characterization of business conditions following the Silicon Valley episode.Higher rates and a steady loan demand are expected to have aided net interest income (NII) growth in the Q1 report. Yet, the volatile nature of the capital markets business and higher mortgage rates are likely to have made fee income growth challenging.

205,9b24d943-b31d-35f9-bda5-c4440a7086ac,NEE,2023-04-14,Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About NextEra (NEE): Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-bulls-look-optimistic-133001242.html,1681306201,STORY,['NEE'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about NextEra Energy (NEE).NextEra currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.58, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 12 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.58 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 12 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 66.7% and 8.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for NEEBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for NEECheck price target &amp; stock forecast for NextEra here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying NextEra, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is NEE a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for NextEra, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.2% over the past month to $3.12.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for NextEra. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for NextEra may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in NextEra Energy (NEE) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to NEE for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?NextEra Energy's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at NextEra Energy's main business drivers.Juno Beach, FL-based NextEra Energy Inc. (previously known as FPL Group Inc.) is a public utility holding company engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution, and sale of electric energy. The company has both regulated and non-regulated energy-related products and services, with operations in 27 states in the U.S. and four provinces in Canada. NextEra Energy was founded in 1925. The company serves nearly 10 million people through approximately 5 million customer accounts.NextEra Energy's primary subsidiaries are Florida Power &amp; Light Company (FPL), Gulf Power Company and NextEra Energy Resources LLC (NEER). NextEra Energy Capital Holdings, Inc. (NEECH) is a wholly owned subsidiary of NextEra, which owns and provides funds for NEER and other operating subsidiaries apart from FPL and its subsidiaries. In 2014, NextEra Energy formed NextEra Energy Partners, LP  to own, manage and acquire contracted clean energy projects.NextEra Energy produces a large volume of electricity from wind and solar energy. The company, through its subsidiaries, is advocating higher usage of clean fuel sources to generate electricity and aiming to reduce total carbon emissions by 67% within 2025 from 2005 base.FPL and NEER contributed $17,282 million and $3,720 million to its top line in 2022, respectively. Corporate and Other negatively impacted the top line by $46 million in 2022.On Jan 1, 2021, Gulf Power merged into FPL. Gulf Power will continue as a separate operating division during 2021, serving the existing customers under separate retail rates.NEER is the competitive energy business of NextEra and plans to add 32,700-41,800 megawatts (MW) of clean power generation assets across the United States over the 2023-2026 time frame. Amid the challenges posed by the outbreak of COVID-19, the company ensured that its major capital projects continued to proceed without any hindrances.Story continuesBottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in NextEra Energy ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in April 2013 would be worth $3,924.85, or a 292.48% gain, as of April 12, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.The S&amp;P 500 rose 157.88% and the price of gold increased 23.32% over the same time frame in comparison.Analysts are forecasting more upside for NEE too.NextEra Energy continues to expand its operations through the efficient execution of organic projects and strategic acquisitions. The company currently has many renewable projects in its backlog and their completion will ensure reduced emissions. The merger of Gulf Power and FPL strengthens NextEra’s position in Florida. FPL’s customer base is expanding as Florida’s economy improves and continues to boost demand for its services. NextEra has ample liquidity to meet its near-term debt obligations and efficient debt management acting as tailwinds. Its shares have outperformed the industry in the past three months. However, the nature of its business is subject to complex federal, state and other regulations. Risk in operating nuclear units, unfavorable weather conditions and an increase in supply costs adversely impact earnings.The stock has jumped 5.08% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 2 higher, for fiscal 2023; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The upside stemmed from strong earnings surprise history. Its earnings have surpassed the Zacks consensus estimates in the trailing 15 quarters. The company has been gaining strength from its land acquisition strategy and focus on higher operating leverage.For the first quarter of 2023, TPH expects to deliver 750-850 homes at an average sales price (ASP) of $720,000-$730,000. Homebuilding gross margin is likely to be in the range of 23-24% and SG&amp;A expense, as a percentage of home sales revenue, is anticipated to be within 14-14.5%.

Also, it reported Homebuilding gross margin of 26.8% and SG&amp;A expenses of 11.1%.Although the prevailing industry headwinds and slowness in the market will be reflected in the next few quarters of 2023, the company aims to achieve 10-20% cost reductions by the end of 2023.

In January, net new home orders were 421 with an absorption rate of 3.1 per community. February also experienced similar growth.Significant Operating Leverage: The company is focused on achieving operating leverage by controlling overhead costs in order to drive the bottom line as well as cash flow.

Going forward, the company is optimistic about creating more unified methods that lead to operational and cost efficiencies for the company over time.Solid Land-Acquisition Strategy: Tri Pointe Homes is consistently focused on land acquisition and development activities, which are critical for community count as well as top-line growth. Also, the company made further efforts to acquire land in a more capital-efficient manner. Currently, the company controls or owns nearly 33,794 lots of land. Tri Pointe Homes is also partnering with different intermediaries to accelerate the purchase and development of land investments in a much more risk-averse way.Story continuesKey PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Construction sector are:Installed Building Products, Inc.

This led to the diversification of its geographies, end markets and products. The company maintains a robust pipeline of acquisition candidates that considers the geographic expansion in the core residential insulation end market and acquisition opportunities that continue end-market and end-product diversification strategies.During 2022, IBP completed eight acquisitions, representing approximately $109 million in annual revenues, surpassing the company’s target of $100 million in acquired revenues. For 2023, IBP’s acquisition pipeline remains robust, and as a result, it expects to acquire at least $100 million of revenues again in 2023.Higher Return on Equity (ROE): Installed Building Products’ trailing 12-month ROE is indicative of its growth potential. ROE for the trailing 12 months is 58.7%, much higher than the industry’s 8.6%, reflecting the company’s efficient usage of shareholders’ funds.Solid Performance: The company has been capitalizing on the strong end-market demand and the continued success of local branches, which prudently align selling prices with the value IBP offers its customers. Although interest rates continue to increase from historically low levels, the company remains optimistic, given the strong demand for installation services.The company’s net revenues grew 35.6% year over year to a record $2.7 million in 2022. The price mix improved 23% year over year in 2022. Consistent with the inflationary trends in the construction industry and the increasing demand for services, the company’s pricing strategies and relatively stable product mix contributed to the largest annual increase in price mix it has achieved since becoming a public company.On a same-branch basis, net revenues improved 24.6% from 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $439.3 million, reflecting an increase of 53.9% from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 16.5%, increasing from 14.5% in the prior year.

MLM sees substantial opportunities in 2023 across federally funded infrastructure projects, industrial manufacturing, energy and power. It expects to deliver another year of profitable growth, strong cash flow and attractive returns for shareholders.In the near term, the company expects affordability-driven headwinds in the single-family residential end market. This will be offset by a significant acceleration in public infrastructure investment and continued strength in large-scale energy, domestic manufacturing and multi-family residential projects.Higher Earnings Expectation: Despite the high inflationary pressures and flat aggregates shipments assumption for 2023, the company expects to continue to deliver accelerated margin expansion during the year. The margin expansion is due to the carryover effects of 2022 commercial actions and broad acceptance of Jan 1, 2023 price increases.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings of $14.84 per share calls for 23% year-over-year growth.Long-Term Plan: Martin Marietta has been gaining strength from long-term strategic plans — markedly SOAR (Strategic Operating Analysis and Review) 2025 initiatives. It is to be noted that 2022 marked the 11th year of consecutive growth in consolidated products and services revenues, adjusted gross profit and adjusted EBITDA.Martin Marietta has been focusing on SOAR plans that include portfolio optimization, assessing business combinations and arrangements with other companies engaged in similar businesses, increasing footprint in core businesses, investing in internal expansion projects in high-growth markets and pursuing new opportunities associated with the existing markets served.Story continuesHeadwindsInflationary Pressures: The company uses large amounts of electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources, subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation, which could affect operating results and erode profits.Gross margin across the business (barring Cement) contracted 180 basis points (bps) in 2022. In particular, the 2022 aggregates product gross margin decreased 160 bps to 28% due to higher diesel, repairs, internal freight and depreciation costs.The Building Materials business gross margin (down 140 bps) was negatively impacted by inflationary pressure throughout the year. Magnesia Specialties’ gross margin was down 570 bps due to low demand from domestic steel industry customers for dolomitic lime products and higher energy and contract services costs.3 Better-Ranked Construction Stocks Hogging the LimelightSome better-ranked stocks which warrant a look in the Construction sector include:Installed Building Products, Inc. IBP — holding a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) — is a leading installer of insulation and complementary building products.

Its revenues and earnings in the to-be-reported quarter are expected to have witnessed increases on a year-over-year basis.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were aided by a rise in net interest revenues. However, asset balances witnessed a decline and higher expenses hurt results to some extent.BNY Mellon has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three and met in one of the trailing four quarters, with a surprise of 4.8%, on average.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.09, which has been unchanged over the past seven days. The consensus estimate indicates a rise of 26.7% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for first-quarter earnings is 91 cents.The consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $4.35 billion, implying a 10.7% rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for the same is $4.16 billion.Key Factors &amp; Estimates for Q1Fee Revenues: Supported by overall asset inflows in the first quarter, BNY Mellon is expected to have recorded an improvement in the total assets under management (AUM) balance. Thus, the related fee is likely to have increased.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total investment services fee (comprising more than 50% of the company’s total revenues) is pegged at $2.12 billion, which indicates a rise of 6.4% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for the same is $2.05 billion, indicating a year-over-year rise of 3%.The consensus mark for financing-related fees is pegged at $42.48 million, which suggests a 5.6% year-over-year decline. Our estimate for financing-related fees is $42 million, indicating a decline of 6.8%.The consensus estimate for distribution and servicing fees is pegged at $33.97 million, indicating 13.2% growth from the previous-year quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for the same is $34.2 million, suggesting year-over-year growth of 14.2%.The consensus estimate for foreign exchange revenues is pegged at $199 million, suggesting a decline of 3.9% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate is $204.2 million, indicating a 1.4% decline. The consensus mark for investment and other income of $8.42 million suggests a year-over-year decline of 88%.Thus, the consensus estimate for total fees and other revenues is pegged at $3.24 billion, suggesting a marginal rise from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for the same is $3.07 billion, indicating a year-over-year decline of 4.8%.Net Interest Revenues (NIR): While loan growth has been strong in the to-be-reported quarter, the overall lending scenario wasn’t very impressive. Following the bank runs in the first week of March, overall loan demand is likely to have decelerated as recessionary fears gained ground.Nevertheless, continuing with its hawkish monetary policy stance, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by another 50 basis points in the quarter. The policy rate has thus reached a 15-year high of 4.75-5%. While the inversion of the yield curve in the March-end quarter is expected to have been an offsetting factor, BK’s interest income is expected to have improved, supported by the rise in rates and decent loan growth.The consensus mark for NIR for the first quarter is pegged at $1.06 billion, indicating 51.7% year-over-year growth. Our estimate for NIR is $1.09 billion, suggesting a year-over-year rise of 56.2%.Expenses: Because of higher litigation and restructuring charges, BNY Mellon’s expenses have been elevated over the past few years. Nevertheless, overall costs are expected to have been manageable in the quarter under review, given the elimination of unnecessary management layers.Our estimate for first-quarter non-interest expenses is $3.22 billion, suggesting a year-over-year rise of 7.2%.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsAccording to our quantitative model, the chances of BNY Mellon beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for BNY Mellon is +2.24%.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookA couple of other finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases, per our model, are BlackRock, Inc. BLK and BankUnited BKU.The Earnings ESP for BlackRock is +1.05% and it carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present. The company is slated to report first-quarter 2023 results on Apr 14.BankUnited is expected to release first-quarter 2023 earnings on Apr 25.

The launch of the new free-on-board (FOB) India R-PET price assessment further augments Platts' pre-existing suite of R-PET offerings, which includes price assessments in Europe, U.S. and Southeast Asia.S&amp;P Global Inc. logoVanessa Ronsisvalle, regional pricing director, Asia petrochemicals, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, said: ""The new Platts FOB India R-PET price assessment will help meet a growing need from market participants for high-quality, transparent pricing information for this fast-developing export market in Asia. By providing an independent view of its market value, the increased transparency will help participants make informed trading decisions and spur the growth of a nascent recycled PET market in South Asia. We believe the marketplace will find Platts pricing information of critical value to the development of the Indian recycled plastics market, as it becomes increasingly commoditized.""A comprehensive market research conducted by Platts showed robust growth in India's plastic recycling capacity in the organized sector, where large volumes are being exported. A deep dive into India's customs data showed the country's exports were approximately 10,000 metric tons from January to November 2022, reflecting a four-fold jump year on year. India's emergence as an exporter of R-PET flakes coincides with the continued rise in global environmental sustainability concerns and ambitions, which has big brands announcing aggressive targets for the use of recycled materials in their packaging globally.Story continuesThe new daily FOB South-Asia assessment reflects a recycled PET flakes quality specification based on an intrinsic viscosity (IV) level of 0.72 – 0.78, PVC content of less than 30 parts per million (ppm), and 100% clear in color.The new assessments will be underpinned by the rigorous Platts Market-On-Close (MOC) price assessment methodology, which produces a daily end-of-day value that reflects prices as determined by buyers and sellers in the open physical markets.See subscriber note.

219,ae2b31dd-4212-3540-a403-31c3e3df56e7,SYF,2023-04-14,Analysts Estimate Synchrony (SYF) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-synchrony-syf-report-140002036.html,1681308002,STORY,['SYF'],"[The market expects Synchrony (SYF) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 19, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis consumer credit company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.50 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -13.3%.Revenues are expected to be $4.01 billion, up 5.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.39% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Synchrony?For Synchrony, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.70%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Synchrony will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Synchrony would post earnings of $1.12 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.26, delivering a surprise of +12.50%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Synchrony doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Without Chinese, Korean and Japanese bids, the market is likely going to continue its current trajectory of new lows.""Customs data on Thursday showed China's January-March natural gas imports fell 3.6% from a year earlier to 26.7 million tonnes.China, the world's top LNG importer in 2021, emerged from stringent pandemic curbs late last year, prompting expectations of a rebound in energy demand.""As Q1 demonstrated, China did not come back in the way people were hoping for post-COVID reopening,"" said Hengky, senior LNG analyst at Refinitiv.He said there could be modest increases in Chinese demand in the second half of the year, though term cargo supplies could exceed demand.""There could be some excess for them to try and resell back to the market. Bear in mind that China is sticking with their policy of leaning towards coal as the main source for energy security purposes,"" he said.""We also expect them to increase flows of pipeline gas, from Russia primarily.""In South Korea, terminal inventories are also ""very high"" said Samuel Good, head of LNG pricing at commodity pricing agency Argus.""We're hearing buyers in the country are seeking to slow the flow of long-term LNG receipts in attempts to avoid reaching tank-top situations, as well as staying away from the spot LNG market,"" he said.Story continues""Together with largely mild weather as northeast Asia shifted from winter into summer, weather forecasts are pointing to a broadly cool start of the new season which could limit cooling power sector gas demand.""In Europe, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights assessed its daily northwest Europe LNG Marker (NWM) price benchmark for cargoes delivered in May on an ex-ship (DES) basis at $11.191 per mmBtu on April 13, a $2.40 discount to the May gas price at the TTF Dutch gas hub.Ongoing strikes in France have affected its LNG sendout, with a force majeure issued at the Dunkirk LNG terminal on April 13.But overall, Europe remains well supplied as Atlantic export flows continue to be pointed to Europe, though the southern hemisphere winter will draw some supply to South America in the coming weeks, said Argus' Good, who on April 13 assessed the northwest Europe delivered LNG prices for May at $11.70/mmBtu.On LNG freight, Pacific spot rates fell this week to $59,250 per day on Friday, its lowest level this year, said Edward Armitage, an analyst at Spark Commodities.Atlantic rates meanwhile rose to $42,750 per day on Friday.(Reporting by Emily Chow; editing by Jason Neely)]"

But she noted that 90% of the new generating capacity that came online globally last year is from renewable sources.“So this is happening. The tectonic plates are shifting, and it has to happen more quickly,” she said, pointing to U.S. efforts to curb emissions in transportation and power generation and other steps toward “decarbonization” of many industries.Still, the approval of major fossil fuel projects such as the Willow project on Alaska’s petroleum-rich North Slope has drawn criticism that it runs counter to President Joe Biden’s pledges to cut carbon emissions and move to clean energy. There are also objections to the project's environmental impact.Environmentalists say Japan's strategy of relying on fossil fuels such as coal, even with technologies like carbon capture that prevent emissions from escaping into the atmosphere, and failure to more fully embrace renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power, fails to set a persuasive example for other major polluters such as China and India.Story continuesGranholm said that moves toward embracing renewable, clean energy sources, including hydrogen, nonetheless “give hope to others to be able to do it as the technology lowers the cost.""The Suiso Frontier, the ship Granholm toured Friday as it was docked in the port of Otaru, is the world's only liquefied hydrogen marine carrier. Built by Japanese ship maker Kawasaki Heavy Industries, it carries hydrogen cooled to minus 253 degrees Celsius (minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit) in a liquid form that occupies one eight hundredth of the volume it would occupy as a gas.The 8,000-ton ship was built to carry hydrogen produced at a coal gasification facility in Australia to Japan for power generation and to fuel vehicles, among other uses.The Biden administration is turning to hydrogen as an energy source for vehicles, manufacturing and generating electricity. It’s offering $8 billion to entice the nation’s industries, engineers and planners to figure out how to produce and deliver clean hydrogen.“We’re interested in taking this to the next level in making sure that it can be derived from clean sources,” Granholm said while standing on the bridge of the vessel, whose home port is Kobe.American companies made final pitches earlier this month in bidding for a new program that will create regional networks, or “hubs,” of hydrogen producers, consumers and infrastructure. The aim is to accelerate the availability and use of the colorless, odorless gas that already powers some vehicles and trains.The Department of Energy is required to fund at least four hydrogen hubs by 2026. The hubs are to demonstrate various ways of producing hydrogen, including fossil fuels, nuclear power and renewable energy sources.The challenge is to ensure such projects are commercially feasible, that there is adequate demand from industries for the hydrogen.The Department of Energy has estimated that at least $85 billion is needed to establish a U.S. hydrogen industry.Despite ambitions to turn the country into a “hydrogen society,” Japan’s own hydrogen industry is in its infancy, with the government still drawing up the legislation needed to support creation of infrastructure and supply chains for commercial use of hydrogen and ammonia.Part of that plan involves providing an estimated 7 trillion yen ($53 billion) in subsidies to help bridge the difference in prices between energy produced from hydrogen and conventional sources such as natural gas.Since hydrogen is difficult to transport it is sometimes stored as liquid ammonia, which is one part nitrogen to three parts hydrogen. Ammonia allows the hydrogen to be stored and shipped more easily and compactly.Supporters of hydrogen and ammonia say they offer a way for countries in Southeast Asia, whose combined emissions are the world’s fourth largest, to meet rising demand for power while cutting carbon emissions.Another is nuclear power.Granholm praised Japan's decision to restart many of the nuclear power plants it idled for safety concerns after a massive earthquake and catastrophic tsunami in March 2011 triggered meltdowns at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant on the northeastern coast of its main island.It's a choice that many in the energy-scarce nation view as inevitable, even as the plants near the end of their expected lifetimes.Major Japanese industries such as steelmakers, manufacturers and electrical utilities are heavily invested in fossil fuel-based technologies and have huge sway over the government and politicians, Kumiko Hirata, founder and international director of Climate Integrate (Japan), said in an online briefing.Japan's “green transformation” strategy, which includes commercializing the use of hydrogen and ammonia, mainly caters to big business interests, she said.“They always argue that using existing technology is the most economically feasible approach for decarbonization and because of that, climate policy development in Japan has been so slow,” she said. “And Japan became the laggard among the G-7.”]"

The second quarter too has started on a high, with indexes trading mostly in the green.The positive sentiment got a further boost after the Labor Department reported on Apr 12 that inflation cooled in March, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rising a meager 0.1%, beating expectations of a jump of 0.2%. Moreover, the CPI rose 5% year over year in March, which also beat analysts’ expectations of a jump of 5.1%.Core CPI rose 0.4% month over month and 5.6% year over year in March. The March figures indicate that inflation may finally have started cooling. However, it is still at a multi-decade high and far from policymakers’ target of 2%.The crisis is hence far from over. Responding to the current scenario, the Fed has been on an interest rate hike spree. The central bank increased interest rates by 25 basis points in its last monetary policy meeting in March.The Fed has now hiked interest rates by 475 basis points since March 2022, the highest since 2008. Moreover, Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave a hawkish view and indicated continuing with its rate hike policy till the central bank gets complete control over sky-high inflation.Also, the banking collapse in the United States which started with the Silicon Valley Bank, was followed by Signature Bank and raised fears of a liquidity crisis spilling over to other banks, rattled markets. The Fed finally had to intervene to assure investors that the U.S. banking sector is still on solid ground.It now needs to be seen how the Fed goes ahead with its interest rate hikes in the near term.Given the circumstances, a wise investor would keep an eye on dividend-paying equities at this time. Market turbulence can be handled by dividend stocks that have a solid business plan and a proven track record.Dividend stocks further lessen the likelihood of market volatility while ensuring a steady profit flow.

In that same time, the Retail-Wholesale sector gained 4.7%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 6.11%.Investors will be hoping for strength from Expedia as it approaches its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Expedia to post earnings of -$0.04 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 91.67%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $2.68 billion, up 19.28% from the prior-year quarter.EXPE's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $9.26 per share and revenue of $12.78 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +36.38% and +9.55%, respectively.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Expedia should also be noted by investors. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

Expedia is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Looking at its valuation, Expedia is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 9.65. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 21.99, so we one might conclude that Expedia is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesMeanwhile, EXPE's PEG ratio is currently 0.69.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Lockheed Martin, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.20 = US$7.5b ÷ (US$53b - US$16b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Therefore, Lockheed Martin has an ROCE of 20%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry average of 9.1%. Check out our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Lockheed Martin compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?Lockheed Martin is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 22% over the last five years. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.Story continuesIn Conclusion...As discussed above, Lockheed Martin appears to be getting more proficient at generating returns since capital employed has remained flat but earnings (before interest and tax) are up. Since the stock has returned a solid 60% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.Like most companies, Lockheed Martin does come with some risks, and we've found 2 warning signs  that you should be aware of.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

Located in Pulte’s Forest Park at Wildlight community, the home was donated through the Company’s Built to Honor® program. This is the first home dedication of 2023, which marks the program’s 10th year of providing homes to wounded veterans and their families.This press release features multimedia.

""It is an honor for our Pulte team, along with the Wildlight community and our trade partners and suppliers who provided such generous support, to present this home to Sergeant Perry and his family.""The fully accessible single-family home was designed to meet all of Sergeant Perry’s current and future needs. The home includes Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) modifications to accommodate future wheelchair use. The stairwell has also been reinforced for the future addition of a wheelchair lift.""We are so grateful, and we appreciate all of the efforts that went into coordinating this new beginning for our family,"" said Sergeant Perry. ""We are honored and humbled to be the recipients of this beautiful new home.""This is the third home donated in Northeast Florida through PulteGroup’s Built to Honor program. The home was built in partnership with Building Homes for Heroes®, a national non-profit organization making a significant difference in the lives of wounded American service members and their families, and with the generous support of the Wildlight community.Story continues""Sergeant Perry is a hero who fought for our country in both Iraq and Afghanistan at the sacrifice of his health and well-being,"" said Andy Pujol, founder and CEO of Building Homes for Heroes. ""His wife Helen also served our country as a captain in the Army. We are forever grateful for their service, and hope this home welcomes a new chapter of their lives as they raise their two young children and build a brighter future for their family.""""We warmly welcome the Perry family to their new home at Forest Park at Wildlight, where they will create wonderful new memories together,"" said Wildlight Vice President Wes Hinton. ""They are now part of an integrated community that encourages connections and support, including those with fellow veterans, and are close to all of the services they need.""United States Marine Corps Sergeant Matthew PerryU.S. Marine Corps Sergeant Matthew Perry joined the Marines in August 2005, after being part of the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC) and Civil Air Patrol in high school. After more than a decade of service where Sergeant Perry carried out numerous critical missions and served in combat in both Iraq and Afghanistan, he was medically retired in March 2016 after suffering a traumatic brain injury (TBI).On July 21, 2008, Sergeant Perry was in direct contact with enemy forces during a company assault in Afghanistan, exposing him to three improvised explosive device (IED) detonations that resulted in serious injuries, including three concussions and a loss of consciousness. Six years later, he suffered a series of severe seizures and cardiac arrest due to his previous consecutive head injuries, causing post traumatic epilepsy secondary to closed brain injury. This is a chronic condition that will require lifetime monitoring and treatment, leaving Sergeant Perry with severe memory loss, difficulty communicating, and having to relearn how to talk and walk.For his valor and service, Sergeant Perry has received several accolades, including the Purple Heart, Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, Combat Action Ribbon (Afghanistan), Combat Action Ribbon (Iraq), Navy Unit Commendation (3), Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation (3), Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal (3), and the National Defense Service Medal.About Built to Honor®For the last decade, PulteGroup’s Built to Honor® program has recognized and thanked returning military personnel who have been injured during their term of service by providing mortgage-free homes to veterans and their families.

The security has been making its way higher with support from the 20-day moving average, after pulling back to the $52 region in March as it took a breather from a Feb. 2, one-year high of $60.89.PHM 20 DayA historically bullish signal now flashing could mean more tailwinds for PHM, which is today pacing for a third-straight daily win. According to Schaeffer's Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, PHM's latest peak comes amid historically low implied volatility (IV), which has been a bullish combination for the shares in the past.White's data shows seven other signals during the last five years when the security was trading within 2% of its 52-week high, while its Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) sat in the 20th percentile of its annual range or lower. This is currently the case with PulteGroup stock's SVI of 29%, which sits in the 1st percentile of its annual range.One month after these signals, shares were higher 57% of the time, averaging a 3.1% gain. From its current perch, a move of similar magnitude would place the equity at a fresh one-year high of $61.96.A sentiment shift in the options pits could push the shares higher still. This is per their Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio (SOIR) of 3.87, which ranks higher than all other annual readings. This suggests short-term options traders have rarely been more put-biased.]"

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about PulteGroup (PHM).PulteGroup currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.77, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 13 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.77 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 13 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy, representing 61.5% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PHMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PHMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for PulteGroup here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying PulteGroup, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is PHM Worth Investing In?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for PulteGroup, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $7.44.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for PulteGroup. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for PulteGroup.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It has gained 1.5% so far this year, and SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust DIA, which tracks the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, is up 2.2%.As the index is closely tied to the cyclical sectors, the banking turmoil hit hard the Dow last month. Recession fears have added to the woes (read: Forget Recession Fears, Invest in These Safe ETFs).The first-quarter 2023 earnings season will kick off this week, with the banking sector slated to report numbers. The picture of the earnings season seems bleak, given that the companies are struggling with a host of challenges, including inflation, rising interest rates and concerns about the health of the financial system in the wake of the two biggest bank failures since the 2008 financial crisis.Total S&amp;P 500 earnings are expected to be down 10% from the same period last year on 1.8% higher revenues, per the latest Earnings Trends. This would follow the 5.4% earnings decline in Q4 on 5.9% higher revenues. Though estimates have come down from the 4% earnings decline projected at the start of the first quarter, the magnitude of negative revision is smaller relative to the comparable periods for the preceding two quarters.Of the 16 Zacks sectors, six are expected to post positive earnings growth in the first quarter, with the strongest gains in Transportation (55.6%).

241,f49b98b5-8d42-3f3d-a583-60b5dbfeb9ee,JNJ,2023-04-14,12 Best Warren Buffett Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-best-warren-buffett-stocks-214848744.html,1681336128,STORY,"['BRK-B', 'TMUS', 'JNJ', 'TSM', 'AAPL', 'SNOW', 'GM', 'CHTR', 'MA']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best Warren Buffett stocks to buy according to hedge funds. For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Warren Buffett Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. For newcomers, and sometimes seasoned professionals too, investing often feels like a daunting task. Choosing the right set of securities, commodities, currencies, or other investment vehicles to put one's money in, naturally carries the allure of profits. However, at the same time, the sword of losses is also always dangling, eager to strike at the slightest miscalculation.The aftermath of the coronavirus and the generous stimulus spending by the American government changed stock market dynamics. Before the pandemic hit, most investing was done by professional investors, and the retail segment - namely ordinary people buying and selling shares - constituted a nearly negligible portion of total trading. The retail trader of today is quite different from the retail trader of the dotcom era where everyone bet on technology companies regardless of their fundamentals and ended up losing significant amounts of value as the market crashed.Data from BNY Mellon shows that retail traders typically focus on individual stocks, and when they do, their attention often ends up disrupting the complex mathematical models deployed by hedge funds for trading. It adds that stocks such as GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) carry the potential of massive returns that can go as high as 3,500% but can also cause significant losses that range around 18%. At the same time, the relatively safer S&amp;P 500 can provide 35% in returns and a maximum of 7.5% in losses. After inflation hurt the stock market again last year, retail traders were hesitant to put more of their money on the market. However, this does not mean that they are out of the picture for good. According to data from the investment bank JPMorgan, retail trading hit an all time high for 2023 by the close of January and as of data released in early February. A note from the bank outlined that between the final week of January and the start of the first week of February, the retail trade share of the total trading volume in America was a whopping 23%. This was an all time high record for the everyday trader since the last record was during the pandemic's peak. This record was 22%, and inflation had cut down retail trading to 15% of the total volume in 2022.Story continuesSo, if retail traders can enter or leave the market on a whim and the hedge fund industry remains shaky, who can you rely on for trading advice? Well, one name that no one should disagree with is the legendary Warren Buffett - or the Oracle of Omaha. Mr. Buffett's journey on the stock market has made him worth a cool $110 billion as of March 2023 according to Forbes Magazine. This wealth is after Mr. Buffett's donation, which currently sits at $49 billion. His fortune comes courtesy of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), an investment holding company that buys ownership stakes in a wide variety of different companies such as technology, retail, banking, energy, automotive manufacturing, and more. In fact, Berkshire is also the most expensive stock on the U.S. market, with a share price that currently trades at $481,661. Over the past five years, the shares have appreciated by 62% and since they started trading, the gains stand at a whopping 52,238%. And you only thought that meme stocks could give you returns in thousands of percent, huh?Mr. Buffett regularly communicates with investees in his firm in the form of shareholder letters. His letter for 2022 was released earlier this month, and it contains pieces of wisdom from the Oracle himself. For instance, the sage believes that stocks often trade at silly prices, as he shares:One advantage of our publicly-traded segment is that – episodically – it becomes easy to buy pieces of wonderful businesses at wonderful prices. It’s crucial to understand that stocks often trade at truly foolish prices, both high and low. “Efficient” markets exist only in textbooks. In truth, marketable stocks and bonds are baffling, their behavior usually understandable only in retrospect.Another piece of wisdom from Mr. Buffett outlines that over the long term, you only have to make a couple of good decisions to ensure success on the stock market. Quoting his investment in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), the Oracle outlines:In August 1994 – yes, 1994 – Berkshire completed its seven-year purchase of the 400 million shares of Coca-Cola we now own. The total cost was $1.3 billion – then a very meaningful sum at Berkshire.The cash dividend we received from Coke in 1994 was $75 million. By 2022, the dividend had increased to $704 million. Growth occurred every year, just as certain as birthdays. All Charlie and I were required to do was cash Coke’s quarterly dividend checks. We expect that those checks are highly likely to grow.American Express is much the same story. Berkshire’s purchases of Amex were essentially completed in 1995 and, coincidentally, also cost $1.3 billion. Annual dividends received from this investment have grown from $41 million to $302 million. Those checks, too, seem highly likely to increase.These dividend gains, though pleasing, are far from spectacular. But they bring with them important gains in stock prices. At yearend, our Coke investment was valued at $25 billion while Amex was recorded at $22 billion. Each holding now accounts for roughly 5% of Berkshire’s net worth, akin to its weighting long ago.Assume, for a moment, I had made a similarly-sized investment mistake in the 1990s, one that flat-lined and simply retained its $1.3 billion value in 2022. (An example would be a high-grade 30-year bond.) That disappointing investment would now represent an insignificant 0.3% of Berkshire’s net worth and would be delivering to us an unchanged $80 million or so of annual income.The lesson for investors: The weeds wither away in significance as the flowers bloom [EMPHASIS OURS]. Over time, it takes just a few winners to work wonders. And, yes, it helps to start early and live into your 90s as well.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the best of both worlds, namely Warren Buffett's stock picks that are also popular with hedge funds.

244,de4b684a-0ae9-3c48-b029-a0a4b0385790,MDT,2023-04-14,3 Medical Device Stocks to Buy for Cutting-Edge Innovation and Growth,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-medical-device-stocks-buy-120140389.html,1681128100,STORY,"['MDT', 'ISRG', 'VREX']","[As the population of our country continues to age, treatments and disease detection will continue to increase in demand. Additionally, improvements in imaging, robotics, and AI technology continue to give scientists new tools to make better medical devices. As devices become better and better at diagnosing and treating diseases without needing an in-person doctor, they will continue to build market share. This will be good news for the medical device stocks of companies treating and detecting diseases.Medical devices are regulated by the FDA much like drugs are. That means an investor should be aware of the workings of the FDA as they approve or disapprove certain devices. And while FDA disapproval can sting a company’s stock, a good medical device stock won’t have all its eggs in one basket. Plenty of rewards exist for a patient investor willing to push through bad news or wait in anticipation of good news.On top of this, the medical device industry is less sensitive to economic downturns. If economic headwinds persist, medical device stocks could benefit from a flight to safety. So if you believe a recession is around the corner, now is the best time to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOverall, medical device stocks couple high growth potential for strong regular returns. Here are three medical device stocks any investor will want to look out for.Medical Device Stocks: Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) makes robotic surgery equipment, the flagship of which is the da Vinci Surgical System. Robotic surgery promises to deliver better surgical outcomes with greater regularity than what a doctor can do on their own.Not only that, Intuitive Surgical is using AI/ML to improve patient outcomes. By training a machine to find and approach surgical markers like a doctor would, much of the stress can be removed from the doctor’s load. The synthesis of AI learning and doctors’ insight can be leveraged to provide the best possible care at the lowest possible price.Story continuesIntuitive has historically been a strong growth stock, and its price reflects this. Its current price-to-earnings ratio of 70x is likely due to its historically high growth rate and expected future growth. While some investors may balk at such a price, there is reason to be optimistic.In Q4 2022, the year-on-year use of da Vinci grew by 18%. And while year-on-year revenue increased just 7% overall, this was in part due to the impacts of COVID in China. With China now opened back up, the company could benefit from a return to double-digit growth to justify its high P/E. Investors should look to Intuitive’s earnings on April 14th to see if this is true.Overall, Intuitive is one of the best-positioned stocks to take advantage of the ongoing robotics and artificial intelligence revolution. And that gives it a pathway to big growth in the very near future.Medtronic (MDT)Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocksSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comMedtronic (NYSE:MDT) is a giant in the medical device sector, with Q1 2023 sales of $7.7 billion and a net income of $1.2 billion. Its strong dividend of 3.4% is also noteworthy for a medical device company, making it an attractive stock for investors seeking both growth and income.Medtronic’s line of products and services covers almost the entire spectrum of medical devices. Moreover, Medtronic is venturing into a potentially lucrative market with the launch of Mozarc Medical. Mozarc Medical is a Medtronic-DaVita (NYSE:DVA) joint venture which will develop at-home kidney treatments. With 15% of U.S. adults having chronic kidney disease, this market represents a significant opportunity for Medtronic.Although Medtronic received a warning letter from the U.S. FDA about its diabetes devices, the company is addressing these issues. Meanwhile, it could be suggested that the FDA letter proves Medtronic’s size is a hindrance. Competing with smaller, nimbler companies may be too big and slow.But Medtronic is addressing these issues, spinning out its patient monitoring and respiration business. And it could also spin out its diabetes business in the future, allowing it to focus on stronger growth opportunities. And if Medtronic can remove the deadweight, it can quickly create growth opportunities.Overall, Medtronic is strongly positioned financially for the road ahead. It also has a large number of ongoing clinical trials for its devices. And while some of those trials may fail, a large company like Medtronic can play the averages and ensure that its winners go on to be industry leaders. And that means big returns for investors.Varex Imaging (VREX)An image of a dental equipment manufactured by Dentsply Sirona (XRAY)Source: Cineberg / Shutterstock.comVarex Imaging (NASDAQ: VREX) is a company that specializes in the design and manufacture of X-ray imaging components. Its X-rays power various applications, including medical imaging, industrial inspection, and security scanning. The company was spun out from Varian Medical (NYSE:VAR) in 2017. And since then, it has established itself as a leading player in the imaging components market.Varex’s strongest sector is medical imaging. As the demand for disease detection and screening increases, this will likely drive growth in its medical imaging market.But Varex also has a strong revenue stream in other areas. Varex serves both original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and end-users in the medical and industrial sectors. This provides a broad customer base for weathering fluctuations in demand from any one industry. So while it has room to grow in the medical device field, it also has plenty of room to grow elsewhere.In Q4 2022, Varex Imaging’s revenue was $205 million, with a gross margin of 31%. Their net income of just $3.2 million comes largely from their continued heavy investment in research and development. But that is also a point in their favor, as it means they continue building out for the future.Varex Imaging is a company with strong growth potential in a growing market. And that makes it a medical device stock that should definitely be on your radar.On the date of publication, John Blankenhorn did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.Story continuesMerck has an extensive clinical development program evaluating KEYTRUDA in gastrointestinal cancers, which includes KEYNOTE-811 in first-line advanced HER2-positive gastric cancer, KEYNOTE-585 in early-stage gastric cancer, and further exploration in advanced/metastatic gastric cancer in LEAP-015. Merck is continuing to study KEYTRUDA for multiple uses in hepatobiliary, esophageal, pancreatic, colorectal and biliary tract cancers.About KEYNOTE-859KEYNOTE-859 is a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03675737) evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy compared to placebo in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma. The primary endpoint is OS, and secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, ORR, duration of response and safety. The trial enrolled 1,579 patients who were randomized to receive KEYTRUDA (200 mg every three weeks for up to approximately two years) in combination with fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy (n=785), or placebo in combination with chemotherapy (n=787). All patients received investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil plus cisplatin or capecitabine plus oxaliplatin).About gastric cancerGastric (stomach) cancer tends to develop slowly over many years and rarely causes early symptoms, resulting in most cases going undetected until an advanced stage. More than 70% of patients with gastric cancer develop advanced-stage disease. Most gastric cancers are adenocarcinomas (about 90-95%), which develop from cells in the innermost lining of the stomach (known as the mucosa). The majority of gastric cancers are HER2-negative, affecting approximately four out of every five patients. Gastric cancer is the fifth most diagnosed cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with approximately 1.1 million patients diagnosed and 768,000 deaths from the disease globally in 2020. In the U.S., it is estimated there will be approximately 26,500 patients diagnosed with gastric cancer and 11,000 deaths from the disease in 2023. The five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with gastric cancer at an advanced stage is only 6%.About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection, 100 mgKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD- L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.Gastric CancerKEYTRUDA, in combination with trastuzumab, fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.See additional selected KEYTRUDA indications in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information.Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDASevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse ReactionsKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.Immune-Mediated PneumonitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.Pneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.Immune-Mediated ColitisKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated HepatitisKEYTRUDA as a Single AgentKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.KEYTRUDA With AxitinibKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.Immune-Mediated EndocrinopathiesAdrenal InsufficiencyKEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (&lt;0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids.

Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection.Infusion-Related ReactionsKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple MyelomaIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.Embryofetal ToxicityBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.Adverse ReactionsIn KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%).

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best 5% Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Analysts. High-dividend stocks can be an attractive option for investors who are seeking regular income from their investments. However, it's important to note that a high dividend yield can sometimes indicate that the stock price has fallen significantly, which may indicate a riskier investment. It's also important to consider the company's financial health and growth potential, as well as the overall market conditions. According to analysts, dividend yields between 3% to 6% are considered healthy.The current high-interest rates environment has turned investors’ attention toward high-dividend stocks because of their ability to generate stable income. Historically, dividend stocks have massively contributed to the market returns overall, especially during periods when interest rates were high. Since 1926, dividend stocks represented nearly one-third of the S&amp;P 500’s total return and accounted for over 50% during decades with elevated interest rates and slowing growth, as reported by iShares. Last year’s returns show the outperformance of dividend stocks over the wider market. The iShares Core High Dividend ETF, which tracks the performance of relatively high-dividend-paying US equities, gained 7.1% in 2022, compared with an 18.1% decline in the S&amp;P 500. Moreover, the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Payers fell by only 7.6% last year, which is less severe than a 21.1% drop in the S&amp;P 500 Non-Dividend Payers.United Overseas Bank published a report in collaboration with JPMorgan Asset Management, stressing the positive performance of high-dividend stocks over the years. The report mentioned that the MSCI World High Index gained 3.7% from July 2007 to August 2022 with a volatility of 13.3%. In comparison, MSCI World returned 2.1% during this period with high volatility of 16%.Story continuesAnalysts are also presenting a positive stance on quality dividend companies during this period of financial uncertainty. Michael Clarfeld, ClearBridge Investments portfolio manager, spoke to CNBC about dividend companies. Here are some comments from the analyst:“High-quality dividend growers are a good place to be. The upfront yield provides strong downside support and the dividend growth provides a meaningful headwind against rising interest rates and preserves purchasing power.”Some of the best dividend stocks with high yields include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) because of their strong dividend policies. To know more about high-dividend stocks, readers can have a look at 15 Best High Yield Dividend Stocks to Buy.11 Best 5% Dividend Stocks To Buy According To AnalystsPhoto by Austin Distel on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this article, we first screened for dividend stocks with yields above 5%. From the resultant list, we selected companies that have raised their dividends for at least 5 years. We then found the average price targets and ratings of these stocks placed by Wall Street analysts and other investment firms and narrowed them down to the stocks with strongest upside potential based on their current share price and their average price targets. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the upside potential as of April 12.11 Best 5% Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Analysts11. Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO)Upside Potential as of April 12: 8.29%Average Price Target Based on Analyst Ratings: $48.8Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) deals in the manufacturing of tobacco, cigarettes, and other related products. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the company posted net revenue of over $6.1 billion, which showed a 2.3% decline from the same period last year. It remained committed to its shareholder obligation, returning $1.7 billion to investors during the quarter, which places it as one of the best dividend stocks on our list.In addition to Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) are other high-dividend stocks favored by investors.Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.94 per share and has a dividend yield of 8.39%, as of April 12. The company maintains a 53-year streak of consistent dividend growth. According to analysts, the stock has an upside potential of 8.29%, as of April 12.At the end of Q4 2022, 45 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO), compared with 47 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a total value of over $1.8 billion.Broyhill Asset Management mentioned Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We rebalanced our tobacco exposure during the year, reducing our investment in Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) as the future of the company’s combustible cigarette business became increasingly questionable given pending US legislation and a lackluster portfolio of reduced risk products. We reinvested the proceeds in Philip Morris so that relative position sizing is more consistent with our increased conviction.”10. Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)Upside Potential as of April 12: 14.3%Average Price Target Based on Analyst Ratings: $112.7Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is an American multinational tobacco company that also specializes in other nicotine-containing products. On March 9, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $1.27 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend. It is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as it holds a 14-year track record of consistent dividend growth. As of April 12, the stock has a dividend yield of 5.14%.In March, JPMorgan upgraded Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) to Overweight and also raised its price target on the stock to $116, presenting a positive outlook on the company's earnings growth.In the fourth quarter of 2022, Philip Morris International Inc.

At the end of December 2022, the company had over $3.2 billion available in cash and cash equivalents.As per Insider Monkey's Q4 2022 database, 47 hedge funds owned stakes in Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), with a total value of over $6.2 billion. Among these elite funds, GQG Partners was the company's leading stakeholder in Q4.Artisan Partners mentioned Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Our top individual contributors were Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), EOG Resources and Merck. Despite being US-based, tobacco company PM derives all its sales from outside the US. As a result, foreign exchange impacts can be an important driver of near-term returns, and the recent weakening in the US dollar should provide a strong tailwind for earnings due to translation effects. However, our investment case is not tied to currency movements. By virtue of its globally known brands, PM is the best-in-class operator with a well-diversified business, particularly by geography. We believe its next generation heat-not-burn product IQOS should gain share as consumers continue migrating to safer tobacco delivery systems. The company is progressing toward its acquisition of Swedish Match, a Swedish tobacco and nicotine products maker, which was previously held in the portfolio. The deal is a good fit for PM as it reduces PM’s dependence on cigarettes—a category in steady decline—and accelerates the company’s transition to smokeless “reduced-risk” products (RRPs)—a category that has experienced rapid growth over the past five years. PM can also leverage its global scale to generate significant revenue synergies from these complementary product sets, as well as quickly gain access to the US market—the world’s largest market for RRPs and one where regulators have embraced RRPs and other less harmful nicotine products. Looking at PM through our margin-of-safety criteria, the business trades for an undemanding valuation and has extraordinary business economics and a strong credit profile.”9. Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU)Upside Potential as of April 12: 14.9%Average Price Target Based on Analyst Ratings: $98.1Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) is a New Jersey-based insurance company that offers a wide range of insurance services to its consumers.

Here is what the firm has to say:“There are a few other segments of our portfolios that displayed weakness in the quarter. Cable and telecommunication companies have been an area that has lagged the broader market as their worlds are increasingly colliding. Companies such as Verizon (NYSE:VZ) has been impacted as wireless operator is spending heavily to attract internet subscribers with fixed wired access and the cable companies are trying to build wireless businesses.”7. Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD)Upside Potential as of April 12: 21.48%Average Price Target Based on Analyst Ratings: $32.40Enterprise Products Partners L.P.

(NYSE:EPD) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) is still owned in the fund and remains one of our largest positions, as it has been since the partnership was founded. This has not been a great investment. Shares are down about 6% since I first wrote about it. However, we have received $8.93 per share in dividends, which is about 34% of the 2018 share price. So, with dividends included we’ve made 28% cumulatively over 5-years. Still not good, but not an impairment of capital either.Since 2018, EPD’s dividend yield has gone from 6.5% to 8% with the annual per share payout growing from $1.72 to $1.96, +14%. The pace of dividend growth has recently increased from about 2% to 5%+. Additionally, Distributable Cash Flow per share (what could be paid to us if management wanted to) has increased 22%, from $2.73 to $3.33, while leverage has come down a little over ½ a turn. So, the balance sheet and cash flow metrics are in better shape than they were 5-years ago, and they were pretty good 5-years ago.The competitive dominance of the asset base, industry leading low leverage, and a founding family with multiple billions of dollars invested alongside us keep it a core holding in the portfolio. We’ll continue to own this company unless the shares become meaningfully overvalued, and if it gets cheaper, we would be very comfortable owning more.”6. The Williams Companies, Inc.

Any slowdown in production could hit airlines’ plans for expansion.Boeing 737 Max - Lindsey Wasson/ReutersBoeing is also struggling to recover confidence in the 737 Max after two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 claimed the lives of 346 passengers and triggered a grounding of the craft. Faulty software was found to be the cause.The company said it had told its regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration, about the construction error, adding that it was “working to conduct inspections and replace the non-conforming fittings where necessary”.The problem affects other craft in the 737 Max “family”, Boeing said, including the Max 7, Max 8 and Max 8200 planes, in addition to the P-8 Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft.Spirit said it and Boeing would work towards a solution.Smaller jets contribute the majority of sales at both Boeing and Airbus, with intercontinental jets with two aisles proving less popular among customers.Although the 737 Max jets have now been signed off as safe by regulators, Boeing has been hit by supply chain problems and production delays. But airlines are keen to acquire the aircraft as it will cut carriers’ fuel costs and reduce emissions.In February, it emerged Boeing would cut 2,000 office jobs in the US as the struggling planemaker battles to improve its stalling production line.Roughly a third of the roles being cut will be outsourced to India, The Seattle Times reported, with the remainder disappearing completely.Boeing said it will increase its overall workforce size by 10,000 this year, with a “focus on engineering and manufacturing” roles.

This likely points to a longer pause this time (BA resumed 787 deliveries after ~2 weeks),"" Wells Fargo analyst Matthew Akers said.Akers, however, added that the impact could be ""short term in nature"" and that Boeing may push its 2023 cash flow goal of $3 billion to $5 billion toward the lower end.Story continuesAirbus shares have outperformed those of Boeing this year https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/klpygmjybpg/Airbus%20vs%20Boeing.PNGShares of Spirit closed down 20.7% on Friday.""We see more negative financial exposure to this news at Spirit than at Boeing,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Seth Seifman said.The issue could weigh on the fleet-expansion plans of the airlines.Southwest Airlines expects the issue to impact its current delivery schedule, while American Airlines said it was working with Boeing to understand the effect.Europe's Ryanair, which was scheduled to receive 24 737 aircraft over the next 2-1/2 months, said it was working with Boeing on the possible impact.(Reporting by Aishwarya Nair, Abhijith Ganapavaram in Bengaluru and Valerie Insinna in Washington; Additional reporting by Bansari Kamdar and Nathan Gomes in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Anil D'Silva)]"

Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Quanta Services (PWR) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to PWR for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Quanta Services' Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Quanta Services' main business drivers.Quanta is a leading national provider of specialty contracting services, and one of the largest contractors serving the transmission and distribution sector of the North American electric utility industry. Quanta has operations in the United States, Canada, Australia and other selected international markets.Starting from fourth-quarter 2021, Quanta reports results under three reportable segments: Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions, Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions, and Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions.The Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions segment (accounting for 52.4% of 2022 revenues) provides network solutions to customers in the electric power industry. Services performed include design, installation, upgrade, repair and maintenance of electric power transmission and distribution networks, and sub-station facilities; emergency restoration services; installation of “smart grid” technology on electric power networks; and communications infrastructure services.The Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment (25.5%) provides solutions to customers involved in the transportation of natural gas, oil and other pipeline products. Services include design, installation, repair and maintenance of oil and gas transmission and distribution systems, and related trenching and directional boring services. Also, this segment provides pipeline protection services, high-pressure and critical-path turnaround services to the downstream and midstream energy markets.Story continuesRenewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions segment (22.1%) provides infrastructure solutions to clients involved in the renewable energy and/or related infrastructure. This segment provides services related to engineering, procurement, new construction, upgrade, and repair and maintenance of utility-scale wind, solar and hydropower generation facilities as well as battery storage facilities.Bottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Quanta Services ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in April 2013 would be worth $5,880.26, or a gain of 488.03%, as of April 13, 2023, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 157.54% and gold's return of 23.93% over the same time frame.Analysts are anticipating more upside for PWR.Quanta's shares have outperformed the industry this year. It has been witnessing notable revenue growth in each segment. It witnessed a solid total backlog of $24.09 billion at 2022-end. The company remains uniquely positioned to capitalize on megatrends and opportunities to lead the energy transition and enable technological development, with initiatives such as electric vehicle charging infrastructure and undergrounding of electrical infrastructure gaining momentum. More demand for infrastructure solutions that help support customers' energy-transition initiatives and modernization will continue to provide multi-year growth opportunities for Quanta. However, lower operating margins, regulatory challenges and project delays are potential headwinds.The stock has jumped 6.22% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 5 higher, for fiscal 2023; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Hot functional testing marks the last series of major tests underway for the new nuclear unit ahead of initial fuel load. The testing represents a significant step towards operations and providing customers with a reliable, carbon-free energy source for the next 60 to 80 years.Hot functional testing is conducted to verify the successful operation of reactor components and systems together and confirm the reactor is ready for fuel load. As part of the testing, the site team will begin running Unit 4 plant systems, without nuclear fuel in the reactor, and advance through the testing process towards reaching normal operating pressure and temperature.As part of the testing process, nuclear operators will use the heat generated by the unit's four reactor coolant pumps to raise the temperature and pressure of plant systems to normal operating levels. Once normal operating temperature and pressure levels are achieved and sustained, the unit's main turbine will be raised to normal operating speed using steam from the plant. During these series of tests, nuclear operators will be able to exercise and validate procedures as required ahead of fuel load.Vogtle Unit 4 is projected to enter service in late fourth quarter 2023 or first quarter 2024.The new Vogtle units are an essential part of Georgia Power's commitment to delivering clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to its 2.7 million customers. Once operating, the two new units, which will be clean energy sources that produce zero air pollution, are expected to power more than 500,000 homes and businesses.

LOUIS, April 13, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Express Scripts, the pharmacy benefits management business of Evernorth, a subsidiary of The Cigna Group (NYSE: CI), today announced several actions to further evolve its pharmacy benefit management (PBM) model. The new solutions and capabilities will increase access to affordable medicines and drive greater transparency and predictability. As part of its long-standing commitment to accelerate pharmacy care and lower the cost of prescription drugs for more than 100 million Americans, Express Scripts is further aligning incentives across the pharmaceutical supply chain, consumers, and clients, with new products available starting in summer 2023.Express Scripts’ new Copay Assurance™ plan ensures consumers pay less out-of-pocket by capping copays on prescription drugs at $5 for generics, $25 for preferred brand drugs, and $45 for preferred specialty brand drugs.Driving Down Costs for ConsumersExpress Scripts is introducing a new and innovative solution, the Copay Assurance plan, which caps consumer out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs under a client's prescription drug benefit. This means customers enrolled in the program will pay no more than $5 for generics and specialty generics, $25 for preferred brand drugs, and $45 for preferred specialty brand drugs every time they fill a prescription. The program will immediately guarantee these lower out-of-pocket rates – customers will not have to wait to meet any deductible levels.""A prescription drug doesn't work if it's priced out of reach. Reducing out-of-pocket costs for consumers is the single best thing we can do to improve the health of those we serve,"" said Adam Kautzner, Pharm.D., President of Express Scripts. ""Express Scripts was first to deliver a $25 price cap on out-of-pocket costs for insulin and other diabetic treatments, which has saved consumers more than $45 million in two years. Our new Copay Assurance plan builds on this success and aggressively expands our efforts across medications to treat all diseases – providing millions more people with predictability and peace of mind at the pharmacy counter.""Story continuesAdditionally, Express Scripts is working with employer and health plan clients to offer consultative options to bring better affordability and predictability. This includes: adopting the broadest lists of preventive prescription drugs that are either fully covered or covered at a discount, lower premiums and deductibles, and increased Health Savings Account contributions for lower-income consumers based on IRS income requirements.Offering Clients a New Level of TransparencyExpress Scripts' new ClearCareRx offers employer, health plan, and government employer clients the option of a transparent economic model by providing clear and predictable costs for prescription drug benefits:Clients pay exactly what Express Scripts pays pharmacies for a prescription.Clients receive 100% of drug rebates that Express Scripts obtains by negotiating with pharmaceutical companies.Clients pay one simple fee to cover the administration of pharmacy benefits, PBM product services, reporting and analytics, and is 100% auditable.Provides guarantees that keep Express Scripts accountable to clinical and financial performance measures, including improvements in drug performance, adherence, and overall patient outcomes.""Expanding on our proven track record of driving transparency, ClearCareRx drives greater simplicity, with strategies to further reduce costs and improve health and pharmacy care. If we don't deliver on a client's goals, they pay less, guaranteed,"" Kautzner added. ""We are built to work on our clients' terms. That means constantly coming to the table with innovative pharmacy benefits and tailored approaches that do more for them and the unique needs of their people.""Enhanced Disclosures and ClarityExpress Scripts is further evolving its transparency to consumers and clients and enhancing its disclosure practices, including:Demonstrating the value consumers and clients can expect from their pharmacy benefit services: Starting in 2024, prescriptions will include an easy-to-understand digital pharmacy benefits statement for consumers – sharing drug price information, out-of-pocket costs, and the value delivered by Express Scripts. This benefit will be implemented across all 65,000 pharmacies in Express Scripts' networks, including Accredo® specialty pharmacy, and Express Scripts Pharmacy.Enhanced financial and fee disclosure for clients utilizing spread pricing: Express Scripts offers different PBM pricing options that clients can select based on their unique needs. Some of these options include spread pricing, a value-sharing arrangement for the discounts Express Scripts negotiates with retail pharmacies for prescription medications. Beginning with the 2023 plan year, Express Scripts will provide clients enhanced financial and fee disclosure regarding their spread pricing arrangements for Form 5500 reporting and other plan administration functions. The Form 5500 Series is a compliance, research, and disclosure tool for the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), other federal agencies, Congress, as well as for plan participants and beneficiaries, and the private sector to assess employee benefit, tax, and economic trends and policies. Express Scripts will provide the same level of increased disclosure to its non-ERISA clients to help support them in understanding the services Express Scripts provides.Launch of a microsite providing disclosures, and filings with the SEC: Concurrent with the release of first quarter earnings by The Cigna Group, Express Scripts will launch a new microsite that will provide additional information about the Express Scripts model. The Cigna Group will also provide additional disclosures regarding its PBM business in its upcoming SEC 10-Q filing.""Our mission is simple: lower the cost of prescription drugs for the one in three Americans we serve. Today's actions demonstrate our ongoing commitment to that mission, and helps clients and consumers see the value of their pharmacy benefits at work more quickly in their daily lives. Because at the end of every prescription is a consumer and client putting their trust in us – that's a responsibility that drives us each day,"" Kautzner said.As a leader in innovative solutions designed to drive meaningful consumer and client outcomes and performance, the initiatives announced today represent Express Scripts' long-standing commitment to advance the PBM model.

(Photo Credit: U.S. Army)HUNTSVILLE, Ala., April 13, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The United States Defense Department has approved Full Rate Production for Northrop Grumman Corporation’s (NYSE: NOC) Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS). The decision scales the U.S. Army’s ability to field the paradigm-changing system, enabling sensor to decider to weapon integration. It also affirms IBCS’s role as the cornerstone of the U.S. Army’s air and missile defense modernization strategy.IBCS rapidly integrates all available sensors and shooters to deliver decision-quality fire control data across joint networks providing a 360-degree view, even if a sensor becomes inoperable. This capability provides increased situational awareness, more effectively manages resources, and enables integration across coalition partners.“IBCS transforms the battlespace by fusing data from any sensor to create a single integrated air picture allowing commanders to see the battlespace and use the best weapons to defeat complex threats,” said Rebecca Torzone, vice president and general manager, combat systems and mission readiness, Northrop Grumman. “Northrop Grumman shares the U.S. Army’s commitment to the rapid deployment of IBCS.”The full rate production decision enables the U.S. Army to set the fielding schedule for IBCS to operational air defense units. The system provides state-of-the-art, all domain command and control for integrated air and missile defense for U.S. interests across the globe. Poland selected IBCS to serve as the centerpiece of the country’s air and missile defense modernization, and as it is adopted by more U.S. allies and partners, IBCS will enable high levels of coalition forces interoperability and network integration.This decision is the latest in a series of milestones for the program. In a paradigm-busting developmental test in November 2022, IBCS successfully intercepted a cruise missile target using a Patriot interceptor without having a Patriot radar in the system architecture. The test demonstrated the flexibility of the IBCS system architecture and its capacity to optimize the capabilities of integrated sensors and effectors onto its network. Additionally, the Agile framework used for IBCS software development yields rapid capability enhancements and addresses emerging threats.Story continuesIn December 2021, Northrop Grumman was awarded a $1.4 billion production contract for Low Rate Initial Production and Full Rate Production, and in late 2022, the program completed Initial Operational Test and Evaluation. Initial operational capability for IBCS is on track for a declaration in 2023.IBCS implements a modular, open and scalable architecture that is foundational to integrating available assets in the battlespace, regardless of source, service or domain onto a common fire control network. Its architecture enables the efficient and affordable integration of current and future systems and extends the battlespace by disaggregating sensors and effectors. By enabling this high level of network integration, the warfighter is given unprecedented time to make decisions within the kill chain. Through numerous successful development and operational tests and demonstrations, IBCS has proven its capability to connect and fuse multi-service sensor data to multi-service weapons, demonstrating Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) capabilities.Northrop Grumman is a leading global aerospace and defense technology company.

Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Northrop Grumman (NOC) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to NOC for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Northrop Grumman's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Northrop Grumman's main business drivers.Originally formed in 1939 as Northrop Aircraft Incorporated and reincorporated in Delaware in 1985 as Northrop Corporation was a principal developer of flying wing technology. In 1994, the company acquired Grumman Corporation (Grumman), after which the company was renamed Northrop Grumman Corporation. Currently, this global security company supplies a broad array of products and services to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) including electronic systems, information technology, aircraft, space technology and systems integration services. Northrop Grumman has realigned its business units effective January 2020.Northrop Grumman's Aeronautics Systems unit focuses on the development, integration, production and support of manned aircraft and autonomous systems. In 2022, revenues came in at $10,531 million, contributing 28.9% to the company’s total revenues.Its Defense Systems unit focuses on mission readiness along with battle management and missile systems. In 2022, revenues came in at $5,579 million, contributing 15.2% to the company’s total revenues.The company's Mission Systems unit includes airborne sensors and networks, cyber and intelligence mission solutions, maritime/land systems and sensors, along with navigation, targeting and survivability. In 2022, revenues came in at $10,396 million, contributing 28.4% to the company’s total revenues.Its Space Systems unit focuses on launch and strategic missiles as well as varied space related products that Northrop manufactures. In 2022, revenues came in at $12,275 million, contributing 33.5% to the company’s total revenues.However, total revenues of $36,602 million in 2022 were adjusted for inter-segment eliminations of up to $2,179 million.Story continuesBottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Northrop Grumman ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in April 2013 would be worth $6,556.23, or a gain of 555.62%, as of April 13, 2023, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 157.54% and gold's return of 23.93% over the same time frame.Analysts are anticipating more upside for NOC.Northrop Grumman ended the fourth quarter on a solid note, with sales and earnings surpassing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. It continues to witness strong demand for its products, driven by programs like F-35, Triton and SABR radar Global Hawk. Solid U.S. budgetary provisions make one confident about a solid contract inflow from Pentagon for it. It also holds a strong solvency position. Its shares have outperformed the industry in the past year. However, a comparative analysis of the stock’s trailing 12-month EV/Sales ratio reflects a relatively gloomy picture. The prolonged impact of COVID-19 may cause extended disruptions in its supply chain. Rising inflation across the United States might also hurt the stock. It expects further impacts related to the conflict in Ukraine and economic sanctions imposed on Russia.The stock has jumped 5.32% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 1 higher, for fiscal 2023; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These submarines boast strategic deterrent capabilities and will replace the current Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine fleet as it reaches the end of its service life.NNS is a major shipbuilding partner in the Columbia-class program, constructing and delivering six module sections per submarine under contract to General Dynamics Electric Boat.The first boat is scheduled to be delivered in 2027, and the construction is scheduled to continue for two decades. The value of the Navy’s program of record is more than $110 billion.Considering the importance and demand for the submarine, HII is well-poised to win several significant awards involving the next-generation submarine in the days ahead, like the latest one. This should substantially benefit the company and boost its revenue generation prospects from the NSS business unit.Growth ProspectsNations are upgrading their defense capabilities to build up strength in their ability to carry out missions efficiently. In this context, the demand for submarines has increased manifold as part of improving undersea warfare competencies. This demand for submarines is likely to fortify in the days ahead.Per Allied Market Research, the global submarine market is expected to witness a CAGR of more than 4% over the 2022-2031 period.

280,f7f725fe-2bf9-3a2c-8e5c-c07008f6ea21,NKE,2023-04-14,Wesco International and Foot Locker have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wesco-international-foot-locker-highlighted-114911654.html,1681386551,STORY,"['FL', 'WCC', 'NKE', 'BP']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – April 13, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Wesco International WCC as the Bull of the Day and Foot Locker, Inc. FL as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on BP plc BP, Shell plc SHEL and TotalEnergies SE TTE.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Wesco International is a global distributor of electrical, industrial, and communications products. Wesco also provides supply chain management and logistics services.The firm posted a stellar 2022 and its outlook continues to improve as it benefits from secular trends such as electrification, cloud computing, and beyond. Wesco boasts many other solid fundamentals and it is sitting at rather attractive entry points on both the technical front and the valuation side. Plus, Wesco in early March declared its inaugural quarterly cash dividend on common stock.Rowing with the Current Wesco's array of products and services help the company cast a wide net, with offerings that help drive forward crucial segments of the economy such as communications &amp; networking, power generation and distribution, electrical and lighting, security, automation, and renewable energy. Wesco beefed up its reach and portfolio when it acquired Anixter in June 2020. Wesco splits its business into three core operating segments: Electrical &amp; Electronic Solutions, Communications &amp; Security Solutions, and Utility &amp; Broadband Solutions.The company is set to benefit for decades to come from the never-ending need for cloud computing and other vital communication services. Wesco is also gaining steam as the U.S. ramps up its spending on renewable energy sources such as solar and battery storage. Solar and battery storage are two of the largest growth areas within all of the broader non-fossil fuel energy segment.Wesco's electric vehicle segment should help it expand for years to come. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation said the number of EVs sold globally soared 60% last year. Plus, EVs still accounted for just 10% of U.S. vehicle sales in December 2022, up from around 2% in 2020.Story continuesSome projections call for EVs to account for upward of 40% of the market by as soon as 2030. With the massive EV expansion and other electrification efforts in the U.S. and beyond comes the need to invest heavily in revamping, updating, and building out the aging power grids.Recent Growth and OutlookWesco boasts roughly 140K customers across over 50 countries. The Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-headquarter firm reportedly holds a roughly 15% share of the U.S. electrical distribution market and it could keep slowly adding to its reach.Wesco grew its revenue by 18% YoY in 2022 to $21.42 billion to help its adjusted earnings soar 65%—on top of 48% revenue in both 2021 and 2020.Better yet, WCC provided upbeat guidance when it reported back in mid-February, with its FY23 consensus earnings estimates up 6% and FY24's figure 13% higher. Plus, its most recent estimate for 2024 is already 8% higher than the current consensus. All of these positive earnings revisions trends help Wesco land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now. These recent revisions are part of a long-term upward revisions trend dating back to 2020.Zacks estimates call for Wesco to follow up this huge stretch of top and bottom line growth with another 7% earnings and revenue growth in 2023 and more growth in 2024.Price Movement, Valuation &amp; MoreWesco stock has soared 3,000% over the past 20 years for a 19% annualized return. This performance blows away the Zacks Tech sector's 490% and the S&amp;P 500's 350%.More recently, WCC took off following its covid lows, with it up 430% in the past three years vs. Tech's 50% and its industry's 135%. Wesco shares have climbed 11% in the last 12 months, while Tech fell 10%.Thankfully, investors can now scoop up Wesco stock around 20% below its March peaks. The selling came after WCC reached heavily overbought RSI levels.WCC is now well under neutral RSI levels (50) at 41. The stock also just recently bounced back above its 200-day moving average. Wesco is also trading 45% below its average Zacks price target at around $139 per share.Wesco's valuation levels are looking super attractive at the moment. WCC is trading at a 40% discount to its 20-year median and a roughly 66% discount to the Zacks Tech sector at just 7.7X forward 12-month earnings.Despite its huge run over the last three years, WCC is trading 30% below its three-year median and 50% under its sector to help showcase its impressive and improving earnings outlook.Wesco has a rather solid balance sheet and it is so confident in its business model despite near-term economic slowdown concerns that it declared on March 3 its first-ever quarterly cash dividend on common shares. The first $0.375 per share dividend was payable on March 31. WCC's current dividend yield sits at 1.1%.Bottom LineWesco is a stable business that's been around since the 1920s that's benefiting from secular tailwinds across various backbones of the entire U.S. and global economy.Cloud computing and networking infrastructure are only growing more integral. It's also worth constantly remembering that the most powerful and richest nations in the world are actively helping fuel the broader renewable and EV expansion, alongside Wall Street titans. And these are just some of the areas that Wesco operates in.Bear of the Day:Foot Locker, Inc. is in the midst of a rather significant overhaul of its business as it tries to adapt for the future. Foot Locker, under the stewardship of CEO Mary Dillon, is trying to move away from malls and its over reliance on Nike, among other initiatives.The footwear retailer expects these efforts will yield long-term results to the detriment of near-term profits. Foot Locker's earnings outlook has tumbled since it released its quarterly results and provided updated guidance on March 2020.Revamping for the Road AheadFoot Locker is a shoe retailer that aims to lead the ""celebration of sneaker and youth culture around the globe."" The company currently has roughly 2,700 stores in around 30 countries that includes its namesake, Kids Foot Locker, Champs Sports, atmos, and WSS. The company has grown within the broader sneaker revolution that's developed alongside the rise of Nike, its Jordan Brand, and other popular and trendy shoemakers.Nike is the most powerful and popular sneaker company in the U.S., even amid a resurgent Adidas and newer challengers. This has helped Foot Locker for years, and Nike has continued to work with Foot Locker even as Nike tries to move away from many other retailers to go at it alone.Foot Locker is actively reshaping its business to move away from its huge dependence on Nike as the footwear and apparel titan moves heavily toward its own direct-to-consumer businesses.Nike is still very important to Foot Locker, and it is doing all it can to have the best relationship possible. Nike had at one point made up 70% of Foot Locker's overall sales. The company hopes for Nike to account for around 60% of sales in the near term, as it builds up its portfolio with New Balance, Puma, and others.Foot Locker's 2022 revenue dipped 2% against a tough-to-compete year. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings fell by around 30%. FL said that it expects its profits to drop by roughly 30% again in 2023 as it spends to prepare for the future. Zacks estimates call for Foot Locker's adjusted earnings to tumble 30% on 4.3% lower revenue. ""We are entering 2023 with a focus on resetting the business – simplifying our operations and investing in our core banners and capabilities to position the Company for growth in 2024 and beyond,"" CEO Mary Dillon said in prepared remarks.Bottom LineFoot Locker's negative earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) right now. FL shares have also been on a rather up-and-down ride in 2023, having surged higher to start the year only to dive lower.Foot Locker shares are up around 6% YTD, but they are still down nearly 40% below their 2021 levels. Some investors might, therefore, want to consider nibbling at the stock. But it might be best to wait and see how Fl's revamp goes. Plus, the stock has dramatically underperformed the market and its industry over the past decade.Additional content:Does the EV Revolution Pose a Serious Threat to the Oil Industry?The rise of electric vehicles (EVs) has been one of the most significant changes in the transportation industry in recent years. As governments worldwide work to reduce carbon emissions, the push towards cleaner energy is gaining momentum, and electric vehicles are becoming an increasingly popular choice among consumers.While EVs still account for a small share of global vehicle sales, they are poised to lead the transportation space in the coming years. This has led some to wonder whether the EV boom poses a serious threat to the oil industry, which has long been the backbone of the global energy market.In this article, we will explore this question in detail, looking at the current state of the EV market, the potential impact on oil demand, and how oil companies may adapt to the changing landscape.The Electric Future Is HereThe growth of the EV industry has been impressive. In 2020, despite the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the global economy, EV sales continued to rise, reaching a record high of 3.24 million units, according to EV-volumes.com. Sales of electric cars doubled in 2021 and rose another 55% in 2022 to hit a record of 10.1 million units.  The International Energy Agency predicts that the number of electric cars on the road could reach more than 300 million by 2030, up from just 16.5 million in 2021.This growth is being driven by several factors, including the increasing availability of affordable EVs, improvements in battery technology, and government incentives to encourage EV adoption. Legacy automakers are revving up their e-mobility game and are setting deadlines to phase out ICE models. Pure-play EV makers are focused on expanding their vehicle lineup.Could the EV Boom Eat Away Oil Demand?The rise of EVs presents a threat to the oil industry as EVs do not require oil as their primary fuel source. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), transportation accounts for around 60% of global oil demand, and the rise of EVs could significantly reduce this demand. Per BloombergNEF estimates, EVs on the roads are displacing 1.5 million barrels of oil demand per day. Electric cars are expected to displace around 2.5 million barrels of oil demand daily by 2025.BNEF estimates that electric and fuel cell vehicles will displace 21 million barrels per day in oil demand by 2050.Some industry watchers and economists view EVs as the archnemesis of the oil industry. For instance, Stanford University economist Tony Seba is of the view that EVs will destroy the global oil industry by 2030. Akshat Rathi from Bloomberg News went on record claiming that ""every F-150 Lightning destroys 50+ barrels of oil demand forever."" In 2016, Bloomberg predicted EVs to trigger a global oil crisis.While there's no denying that rapid EV momentum is set to hurt the oil industry's prospects, things don't look as appalling now as predicted by some analysts and economists. It's also worth noting that the impact on oil demand will vary by region. In countries with a strong renewable energy infrastructure, such as Norway, where EVs already account for major chunk of all new car sales (around 80% in 2022), the shift away from oil will be more rapid. In contrast, in developing countries with limited charging infrastructure and high levels of oil dependency, the transition to EVs may take longer.Having said that, it's certain that EVs will not replace all oil demand. The petrochemical industry uses oil as a feedstock to produce plastics, fertilizers, and other products. Additionally, heavy-duty vehicles, such as trucks and airplanes, are not yet feasible for electrification and continue to rely on oil.How Are Oil Companies Adapting to the Swift EV Transition?The oil industry is already taking steps to adapt to the rise of electric vehicles. Many companies are investing in renewable energy, such as wind and solar power, to diversify their portfolios and reduce their carbon footprints.For instance, BP plc has set a target of becoming a net-zero company by 2050 and plans to invest $5 billion per year in low-carbon energy by 2030.The integrated company intends to invest in and create its renewable energy generation capacity of 20 gigawatts by 2025. In February, it announced plans to invest $1 billion in EV charging stations across the United States by 2030.EV charging is one of BP's five strategic transition growth engines, wherein the company expects to grow investment over the next 10 years.BP currently offers 22,000 EV charge points worldwide and aims for more than 100,000 by 2030, with 90% of those being quick or ultra-fast. BP has also invested $7 million in IoTecha, in sync with its objective to provide more than 70,000 public EV charging points worldwide by 2030.Oil companies are also exploring new business models, such as offering charging infrastructure and battery storage solutions to EV owners. Shell plc, Europe's largest oil company, is investing in a network of fast-charging stations across Europe. Early this year, the company inked a deal to acquire Volta, in a bid to diversify from oil and invest in green energy management. It bought Greenlots — another company involved in EV charging and management — in 2019 and ubitricity — U.K.'s largest EV charging network — in 2021.Shell also has the same ambitious target of becoming a net-zero emissions energy player by 2050 or earlier. By 2030, the integrated energy company plans to lower absolute emissions by 50%.TotalEnergies SE also strives to be a net-zero carbon emission company by 2050 and has taken the necessary steps to achieve the target. TTE plans to add more renewable gross capacity in operation by 2023-end and plans to invest $5 billion to expand the Renewable &amp; Electricity business in 2023. It is partnering with automakers to offer home charging solutions. TotalEnergies' EV charging network in Belgium is praiseworthy.TTE has already won public contracts to install and operate more than 3,500 EV charging stations in Brussels and Antwerp, Belgium. Last September, it received a contract to install and commercially operate 4,400 EV charging points in West Flanders and Flemish Brabant, Belgium, over the next two years.While SHEL carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), BP and TTE are #3 Ranked (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Last WordThe EV revolution does present a threat to the oil industry, as it could lead to a decline in oil demand and prices. However, it is essential to note that oil remains an essential resource for many industries, and EVs are not yet a viable solution for all transportation needs. Oil companies have recognized the need to adapt and are investing in renewable energy sources to diversify their portfolios. As the world continues to shift towards sustainable energy sources, the oil industry's ability to adapt will determine its future success.Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double"" From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come.

(FL)",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bear-day-foot-locker-inc-080008628.html,1681372808,STORY,"['FL', 'NKE']","[Foot Locker, Inc. (FL) is in the midst of a rather significant overhaul of its business as it tries to adapt for the future. Foot Locker, under the stewardship of CEO Mary Dillon, is trying to move away from malls and its over reliance on Nike, among other initiatives.The footwear retailer expects these efforts will yield long-term results to the detriment of near-term profits. Foot Locker’s earnings outlook has tumbled since it released its quarterly results and provided updated guidance on March 2020.Revamping for the Road AheadFoot Locker is a shoe retailer that aims to lead the “celebration of sneaker and youth culture around the globe.” The company currently has roughly 2,700 stores in around 30 countries that includes its namesake, Kids Foot Locker, Champs Sports, atmos, and WSS. The company has grown within the broader sneaker revolution that’s developed alongside the rise of Nike, its Jordan Brand, and other popular and trendy shoemakers. Nike (NKE) is the most powerful and popular sneaker company in the U.S., even amid a resurgent Adidas and newer challengers. This has helped Foot Locker for years, and NKE has continued to work with Foot Locker even as Nike tries to move away from many other retailers to go at it alone.Foot Locker is actively reshaping its business to move away from its huge dependence on Nike as the footwear and apparel titan moves heavily toward its own direct-to-consumer businesses.Nike is still very important to Foot Locker and it is doing all it can to have the best relationship possible with NKE. Nike had at one point made up 70% of Foot Locker’s overall sales. The company hopes for Nike to account for around 60% of sales in the near term, as it builds up its portfolio with New Balance, Puma, and others.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFoot Locker’s 2022 revenue dipped 2% against a tough-to-compete against year. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings fell by around 30%. FL said that it expects its profits to drop by roughly 30% again in 2023 as it spends to prepare for the future.  Story continuesZacks estimates call for Foot Locker’s adjusted earnings to tumble 30% on 4.3% lower revenue. ""We are entering 2023 with a focus on resetting the business – simplifying our operations and investing in our core banners and capabilities to position the Company for growth in 2024 and beyond,” CEO Mary Dillon said in prepared remarks.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineFoot Locker’s negative earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) right now. FL shares have also been on a rather up-and-down ride in 2023, having surged higher to start the year only to dive lower.Foot Locker shares are up around 6% YTD, but they are still down nearly 40% below their 2021 levels. Some investors might, therefore, want to consider nibbling at the stock. But it might be best to wait and see how Fl's revamp goes. Plus, the stock has dramatically underperformed the market and its industry over the past decade.   Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NKE) Worth Betting on Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/most-watched-stock-nike-inc-130001434.html,1681304401,STORY,['NKE'],"[Nike (NKE) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this athletic apparel maker have returned +3.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.5% change. The Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry, to which Nike belongs, has gained 5.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Nike is expected to post earnings of $0.67 per share, indicating a change of -25.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -18.4% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.24 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -13.6%. This estimate has changed +3.5% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.96 indicates a change of +22.5% from what Nike is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.3%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nike is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NKE _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Nike, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $12.58 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +2.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $50.87 billion and $54.2 billion estimates indicate +8.9% and +6.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNike reported revenues of $12.39 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14%. EPS of $0.79 for the same period compares with $0.87 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.41 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +8.55%. The EPS surprise was +51.92%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nike is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nike. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

284,d12c049b-a5bb-3aa1-bcf2-702e167192f7,NKE,2023-04-14,3 Overvalued Blue-Chip Stocks Not Worth Your Green,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-overvalued-blue-chip-stocks-104546314.html,1681209946,STORY,"['MRNA', 'JPM', 'NKE']","[This year, stock markets have experienced growth, although not uniformly. Some stocks are recovering, while others are still declining or stagnating. However, unexpectedly many overvalued blue-chip stocks that have consistently outperformed the market in the past decade are now underperforming.These are well-known companies that people encounter in their everyday lives. Because of various internal and external factors, many of these once-popular stocks have lost their appeal to professional traders and retail investors.The future outlook for several of these stocks appears grim, and investors holding these stocks should sell them immediately.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIf you want to invest money in the stock market, it is best to avoid these overvalued blue-chip stocks for now.MRNAModerna$160.36NKENike$121.32JPMJPMorgan Chase$127.66Moderna (MRNA)red text reads ""moderna"" on a light blue background. there is a bottle of liquid vaccine next to a medical needleSource: diy13 / ShutterstockModerna (NASDAQ:MRNA) was widely lauded during the Covid-19 pandemic for producing one of the first vaccines approved by the FDA.The markets rewarded its innovation with a rally pushing the stock to $450 in September 2021. As the pandemic fades into the background, the momentum is also decreasing. On Friday, shares closed at around $158 a pop, marking a significant decline from its pandemic high.Moderna’s key problem is its pipeline. Its patented mRNA technology has been successfully commercialized through its COVID-19 vaccine, which is the company’s first product of its kind.Unlike competitors such as Johnson &amp; Johnson that have a product portfolio to rely on, Moderna often feels like a one-trick pony.Moderna was highly successful during a global emergency caused by a pandemic that the world hadn’t seen in a century. We shouldn’t assess the company’s future potential based on its performance during this exceptional time.Moderna predicts it will generate $18.4 billion in revenue from COVID-19 vaccine sales for the fiscal year 2022.Story continuesBy 2023, the figure is expected to decrease to roughly $5 billion. Moderna has the potential to earn more revenue if it makes additional agreements. The company won’t come close to the total vaccine sales it achieved in 2022.Apart from its COVID-19 vaccine, Moderna doesn’t have any other approved medications, and it’s projected that vaccine sales will slow down this year. Despite having several new drugs in the pipeline, until they are released to the market, the value of MRNA stock is expected to stay low.Nike (NKE)A stack of red Nike (NKE) shoe boxes.Source: mimohe / Shutterstock.comNike (NYSE:NKE) possesses such a strong brand name you expect it to perform in every situation.However, the sports apparel giant finds itself in unfamiliar waters, up just 1.24% since the start of the year.There are two main reasons for this. The first has to do with Nike’s struggles in China. The multinational announced solid quarterly results, surpassing analysts’ revenue and earnings per share estimates.Nike’s earnings per share of 79 cents beat the average estimate of 55 cents, while its revenue of $12.39 billion exceeded the average outlook of $11.47 billion.However, the company’s sales in China, its third-largest market by revenue, dropped by 8% year-over-year, casting a cloud over an otherwise impressive print.There are signs that Nike is maturing as a business, and younger, leaner competitors are capturing market share.For example, Lululemon Athletica has outperformed its competitor Nike since its IPO in 2007, growing sales by nearly 20% annually over the past decade compared to Nike’s 8.7%.The company has successfully implemented a direct-to-consumer model that has helped increase brick-and-mortar sales by 15% YoY and e-commerce sales by 37%.Lululemon’s grip on distribution has helped maintain a strong hold on its branding, and expansion into international markets has diversified revenue streams.Overall, in my eyes, Nike is not on firm footing right now. The combination of competition and woes in China weighs heavily on the stock right now. That is why it is among the more overvalued blue-chip stocks right now.JPMorgan Chase (JPM)JPMorgan Chase (JPM) lettering on a corporate office in New York City.Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.comJPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is one of the premier banking stocks. However, it is not immune to the current banking crisis that took down two mid-sized US regional banks and the European giant Credit Suisse.JPMorgan Chase is performing well on the bottom line. It has beaten earnings in the last two quarters. Despite this, its stock is down almost 5% in the last month.JPMorgan’s contribution to the banking crisis was limited to arranging a $30 billion bailout for the distressed regional bank First Republic. It seems unfair that the stock is getting punished, but that’s where we are.CEO of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, speaks up about regulation and fintech matters. However, he has been silent since the collapse of SVB Financial and Signature Bank in March.In his recent annual letter to shareholders, Dimon focused on the present state of JPMorgan Chase and the industry. He talked more about the potential response to the crisis rather than dissecting it. He cautioned that the crisis is ongoing and will continue to have consequences for years.These words do not instill a lot of confidence. As a result, for now, JPM remains a risky investment. However, when it reports earnings this week, it can strike its name off this list of overvalued blue-chip stocks. A sizeable earnings beat can solve many problems.On the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not hold (directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This effort is part of Axelera AI's work with Ansys to build its recently released Metis AI platform, a hardware and software platform for computer vision AI inference at the edge. The technology delivers advanced acceleration performance and usability at a fraction of the cost and power consumption of solutions available today.Axelera AI's PCIe AI Edge accelerator card (pictured) is powered by four Metis AIPUs, validated using Ansys simulation software.Logical chip interactions across various power and clock domains have the potential to cause chip failures. Axelera AI needed to validate its Metis AIPU, which contained as many as 100 million gates, or simple switching circuits, along with different clock and power domains responsible for executing operations essential to a digital circuit. These interactions were difficult to analyze using traditional tools and methods, which lacked accuracy, and proved too time consuming and resource intensive. Axelera AI developed a top-down, two-step workflow enabled by Ansys software to understand floorplan quality and IR drop. First, the software was used to prefetch or transfer numerous weaknesses in various integrated circuit schematics that would have delayed the manufacturing process. Next, drop analysis was completed using Ansys simulation to uncover problems impacting chip quality, then to quickly iterate on and execute fixes to minimize unanticipated voltage drops that lead to circuit failure.Story continues""During our analysis, we uncovered serious problems that could affect the quality of our chip design,"" said Giuseppe Garcea, director of silicon and co-founder at Axelera AI. ""Setting up a two-step workflow with Ansys software was straightforward, and initial run times were accomplished on one server. Ultimately, these tools provided the detailed data we needed to quickly identify and iterate on various fixes to floorplan and IR-drop challenges. Ansys gave our team confidence that we could circumvent any design issues that lead to chip failure in the future.""""Demands for edge AI platforms, characterized by massive amounts of data processing and storage, require significant architectural improvements on the chip side,"" said Shane Emswiler, senior vice president of products at Ansys. ""Today's chip designs require complex testing and validation, exerting upward pressure on semiconductor manufacturers to fulfill changing system requirements in a sensitive, cost- and time-performant manner. Ansys simulation software enables comprehensive, competent analysis needed to quickly optimize the power and performance of these chip designs and speed the movement of data critical to AI applications."" / About AnsysWhen visionary companies need to know how their world-changing ideas will perform, they close the gap between design and reality with Ansys simulation.

Stocks forfeited gains following these headlines and steady selling in the major indexes pushed stocks to session lows in early afternoon trade before an afternoon rebound.""These expectations have been seesawing for four consecutive months, alternating between increases and decreases,"" said Joanne Hsu, director for the survey of consumers. ""Uncertainty over short-run inflation expectations continues to be notably elevated, indicating that the recent volatility in expected year-ahead inflation is likely to continue.""Overall, the report showed sentiment was ""essentially unchanged"" in April, as the index stood at 63.5, up from 62 at the end of March. This data came about an hour after Fed Governor Chris Waller reiterated in a speech that inflation remains ""much too high.""Story continuesElsewhere on the economic calendar the monthly report on retail sales showed sales fell 1% in March while industrial production data came in better than expected.""Overall, [retail sales were] not quite as bad as we had expected,"" wrote Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics. ""Thanks to the strong January, first-quarter real consumption growth should be close to 4.5%, with GDP growth at 1.8%, which might be enough to persuade the Fed to hike by a final 25bp in early May.""Banks results shineJPMorgan, the country's largest bank by assets, saw shares rise more than 7% after reporting top- and bottom-line results that surged from the prior year.Deposits, which will be closely tracked by investors this quarter following the failure of three US banks in March, rose 1.5% over the quarter at JPMorgan. Compared to the same period last year, however, deposits fell 7%.In the company's earnings release, CEO Jamie Dimon said, ""the U.S. economy continues to be on generally healthy footings—consumers are still spending and have strong balance sheets, and businesses are in good shape. However, the storm clouds that we have been monitoring for the past year remain on the horizon, and the banking industry turmoil adds to these risks.""Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, arrives for the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee hearing titled Annual Oversight of the Nations Largest Banks, in Hart Building on Thursday, September 22, 2022.

Wells Fargo participated with other banks in pumping $30 billion in deposits into First Republic Bank in a so far successful effort to prevent a third failure.Wells said Friday that it earned $5 billion, or $1.23 per share, in the three months ended March 31, beating analyst projections by 10 cents a share. Revenue of $20.7 billion topped Wall Street's target of $20.1 billion, a 17% increase.Wells' profit rose 32% from last year, when the San Francisco-based bank posted net earnings of $3.8 billion, or 91 cents per share.Wells, which until recently was the U.S.'s biggest mortgage lender, set aside $643 million for potential loan losses, specifically commercial real estate loans, credit cards and auto loans.The bank has said it plans to drastically reduce its mortgage lending business. Higher interest rates have chilled the housing market, and Wells said home lending was down 42% from the same quarter last year.Wells had $13.3 billion in net interest income in the period, slightly less than last quarter’s $13.4 billion, but well ahead of the $9.3 billion from the same period a year ago. Wells reaffirmed guidance for full-year net interest income, which it projects to be about 10% higher than 2022's $45 billion.Credit card revenue was up 3% to $1.3 billion in the period while personal lending rose 9% to $318 million.Like other banks, Wells has benefitted from the Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate hikes as the central bank tries to tamp down the highest inflation in four decades. Fed officials have signaled that they may raise the central bank’s main borrowing rate another quarter point this year which would bring it slightly above 5%.Wells is still trying to exit the strict federal guidelines imposed in 2018 that sets its asset cap at just under $2 billion after a series of scandals, including the uncovering of millions of fake checking accounts its employees opened to meet sales quotas. That order was expected to last only a year or two, but additional improprieties have surfaced and regulators have been skeptical about the bank’s efforts to clean up its act.Shares of Wells Fargo rose 2.5% in premarket trading.]"

That helped counter a surge in provisions for souring loans, leaving profit to top analysts’ estimates.Wells Fargo and peers JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Citigroup Inc. are kicking off big bank earnings Friday, offering a first look at how lenders fared through a tumultuous quarter in which three smaller banks collapsed. PNC Financial Services Group Inc. also reported Friday, the first results for regional firms.All four of those companies were part of a group of 11 banks that helped shore up ailing First Republic Bank with a combined $30 billion deposit infusion as it faced panic in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank’s failure. Wells Fargo contributed $5 billion to the effort, which involves each firm parking money at First Republic for at least 120 days.“We are glad to have been in a strong position to help support the US financial system during the recent events that impacted the banking industry,” Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf said in the statement. “Regional and community banks are an important part of our financial system and are uniquely positioned to serve their customers and communities.”The San Francisco-based company left full-year guidance for both net interest income and non-interest expenses unchanged.Wells Fargo shares rose 1.1% to $40.10 at 9:55 a.m. in New York. They’ve dropped 2.9% this year.Story continuesThe firm added $643 million to its pile of money set aside for potentially soured loans, signaling a worsened economic outlook. Net charge-offs jumped 17% compared to a year ago, bringing total provisions to $1.2 billion, topping the $919 million average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.The increase in reserves was primarily tied to the firm’s office loans inside its commercial real estate portfolio, Wells Fargo said. It also added reserves for credit-card and auto loans in the quarter.In recent months, investors have become increasingly worried about commercial real estate credit quality, with large swaths of offices sitting empty in major metropolitan areas across the country in the aftermath of the pandemic. Wells Fargo said that roughly 12% of its office loan portfolio is owner-occupied, and nearly one-third have recourse to a guarantor.The company reported an 8% drop in firmwide deposits, noting the the decline was fueled by customers migrating to higher-yielding alternatives and an increase in consumer spending. Average deposit costs soared to 83 basis points compared with just 3 basis points a year ago.Expenses, a key focus of Scharf’s turnaround effort, totaled $13.7 billion, slightly higher than analysts expected. That helped bring Wells Fargo’s efficiency ratio, a measure of profitability, to 66%.Wells Fargo remains under a Federal Reserve-imposed asset cap limiting the size to an end-of-2017 level.

Its revenue of $38.3 billion was up 25% from the year-ago period. Wells Fargo (WFC) earned $5 billion, Citigroup earned (C) $4.6 billion, and PNC (PNC) earned $1.7 billion.The results kicked off a closely-watched earnings season for the nation’s biggest banks. Banks of all sizes will be scrambling over the coming weeks to show investors how they are better positioned than rivals to weather any future turmoil.JPMorgan shares rose 7.5% Friday following the earnings release. Citi rose 4.8%. Wells Fargo and PNC were down slightly during the day but closed flat.The giants of the industry weren’t totally immune from the chaos surrounding the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Deposits at JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and PNC fell by 7%, 8% and 3% from a year ago, while Citigroup was roughly flat. JPMorgan and PNC deposits did rise slightly, however, compared with the fourth quarter of 2022.Even before the turmoil in March, lenders big and small had been losing depositors to money market funds that were willing to offer higher yields as the Federal Reserve boosted interest rates. The outflow of deposits from all of the nation’s banks reached nearly $500 billion last month through March 29, according to recent Fed data. JPMorgan CFO Jeremy Barnum told reporters Friday that the bank took in $50 billion in deposits last month as some customers moved their money from regional lenders.Banks like JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, because of their size and diversity of their businesses, are better positioned than smaller rivals to weather such periods of uncertainty. Regulators also require them to maintain greater buffers to absorb losses and demonstrate that it has enough liquidity to withstand unexpected economic turmoil.Story continuesThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The rise in interest rates over the past year also benefitted some of these large banks, including JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, because it allowed them to charge more for their loans. JPMorgan's net interest income was up 48% compared to the year-ago quarter, and it raised its net interest income expectation for all of 2023 to $81 billion.But those figures could drop going forward. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in a call with reporters that net interest income ""will come down significantly next year and I think that's a more important statement than what it is for this year.""Total loans were also up at JPMorgan, as well as for Wells Fargo and PNC. They were down slightly at Citigroup.Investors are looking for any signs that banks are making fewer new loans, which would affect the larger economy by reducing the flow of credit to businesses and consumers. Lending across the industry fell by nearly $105 billion during the two weeks ending March 29, according to the Fed, due mostly to a pullback by smaller institutions.One lending business has clearly slowed at JPMorgan: mortgages. There is not as much demand for new borrowings now that interest rates are much higher than they were a year ago. Home lending revenue was down 38%.JPMorgan CFO Jeremy Barnum told reporters Friday that he isn't anticipating the bank will get more conservative on lending. ""We didn't loosen underwriting standards when numbers were really good during the pandemic and we don't see ourselves particularly tightening them now,"" he said.FILE - JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon testifies at a Senate Banking Committee hearing in 2022. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File)JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, however, are both preparing for the possibility that credit conditions could worsen. JPMorgan increased its provision for credit losses by 56% compared to a year ago, a sign that it expects more debt to go bad as the economy slows. Higher provisions at Wells included a $643 million increase in the allowance for credit losses on commercial real estate loans, as well as an increase for credit card and auto loans.The current challenge faced by the banking industry, Dimon said in a release, “is distinct” from the 2008 financial crisis “as it has involved far fewer financial players and fewer issues that need to be resolved, but financial conditions will likely tighten as lenders become more conservative, and we do not know if this will slow consumer spending.”His CFO told reporters that ""it seems to me that the system as a whole is in very good shape.

(PFE) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizer-inc-pfe-trending-stock-130001734.html,1681390801,STORY,['PFE'],"[Pfizer (PFE) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this drugmaker have returned +2.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.1% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Pfizer belongs, has gained 11.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Pfizer is expected to post earnings of $0.98 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -39.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $3.48 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -47.1%. This estimate has changed -1.1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.78 indicates a change of +8.6% from what Pfizer is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.8%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Pfizer.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PFE _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Pfizer, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $17.25 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -32.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $68.54 billion and $69.57 billion estimates indicate -31.7% and +1.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPfizer reported revenues of $24.29 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.9%. EPS of $1.14 for the same period compares with $1.08 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.2 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.36%. The EPS surprise was +10.68%.Over the last four quarters, Pfizer surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Pfizer is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Pfizer. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The trial is one of the most closely watched U.S. defamation cases in years, involving a leading cable news outlet with numerous conservative commentators.Davis said he has ""more than enough jurors"" but will make his final selections on Monday before opening statements. The court will not be in session on Friday.Dominion sued Fox Corp and Fox News in 2021, accusing them of ruining its reputation by broadcasting false claims by Republican former President Donald Trump and his lawyers that the Denver-based company's voting machines were used to rig the outcome of the election against him and in favor of Democrat Joe Biden.The trial is considered a test of whether Fox's coverage crossed the line between ethical journalism and the pursuit of ratings, as Dominion alleges and Fox denies. Fox had argued that coverage of the vote-rigging claims was inherently newsworthy and protected by the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment guarantee of press freedom. Davis rejected that argument.The primary question for jurors will be whether Fox knowingly spread false information or recklessly disregarded the truth, the standard of ""actual malice"" Dominion must show to prevail in a defamation case.The jurors are being drawn from Delaware's New Castle County, where Democrats outnumber Republicans more than two-to-one, according to the state's Department of Elections.

This evidence included recordings made by a former Fox employee, Abby Grossberg, who is suing the network.Davis said he would also very likely tap an outside investigator to look into Fox's late disclosure of the evidence and take whatever steps necessary to remedy the situation, which the judge described as troubling.A Fox spokesperson said in a statement on Wednesday: ""As counsel explained to the court, Fox produced the supplemental information from Ms. Grossberg when we first learned it.""(Reporting by Helen Coster in New York; Additional reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware; Editing by Will Dunham, Noeleen Walder, Aurora Ellis and Cynthia Osterman)]"

Democratic President Joe Biden represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate from 1973 until 2009.Fox News and its conservative commentators were generally supportive of Trump during his presidency.The county’s political composition is likely to “make the defense nervous, but left-leaning people also tend to be in favor of freedom of the press,” said Melissa Gomez, president of MMG Jury Consulting.In Delaware, attorneys are not allowed to speak directly with potential jurors. Instead, Superior Court Judge Eric Davis -- who is presiding over the case -- will question them behind closed doors, using questions both sides have agreed to, including whether potential jurors have ever ""worked in a newsroom"" and whether “they regularly watch any Fox News programs.”Story continuesIf a prospective juror responds “yes,"" Davis may ask follow-up questions.After the judge identifies 36 potential jurors, they will be brought to the court room and each side's attorneys will have six ""peremptory strikes,"" in which they can dismiss a potential juror without giving a reason for doing so.The streamlined process allows for jury selection to happen more quickly than it does in some other states: Davis has allotted two days.But it also means both sides will have a harder time trying to identify prospective jurors’ political views, which could be relevant in this case, said Gomez.“If you have a juror who believes that the election was stolen, it will influence their position,” said Gomez. “Will the facts of the case actually matter to them if they have that underlying belief?”The questions are limited to prospective jurors’ experience rather than their attitudes.Questions that capture prospective jurors’ attitudes are more likely to predict how a juror will lean in the case, according to Christina Marinakis, a jury consulting and strategy advisor at IMS Consulting and Expert Services.“So you're sort of shooting blind when it comes to jury selection,” Marinakis said.Davis on Wednesday sanctioned Fox News, handing Dominion a fresh chance to gather evidence after Fox withheld records until the eve of trial, according to a source who is familiar with the case and was present during Wednesday's court hearing.Davis said he would also very likely tap an outside investigator to probe Fox's late disclosure of the evidence and take whatever steps necessary to remedy the situation, which he described as troubling, the source said.

But now the former president has come roaring back at the popular network for conservative viewers, most notably since his indictment in New York on hush-money charges.The Trump revival was on display Tuesday night, when Tucker Carlson devoted his entire prime-time program to a “historic interview” with him, promising more excerpts on Wednesday. It was two weeks after Sean Hannity similarly gave Trump extensive airtime.Left unmentioned were Carlson's two-year-old private text message s, revealed in a defamation case against the network, in which he disparaged Trump and talked eagerly of putting the former president behind him. In one of the exchanges, from Jan. 4, 2021, Carlson wrote that “we are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights” and “I truly can’t wait.”Trump’s return reverses what some had been calling a “soft ban” by Fox News, which had no on-air interviews with him between Sept. 22, 2022, and Hannity on March 27.“The short answer is, they need each other,” said Jane Hall, a journalism professor at American University and author of “Politics and the Media: Intersections and New Directions.”“He's getting attention, he's getting ratings, and cable news needs it because they've been down,” Hall said.Records released as part of Dominion Voting Systems $1.6 billion defamation case against the network and its parent company, Fox Corp., show that Fox repeatedly aired false allegations about the 2020 presidential elections as part of a bid to win back viewers angered that the network had called Arizona for Joe Biden on election night. The lawsuit also revealed how Fox executives and many of its star hosts, including Carlson, didn't believe those claims but aired them anyway.The judge presiding over that case said Wednesday he was inclined to order an independent review to determine whether the network had improperly withheld evidenceStory continuesA week ago, Fox News Channel carried in full Trump's speech from Mar-a-Lago on the day he was indicted by a Manhattan grand jury on charges that he falsified business records to conceal payments made ahead of the 2016 election to silence a porn star who says she and Trump had an extramarital sexual encounter years earlier; Trump denies the two had sex.The speech reached 6.7 million viewers, or about double the typical audience Carlson generally receives at the same time, the Nielsen company said.Fox says Trump's return is because of the news, not ratings. The Hannity interview was billed as Trump's first after his indictment, Carlson's the first after his arraignment, when the former president pleaded not guilty to the charges. Fox personalities and commentators leapt to his defense when news of the grand jury indictment came out.Trump's higher profile also coincides with his growing strength in polls of Republican voters, according to the network.While Fox News continues as the top-rated cable network, its prime-time viewership was down 18 percent in the first three months of the year, compared to 2022. CNN was down 34 percent in the same measurement and MSNBC was down 8 percent, Nielsen said.“They're in the business of fan service and right now conservative politics is all the Trump show,” said Charlie Sykes, a conservative and founder of the Bulwark website. “If the show is back in town, Fox can either try to counterprogram or buy into it. Right now, what is the counterprogramming?”Trump's return “was always inevitable,” said Sykes, also an MSNBC contributor. “They can't quit him. Fox knows what its audience wants and what its audience will accept.”If Fox wasn't quitting Trump, it surely had been pulling back.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, viewed as Trump's chief GOP rival, has made 12 appearances on Fox News this year — but none since March 13, according to the liberal advocacy group Media Matters for America, which monitors Fox.March 5-11 was the first week this year where the name “DeSantis” received more mentions (177) than “Trump” (142) on Fox, Media Matters said. Others recognized Trump's potency for their viewers as well: The same week, Trump was mentioned 925 times on MSNBC, compared to 268 for DeSantis.Back on Jan. 8, 2021, two days after the U.S. Capitol insurrection, Fox News founder Rupert Murdoch wrote in an email to a former Fox executive that the network was pivoting.“We want to make Trump a non-person,” Murdoch wrote, according to documents revealed as part of an elections technology company's defamation lawsuit against Fox.The trend away from Trump accelerated following the midterm elections when candidates he supported did more poorly than he expected. When he announced in November he was running again for president, Fox didn't carry his speech in full.Other Murdoch-controlled media properties were even harsher: The New York Post headlined its story: “Florida man makes announcement.” Following the midterms, a Wall Street Journal editorial was headlined, “Trump is the Republican Party's biggest loser.”Yet, as spring neared, Fox warmed again to the former president. The network carried Trump's entire 90-minute speech to the Conservative Political Action Committee live on the network March 4.Tuesday night, understandably, Carlson didn't talk about his critical texts and emails directed at Trump following the 2020 election, as seen in court papers related to the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit. Back in January 2021, when Carlson said his show was close to being able to ignore Trump most nights. he wrote, “I hate him passionately.""Carlson said in an interview with WABC radio last month that a wounded Trump had called him, seeking an explanation after the text messages became public. Carlson said he'd been angry about election information passed on by Trump's team that proved false.He told the radio station that he found Trump “funny and insightful” and that he spent four years on the air defending his policies.___More on Donald Trump-related investigations: https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump]"

Fox could face sanctions if it’s found to have withheld or destroyed relevant documents.The ruling is another blow to Fox’s efforts to defend itself against Dominion’s claims that the network’s bogus assertions that its voting machines were rigged to propel Joe Biden to victory in the 2020 election damaged its reputation to the tune of $1.6 billion. The Denver-based company says it’s still receiving threats from the network’s backers who believe the claims.Dominion’s lawyers say one issue is Fox’s failure to turn over files showing Murdoch, the founder of Fox Corp., also held the executive chairman title at Fox News. That miscue harmed the voting-machine maker’s efforts to put together its defamation case, its lawyers said.Murdoch’s network title had been publicly available for years in the company’s US Securities and Exchange Commission filings and Dominion lawyers used those filings in his pre-trial deposition, Fox News lawyers responded. “I don’t think they were prejudiced” by the network’s late handover of the names of all the network’s officers and directors, said Dan Webb, one of Fox’s lawyers.Story continuesDominion also pointed to the tardy handover of secret recordings of Fox commentators, including Trump lawyers Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani, made by a now-fired producer for Fox host Maria Bartiromo’s show as another example of evidence that was mishandled.Attorneys for the manufacturer played a snippet of one of the recordings, in which Bartiromo asks Giuliani if it were true that former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had a financial interest in Dominion. That’s one of the false statements at issue in the case, Davis noted during the hearing.“I read that, but I can’t prove that,” Giuliani responded.Dominion said statements like Giuliani’s may bolster its case that Fox guests knew such conspiracy theories involving the voting-machine maker was false, but continued to make them on air anyway.Fox’s lawyers said they didn’t learn about the recordings until recently and moved to quickly turn them over to Dominion. They said Abby Grossberg – the producer who is now suing Fox for intimidation – didn’t indicate she’d made the recordings until recently.Davis refused Dominion’s request to split the trial into two separate proceedings — against Fox Corp. and Fox News — over the alleged document mishandling. But the judge said he’d consider punishing the network by telling jurors they botched the handover of files once the so-called special master probing the issue issues a report.The judge is going through a list of pre-trial issues to set the stage for the six-week trial, which is scheduled to start Thursday with jury selection. Opening arguments are scheduled for April 17.The defamation case is Dominion Voting Systems v.

Recession fears have added to the woes (read: Forget Recession Fears, Invest in These Safe ETFs).The first-quarter 2023 earnings season will kick off this week, with the banking sector slated to report numbers. The picture of the earnings season seems bleak, given that the companies are struggling with a host of challenges, including inflation, rising interest rates and concerns about the health of the financial system in the wake of the two biggest bank failures since the 2008 financial crisis.Total S&amp;P 500 earnings are expected to be down 10% from the same period last year on 1.8% higher revenues, per the latest Earnings Trends.

We had producer prices falling this morning. People still digesting the Fed minutes from yesterday. So let's see how it all shakes out as trading begins here this morning. There you see FS Investments ringing the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange here this morning.And when you have the Fed saying that, yes, there could, indeed, be a recession, on the flip side, when you have producer prices that came in with declines, and which is quite interesting here in this environment, even as consumer prices continue to rise, but does suggest that some of those input costs for companies are mitigating. PPI final demand down 1/2% month-over-month, excluding food and energy down a tenth of 1%. So that's seeming to be maybe a positive for stocks, perhaps, as we see all three major averages in the green for now. Not runaway gains, Brad, but still, a little bit green.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, a little bit of green here on the day. As we're taking a look at the Dow Jones Industrial Average, you're seeing that up by about 1/10 of a percent to kick things off, adds on to the net gains that we've seen over the course of this week. We are up over the past four days by about 6/10 of a percent.NASDAQ composite up 6/10 of a percent out of the gate here today. However, over the past four days, net lower, as we've seen some sputtering in the tech sector over the course of this week. As of right now for the aggregate. It's down by about 7/10 of a percent over the course of this week.The S&amp;P 500, you're seeing that just about as flat as it gets, barely to the downside for this week. However, here today out of the gate, higher by about 3/10 of a percent. Also want to take a look further at the S&amp;P 500, dig into some of that sector activity here. 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors, we've got them pulled up on the screen for you here.Story continuesUtilities is the laggard right now by about 7/10 of a percent, the largest laggard, as we are relatively split, about as split as you can get for 11 sectors there. But, ultimately, communication services, you're seeing that move higher by about 1% out of the gate this morning. Also interesting activity that you're seeing in consumer discretionary. That's up by about 8/10 of a percent as well.Also, just want to take a brief look at the NASDAQ 100. We'll give you a glimpse at some of the megacap tech stocks after we got that Amazon annual letter, the CEO letter from Andy Jassy this morning. You're seeing shares higher there by about 1.4% for AMZN. Also taking a look at some of those other megacap tech stocks, you've got Apple up 1%, Microsoft higher, but just by about 1/10 of a percent, Alphabet, AlphaGoogle, Google, whatever you're calling them, I'm calling them up by about 1 and 3/4% as well.And then additionally here, just want to zoom out and take a look at the Dow 30 components here and largely in positive territory. But you still do have some laggards in the form of, interesting, big blue pulling up the caboose-- I tried to make it work. It's down by about 1.2% right now.- Yeah, there was a report from ""The Wall Street Journal"" that IBM is looking to sell it perhaps its weather business, could be worth as much as a billion dollars.

According to people familiar with the proceedings, the transaction is likely to generate about $1 billion in sale proceeds if consummated.In 2015, IBM acquired The Weather Company to leverage its own cloud infrastructure to provide accurate weather forecasts around the globe that aggregate more than 25 billion forecasts a day. The company expected to profit from the wave of data-crunching software by improving the Weather Company’s modeling technology and developing a new generation of predictive applications for incremental revenues.However, over a period of time, IBM has streamlined its operations in order to focus on its core hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence businesses. It has spun off its legacy Managed Infrastructure Services business in a bid to accelerate its hybrid cloud growth strategy, with a focus on enabling clients with accelerated digital transformation. It has further restructured its segments post the separation of its managed infrastructure services business from Kyndryl.IBM expects growth to be driven primarily by analytics, cloud computing and security services. A better business mix, improving operating leverage through productivity gains and increased investments in growth opportunities will likely drive its profitability.The company has expanded its partner relationships in AI, network automation and security to help the telecommunications industry evolve as 5G and Edge Computing take center stage. It has extended the secured cloud services for business enterprises while improving their performance through reduced latency and higher data security features.In addition, the acquisition of Red Hat has bolstered the Open Hybrid architecture initiative of the company. The deal marks IBM’s largest acquisition ever, and the combined company is likely to alter the dynamics of “the cloud market for business.” Specifically, IBM hopes to leverage Red Hat to help it become the world’s largest hybrid cloud platform provider.More than 4,000 clients are utilizing Red Hat and IBM’s hybrid cloud platform. We remain bullish regarding improving the utility of hybrid cloud services based on the architecture built by IBM and Red Hat by notable clients, including American Express, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone, Banco Sabadell, Broadridge Financial Solutions and Caixa Bank. Red Hat’s expanding foothold across the Asia Pacific is also anticipated to bolster IBM’s TAM (total addressable market).The stock has gained 1.5% over the past year against the industry’s decline of 7.7%.

So, you know, since the Dodd-Frank legislation after '08, we've lost over 10% in the banks of the United States. So we've had this slow, grinding whittling away of banks in the United States. I think we're more acutely aware of what's going on now because we've seen larger banks, much larger banks run into financial trouble, and we've seen larger banks go out of business.I don't think we have seen the end of this banking situation. I won't call it a crisis because I don't feel like we're in a crisis, but we're in a situation where banks were sort of flooded with deposits during COVID, flooded with deposits during the crisis. A lot of it was government stimulation. A lot of it was people just had money coming in. There was no way for people to spend money because there was no consumptive ability except for things that could be delivered to your house or you could buy at the grocery store. So your ability to consume money was fairly low, which meant there was no loan demand for banks.So banks were seeing deposits come in on one side, and they were seeing nothing going out on the asset side. They weren't able to lend money to people because people didn't need to borrow money. So all of a sudden they were in this position where they had huge excess reserves, and the natural thing to do was to go out and buy some interest-bearing, low-risk asset. The most unique low-risk asset in the United States is the US Treasury.Story continuesThen we saw this massive move in interest rates, you know, up close to 500 basis points. So it's virtually impossible that banks don't have big mark-to-market losses on their balance sheet. We know that they all have big mark-to-market losses. Now, some of the bigger banks run those through their year-end stress-test calculations. Some of the smaller banks don't. But we're getting more and more transparency to what banks' tier one capital looks like on a mark-to-market basis with their hedges, and we're not through to the other side of this.So nothing has changed in the banking sector from where we were six weeks ago except we understand what happened at Silicon Valley Bank. We understand what happened at Signature Bank. We understand the mark-to-market losses in the available-for-sale and the hold-to-maturity buckets.I think all the banks are going to talk about the excess liquidity they have. I think many of the banks will talk about their insured to uninsured deposit ratio. I think they'll talk about their mark-to-market losses that are disclosed and nondisclosed in their hedging books and what the asset side of their balance sheet looks like. I think banks will go out of their way to give you more disclosure on what their portfolio looks like at this time because I do think that is a good prophylactic.If you're trying to fight the knee-jerk reaction in Washington-- which is just something bad happened. Let's go regulate. Show that the US banking system as a whole is very, very well managed. It went into this whole scenario very well capitalized, and I think the bigger banks are going to go out of their way to show you how well capitalized they are.]"

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. Check out our latest analysis for Marathon Petroleum Marathon Petroleum's Improving ProfitsInvestors and investment funds chase profits, and that means share prices tend rise with positive earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So for many budding investors, improving EPS is considered a good sign. It is awe-striking that Marathon Petroleum's EPS went from US$2.03 to US$32.69 in just one year. While it's difficult to sustain growth at that level, it bodes well for the company's outlook for the future. But the key is discerning whether something profound has changed, or if this is a just a one-off boost.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. The good news is that Marathon Petroleum is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 8.0 percentage points to 11%, over the last year. That's great to see, on both counts.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Marathon Petroleum's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Story continuesAre Marathon Petroleum Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Marathon Petroleum, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Holding US$93m worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. This would indicate that the goals of shareholders and management are one and the same.Should You Add Marathon Petroleum To Your Watchlist?Marathon Petroleum's earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. This level of EPS growth does wonders for attracting investment, and the large insider investment in the company is just the cherry on top. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching Marathon Petroleum very closely. We should say that we've discovered 2 warning signs for Marathon Petroleum (1 can't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing here.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Undervalued Energy Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.""It's Obviously A Positive For The Energy Sector""On April 2, OPEC+ announced an oil production cut of 1.16 million bpd, bringing aggregate cuts to 3.66 million bpd which is approximately 3.7% of global demand, according to Reuters. Shortly after the announcement, Hightower Advisors chief investment strategist, Stephanie Link, appeared in an interview on CNBC to discuss this development in the energy sector and what it means for energy stocks. Stephanie Link thinks that ""it's obviously a positive for the energy sector"" as companies in the space will be able to generate more free cash flow and drive shareholder returns through buybacks and dividends, as oil prices rise. However, Link thinks that it could be negative for consumers if oil prices rise, and the Fed might remain hawkish on inflation. She also noted that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve's record low levels are a concern and something needed to be addressed.Stephanie Link discussed her investment strategy for the quarter, stating that she was overweight in oil stocks and owned Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB), and Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG). Link said that Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is a ""high-quality"" and ""diversified"" company that pays decent dividends. Link called Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) a ""wonderful technology company"". She believes that these companies are trading at attractive P/E ratios and generating abundant free cash flow. As of April 5, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is trading at a PE multiple of 9x and is offering a forward dividend yield of 3.60%. Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) is trading at a PE multiple of 20x, as of April 5, and is offering a forward dividend yield of 1.97%.Story continuesStephanie Link also shared her views regarding the outperformance of technology in the first quarter of 2023. Link suggests investors to opt for a more ""balanced approach"" in 2023. Here are some comments from Link:""(technology) it was really more of a macro call. Why they have outperformed is because rates have come down in the first quarter, inflation has started to come down, you've had a flight to safety because of the bank scare, and then also a bit of mean reversion. If you think about it growth, year-to-date, has outperformed value by 12%. But last year, value outperformed growth by 20%. So there was some mean reversion in the first quarter this year as well.""Stephanie Link noted that there are ""great stories and great total addressable markets"" within the tech sector and as tech companies are cutting costs, they are improving their ability to generate cash flow and improve margins. However, she thinks the tech sector has ""moved really far really fast"".Overall, Stephanie Link is bullish on the energy sector and believes that investors should have a balanced portfolio. Some other sectors she likes include industrials, aerospace, agriculture, and China reopening names. Link suggested that consumer spending would continue to rise, mainly focused on services, and there are opportunities for investors within the market to diversify and balance their portfolios.We have compiled a list of the best undervalued energy stocks to buy now according to analysts, which include Diamondback Energy, Inc.

Of those, Harris Associates was the leading shareholder in the company and held a position worth $792 million.Artisan Partners made the following comment about EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Our top three contributors for the full year were two energy holdings—Schlumberger and EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG)—and health care company Merck. EOG is a US shale-focused E&amp;P company. The current supportive commodity price environment and EOG’s continuing to deliver on its production goals and capex plans have led investors to bid up shares. Its commitment to return excess capital to shareholders via regular and special dividends is also highly appealing, particularly in a period of rising interest rates. The company has proven its ability to create economic value for shareholders, even over the past decade that included the toughest energy commodity environment of the last 30+ years. The company’s strong balance sheet enabled it to increase production capabilities during the downturn. EOG has a low-cost production position with a strong reserve base, giving it an advantage versus peers. Further, EOG’s management focuses on return on invested capital and cash flow generation, distinguishing it from most of the company’s competitors who prioritize growth over profitability.”10.

Given the long-life nature of its oil sand assets and its low cost of production, we estimate Cenovus is free cash flow break-even at an oil price of ~US$40/bbl. Despite the recent fall, oil prices remain more than double this break-even point, implying considerable free cash flow generation potential for the company at current levels, with Cenovus currently trading on a consensus FY22 free cash flow yield of around 20%.

326,f1cd5dc4-8064-354c-a058-4becaaa0397a,MPC,2023-04-14,Why It's Good to Be an Oil Refiner This Earnings Season,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-good-oil-refiner-earnings-140702978.html,1681308422,STORY,"['MPC', 'CL=F', 'CVI', 'VLO']","[As the energy sector undergoes a significant shift toward renewable energy sources, it's important to keep a tab on the performance of traditional energy sources. According to Bank of America’s recent outlook for the energy sector, the oil refining industry is in a “golden age”, with analysts predicting the best Q1 results ever for U.S. oil refiners. This is excellent news for companies in the sector like Marathon Petroleum MPC, CVR Energy CVI, and Valero Energy VLO. Before getting into the stocks, it's essential to understand what's driving this trend.Key Factors Behind Refiners’ Profit SurgeAt first glance, it may seem counterintuitive that the oil refining industry is doing so well. After all, the world is moving toward renewable energy and oil is widely considered a non-renewable resource. However, there are several factors at play here that are driving the industry's growth.One of the most significant factors driving the oil refining industry's growth is the current demand for gasoline. The pandemic led to a significant drop in gasoline demand in 2020, but this year, demand has rebounded significantly, thanks to the return of normal economic activity. This rebound in demand has led to higher prices for gasoline, which has helped boost oil refiners’ profits.Another factor driving the industry's growth is the current state of the global oil market. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has been limiting oil production to help support prices. Additionally, the recent cold snap in Texas, which is a significant producer of oil, caused significant disruptions to the industry, further driving up prices.The ""Golden Age"" of RefiningAs mentioned in a Bank of America report, the refining industry is currently experiencing a ""golden age."" This can be attributed to several factors, including increased demand for refined petroleum products, low crude oil prices and improvements in refining technology.Story continuesAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the refining industry has seen steady growth over the past decade, with 2022 seeing record-high levels of petroleum product demand. This trend is expected to continue in 2023, with experts projecting a 3.5% increase in demand for gasoline alone.Furthermore, advancements in refining technology have allowed companies to process heavier crude oils, resulting in higher yields of valuable products such as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. This has enabled refiners to maintain profitability despite low crude oil prices.The Impact of Environmental RegulationsWhile the refining industry is experiencing a period of growth, it is not without its challenges. Environmental regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, particularly with regard to greenhouse gas emissions.In response, refiners are investing heavily in technologies that reduce emissions, such as carbon capture and storage and hydrogen production. While these technologies are still in the early stages of development, they have shown promise in reducing the environmental impact of the industry.The Role of Refiners in the Energy SectorAs the Bank of America report noted, oil refiners are leading the energy sector outlook for Q1 2023. This is due in part to the industry's resilience in the face of low crude oil prices as well as increased demand for refined petroleum products.In addition, refiners are playing a key role in the transition to cleaner energy sources. Many companies are investing in renewable fuels such as biofuels and hydrogen as well as CCS technologies. By embracing these technologies, refiners are positioning themselves as key players in the energy transition.Solid Industry RankThe Zacks Oil and Gas – Refining and Marketing is a 16-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #37, which places it in the top 15% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bullish near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Which Companies Will Gain the Most?A company that is enjoying the benefits of the robust refining environment is CVR Energy.

In addition, the company has undertaken several initiatives aimed at reducing its cost of operations, such as increasing its focus on high-margin products, reducing its headcount and improving its energy efficiency. As a result, CVR is expected to report strong Q1 results, with its share price already reflecting the expected good news.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of 98 cents per share.

328,4ca32e04-e6f3-448e-92bf-dc2705eaf361,GM,2023-04-14,Biden’s gift to Elon Musk and Tesla,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bidens-gift-to-elon-musk-and-tesla-195528708.html,1681415728,STORY,"['TSLA', 'F', 'GM']","[Tesla CEO Elon Musk leans Republican, and he’s no friend of Joe Biden. But President Biden and his fellow Democrats have done Musk and his company a favor no Republican would likely consider.Biden’s new rules for tailpipe emissions, which the Environmental Protection Agency proposed on April 12, would sharply limit the pollution cars are allowed to emit for model years 2027 through 2032. If ultimately adopted, in whole or in part, the new rules would effectively force automakers to build far more electric vehicles and far fewer gasoline-powered ones.That could cause upheaval at many automakers trying to shift from gas-powered cars to electrics at a measured pace that doesn’t wreck their profitability. For Tesla, (TSLA) however, it will be business as usual—except that the competition could end up hobbled by massive new costs, plus the stumbles that often attend large corporate transformations. That makes Tesla the single-biggest beneficiary of the EPA’s new effort to slash auto-related emissions.Ironies abound. Musk and Biden have feuded over labor unions, which Biden considers a key constituency and Musk loathes. When highlighting the rollout of EVs, Biden typically touts new efforts at Ford (F) and General Motors, (GM) which are unionized, while ignoring Tesla, which is not. Yet Tesla is the undisputed leader in EV sales in the United States, with 65% of the US EV market and vastly more sales in the category than Ford, GM or any other automaker.Musk got so irritated by Biden’s dismissiveness that in January 2022 he called Biden a “damp sock puppet” on Twitter. Later that year, Musk said he had a “super bad feeling” about the economy, and at a Biden press conference a reporter asked Biden for his response. “Lots of luck on his trip to the moon,” Biden quipped, referring to Musk’s hopes for space travel on one of his Space X rockets. Musk continued to tweak Biden on Twitter, and right before the midterm elections last year, Musk advised his 134 million Twitter followers to vote Republican.Story continuesBiden's gift to Tesla? A Model 3 at a showroom in the U.S. REUTERS/Florence Lo[Drop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter.]Democrats, however, are better for his car company. Musk and Tesla deserve credit for foreseeing the electrified future and persevering through near-death experiences. But they’ve had some help. The electric-vehicle tax credit that helps subsidize the cost of an EV originated in a 2009 law passed by Democrats and signed by President Obama. That tax break helped goose Tesla’s sales during difficult years when it lost money and needed every penny. President Trump wanted to kill that tax credit, but wasn’t able to.Tesla has also benefited from regulatory credits in California, largely governed by Democrats. California gives Tesla credits for producing zero-emission vehicles that it can sell to other companies who use them as a pollution offset. Such sales have netted Tesla hundreds of millions of dollars.The Biden administration’s new pollution rules could force the biggest transformation of the auto industry in its history. The EPA estimates that if the rules go into effect as proposed, EVs as a portion of new-car sales would rise from less than 6% now to around 67% by 2032. That would be a remarkable shift for just a 10-year period.All of Tesla’s assembly lines produce EVs. At other automakers, EVs are a tiny share of production, even with sizeable new commitments to electrics. It costs billions of dollars to build an automotive assembly line, and more to retire old ones no longer in use. Legacy automakers face massive transformation costs. Tesla doesn’t.Since 2019, North American automakers have announced roughly $80 billion worth of new investments in electric vehicles. The EPA argues that a rapid transition to EVs will happen no matter what, given the industry’s own large investments in that direction.The new EPA rules, however, would still impose new costs on top of investments automakers already have planned. The new rules would raise industry-wide costs by somewhere between $180 and $280 billion during the seven-year period, according to the EPA. There would be savings, too, such as better fuel economy for drivers and reduced maintenance for EVs, compared with gas-powered models. But manufacturers largely bear the costs up front, then pass on to consumers what they can recoup through higher prices. That’s the tricky part for legacy automakers: financing the transition to electrics without racking up losses or too many sell recommendations on their stock.Ford and GM stock has been largely range-bound for years, with the exception of a modest run-up during the Covid rally, when monetary stimulus goosed the whole market. Those flattish stock trends reflect Wall Street worry about massive transformation costs. Tesla, of course, is a high-flier that’s still worth six times as much as GM and Ford combined, even with its stock down by more than half from its 2021 peak. Investors think Tesla is poised to dominate an industry driven by EVs, and that dominance could come sooner if the Biden rules stick.They may not.Automakers seem sure to challenge the new proposal, saying they can’t shift to EVs that fast. So the final rule could be weaker than the proposal. There will probably also be litigation challenging the Biden administration’s authority to make such a big change—without Congressional legislation. The current Supreme Court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, has been much more skeptical of executive-branch authority than in the past, and there’s a chance they could block such dramatic changes. A final risk to the new rules is a possible change in administration in 2024, with a future Republican president likely to roll back the Biden standards.All of those risks add up to a lot of uncertainty for legacy automakers already unloved by the market. CEOs of those companies have to plan for a future where the pace of transformation could range from challenging to ruinous. Tesla has challenges, too, but the burden of stringent pollution regulation isn’t one of them.Maybe Biden and Musk should be a little friendlier toward each other.Rick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

332,f49b98b5-8d42-3f3d-a583-60b5dbfeb9ee,GM,2023-04-14,12 Best Warren Buffett Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-best-warren-buffett-stocks-214848744.html,1681336128,STORY,"['BRK-B', 'TMUS', 'JNJ', 'TSM', 'AAPL', 'SNOW', 'GM', 'CHTR', 'MA']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best Warren Buffett stocks to buy according to hedge funds. For more stocks, head on over to 5 Best Warren Buffett Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. For newcomers, and sometimes seasoned professionals too, investing often feels like a daunting task. Choosing the right set of securities, commodities, currencies, or other investment vehicles to put one's money in, naturally carries the allure of profits. However, at the same time, the sword of losses is also always dangling, eager to strike at the slightest miscalculation.The aftermath of the coronavirus and the generous stimulus spending by the American government changed stock market dynamics. Before the pandemic hit, most investing was done by professional investors, and the retail segment - namely ordinary people buying and selling shares - constituted a nearly negligible portion of total trading. The retail trader of today is quite different from the retail trader of the dotcom era where everyone bet on technology companies regardless of their fundamentals and ended up losing significant amounts of value as the market crashed.Data from BNY Mellon shows that retail traders typically focus on individual stocks, and when they do, their attention often ends up disrupting the complex mathematical models deployed by hedge funds for trading. It adds that stocks such as GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) carry the potential of massive returns that can go as high as 3,500% but can also cause significant losses that range around 18%. At the same time, the relatively safer S&amp;P 500 can provide 35% in returns and a maximum of 7.5% in losses. After inflation hurt the stock market again last year, retail traders were hesitant to put more of their money on the market. However, this does not mean that they are out of the picture for good. According to data from the investment bank JPMorgan, retail trading hit an all time high for 2023 by the close of January and as of data released in early February. A note from the bank outlined that between the final week of January and the start of the first week of February, the retail trade share of the total trading volume in America was a whopping 23%. This was an all time high record for the everyday trader since the last record was during the pandemic's peak. This record was 22%, and inflation had cut down retail trading to 15% of the total volume in 2022.Story continuesSo, if retail traders can enter or leave the market on a whim and the hedge fund industry remains shaky, who can you rely on for trading advice? Well, one name that no one should disagree with is the legendary Warren Buffett - or the Oracle of Omaha. Mr. Buffett's journey on the stock market has made him worth a cool $110 billion as of March 2023 according to Forbes Magazine. This wealth is after Mr. Buffett's donation, which currently sits at $49 billion. His fortune comes courtesy of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A), an investment holding company that buys ownership stakes in a wide variety of different companies such as technology, retail, banking, energy, automotive manufacturing, and more. In fact, Berkshire is also the most expensive stock on the U.S. market, with a share price that currently trades at $481,661. Over the past five years, the shares have appreciated by 62% and since they started trading, the gains stand at a whopping 52,238%. And you only thought that meme stocks could give you returns in thousands of percent, huh?Mr. Buffett regularly communicates with investees in his firm in the form of shareholder letters. His letter for 2022 was released earlier this month, and it contains pieces of wisdom from the Oracle himself. For instance, the sage believes that stocks often trade at silly prices, as he shares:One advantage of our publicly-traded segment is that – episodically – it becomes easy to buy pieces of wonderful businesses at wonderful prices. It’s crucial to understand that stocks often trade at truly foolish prices, both high and low. “Efficient” markets exist only in textbooks. In truth, marketable stocks and bonds are baffling, their behavior usually understandable only in retrospect.Another piece of wisdom from Mr. Buffett outlines that over the long term, you only have to make a couple of good decisions to ensure success on the stock market. Quoting his investment in The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), the Oracle outlines:In August 1994 – yes, 1994 – Berkshire completed its seven-year purchase of the 400 million shares of Coca-Cola we now own. The total cost was $1.3 billion – then a very meaningful sum at Berkshire.The cash dividend we received from Coke in 1994 was $75 million. By 2022, the dividend had increased to $704 million. Growth occurred every year, just as certain as birthdays. All Charlie and I were required to do was cash Coke’s quarterly dividend checks. We expect that those checks are highly likely to grow.American Express is much the same story. Berkshire’s purchases of Amex were essentially completed in 1995 and, coincidentally, also cost $1.3 billion. Annual dividends received from this investment have grown from $41 million to $302 million. Those checks, too, seem highly likely to increase.These dividend gains, though pleasing, are far from spectacular. But they bring with them important gains in stock prices. At yearend, our Coke investment was valued at $25 billion while Amex was recorded at $22 billion. Each holding now accounts for roughly 5% of Berkshire’s net worth, akin to its weighting long ago.Assume, for a moment, I had made a similarly-sized investment mistake in the 1990s, one that flat-lined and simply retained its $1.3 billion value in 2022. (An example would be a high-grade 30-year bond.) That disappointing investment would now represent an insignificant 0.3% of Berkshire’s net worth and would be delivering to us an unchanged $80 million or so of annual income.The lesson for investors: The weeds wither away in significance as the flowers bloom [EMPHASIS OURS]. Over time, it takes just a few winners to work wonders. And, yes, it helps to start early and live into your 90s as well.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the best of both worlds, namely Warren Buffett's stock picks that are also popular with hedge funds. The top three are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Amazon.com, Inc.

(CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images)Given the stress associated with his public company gigs over the past few decades, who can blame Jacobson for enjoying a release with a few toys on four wheels?Jacobson took over as GM's CFO on Dec. 1, 2020. He had been with Delta since 1997, a stretch coinciding with the September 11 terrorist attacks, a merger with Northwest Airlines, the Great Recession, and a COVID-19 pandemic that brought travel to a complete halt. Jacobson had been Delta's CFO since 2012.""A lot of the principles are the same between Delta and GM,"" Jacobson said of his two high-profile roles. ""We have got to drive efficiency in the business, but at the same time, we have to focus on the quality of the brand and the process. We have a lot of work ahead of us.""Indeed GM landed itself an operational field general that also knows numbers, a wicked management combo that will help it embark on an entirely new generation of automobiles that will require a lot of work, as Jacobson suggested.The Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 is seen during the 2016 New York International Auto Show in Manhattan, New York March 24, 2016. REUTERS/Eduardo MunozWhen Jacobson isn't putting the pedal to the metal on his giant EV hummer or beastly Camaro, he is hard at work alongside CEO Mary Barra in driving that transformation at a legendary automaker.Such a wholesale transformation — a reflection of a broader industry shift toward EVs and reduced cost profiles — encompasses a few different parts at GM.The first key area is GM standing up dozens of new EV models over the next five years, such as the looming Silverado pickup truck, in an effort to reach $50 billion in sales by 2025 from the category. But at the same time, the automaker is investing $854 million into a variety of plants to build sixth-generation small-block V-8 engines.Story continuesGM's small-block V-8 dates back to 1954, and its fifth generation of the engine debuted in 2013. The company will need those engines in order to serve commercial customers.Employees work at a production line inside a factory of Saic GM Wuling, in Liuzhou, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China, June 19, 2016. REUTERS/Norihiko ShirouzuThe other component is bringing down costs to free up resources for the EV push and satisfy profit-hungry investors.Jacobson recently detailed that 5,000 white-collar workers took buyouts — a move that will save GM about $1 billion in costs. This comes as GM aims to shave off $2 billion in costs over the next two years through various cost-cutting actions.“We are a show-me story,” Jacobson said when asked why the stock trades at a steep discount to the broader market from a valuation perspective.Jacobson is keen to wrestle market share away from Tesla (TSLA) and in the process, grab a slice of the lucrative EV industry leader's profit margins.It's that margin potential that Jacobson no doubt feels while driving around a nearly $100,000 EV Hummer.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

334,9061cde3-2874-47b2-bad8-be6397110e5c,GM,2023-04-14,Why Tesla is losing its EV dominance,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-losing-ev-dominance-151234275.html,1681312354,STORY,['GM'],"[Tesla (TSLA) should be looking over its shoulder at the fully charged EVs barreling right toward its castle.While Elon Musk's non-Twitter creation still has a stronghold on the EV market based on name recognition, market share, and production capabilities, the clear takeaway from this year’s New York International Auto Show (which Tesla was not a part of) is that traditional automakers such as Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Nissan (NSANY) are all gunning for Tesla's dominance and lucrative profit margins.And they may just have success at that target practice.Hyundai aims to lead the EV pack“Tesla who,” Hyundai Motor Americas CEO Randy Parker quipped when Yahoo Finance Live asked about Hyundai's IONIQ 6, an EV that was named 'Car of the Year' for 2023.The impressive specs and pricing of Hyundai's IONIQ 6 places it in direct competition with Tesla's Model 3, the second-most-popular EV in the U.S. Hyundai's IONIQ 6 starts at $41,600 with a range of up to 240 miles. By comparison, the $41,990 Model 3 reaches 272 miles on one charge.Gap closed.“The IONIQ 6 from a technology standpoint, you can’t do better,” Parker crowed.And it’s that type of Tesla mentality that’s likely to test the EV leadership of Musk's EV outfit.Older automakers known for their gas-powered rides are ramping up their push into the EV market with edgy new styles and attractive specs like those showcased at this year's New York Auto Show, including the Kia EV9, Nissan Ariya, Chevrolet Equinox EV, and Ram 1500 REV electric truck.These will be added to a class of solid EVs already in the market like Ford's F-150 Lightning and Mach-E and the coming Chevy Silverado.What's next for TeslaTesla's Cybertruck isn't even on the market yet. The company is reportedly working on a compact EV dubbed the Model 2, but it's unclear when that will arrive.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.And more EV models, not from Tesla, are coming — and fast.Story continuesS&amp;P Global estimates the EV market will grow from just over 50 models today to 78 by year-end before more than doubling to 160 by the end of 2025.S&amp;P Global Mobility’s Tom Libby told Yahoo Finance in a chat that ""competitive pressure is pushing OEMs to move quickly,' and that Tesla's market share will ‘keep declining' as a result.The inroads into Tesla's dominance are already being felt without question.General Motors sold more than 20,000 EVs for the first time in a quarter, fueled by demand for its cheaper Chevy Bolt EV, which accounted for 95% of the auto giant’s EV sales. And according to GM, Bolt sales are expected to soar to reach 70,000 by the end of this year.That may not sound too impressive when you compare it to Tesla’s record first-quarter delivery numbers, which totaled 422,875 globally. But data compiled by S&amp;P Global Mobility shows Tesla's competitors are gaining ground.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Tesla’s U.S. EV share subsequently fell from nearly three-quarters of the market in January 2022 to just over half in January 2023. Within that same time frame, General Motors' EV market share grew from 0.1% to 9.9%, and Ford’s foothold grew to 8.4%.The pressure on Tesla is one of the factors forcing the carmaker to slash prices again. Tesla marked down its vehicles for the fifth time this year, its latest effort to boost demand and regain lost market share.""In this EV arms race Tesla needs to defend their turf and customer base with price cuts,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in an email to Yahoo Finance. ""Everyone is trying to catch up. Tesla cutting prices were the near-term pain for long-term gain strategic poker move.""RBC analyst Tom Narayan also thinks lower prices could help Tesla's demand issue, telling Yahoo Finance Live that lower prices are a ""great way to really steal market share.""Despite some upbeat outlooks from Wall Street on price cuts and the fact Tesla's stock has been a favorite among investors since the start of the year, shares are still off more than 40% in the past 12 months. That's a much starker decline than competitors Ford and General Motors, with respective one-year drops of 14% and 10%.The relative underperformance of Tesla's stock proves some investors are looking at its recent price cuts and quarterly delivery miss as a sign of trouble ahead for the electric vehicle maker. And perhaps a sign that mighty Tesla is losing its grip on an industry it has dominated for the last five years.Either way, it will be electric for investors to bet on.Seana Smith is an anchor and journalist at Yahoo Finance.

This is the latest announced investment from the new UAV Sustainable Flight FundSM, a first-of-its-kind investment vehicle that is designed to leverage support from cross-industry businesses in order to support start-ups focused on decarbonizing air travel through SAF research, technology and production.The airline aims to be 100% green by reducing its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 100% by 2050, without relying on traditional carbon offsets. To date, United has invested in the future production of over three billion gallons of SAF - the most of any airline in the world.1""Carbon capture technology has the potential to be a critical solution in the fight to stop climate change and has the added benefit of helping us scale the production of SAF,"" said United CEO Scott Kirby. ""And at United we're building on that approach by investing in both companies that can capture CO2 and others that can turn it into fuel. There's no question that this carbon utilization is in its infancy today, but as a leader in sustainable flying we must help build the foundation to deploy this technology of the future as expediently as possible. This is truly a global imperative, and United's investment in Svante reflects our dedication to making sustainable travel a reality.""This investment was made as part of Svante's Series E financing round and will fund and support Svante's commercial-scale filter manufacturing facility in Vancouver, BC, Canada. Svante is working with world-leading organizations, including Dimensional Energy, a carbon utilization - CO2 to jet fuel - company that United Airlines Ventures invested in last year.Story continues""We are pleased to have the support of United Airlines as one of our world-class investors,"" said Claude Letourneau, Svante's President &amp; CEO. ""The airline industry has a huge opportunity to make a big impact on global decarbonization - battling climate change through the transition to sustainable aviation fuels and other innovative technologies that will help the world achieve net zero. Their investment in companies like ours will aid in accelerating the commercialization of carbon capture and removal technology.""Svante is a leader in second generation solid sorbent-based carbon capture and removal. The company's scalable, eco-friendly, and commercially available carbon capture and removal technology employs structured absorbent beds, known as filters. These filters can capture 95% of CO2 emissions from industrial sites as well as CO2 that's already in the air. Once the CO2 is captured, it is concentrated and can be used in the creation of SAF or other products. It can also be safely transported and stored underground.Svante's manufacturing facility is anticipated to produce enough filter modules to capture millions of tons of carbon dioxide per year across hundreds of large-scale carbon capture facilities.""It's great to see United's commitment to building an ecosystem for carbon dioxide (CO2) to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) manifest through this significant investment in Svante,"" said Jason Salfi, Dimensional Energy's CEO. ""The teams at Svante and Dimensional Energy are working together to design integrated systems for captured CO2 to SAF today. There is enough CO2 in the atmosphere and in industrial process emissions to provide all of the carbon necessary for the fuels and products people use every day now and into the future. Svante provides the first step toward a circular carbon economy.""SAF is an alternative to conventional jet fuel that, on a lifecycle basis, reduces GHG emissions associated with air travel compared to conventional jet fuel alone. SAF is made from used cooking oil and agricultural waste, and, in the future, could be made from other feedstocks, including household trash, forest waste, or compressed CO2, the end product of Svante's carbon capture process.The Federal Government Recognizes the Value of SAFThe 2022 Inflation Reduction Act includes the largest governmental climate change investments in U.S. history -- a new blended tax credit specifically for SAF along with other critical incentives for clean energy and carbon capture - that will help spur an increase in SAF infrastructure and supply while lowering costs for SAF consumers.The U.S. military currently uses nearly five billion gallons of jet fuel annually and the Department of Defense will use a jet fuel blend containing at least 10% SAF by 2028 because of the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act.And according to the U.S. Department of Energy, the country's vast feedstock resources are enough to meet the projected SAF demand of the entire U.S. aviation industry.United's Commitment to Net-Zero Emissions by 2050United was the first airline to commit to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, without relying on traditional carbon offsets. In addition to the UAV Sustainable Flight FundSM, United has launched a SAF purchasing program called the Eco-Skies Alliance and established a venture fund - United Airlines Ventures - to identify and invest in companies and technologies that can decarbonize air travel. These strategic investments include carbon capture, hydrogen-electric engines, electric regional aircraft and air taxis.About UnitedUnited's shared purpose is ""Connecting People.

This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.A company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for United is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for United imply an improvement in the company's underlying business. Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for UnitedThis airline is expected to earn $8.80 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2023, which represents a year-over-year change of 249.2%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for United. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 28.6%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of United to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

She expects ""near record revenues"" for the second and third quarter from Delta. Still, whether earnings will be high ""remains to be seen."" Becker predicted rising fuel, labor, and maintenance costs will continue to weigh on airline's bottom line.Key Video Moments:00:00:15 - Bastian: ""Outlook for summer is strong""00:00:58 - No signs of a slowdown in air travel00:02:10 - Delta's positive Q2 forecast pulls stock up in premarket00:02:45 - Going to see a ""multi-year resurgence"" in travel: Bastian00:03:03 - Costs are the issue, not demand00:03:51 - Delta's big push to hire, train pilotsFor more on Delta's Q1 earnings report, check out Brad Smith's full breakdown here.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: We're getting back to that first thing. Delta is out with its first-quarter earnings. The company missed on the top and bottom lines, as it faced uncertainty and volatility over the past few months. I spoke with Delta CEO Ed Bastian about the quarter. He remains optimistic about future travel demand and economic impacts. Take a listen.ED BASTIAN: The outlook for summer is strong, particularly international. Our consumers are prioritizing spend on premium experiences and that's our sweet spot. We deliver some of the best experience in the sky. And consumers are wanting to-- wanting to travel.Story continuesWhen we look at the second quarter coming up, we're going to have a good performance. We expect an operating margin of about 15%. We expect to grow our top line mid-double-digits and generate another net billion of free cash. So I'm encouraged by what I see. And we're not seeing any signs of a slowdown, at least on air travel.Remember, we had our recession. We had the worst recession any industry could ever have over the last few years when our revenues went to basically $0.00. So our product is one that people need to be accessing for many, many reasons. It's something that consumers are prioritizing. And even to the extent that consumers are deciding to reduce their spend, it's not coming out of travel or certainly not coming out of the experience economy.You can go to any restaurant, go to any hotel, get on board any aircraft and you can see that with your own eyes. What I think you're gonna see is that it's gonna be a pretty strong, steady pull in the latter part of the year.BRAD SMITH: And so airlines really kicking off this earnings season. And for any investors wondering why the stock is moving higher in reaction to the miss on the top and bottom line compared to what the consensus estimates were from Wall Street and analysts who cover the stock, it is really about what that forecast looks like for summer travel, some of the trends that are remaining intact.I was running some figures, running some calculations based on TSA Traveler throughput numbers, and found that during the first quarter, the entirety of the first quarter, passenger volumes, they average above prepandemic markers for the first time for the entirety of that quarter. About 2.1 million passengers screened every day during the first three months of the year.And so you kind of factor in that broader trend that Delta is really looking into and what Bastian offered even further during our conversation, saying I think what you're going to see is a multiyear resurgence in travel. It's going to continue. And not seeing anything in the economic outlook that suggests travel is going to be stalled. And really kind of a nod to where consumer spending has been prioritized now among some of those discretionary dollars into services and into that experience economy.JULIE HYMAN: It doesn't seem like demand is the problem. But it does seem like costs could be an issue. And that really was flagged by American Airlines yesterday, right? That was the issue for American and why it's maybe not gonna meet its quarter.It looks like the Delta's costs are going OK. Unit costs are gonna be up 1% to 3% in the second quarter. It's non-fuel cost to fly each seat a mile were up by 4.7%. So, you know, I think there's gonna continue to be some scrutiny there, even as demand does seem to be holding up. What is gonna happen with costs?We're gonna have to continue to watch what happens with pilots and pay. That's gonna be a big issue for the airline. So it's not as though it's smooth sailing, so to speak, right, even if demand is strong.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, and on the pilot front that you were mentioning, he did give a nod to the last couple of years. They've hired between 3,000 and 4,000 pilots. And really the issue there in just getting them onto flight schedules, it just has been training and having enough of the different seats that they can sit pilots into to make sure that they're getting the necessary amount of training prior to being added to routes and flight schedules.And it's important to remember that this is, as well as many of the other airline operators, they're not at prepandemic capacity. Even though you're hearing about them cutting some regional routes here and there, it's really more of the negotiations within certain cities and certain hubs that they can get into and get out of and then kind of trimming where it seems appropriate.But I think in this near-term period of time-- especially as we're thinking about Delta, too, and some of those costs. Sure, on the pilot front, they had to acknowledge that. We spoke about that. But then additionally, how they maintain some of the costs on the oil front, as well-- or at least on the fuel, I should say front, is they have their own refinery operations, too, that help them mitigate some of the exposure that other airlines have, as well.JULIE HYMAN: Right, and they do a lot of hedging, also. All the airlines do, for that matter.]"

This $5 million investment will support the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from algae, an abundant and scalable resource that can be grown and harvested without impacting the food supply chain.Viridos specializes in the bioengineering of microalgae and its proprietary technology accelerates the amount of oil that can produced from microalgae. This algae oil could then be used to scale the future production of SAF.SAF is an alternative to conventional jet fuel that, on a lifecycle basis, reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with air travel compared to conventional jet fuel alone.¹ SAF is made from used cooking oil and agricultural waste, and, in the future, could be made from other feedstocks, including household trash, forest waste, or algae. To date, United has invested in the future production of over three billion gallons of SAF - the most of any airline in the world.²""SAF is proven, scalable, and the best tool we have to reduce our carbon emissions from flying, but we face a significant shortage of available feedstock,"" said United Airlines Ventures President Mike Leskinen. ""As the global aviation leader in SAF production investment United remains committed to reaching net zero carbon emissions, without relying on traditional carbon offsets, by 2050. Viridos' algae-based biofuel technology has the potential to help solve our supply problem without the need for farmland or other agricultural resources and marks our inaugural investment in our new cross-industry UAV Sustainable Flight Fund.""Story continuesViridos, a biofuel company focused on decarbonizing industries, is leading the bioengineering of microalgae and has already achieved seven times the oil productivity compared to typical wild-type algae. This creates an opportunity for potentially scalable and more sustainable production of algae oil, that could later be used to produce SAF. Based on current estimates, SAF created by Viridos' algae oil is expected to have a 70% reduced carbon footprint on a lifecycle basis when compared to traditional jet fuel.Viridos' bioengineering technology combines several important and unique attributes contributing to better scalability and sustainability compared with traditional jet fuel production:Surface area oil productivities of Viridos algae far exceed any traditional oil crop, achieving high algae oil output on comparatively small areas.Viridos algae are grown in vessels containing seawater. This allows contained deployment in hot and dry locations without taxing scarce freshwater and arable land resources, while eliminating runoff.Viridos algae have extremely high oil contents facilitating downstream processing to algae oil.Viridos algae oil is a quality plant oil allowing existing bio-refineries to process the oil with high yield.""By establishing production sites to grow Viridos-engineered microalgae in saltwater, we are creating the foundation for a biofuel future that moves away from fossil fuels without competing for precious resources such as fresh water and arable land. We are excited to have the support from United Airlines. Together we can build the ecosystem needed to bring algae biofuels to the market,"" said Oliver Fetzer, Viridos Chief Executive Officer.About the UAV Sustainable Flight FundThe UAV Sustainable Flight Fund is a first-of-its-kind investment vehicle that is designed to leverage support from cross-industry businesses in order to support start-ups focused on decarbonizing air travel through SAF research, technology and production. The fund is starting with more than $100 million in investments from United and inaugural corporate partners Air Canada, Boeing, GE Aerospace, JPMorgan Chase and Honeywell. To date, nearly 6,000 United customers have contributed to supplement United's investment in the fund while purchasing tickets.The Federal Government Recognizes the Value of SAFThe 2022 Inflation Reduction Act includes the largest governmental climate change investments in U.S. history - a new blender's tax credit specifically for SAF along with other critical incentives for clean energy and carbon capture - that will help spur an increase in SAF infrastructure and supply while lowering costs for SAF consumers.The U.S. military currently uses nearly five billion gallons of jet fuel annually and the Department of Defense will use a jet fuel blend containing at least 10% SAF by 2028 because of the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act.And according to the U.S. Department of Energy, the country's vast feedstock resources are enough to meet the projected SAF demand of the entire U.S. aviation industry.United's Commitment to Net Zero Emissions by 2050United aims to be 100% green by reducing its GHG emissions 100% by 2050, without relying on traditional carbon offsets. In addition to the UAV Sustainable Flight Fund, United has launched a SAF purchasing program called the Eco-Skies Alliance and established a venture fund - United Airlines Ventures - to identify and invest in companies and technologies that can decarbonize air travel. These strategic investments include carbon capture, hydrogen-electric engines, electric regional aircraft and air taxis.About UnitedUnited's shared purpose is ""Connecting People.

Its revenue of $38.3 billion was up 25% from the year-ago period. Wells Fargo (WFC) earned $5 billion, Citigroup earned (C) $4.6 billion, and PNC (PNC) earned $1.7 billion.The results kicked off a closely-watched earnings season for the nation’s biggest banks. Banks of all sizes will be scrambling over the coming weeks to show investors how they are better positioned than rivals to weather any future turmoil.JPMorgan shares rose 7.5% Friday following the earnings release. Citi rose 4.8%. Wells Fargo and PNC were down slightly during the day but closed flat.The giants of the industry weren’t totally immune from the chaos surrounding the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Deposits at JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and PNC fell by 7%, 8% and 3% from a year ago, while Citigroup was roughly flat. JPMorgan and PNC deposits did rise slightly, however, compared with the fourth quarter of 2022.Even before the turmoil in March, lenders big and small had been losing depositors to money market funds that were willing to offer higher yields as the Federal Reserve boosted interest rates. The outflow of deposits from all of the nation’s banks reached nearly $500 billion last month through March 29, according to recent Fed data. JPMorgan CFO Jeremy Barnum told reporters Friday that the bank took in $50 billion in deposits last month as some customers moved their money from regional lenders.Banks like JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, because of their size and diversity of their businesses, are better positioned than smaller rivals to weather such periods of uncertainty. Regulators also require them to maintain greater buffers to absorb losses and demonstrate that it has enough liquidity to withstand unexpected economic turmoil.Story continuesThe rise in interest rates over the past year also benefitted some of these large banks, including JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, because it allowed them to charge more for their loans. JPMorgan's net interest income was up 48% compared to the year-ago quarter, and it raised its net interest income expectation for all of 2023 to $81 billion.But those figures could drop going forward. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in a call with reporters that net interest income ""will come down significantly next year and I think that's a more important statement than what it is for this year.""Total loans were also up at JPMorgan, as well as for Wells Fargo and PNC. They were down slightly at Citigroup.Investors are looking for any signs that banks are making fewer new loans, which would affect the larger economy by reducing the flow of credit to businesses and consumers. Lending across the industry fell by nearly $105 billion during the two weeks ending March 29, according to the Fed, due mostly to a pullback by smaller institutions.One lending business has clearly slowed at JPMorgan: mortgages. There is not as much demand for new borrowings now that interest rates are much higher than they were a year ago. Home lending revenue was down 38%.JPMorgan CFO Jeremy Barnum told reporters Friday that he isn't anticipating the bank will get more conservative on lending. ""We didn't loosen underwriting standards when numbers were really good during the pandemic and we don't see ourselves particularly tightening them now,"" he said.FILE - JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon testifies at a Senate Banking Committee hearing in 2022. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, however, are both preparing for the possibility that credit conditions could worsen. JPMorgan increased its provision for credit losses by 56% compared to a year ago, a sign that it expects more debt to go bad as the economy slows. Higher provisions at Wells included a $643 million increase in the allowance for credit losses on commercial real estate loans, as well as an increase for credit card and auto loans.The current challenge faced by the banking industry, Dimon said in a release, “is distinct” from the 2008 financial crisis “as it has involved far fewer financial players and fewer issues that need to be resolved, but financial conditions will likely tighten as lenders become more conservative, and we do not know if this will slow consumer spending.”His CFO told reporters that ""it seems to me that the system as a whole is in very good shape. And we've had a rough spell in March but things were looking better now.""Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Other noninterest expense increased $11 million and included $25 million from a higher FDIC assessment rate, which was partially offset by continued cost savings initiatives.Noninterest expense increased $149 million from the first quarter of 2022, due to higher personnel costs, an increased FDIC assessment rate and continued investments in technology and marketing to support business growth.The effective tax rate was 17.2% for the first quarter of 2023, 17.7% for the fourth quarter of 2022 and 17.3% for the first quarter of 2022.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET REVIEW Average total assets were $562.3 billion in the first quarter of 2023 compared with $557.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $550.1 billion in the first quarter of 2022. The increase from the fourth quarter of 2022 was driven by increased loans outstanding and higher Federal Reserve Bank balances.

Common shareholders' equity at March 31, 2023 increased $1.8 billion from December 31, 2022, driven by the benefit of first quarter net income and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by dividends paid and share repurchases during the first quarter.As a Category III institution, PNC has elected to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income related to both available for sale securities and pension and other post-retirement plans from CET1 capital. Accumulated other comprehensive income at March 31, 2023 improved $1.1 billion compared to December 31, 2022, reflecting the accretion of unrealized losses and the favorable impact of interest rate changes on securities and swaps valuations. Accumulated other comprehensive income decreased $3.4 billion from March 31, 2022, as a result of the negative impact of higher interest rates on securities and swaps valuations.In the first quarter of 2023, PNC returned $1.0 billion of capital to shareholders, reflecting $0.6 billion of dividends on common shares and $0.4 billion of common share repurchases, representing 2.4 million shares. Consistent with the Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) framework, which allows for capital return in amounts in excess of the SCB minimum levels, our board of directors has authorized a repurchase framework under the previously approved repurchase program of up to 100 million common shares, of which approximately 47% were still available for repurchase at March 31, 2023. PNC's SCB for the four-quarter period beginning October 1, 2022 is 2.9%.Due to recent market volatility and increased economic uncertainty, share repurchase activity is expected to be reduced in the second quarter of 2023 compared to recent prior quarters. PNC continues to evaluate and may adjust share repurchase activity, as actual amounts and timing are dependent on market and economic conditions as well as other factors.On April 3, 2023, the PNC board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $1.50 per share payable on May 5, 2023.At March 31, 2023, PNC was considered ""well capitalized"" based on applicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio requirements. For additional information regarding PNC's Basel III capital ratios, see Capital Ratios in the Consolidated Financial Highlights. PNC elected a five-year transition provision effective March 31, 2020 to delay until December 31, 2021 the full impact of the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) standard on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. Effective for the first quarter of 2022, PNC is now in the three-year transition period, and the full impact of the CECL standard is being phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024. The fully implemented ratios reflect the full impact of CECL and exclude the benefits of this transition provision.CREDIT QUALITY REVIEWCredit QualityChangeChangeMarch 31, 2023December 31, 2022March 31, 202203/31/23 vs03/31/23 vsIn millions12/31/2203/31/22Provision for (recapture of) credit losses$         235$          408$        (208)$      (173)$       443Net loan charge-offs$         195$          224$         137(13) %42 %Allowance for credit losses (a)$      5,413$       5,435$      5,197—4 %Total delinquencies (b)$      1,326$       1,490$      1,699(11) %(22) %Nonperforming loans$      2,010$       1,985$      2,2981 %(13) %Net charge-offs to average loans (annualized)0.24 %0.28 %0.19 %Allowance for credit losses to total loans1.66 %1.67 %1.76 %Nonperforming loans to total loans0.62 %0.61 %0.78 %(a) Excludes allowances for investment securities and other financial assets(b) Total delinquencies represent accruing loans more than 30 days past dueProvision for credit losses of $235 million in the first quarter of 2023 included the impact of updated economic assumptions as well as changes in portfolio composition and quality.

To provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest margins, we use net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields used in the calculation of net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments.

Under the standardized approach for determining credit risk-weighted assets, exposures are generally assigned a pre-defined risk weight. Exposures to high volatility commercial real estate, past due exposures and equity exposures are generally subject to higher risk weights than other types of exposures.PNC elected a five-year transition provision effective March 31, 2020 to delay until December 31, 2021 the full impact of the CECL standard on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. Effective for the first quarter 2022, PNC is now in the three-year transition period, and the full impact of the CECL standard is being phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024. See the table below for the December 31, 2022, March 31, 2022 and estimated March 31, 2023 ratios. For the full impact of PNC's adoption of CECL, which excludes the benefits of the five-year transition provision, see the March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (Fully Implemented) estimates presented in the table below.Our Basel III capital ratios may be impacted by changes to the regulatory capital rules and additional regulatory guidance or analysis.Basel lll Common Equity Tier 1 Capital RatiosBasel III (a)March 312023 (estimated) (b)December 312022 (b)March 31 2022 (b)March 31, 2023 (Fully Implemented)(estimated) (c)December 31, 2022 (Fully Implemented)(estimated) (c)Dollars in millionsCommon stock, related surplus and retained earnings, net of treasury stock$    51,400$    50,924$    50,624$         50,918$         50,200Less regulatory capital adjustments:Goodwill and disallowed intangibles, net of deferred tax liabilities(11,119)(11,138)(11,114)(11,119)(11,138)All other adjustments(92)(101)(63)(94)(101)Basel III Common equity Tier 1 capital$    40,189$    39,685$    39,447$         39,705$         38,961Basel III standardized approach risk-weighted assets (d)$  435,873$  435,537$  397,455$       436,067$       435,581Basel III Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio9.2 %9.1 %9.9 %9.1 %8.9 %(a)All ratios are calculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to PNC during each period presented.(b)The ratio is calculated to reflect PNC's election to adopt the CECL optional five-year transition provision.(c)The March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 ratio is calculated to reflect the full impact of CECL and excludes the benefits of the five-year transition provision.(d)Basel III standardized approach risk-weighted assets are based on the Basel III standardized approach rules and include credit and market risk-weighted assets. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.Consolidated Financial Highlights (Unaudited) NON-GAAP MEASURESPretax Pre-Provision Earnings (non-GAAP)Three months endedMarch 31December 31March 31Dollars in millions202320222022Income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests$             2,047$             1,881$             1,728Provision for (recapture of) credit losses235408(208)Pretax pre-provision earnings (non-GAAP)$             2,282$             2,289$             1,520Pretax pre-provision earnings is a non-GAAP measure and is based on adjusting income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests to exclude provision for (recapture of) credit losses.

As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest income, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP. Taxable-equivalent net interest income is only used for calculating net interest margin and net interest income shown elsewhere in this presentation is GAAP net interest income.Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking InformationWe make statements in this news release and related conference call, and we may from time to time make other statements, regarding our outlook for financial performance, such as earnings, revenues, expenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity levels and ratios, asset levels, asset quality, financial position, and other matters regarding or affecting us and our future business and operations, including our sustainability strategy, that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.

While chief executives of banks have the task of reassuring customers and shareholders alike, another endeavor lies in wait.  Bank CEOs such as JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon being at the helm for a over a decade, stirs up the question of succession plans. The path of succession is “much cloudier” at both Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan (JPM), William Cohan, Pucknews Founding Partner told Yahoo Finance Live.Cohan explains how “a lot of talent” has left JPMorgan waiting for Dimon to step down, and says “succession is the most important thing that a CEO can do.”The Financial Times’ Gillian Tett echos the same sentiment on the need for succession plan discussions, noting “the fact that Jamie has not groomed visible successors… is in some ways a black mark against his name.”Yahoo Finance’s Julie Hyman and Brad Smith speak with Gillian Tett and William Cohan in a full interview here.Key video moments:00:00:36 Comparing succession plans00:01:25 Succession conversationsVideo TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Bill, your recent piece where you talked about Jamie Dimon, the Jamie and Janet show, as he went, once again, down to DC to try and work on this latest rescue, it got me thinking a little bit about his tenure at JPMorgan, for that matter, Brian Moynihan of Bank of America.Some of these bank CEOs have been around for a long time, and it made me wonder a little bit about when we might see a changing of the guard. I guess Jane Fraser's newer at Citi, for example. But I do wonder when we're going to see that next phase because these people are so entrenched and so really iconic at many of the banks. What's your thinking on that, Bill? And then, Gillian, I'm going to ask for your thinking on it as well.WILLIAM COHAN: At least in Morgan Stanley, there's a clear succession program underway. It might be a few years. Much cloudier at both Bank of America and at JPMorgan Chase. A lot of talent, a lot of talent has left JPMorgan Chase, waiting for Jamie Dimon to perhaps be selected Treasury Secretary to succeed Janet Yellen or to retire. It's a bank loaded with talent. But who it's going to be and when is a big open question. Bank of America same thing. So succession is the most important thing that a CEO can do, Julie. And Jamie Dimon and Brian Moynihan need to get it right.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: Gillian, do you think that this is something that investors are paying enough attention to?GILLIAN TETT: I think they certainly are. But it's been going on for such a long time that these conversations feel a bit like Groundhog Day. And be honest, the entire crisis in March, in some ways, felt like Groundhog Day because so many of the characters that Bill and I spoke to in 2008 and wrote about are still there in some form. It's good because you do have a depth of experience.It's bad because, actually, as and when they do move on, it's going to potentially create a bit of a shock. So I strongly agree with Bill that there needs to be more discussion about succession. And the fact that Jamie has not groomed visible successors who we've managed to keep in the stable is, in some ways, a black mark against his name.]"

This statement is especially true in regard to Intuitive Surgical Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG).Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with ISRG. Click here to check it out. ISRG 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of ISRGPeter Lynch Chart of ISRGThe medical devices manufacturer is a classic example of why valuation is a key factor that should never be neglected in stock picking. I argue that this health care stock could have been a top choice for long-term investing, but it is not. While it has strong fundamentals and a solid balance sheet, the valuation is not in sync with the share price currently.Intuitive Surgical has a strong balance sheet in an era of rising interest ratesShares of Intuitive Surgical are down nearly 1.5% so far in 2023.Intuitive Surgical's Valuation Is ExcessiveWith a beta of 1.49, theory suggests that with a 10% decline of the broader market, the stock will drop around 14.90%. Are we in a bear market yet? This will be determined by the way the stock market reacts to the company's earnings results as well as higher interest rates.As such, it is very nice to find companies like Intuitive Surgical that have little to no debt in an environment where capital gets more expensive as interest rates rise. The company has zero long-term debt; not just for fiscal year 2022, but also for the whole period of 2019 through 2022. This is indeed remarkable because when capital was cheap before the U.S. Federal Reserve started to tighten its monetary policy, Intuitive Surgical did not fund its growth via debt.The fundamentals are very strong, but there is a setback to considerNot only does Intuitive Surgical have a very solid balance sheet, but it is also financially strong, which is good news. By analyzing the fundamentals, investors can see why I think the company has potential. It has to do with the trend in key metrics such as revenue, earnings per share and book value, which have respective three-year average growth rates of 11.20%, -1.80% and 9.90%.Story continuesFurther, according to MSN, the health care company has a three-year average growth rate of 67.47% for its gross margin, 27.11% for its operating margin and 25.15% for its net margin.In addition to this very encouraging profitability, the company generates a lot of positive free cash flow. Intuitive recorded $958.40 million in free cash flow for 2022, which was down from $1.74 billion in 2021.The slowdown in free cash flow growth also affected the growth of the company's revenue and earnings per share for the year. Intuitive Surgical reported revenue growth of 8.97%, less than the three-year average rate of 12.43%, and earnings growth of -21.61%, which was less than the three-year growth rate of 4.45%.The free cash flow in 2022 declined 44.21%, which compared to a three-year average growth rate of 0.81%. Since free cash flow is a top factor for valuation purposes, a slowdown is not an optimistic sign for the value of any company.The valuation is too richThe shares of Intuitive Surgical have a trailing 12-month price-earnings ratio of 71.13. This seems very high, but, as always, it is important to consider the average ratio of the sector in which it operates. The relative valuation of Intuitive Surgical's stock shows that it is now trading at a very high premium compared to the industry median of 26.94. A premium that is too high could soon lead to a convergence of the stock price with its intrinsic value. In other words, the stock could move lower.Further, there is not a single valuation metric that makes shares of Intuitive Surgical look cheap.For instance, the forward price-earnings ratio of 49.14 compares to the health care sector's median ratio of 25.07. Other forward financial ratios, such as enterprise value/sales and enterprise value/Ebitda, show a huge premium that makes it hard to consider Intuitive Surgical as a value stock. Additionally, the forward price-sales ratio of 13.30 is well above the sector median of 4.14. If the price-to-free cash flow ratio was at least attractive, would that change the perspective and make Intuitive Surgican a potentially attractive option?I argue that investors should consider potential investments based on a plethora of financial metrics, not just one. Is it a surprise, then, that even the forward price-to-free cash flow ratio is higher than the sector median? What are we missing, and what makes the stock have a very large premium based on not just one but a number of financial metrics? In a word, exuberance.I find shares of Intuitive Surgical to not be attractive at current prices for all of these reasons. There is no bargain to discover here.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"
356,af1ab8b5-c785-35f2-9fc7-faf21ec956cf,ISRG,2023-04-14,Some Investors May Be Worried About Intuitive Surgical's (NASDAQ:ISRG) Returns On Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-may-worried-intuitive-surgicals-120024697.html,1681300824.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Although, when we looked at Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Intuitive Surgical, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.14 = US$1.6b ÷ (US$13b - US$1.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Therefore, Intuitive Surgical has an ROCE of 14%. In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Medical Equipment industry average of 9.9% it's much better. Check out our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Intuitive Surgical compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is Intuitive Surgical's ROCE Trending?In terms of Intuitive Surgical's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 21% over the last five years. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Intuitive Surgical's ROCEBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Intuitive Surgical's reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 81% over the last five years. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.While Intuitive Surgical doesn't shine too bright in this respect, it's still worth seeing if the company is trading at attractive prices.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like CSX (NASDAQ:CSX). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. View our latest analysis for CSX CSX's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. We can see that in the last three years CSX grew its EPS by 13% per year. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. On the one hand, CSX's EBIT margins fell over the last year, but on the other hand, revenue grew. So it seems the future may hold further growth, especially if EBIT margins can remain steady.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for CSX's future EPS 100% free.Are CSX Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$62b company like CSX. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Holding US$63m worth of stock in the company is no laughing matter and insiders will be committed in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. That's certainly enough to let shareholders know that management will be very focussed on long term growth.Story continuesIt means a lot to see insiders invested in the business, but shareholders may be wondering if remuneration policies are in their best interest. Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to CSX, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$13m.CSX's CEO took home a total compensation package worth US$9.4m in the year leading up to December 2022. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Should You Add CSX To Your Watchlist?One positive for CSX is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. The fact that EPS is growing is a genuine positive for CSX, but the pleasant picture gets better than that. Boasting both modest CEO pay and considerable insider ownership, you'd argue this one is worthy of the watchlist, at least. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 1 warning sign for CSX that you need to be mindful of.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

The consensus estimate for first-quarter earnings has declined marginally to 43 cents per share over the past 90 days.Given this backdrop, let’s examine the factors that are likely to have influenced CSX’s performance in the quarter to be reported.We expect coal revenues to have been impressive primarily due to high export-coal prices. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric indicates a 1% increase from the fourth-quarter 2022 actual. High fuel surcharge revenues are likely to have aided the top line.On the flip side, supply-chain disruptions, including labor and equipment shortages, are expected to have hurt CSX’s first-quarter performance. Rising fuel expenses are expected to have continued to affect the bottom line. Our estimate for fuel expenses indicates a 18.3% rise from the first-quarter 2022 actuals.The operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) is likely to have suffered in the to-be-reported quarter due to high costs.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for CSX this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.CSX has an Earnings ESP of -1.67% and a Zacks Rank #3.Q4 HighlightsThe company's fourth-quarter 2022 earnings of 49 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents and improved 16.67% year over year.Total revenues increased 8.84% year over year to $3,730 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,722.1 million. Higher fuel surcharge, pricing gains, and an increase in volumes, storage and other revenues acted as tailwinds. Overall revenues per unit increased 11%.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks from the broader Zacks Transportation sector that investors may consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this season.Canadian National Railway Company CNI has an Earnings ESP of +1.67% and a Zacks Rank #3.

366,cb436f40-13d9-3a8e-a6c5-853403d66ecb,ADI,2023-04-14,Investors in Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) have made a solid return of 118% over the past five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-analog-devices-nasdaq-adi-110026426.html,1681383626,STORY,['ADI'],"[Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, long term Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) shareholders have enjoyed a 98% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 44% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 21% in the last year , including dividends .Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. See our latest analysis for Analog Devices There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During five years of share price growth, Analog Devices achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 25% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 15% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Analog Devices has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Analog Devices will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Analog Devices' TSR for the last 5 years was 118%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Analog Devices shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 21% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 17% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

368,c2fda108-906b-3c93-883e-1805956a6def,SBAC,2023-04-14,20 Biggest Real Estate Companies in USA,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-biggest-real-estate-companies-103854415.html,1681468734,STORY,"['AMT', 'PLD', 'UDR', 'EQIX', 'ARE', 'DLR', 'EQR', 'RKT', 'CSGP', 'SPG', 'SBAC', 'INVH', 'AVB', 'VICI', 'WELL', 'CBRE', 'O']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 20 biggest real estate companies in USA. For more real estate companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Real Estate Companies in USA. Two children, a car, and a white picket fence - so goes the American dream. Looking at this, you'll realize that the automotive and real estate industries are at the center of American culture. Most people dream to own their house one day and often end up taking out multi-decade long mortgages to afford their own place of living. Apart from houses, several other buildings and properties make up the real estate sector. These range from public places such as parks, to apartment complexes, office buildings, and giant skyscrapers.Naturally, this also means that the real estate industry is among the most closely watched sectors by both governments and the wealthy. The rich are crazy about real estate since they invest copious amounts of wealth in it. After all, having a villa in Beverly Hills has a much different bling to it than a house in a village. Speaking numbers, a report from McKinsey shows that two thirds of global net worth were invested in real estate as of 2020. Within these two thirds, residential and private real estate accounted for almost half, or 46%, of global net worth, with government and public buildings making up another 23%. Growth rates in net worth with respect to the overall gross domestic product (GDP) show that this plowing of funds into a notoriously unproductive asset has led to significant net worth growth as well. McKinsey's data shows that between 2000 and 2020, net worth compared to GDP was a stunning 104% higher than in the three decades between 1970 and 1999. On the most extreme end, France's richest benefited from the real estate boom, as it grew by an eye popping 371% higher than the GDP! Within the net worth growth between 2000 and 2020, two thirds were due to higher asset prices, with saving and investment both accounting for a rather tame 28%.Story continuesAs this should make it clear, real estate is quite lucrative indeed. But just how lucrative is estimated in a research report from Grand View Research. In this report, the firm estimates that the global real estate industry was worth $3.69 trillion in 2021 and despite this huge size, the segment is expected to post a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.2% between 2022 and 2030 to sit at $5.85 trillion by the end of the forecast period. Within the market, the commercial real estate market was the largest constituent segment as it accounted for 35% of the entire market. Apart from residential, the commercial real estate market is another large component of the industry and it will match the broader sector's growth rate by growing at a 5.1% CAGR during the forecast period. Additionally, Grand View Research also highlights that sales by property type, such as villas and second homes, will outpace the broader market in terms of growth by growing at 6.1%. It adds that the Middle East and Africa will also outpace market growth, but Asia Pacific is the largest segment in terms of geography with more than half the market share.In America, the real estate sector is facing some stress these days, This is due to the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes that aim to make borrowing costs for firms and individuals higher to kill GDP growth and fight inflation. The U.S. real estate sector is worth $20 trillion (this is the total value of the properties and not the revenues) and prices dropped by 15% in March 2023 from their peak values. Rising interest rates are playing a role in this, as commercial real estate purchases are rarely made out of pocket and instead, they rely on bank loans and funding. While a 15% drop in itself sounds high, experts worry that prices could drop as much as 30% in case of an economic downturn or a recession.Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD)'s earnings call for its fourth quarter of 2022 provides valuable insight. During the event, management outlined:With regard to our markets and leasing activity, the bottomline is that conditions remain healthy and there is little we see across our results or proprietary metrics that point to a meaningful slowdown. We see a normalization of demand and when combined with low vacancy, it continues to translate to a meaningful increase in rents. Across our markets, rent growth was nearly 5% during the quarter, driving the full year to 28%. Proposal activity for available space was consistent with our recent history, and given persistent low vacancy, there is simply a very small number of units to even propose deals on. As evidenced, over 99% of our portfolio is either currently leased or in negotiation. Utilization remains high at 86%, near its all time record and deal gestation ticked up over the quarter, indicative of more careful consideration and time being taken in leasing decisions.While we are watching e-commerce carefully, its share of overall retail sales have increased to 22%, which is 600 basis points above its pre-pandemic level. Putting the nuance of mix, timing and other factors aside, as measured by retention, occupancy or rent change, it is clear that customers need to commit to space to market conditions, which offer them very little choice. In terms of supply, the development pipeline across our market stands at 565 million square feet and our expectation for the year is that the pipeline will decline. Deliveries will put modest upward pressure on vacancies from 3.3% today towards 4% later in the year. However, new development starts are slowing in response to the market environment, which will reduce vacancies in late 2023 or 2024.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the biggest real estate companies in America, out of which the top ones are Equinix, Inc.

With 78% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Regions Financial. View our latest analysis for Regions Financial ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Regions Financial?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Regions Financial. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Regions Financial, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Regions Financial. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 10% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 5.4% of the company stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 22 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Regions FinancialThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Regions Financial Corporation. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$50m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 22% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Regions Financial. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

That is because the May 19, 2023 $1.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Regions Financial shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Regions Financial is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Banks - Southeast industry that ranks in the Bottom 4% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimate for the current quarter, while six have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 68 cents per share to 66 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Regions Financial right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

371,0e9e5806-7845-31f8-b9e6-451b672873cf,V,2023-04-14,Visa Inc. (V) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-inc-v-attracting-investor-130001142.html,1681390801,STORY,['V'],"[Visa (V) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this global payments processor have returned +5.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.1% change. The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, to which Visa belongs, has gained 4.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Visa is expected to post earnings of $1.97 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.43 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +12.4%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.57 indicates a change of +13.5% from what Visa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Visa.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for V _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Visa, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.74 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +7.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $32.24 billion and $35.58 billion estimates indicate +10% and +10.4% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVisa reported revenues of $7.94 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.4%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $1.81 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.68 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.38%. The EPS surprise was +8.46%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Visa is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Visa. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

V expanded its relationship with PayPal and Venmo to pilot Visa+ in their respective digital payment apps. Visa+ is an innovative service enabling users to send and receive money securely and fast between different person-to-person (P2P) digital payment apps.This new launch of Visa+ will boost growth in the future and act as a moat for Visa. The company’s continued innovations will help solidify its existing position as a leader in the payments space with more than 50% payments volume than its closest competitor, Mastercard.Visa+ is also integrated within different payment apps, helping the company gain from its success. When more users prefer a particular payment app over another, due to Visa+ being piloted in the same, Visa’s brand value will increase.The launch of Visa+ bodes well for Visa’s growth due to continued investments in technology. Visa’s goal of enabling seamless payments and ensuring the security of transactions is no longer a far-fetched goal with Visa+.In traditional payment methods, the sender and receiver of funds had to have the same application; otherwise, the money would not go through. With Visa+ piloted in digital payment apps, one can send money to a different payment app without sharing valuable data, like phone numbers and other details.The main advantage of Visa+ is that one does not need a Visa card to use this service. This expands the company’s reach to a broader audience. A user of a payment app with Visa+ integrated with it will have to create a personalized payment address to send money. The users can share the payment address with others and receive money from any other party’s payment applications. This will tend to reduce friction in the payments process.Visa’s partnership with DailyPay, i2c, TabaPay and Western Union reflects Visa’s unwavering focus to expand and enable more use cases, like creator, gig and marketplace payouts.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best 5% Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Analysts. High-dividend stocks can be an attractive option for investors who are seeking regular income from their investments. However, it's important to note that a high dividend yield can sometimes indicate that the stock price has fallen significantly, which may indicate a riskier investment. It's also important to consider the company's financial health and growth potential, as well as the overall market conditions. According to analysts, dividend yields between 3% to 6% are considered healthy.The current high-interest rates environment has turned investors’ attention toward high-dividend stocks because of their ability to generate stable income. Historically, dividend stocks have massively contributed to the market returns overall, especially during periods when interest rates were high. Since 1926, dividend stocks represented nearly one-third of the S&amp;P 500’s total return and accounted for over 50% during decades with elevated interest rates and slowing growth, as reported by iShares. Last year’s returns show the outperformance of dividend stocks over the wider market. The iShares Core High Dividend ETF, which tracks the performance of relatively high-dividend-paying US equities, gained 7.1% in 2022, compared with an 18.1% decline in the S&amp;P 500. Moreover, the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Payers fell by only 7.6% last year, which is less severe than a 21.1% drop in the S&amp;P 500 Non-Dividend Payers.United Overseas Bank published a report in collaboration with JPMorgan Asset Management, stressing the positive performance of high-dividend stocks over the years. The report mentioned that the MSCI World High Index gained 3.7% from July 2007 to August 2022 with a volatility of 13.3%. In comparison, MSCI World returned 2.1% during this period with high volatility of 16%.Story continuesAnalysts are also presenting a positive stance on quality dividend companies during this period of financial uncertainty. Michael Clarfeld, ClearBridge Investments portfolio manager, spoke to CNBC about dividend companies. Here are some comments from the analyst:“High-quality dividend growers are a good place to be. The upfront yield provides strong downside support and the dividend growth provides a meaningful headwind against rising interest rates and preserves purchasing power.”Some of the best dividend stocks with high yields include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) because of their strong dividend policies. To know more about high-dividend stocks, readers can have a look at 15 Best High Yield Dividend Stocks to Buy.11 Best 5% Dividend Stocks To Buy According To AnalystsPhoto by Austin Distel on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this article, we first screened for dividend stocks with yields above 5%.

We then found the average price targets and ratings of these stocks placed by Wall Street analysts and other investment firms and narrowed them down to the stocks with strongest upside potential based on their current share price and their average price targets.

(NYSE:MO), compared with 47 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a total value of over $1.8 billion.Broyhill Asset Management mentioned Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We rebalanced our tobacco exposure during the year, reducing our investment in Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) as the future of the company’s combustible cigarette business became increasingly questionable given pending US legislation and a lackluster portfolio of reduced risk products. We reinvested the proceeds in Philip Morris so that relative position sizing is more consistent with our increased conviction.”10. Philip Morris International Inc.

(NYSE:PM) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Our top individual contributors were Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), EOG Resources and Merck. Despite being US-based, tobacco company PM derives all its sales from outside the US. As a result, foreign exchange impacts can be an important driver of near-term returns, and the recent weakening in the US dollar should provide a strong tailwind for earnings due to translation effects. However, our investment case is not tied to currency movements. By virtue of its globally known brands, PM is the best-in-class operator with a well-diversified business, particularly by geography. We believe its next generation heat-not-burn product IQOS should gain share as consumers continue migrating to safer tobacco delivery systems. The company is progressing toward its acquisition of Swedish Match, a Swedish tobacco and nicotine products maker, which was previously held in the portfolio. The deal is a good fit for PM as it reduces PM’s dependence on cigarettes—a category in steady decline—and accelerates the company’s transition to smokeless “reduced-risk” products (RRPs)—a category that has experienced rapid growth over the past five years. PM can also leverage its global scale to generate significant revenue synergies from these complementary product sets, as well as quickly gain access to the US market—the world’s largest market for RRPs and one where regulators have embraced RRPs and other less harmful nicotine products. Looking at PM through our margin-of-safety criteria, the business trades for an undemanding valuation and has extraordinary business economics and a strong credit profile.”9.

Shares are down about 6% since I first wrote about it. However, we have received $8.93 per share in dividends, which is about 34% of the 2018 share price. So, with dividends included we’ve made 28% cumulatively over 5-years. Still not good, but not an impairment of capital either.Since 2018, EPD’s dividend yield has gone from 6.5% to 8% with the annual per share payout growing from $1.72 to $1.96, +14%. The pace of dividend growth has recently increased from about 2% to 5%+.

So, the balance sheet and cash flow metrics are in better shape than they were 5-years ago, and they were pretty good 5-years ago.The competitive dominance of the asset base, industry leading low leverage, and a founding family with multiple billions of dollars invested alongside us keep it a core holding in the portfolio.

Currently, 85% of the cell sites serving the Chicago area provide 5G Ultra Wideband using Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum. In addition to a rapid deployment of 5G Ultra Wideband service using C-band spectrum, engineers in Chicago have built 13 new macro cell sites and over 700 small cell sites to provide service throughout the community. Chicago’s exceptional 5G coverage uses a combination of mmWave spectrum and Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum. Verizon engineers are using 60 MHz of C-band spectrum to deliver 5G service to customers. By the end of the year, customers in Chicago will be able to take advantage of even more spectrum – more than doubling the bandwidth available now - as it becomes available for 5G Ultra Wideband. That additional bandwidth will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust services. Lastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in Chicago. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community requires upgraded fiber optic cable links. Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network. Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites in the Chicago area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.Over the last decade, working through nonprofit partners and a suite of programs and resources, Verizon Innovative Learning has committed $1 billion in market value to support digital equity and inclusion within education for some of the most vulnerable populations across the country. To date, the initiative has reached over 3 million students at schools across the U.S., including Title I schools.In the Chicago Public School District, over 4,500 new students will be welcomed to the Verizon Innovative Learning Schools program across seven schools in the 2023-2024 academic year - equipping them with free technology, internet access and innovative STEM learning programs.Additionally, all educators and students have access to Verizon Innovative Learning HQ, our free next-gen online education portal that provides XR content, professional development, and lesson plans. Through Citizen Verizon, the company’s responsible business plan, Verizon has a goal to provide 10 million youths with digital skills training by 2030.Verizon also offers free resources through Verizon Small Business Digital Ready, designed to help SMBs grow their business, including workshops, 1:1 and group coaching, webinars, networking events and mentorship opportunities with industry experts on topics ranging from customer care, employee experience, pivoting business during changing economic conditions and leveraging social media for growth.Supporting first responders who serve IllinoisLast year alone, the Verizon Frontline Crisis Response Team responded to 60 separate requests for support from nearly 25 different public safety agencies in Illinois, including those in and around the Chicago metropolitan area.During 2022, the Verizon Frontline Crisis Response Team helped enable mission-critical communications capabilities for Illinois first responders during emergency situations by delivering nearly 500 Verizon Frontline devices and solutions directly to the front lines.These solutions ranged from mobile hotspots, routers and smart devices to deployable satellite solutions, such as Satellite Picocells on Trailers (SPOTs) and more.The Verizon Frontline Crisis Response Team provides on-demand, emergency assistance during crisis situations to government agencies and first responders on a 24/7 basis. This support is provided at no cost to local agencies and represents a continuation of Verizon Frontline’s 30-year commitment to partnering with public safety.Love your network. Love your phone.For consumers, Chicago is a 5G Home and 5G Ultra Wideband city and one of the first cities in the world to get 5G-enabled smartphones connected to a 5G network.

Through a unique and mutually beneficial agreement, Verizon will place 14 pole-mounted small cell sites along the boardwalk, providing reliable and robust 4G and 5G Ultra Wideband cell service along the famous strip, while the city police department will populate those same poles, already connected with power and fiber, with cameras and public address horns to enhance public safety efforts.“This is a fantastic realization of what can happen when we look holistically at the needs of a community and work together to meet those needs,” said James Hoffman who manages Product Strategy and Global Network and Technology partnerships at Verizon. “We are thrilled to be part of this collaboration to bring communication and safety services to an area enjoyed by so many.”“Improved communication on the Boardwalk coupled with the enhancements to public safety will allow our residents and visitors to feel safe and stay connected while enjoying all we have to offer in this beautiful area,” said the Honorable Robert “Bobby” M. Dyer, Mayor of the City of Virginia Beach. “We couldn’t be more pleased with this collaboration.”The need and desire to connect has never been greater. In fact, Verizon saw a 53 percent increase in data usage on the network in 2022 versus 2021. Whether it’s video chatting with friends and family, ordering food or rides,sharing exciting moments in real time or streaming entertainment, the exponential increase in data is a driving force behind Verizon’s record fast deployment of 5G Ultra Wideband service, a service designed specifically for high-volume and fast speeds.Story continues“Along the boardwalk, we are deploying our most robust 5G service using our extreme capacity mmWave spectrum,” said Julie Slattery, VP of Engineering and Operations at Verizon. “By using this spectrum on the small cell design we and the city collaborated on, we will be able to offer massive capacity and an exceptionally good experience for residents who enjoy relaxed coastal living year-round and for the millions who flock to the Boardwalk for summer sun and events throughout the busy season.”That will be especially important as the city welcomes back the popular “Something in the Water” music festival this spring. The festival, which in the past has attracted approximately 40,000 visitors, is expecting its biggest crowd ever. At the Sea Hear Now music festival in Asbury Park last year, 35,000 attendees across the festivals’ two days used a whopping 10.8 TB of data. For context, 10.8TB of data is equal to one person streaming over two million songs for seven and a half years. Virginia Beach is expecting approximately 40,000 visitors around the Oceanfront stage over a three-day event this spring.“The city is ready and eager to welcome the music festival back, and the collaboration with Verizon will help provide the cameras and other safety equipment needed to ensure everyone has a safe and fun time together at this and other events,” said Dyer.All cellular and public safety services are scheduled to be fully deployed and operational along the Boardwalk this year.Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) was formed on June 30, 2000 and is one of the world’s leading providers of technology and communications services.

TPR, American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. AEO, Urban Outfitters, Inc. URBN and Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. BOOT.Industry: Retail - Apparel &amp; ShoesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2076796/4-retail-apparel-shoes-stocks-to-track-despite-industry-woesThe higher product cost, a tight labor market and supply-chain issues are some of the headwinds that players in the Zacks Retail - Apparel And Shoes industry have been encountering. These, along with the geopolitical turbulence due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, have been making things tough for companies. The demand for apparel has softened as consumers are spending more on necessities. Rising prices have squeezed consumers' disposable income.To navigate troubled waters, industry participants have been directing resources toward digital platforms, accelerating fleet optimization and augmenting the supply chain. Retailers have been focusing on the superior product strategy, the advancement of omnichannel capabilities, prudent capital investments and greater customer reach. Backed by these initiatives, companies like Tapestry, Inc., American Eagle Outfitters, Inc., Urban Outfitters, Inc. and Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. are better placed.About the IndustryThe Zacks Retail - Apparel And Shoes industry comprises companies that offer apparel, footwear, accessories, intimates and beauty products, as well as fitness and lifestyle products for use in yoga, training and sports under various brands in domestic and international markets. Quite a few players offer bag collections, including business cases, computer bags and backpacks, leather goods, such as wallets, card cases, travel organizers and belts, and watches, sunglasses, fragrances and ready-to-wear as well as cold-weather accessories.Markedly, companies showcase products to customers directly through their branded retail stores, mobile applications, catalogs and websites. Some industry participants also provide products via department stores, specialty retailers, third-party e-commerce sites and franchisees who operate brand-dedicated stores.Story continues4 Key Trends to Watch in the Retail - Apparel And Shoes IndustryPressure on Margins to Linger: The industry is quite fragmented, with companies vying for a bigger slice of the pie on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. To address these, a significant number of players in the industry have been investing in strengthening their digital ecosystem and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors bolster sales, they entail high costs.Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation, a tight labor market and supply-chain issues. Nonetheless, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks and adopting effective pricing policies.Soft Consumer Activity May Hit Revenues: Elevating prices and geopolitical concerns continue to pose a threat to consumer spending activity. Undoubtedly, the industry's prospects are correlated with the purchasing power of consumers. However, higher gasoline and food prices have been discomforting family budgets.Consequently, the demand for apparel has softened. Per the Commerce Department, U.S. retail and food services sales in February declined 0.4% sequentially. Sales at clothing &amp; clothing accessories outlets fell 0.8% on a month-on-month basis. Industry experts cited that any deterioration in macroeconomic conditions will hurt consumer confidence and, in turn, spending activity.Brand Enhancement, Capital Discipline: Industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, creating innovative and compelling products and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. The launch of newer styles, customization options and refreshed store environments enable them to woo shoppers.Efforts to enhance the brand portfolio via marketing strategies, buyouts, innovations and alliances are likely to keep supporting players in the space. The companies have been taking steps to strengthen their financial position. They have been making every move, from managing the inventory and closing underperforming stores to optimizing capital expenditures and enhancing operational efficiency.Diversification &amp; Digitization Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns and behavior, industry participants have been playing dual in-store and online roles. They are building an omnichannel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing the supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at a store, which are worth mentioning.Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers' product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, companies have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Retail - Apparel And Shoes industry is a group within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #163, which places it in the bottom 35% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates drab near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

389,2bb8ffc0-1799-3318-a23f-2b1fd9db05ec,TPR,2023-04-14,4 Retail-Apparel & Shoes Stocks to Track Despite Industry Woes,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-retail-apparel-shoes-stocks-135801795.html,1681221481,STORY,"['URBN', 'AEO', 'TPR', '^GSPC', 'BOOT']","[The higher product cost, a tight labor market and supply-chain issues are some of the headwinds that players in the Zacks Retail - Apparel And Shoes industry have been encountering. These, along with the geopolitical turbulence due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, have been making things tough for companies. The demand for apparel has softened as consumers are spending more on necessities. Rising prices have squeezed consumers’ disposable income.To navigate troubled waters, industry participants have been directing resources toward digital platforms, accelerating fleet optimization and augmenting the supply chain. Retailers have been focusing on the superior product strategy, the advancement of omnichannel capabilities, prudent capital investments and greater customer reach. Backed by these initiatives, companies like Tapestry, Inc. TPR, American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. AEO, Urban Outfitters, Inc. URBN and Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. BOOT are better placed.About the IndustryThe Zacks Retail - Apparel And Shoes industry comprises companies that offer apparel, footwear, accessories, intimates and beauty products, as well as fitness and lifestyle products for use in yoga, training and sports under various brands in domestic and international markets. Quite a few players offer bag collections, including business cases, computer bags and backpacks, leather goods, such as wallets, card cases, travel organizers and belts, and watches, sunglasses, fragrances and ready-to-wear as well as cold-weather accessories. Markedly, companies showcase products to customers directly through their branded retail stores, mobile applications, catalogs and websites. Some industry participants also provide products via department stores, specialty retailers, third-party e-commerce sites and franchisees who operate brand-dedicated stores.4 Key Trends to Watch in the Retail - Apparel And Shoes IndustryPressure on Margins to Linger: The industry is quite fragmented, with companies vying for a bigger slice of the pie on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. To address these, a significant number of players in the industry have been investing in strengthening their digital ecosystem and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors bolster sales, they entail high costs. Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation, a tight labor market and supply-chain issues. Nonetheless, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks and adopting effective pricing policies.Story continuesSoft Consumer Activity May Hit Revenues: Elevating prices and geopolitical concerns continue to pose a threat to consumer spending activity. Undoubtedly, the industry’s prospects are correlated with the purchasing power of consumers. However, higher gasoline and food prices have been discomforting family budgets. Consequently, the demand for apparel has softened. Per the Commerce Department, U.S. retail and food services sales in February declined 0.4% sequentially. Sales at clothing &amp; clothing accessories outlets fell 0.8% on a month-on-month basis. Industry experts cited that any deterioration in macroeconomic conditions will hurt consumer confidence and, in turn, spending activity.Brand Enhancement, Capital Discipline: Industry participants have been focusing on deepening engagements with consumers, creating innovative and compelling products and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities. The launch of newer styles, customization options and refreshed store environments enable them to woo shoppers. Efforts to enhance the brand portfolio via marketing strategies, buyouts, innovations and alliances are likely to keep supporting players in the space. The companies have been taking steps to strengthen their financial position. They have been making every move, from managing the inventory and closing underperforming stores to optimizing capital expenditures and enhancing operational efficiency.Diversification &amp; Digitization Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns and behavior, industry participants have been playing dual in-store and online roles. They are building an omnichannel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing the supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at a store, which are worth mentioning. Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, companies have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Retail - Apparel And Shoes industry is a group within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #163, which places it in the bottom 35% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates drab near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential.

390,2cf53faa-4bde-4e59-b1cb-9c9c8a8ef81c,SWK,2023-04-14,How is the economy doing? Home appliances suggest some weakness.,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-is-the-economy-doing-home-appliances-suggest-some-weakness-145616911.html,1681311376,STORY,"['HD', 'SWK', 'WHR', 'LOW', 'BBY']","[Much higher interest rates and a major housing market cooldown appear to be putting appliance sales through the spin cycle as seen in rising levels of discounting at major retailers such as Home Depot (HD) and Best Buy (BBY).""We have found that appliance markdowns are now well above the levels seen in the last two years and are now even above pre-pandemic levels,"" Bank of America analyst Elizabeth Suzuki wrote in a new client note on Wednesday.Suzuki's research reveals that promotions — or the percentages off the original prices — for appliances ranging from $500 to $5,000 at Home Depot averaged about 14% in March. That marks an increase from a 9% average promotion seen in March 2022.CHICAGO, IL - MARCH 24: A customer shops for appliances at a Home Depot store on March 24, 2015 in Chicago, Illinois. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)What could be more alarming to investors is that promotions on big-ticket items in all categories sold at Home Depot are running above 2019 levels year-to-date, according to Suzuki's research.Over at Best Buy, appliance promotions were roughly 20% on average in March. A year ago, promotions clocked in at an average of 18%.Meanwhile, the number of appliance categories offered on sale at Best Buy in 2023 (in other words, the breadth of promotions) is tracking above the average of the last three years, Suzuki noted.""This is likely a reflection of softening demand and increasing inventories,"" Suzuki said.To that end, sales in the building materials and appliances category are down 1.7% year to date, per the latest retail sales report.Appliance discounts pick up.The weakness in big-ticket goods such as appliances reflects a few factors.First, the higher cost of credit has made it much more expensive to purchase appliances that have been jacked up in price over two-plus years of inflation. The average credit card rate right now on a store card could be north of 20%, depending on the store and credit profile of the consumer.Second, consumers continue to show a propensity to buy services like summer vacations as opposed to hard goods post-pandemic.Story continuesAnd lastly, the housing markdown slowdown at the hands of rising interest rates has dented appliance demand.Existing home sales data for February showed a 22.6% year-over-year decline. Prices for those homes dropped 0.2% year over year. New home sales declined 19% in February versus the prior year.""We foresee macro headwinds to slowly turn into tailwinds as the year progresses,"" Whirpool CEO Marc Bitzer told analysts on an early February conference call. ""Needless to say that it is difficult to predict the exact timing of the shift in the macro cycle, but we would expect this to happen towards late Q2 or early Q3.""To combat the sales slowdown, Whirlpool (WHR) is looking to slash $800 million to $900 million in costs this year.Investors are taking a wait-and-see approach to appliance stocks. Whirlpool stock is down 5.7% year to date despite those promised cost cuts, lagging the 7.5% advance for the S&amp;P 500.Home Depot's stock is off by 7% on the year, while Best Buy has shed 6.9%. Lowe's stock (LOW) is up slightly year to date.Suzuki's data suggests that patience is the right call on these appliance names.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

391,95c125cf-e5a0-3337-9021-ff0dc3e6fe23,NVDA,2023-04-14,Is NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Recent Stock Performance Tethered To Its Strong Fundamentals?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-corporations-nasdaq-nvda-recent-110025031.html,1681470025,STORY,['NVDA'],"[NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 57% over the last three months. Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on NVIDIA's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for NVIDIA How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for NVIDIA is:20% = US$4.4b ÷ US$22b (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.20 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of NVIDIA's Earnings Growth And 20% ROETo begin with, NVIDIA seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 18%. This certainly adds some context to NVIDIA's moderate 19% net income growth seen over the past five years.Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that NVIDIA's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 27% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is NVIDIA fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is NVIDIA Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?NVIDIA has a low three-year median payout ratio of 7.1%, meaning that the company retains the remaining 93% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business.Additionally, NVIDIA has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 2.4% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 48% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with NVIDIA's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B) and NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Microsoft’s shares have gained +2.3% over the past year against the Zacks Computer - Software industry’s gain of +3.4%. The company is benefitting from consistent execution across renewal sales motions, including strong recapture rates and growth in Azure cloud platform amid accelerated global digital transformation.Slow yet steady performance of Office 365 and Dynamics is aiding user growth thereby driving the top-line. Strength in Marketing Solutions and steady performance in Talent Solutions is driving LinkedIn revenues boosted by recovery in advertising and job market. The Zacks analyst expects fiscal 2023 revenues to grow by 4.7% over fiscal 2022.However, a slowdown in its cloud business and declining videogame sales were headwinds. Decrease in Xbox content and services and Xbox hardware hurt gaming sales due to a decline in first-party content. Increasing spend on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space from Amazon is likely to dent margins.(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Berkshire Hathaway have outperformed the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry over the past six months (+15.4% vs. +14.2%). The company is one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies measured by premium volume. Berkshire's inorganic growth story remains impressive with strategic acquisitions. A strong cash position supports earnings-accretive bolt-on buyouts and indicates the financial flexibility.Continued insurance business growth fuels increase in float, drive earnings and generates maximum return on equity. The non-insurance businesses are delivering improved results with increased revenues over the past few years. A sturdy capital level provides further impetus.However, exposure to catastrophe loss induces earnings volatility and also affects the property and casualty underwriting results of Berkshire. Huge capital expenditure remains a headwind for the company.(You can read the full research report on Berkshire Hathaway here &gt;&gt;&gt;)NVIDIA’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past year (+24.7% vs. +10.4%).

The newly launched chip is powered by the company’s AI-enabled Ada Lovelace architecture to provide gamers with a whole new experience with more realistic images.NVIDIA revealed that RTX 4070 graphics cards would go on sale from Apr 13 onward at $599. The newly launched chip is believed to be the company’s mid-range GPU, which costs up to $1,599.Additionally, the GeForce RTX 4070 will be the company’s lowest-priced GPU chip, which uses its newest AI technology. NVDA stated that the Ada Lovelace architecture-powered chip would include features such as “DLSS 3 neural rendering, real-time ray-tracing technologies and the ability to run most modern games at over 100 frames per second at 1440p resolution.""NVIDIA Corporation Price and ConsensusNVIDIA Corporation Price and ConsensusNVIDIA Corporation price-consensus-chart | NVIDIA Corporation QuoteNVIDIA Gains Technological Edge From Ada LovelaceWe believe that NVIDIA’s Ada Lovelace architecture has provided it with a technological edge against its rivals in the graphics card space. Named after a 19th-century mathematician, who many consider the first computer programmer, Ada Lovelace architecture-based chips use AI to improve video game graphics.Ada Lovelace architecture-based GPUs are built by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company TSM with its so-called “4N” chip manufacturing technology. NVIDIA revealed that the GPUs come with Micron Technology’s MU GDDR6X memory and are claimed to have improvements across its shader cores, RT cores and Tensor cores.Ada Lovelace-powered graphics cards have the capability of improving existing games immediately, and the enhanced AI feature will learn from the gameplay. NVIDIA claims that the RTX 4070 chip will be 2.6 times faster than the RTX 2070 SUPER and 1.4 times faster than the GeForce RTX 3080 with DLSS 3.NVIDIA claims that the integration of the DLSS 3 feature tremendously boosts the performance of its Ada Lovelace GPUs. In addition to this, the newly launched RTX 4070 GPU “also excels in traditional games that do not include more advanced features such as ray tracing and DLSS,” the company said in a statement.Story continuesBuilt on Taiwan Semiconductor’s 4N chip manufacturing technology with Micron’s memory, NVIDIA’s RTX 4070 chip consumes nearly half the power compared with RTX 3080 and provides an additional 2 GB of memory. The RTX 4070 chip is accompanied by 36 MB of L2 cache and 12 GB of ultra-high-speed GDDR6X memory.With its sustained focus on developing new and more advanced products, NVIDIA has always maintained a significant technological gap against its rivals in the graphic card space.New Chip to Drive Gaming RevenuesPriced at $599, RTX 4070 chips are now NVIDIA’s cheapest available GPU, which uses AI technology. This will help the company drive gaming revenues, which have been negatively impacted by the weakening demand for its chips used in the gaming end market.NVDA’s Gaming revenues plunged 46% year over year to $1.83 billion and accounted for 30.3% of total fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to a lower sell-in of Gaming products. This reflected a reduction in channel partner inventory levels amid weak demand due to macroeconomic headwinds and lockdowns in China, which weighed on consumer demand.We believe that the lower-priced new GPU will help the company drive the demand for its gaming chips.Currently, NVIDIA and Micron each carry Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while Taiwan Semiconductor has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Shares of NVDA, MU and TSM have rallied 81.3%, 24% and 16.7%, respectively, year to date.A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Lattice Semiconductor LSCC, which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) is up about 24.4% so far this year (as of Apr 6, 2023). Tech stocks, in general, were in favor in the first quarter of 2023 as investors believe that the Fed could slow down or stop rate hikes (on signs of slowing inflation) in the near term. As growth sectors like technology fare better in a falling rate environment, chip stocks won.Moreover, tech stocks also benefited from their safe-haven status amid the banking turmoil in March.  U.S. tech stocks hit rough weather last year. But the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the United States, the buying of Credit Suisse by the UBS and the panic-selling in Deutsche Bank led investors to look for a safe haven in the equity space. In this pursuit, tech ETFs have lately emerged as winners.Apple AAPL gained 30%, while NVIDIA NVDA surged more than 90% in Q1. Moreover, the recent hype over artificial intelligence on ChatGpT’s success also favored Nvidia. Now, Nvidia is offering generative AI cloud services and hardware for enterprises (read: Best &amp; Worst Performing ETF Areas of Q1 2023).What Lies Ahead?It all depends on the global growth momentum, inflationary pressure, central banks’ moves and the supply-chain recovery. If inflationary pressure comes down and the central banks act dovish, this would be great news for the tech space (and chip too).However, there are some concerns. The electric car behemoth Tesla (TSLA) recently said that it is using fewer silicon carbide wafers since silicon carbide is an expensive semiconductor. The latest announcement went against the semiconductor space.In fact, this could be a trend in the EV market in the coming days as many EV makers may follow Tesla’s footsteps. However, this is just the beginning. It would take a whole lot of time for the deployment of silicon carbide to be no longer in use.Story continuesThe global economy is slowing. Some big economies may witness recession ahead. Consumers will also start reducing spending, which will result in struggling PC and smartphone demand. Then, enterprises will start to reduce spending in anticipation of a global recession. These are huge headwinds for the chip market.An industry survey for Electrical Equipment, Appliances &amp; Components in the United States revealed that new orders have started to ease in March. The supply -chain disruption — particularly in electronics — is still massive compared to the pre-pandemic conditions. The survey for Transportation Equipment also mentioned that “sales are slowing at an increasing rate.” These are alarming signs for the growth of the semiconductor space.Any Ray of Hope?Having said all, we would like to note that if the global economy manages a soft landing ahead instead of a recession, things may not prove detrimental for the chip space. This is especially true given the lucrative valuation of the semiconductor ETFs despite the recent rally.SPDR S&amp;P Semiconductor ETF XSD, VanEck Semiconductor ETF,iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF FTXL and Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXQ have P/E ratios of 20.85X, 20.35X, 20.34X, 18.91X and 15.08X, respectively.

But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For example, the McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) share price has soared 166% in the last three years. How nice for those who held the stock! In more good news, the share price has risen 8.9% in thirty days. But this could be related to good market conditions -- stocks in its market are up 5.6% in the last month.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. View our latest analysis for McKesson In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During three years of share price growth, McKesson moved from a loss to profitability. Given the importance of this milestone, it's not overly surprising that the share price has increased strongly.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that McKesson has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? Take a more thorough look at McKesson's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for McKesson the TSR over the last 3 years was 173%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that McKesson shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 14% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 21% a year, is even better. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Astrazeneca (AZN) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.87 a share, just 15 days from its upcoming earnings release on April 27, 2023.Astrazeneca's Earnings ESP sits at 2.96%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.87 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.85.AZN is one of just a large database of Medical stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is McKesson (MCK).McKesson is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on May 8, 2023. MCK's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $7.22 a share 26 days from its next earnings release.McKesson's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 1.22% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.13.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, AZN and MCK could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

402,87a0c76d-fbeb-37cb-9d9e-4b13e1d26959,MCK,2023-04-14,McKesson Europe (HMSE:CLS1) Has Some Difficulty Using Its Capital Effectively,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mckesson-europe-hmse-cls1-difficulty-124344736.html,1681303424,STORY,['MCK'],"[When researching a stock for investment, what can tell us that the company is in decline? A business that's potentially in decline often shows two trends, a return on capital employed (ROCE) that's declining, and a base of capital employed that's also declining. This indicates the company is producing less profit from its investments and its total assets are decreasing. On that note, looking into McKesson Europe (HMSE:CLS1), we weren't too upbeat about how things were going.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for McKesson Europe:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.024 = €69m ÷ (€5.1b - €2.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).Thus, McKesson Europe has an ROCE of 2.4%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Healthcare industry average of 5.9%. See our latest analysis for McKesson Europe roceHistorical performance is a great place to start when researching a stock so above you can see the gauge for McKesson Europe's ROCE against it's prior returns. If you're interested in investigating McKesson Europe's past further, check out this free graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.So How Is McKesson Europe's ROCE Trending?We are a bit worried about the trend of returns on capital at McKesson Europe. About five years ago, returns on capital were 9.1%, however they're now substantially lower than that as we saw above. On top of that, it's worth noting that the amount of capital employed within the business has remained relatively steady. Companies that exhibit these attributes tend to not be shrinking, but they can be mature and facing pressure on their margins from competition. So because these trends aren't typically conducive to creating a multi-bagger, we wouldn't hold our breath on McKesson Europe becoming one if things continue as they have.Story continuesOn a related note, McKesson Europe has decreased its current liabilities to 45% of total assets. So we could link some of this to the decrease in ROCE. What's more, this can reduce some aspects of risk to the business because now the company's suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of its operations. Since the business is basically funding more of its operations with it's own money, you could argue this has made the business less efficient at generating ROCE. Either way, they're still at a pretty high level, so we'd like to see them fall further if possible.The Bottom LineIn the end, the trend of lower returns on the same amount of capital isn't typically an indication that we're looking at a growth stock. In spite of that, the stock has delivered a 8.5% return to shareholders who held over the last five years. Regardless, we don't like the trends as they are and if they persist, we think you might find better investments elsewhere.Like most companies, McKesson Europe does come with some risks, and we've found 2 warning signs  that you should be aware of.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One company to watch right now is The Hanover Insurance Group (THG). THG is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 12.40, while its industry has an average P/E of 23.36. THG's Forward P/E has been as high as 15.57 and as low as 10.95, with a median of 13.06, all within the past year.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. THG has a P/S ratio of 0.84. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.9.If you're looking for another solid Insurance - Property and Casualty value stock, take a look at The Travelers Companies (TRV). TRV is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value score of A.Shares of The Travelers Companies currently holds a Forward P/E ratio of 11.75, and its PEG ratio is 1.10. In comparison, its industry sports average P/E and PEG ratios of 23.36 and 1.94.Story continuesOver the last 12 months, TRV's P/E has been as high as 14.22, as low as 10.46, with a median of 12.41, and its PEG ratio has been as high as 4.49, as low as 1.05, with a median of 2.64.Additionally, The Travelers Companies has a P/B ratio of 1.87 while its industry's price-to-book ratio sits at 1.46. For TRV, this valuation metric has been as high as 2.24, as low as 1.50, with a median of 1.81 over the past year.These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that The Hanover Insurance Group and The Travelers Companies are likely being undervalued right now.

406,04694b2f-6c65-3c93-a04a-3b1ce74dd347,APD,2023-04-14,New Technology Could Bring Hydrogen Into The Mainstream,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/technology-could-bring-hydrogen-mainstream-230100002.html,1681340460,STORY,"['CL=F', 'NG=F', 'FCEL', 'APD', 'BLDP', 'PLUG', 'BP']","[One of the world’s biggest challenges is slashing emissions before it’s too late. In fact, we’ve only got until 2050 in order to avoid some of the worst effects of climate change. And guess what? Asking people to ditch meat isn’t going to be enough.Even a drastic reduction in the use of fossil fuels alone won’t stop the Earth from reaching a point of no return.Solutions must come from every corner of the world, and cover every major industry and the power and process they use. And they need to come fast.That’s why the energy transition is a race that can only be won by the most advanced technologies and engineers with unique minds for creative solutions.Otherwise, we risk getting caught in a loop of perpetual motion with respect to greenhouse gas emissions.The story of hydrogen has been a cautionary tale to this end.The “greenest” hydrogen is now produced using electrolysis, a process powered by renewable energy. But it’s still too energy intensive and threatens to displace renewables from the grid, bringing us back to square one.The dirtier processes use 100% natural gas to produce hydrogen.North America needs more sustainable solutions–everywhere–and it’s running out of time.Enter GH Power. It’s a Canadian energy producer that may just have the answer. Its 1-25MW reactors use proprietary exothermic reactions to create three highly valuable green outputs: hydrogen, alumina (aluminum oxide) and exothermic heat that can be used to generate power for the grid. This smaller, modular reactor uses zero hydrocarbons and creates no carbon footprint offering flexible solutions based on the end-user. The reactor requires only a small amount of energy to start-up, and then it produces its green outputs at a cost that is significantly cheaper than existing processes such as electrolysis.The scaled-up 25MW version of this reactor planned for the future produces the same three green outputs using either pure hydrogen or hydrogen blends of natural gas in a turbine. This blend speaks to the heart of the energy transition that is working toward the development of a turbine that can run on 100% hydrogen. With existing turbine technology, GH Power’s scaled-up 25MW reactor will produce hydrogen, alumina and exothermic heat for a carbon footprint that is 25% lower than a system that is run on pure natural gas.Story continuesIt’s an exciting time for GH Power and its team of world-class engineers. They’ve successfully completed Phase 1 testing of their 1MW reactor in Hamilton, Ontario, and are reassembling it in a new facility and preparing it for commercial operations.Output #1 Hydrogen: The Race to Transform This Critical GasBy now, everyone knows that green hydrogen is our only pathway to an energy transition. The International Energy Agency (IEA) believes that the world will need 520 million tonnes of hydrogen to achieve net-zero targets by 2050. One way or another, clean hydrogen will power the world.Hydrogen is used to make ammonia-based fertilizer for global crops, an area in which going green has reached a critical juncture. Hydrogen could also be the only power source that could wean heavy industry off oil and gas. It could be the only way to decarbonize air travel and heavy shipping.Presently, hydrogen is produced most commonly either via natural gas reforming (gasification)--a carbon-intensive process–or through electrolysis, which is a clean but expensive and energy-intensive process. There are two huge challenges for hydrogen production: The first is getting the costs down to make it competitive with conventional transportation fuels. The second is mitigating the environmental impacts of the production processes.In other words, while hydrogen as an output is a green savior, if the inputs are transitional, and if it’s diverting renewable energy from the grid and forcing consumers to use more oil and gas as a result, then we’re back at square one.Using only water and aluminum–a “green” metal itself because it is highly recyclable–North American GH Power has developed a unique process using an exothermic reaction to create three outputs that are critical to a global energy transition: green hydrogen, green alumina and exothermic heat for power generation.An “exothermic” process means that heat is released by the reaction, taking the form of energy. This is the opposite of an endothermic reaction, in which energy is absorbed from the environment into the reaction.When GH Power builds its scaled-up 25MW reactor, it will give the world an opportunity to produce significantly cleaner hydrogen for significantly lower costs.“The only practical solutions for society to reduce carbon emissions is to transition from 100% fossil fuels to cleaner tech,” and one of the steps in tackling this is to blend hydrogen with fossil fuels and ramp up the hydrogen content whenever possible,” says Dave White, GH Power CEO and a veteran engineer in the power generation space.The hydrogen produced by GH Power provides users with a carbon-free power source, right in North America. The reactor requires only a small amount of start-up power, for approximately 30 minutes. Once it’s running at a steady state, it produces power back to the grid and it’s designed to run 24/7.And it’s all modular and built within the last-mile of the energy user. For hydrogen, it’s a huge competitive advantage to be able to build a plant right where it’s needed, without massive hydrogen storage facilities and without transportation needs.With a blend of 25% hydrogen and 75% natural gas, GH Power will burn 2,800 tonnes of Hydrogen/year and 1,091,391 MMBtu of natural gas per year. That’s a 25% reduction in carbon emissions compared to a turbine run on 100% natural gas. In other words, the scaled-up reactor saves the planet from 20,000 tons of carbon per year.  GH Power intends to ramp up to 40% hydrogen content in the short- medium-term once the plant is operational, shaving even more carbon off the world’s footprint.Flipping the switch on a turbine with a hydrogen/natural gas blend of 25/75 is set to make a huge splash, globally. The Paris climate target is a 40% reduction by 2050 of CO2, and there is not a single country that is even close to making that happen. It’s never been done on an industrial scale, and GH Power is hoping to raise the bar here with a first.This proprietary exothermic reaction technology is award-winning, globally. Most recently, GH Power was awarded $2.2 million in a grant under a joint program by the governments of Canada and Germany. The alliance with Germany will build on Canada’s Hydrogen Strategy and mark a step toward Canada’s objective of becoming a top global supplier of clean hydrogen. In fact, the alliance sees this all kickstarting a new Transatlantic supply chain for hydrogen, with Russia’s war on Ukraine lending significant momentum to these projects.For GH Power’s unique exothermic reactor solution, the economics make perfect sense. GH Power estimates that its process to produce green hydrogen costs significantly less than electrolysis. And its 1MW reactors don’t require any electricity from the grid, which eliminates further strain and cost on transmission and generation assets.The near-zero-carbon 1MW demonstration reactor will start generating revenues for GH Power in the third quarter of this year already. Construction/reassembly started on January 12 and will wrap up on April 14. Annually, this first reactor is forecast produce 120 million tons of hydrogen, 1,800 million tons of alumina, while outputting 1MW of energy via exothermic heat. The cost to complete this first-of-a-kind technology is $7 million, with historic capex is $3 million, with an initial rate of return of 31%.Once GH Power’s reactor is scaled up from 1MW to 25MW, electrical power generation will be produced from the recaptured exothermic reaction, sending approximately 2.5 MWe gross output to the grid. The other green outputs–hydrogen and alumina–will be directed to other commodity markets in significantly higher volume. And that’s where revenues start to look even more interesting.The scaled-up version has a projected EBIDTA of $51 million and an IRR of 45%.There’s a fourth revenue stream, as well–carbon credits. The team at GH Power is in the process of joining the Vera Carbon Pathway program, which provides a mechanism for generating and verifying carbon offset credits to add to the revenue stream. Initial estimates are that GH Power could produce 1.1 tons of carbon offset credits for every ton of alumina produced. The company should be selling carbon credits by April next year.Output #2: Alumina, The Essential Greening in the Shadow of HydrogenWhile hydrogen gets all the hype, the greening of aluminum oxide, or alumina, is critical if we are to meet our 2050 climate goals.Alumina is a highly valuable mainstay of countless industries. At its highest grades, it is used in LED lighting, semiconductors, electric vehicle batteries–and all of today’s key consumer electronics. At its lowest grades, it is used as an industrial abrasive and in the production of aluminum.Alumina demand is soaring, and we’re looking at a supply squeeze in the next few years.But we can’t just produce more alumina. We need to produce green alumina.Traditionally, bauxite refineries produce alumina by refining bauxite and raw aluminum ore. This refining, called the Bayer process, is toxic, and produces a byproduct called “red mud”. It is energy and chemically intensive and has a significant carbon footprint.Again, using only two inputs–aluminum and water–GH Power is setting out to change how we produce alumina. The green alumina it produces in its 1MW reactor, which is currently being prepped for commercial operations, leaves no carbon footprint.The GH Power reaction produces high-quality, high-purity aluminum oxide as a byproduct of the oxidizing reaction, which itself is virtually carbon-free.When the National Research Council of Canada conducted a life-cycle analysis (LCA) of GHP’s alumina production process, it concluded that it produces 85% fewer carbon emissions than the Bayer process. And GH Power is continually working to reduce the footprint even more by experimenting with different aluminum feedstocks, including recycled aluminum and end-of-life aluminum. The value of alumina should not be underestimated. While prices vary significantly depending on grade, for the highest grade, alumina fetches up to $50/kg.And GH Power has a clear cost advantage when it comes to production–and greening.As the aluminum slurry reacts with water in GH Power’s reactor, the oxygen leaves the water molecule and attaches to the aluminum. For every 1 kg of aluminum reacted, 1.8 kgs of green alumina is created.GH Power estimates that its cost to produce green alumina is over 85% cheaper than other existing processes.Direct competitors in alumina production, such as Alpha HPA, FYI Resources Limited and Altech Chemicals fall short on emissions, annual volume projections, production costs and estimated margins.GH Power’s forecast Capex per ton is only $555, compared to $20,000 for the closest competitor (Alpha HPA) and nearly $67,000 for Altech. It’s winning the margins game, too, with a margin estimate of 92% compared to the next highest, FYI Resources, at 75%. While Altech’s production cost is $9.9 per kilogram, GH Power is forecast to produce at only $2/kg.GH Power’s first commercial reactor in Ontario is expected to be producing 1,800 mt of alumina annually, potentially generating ~$6 million in annual revenues.And, importantly, GH Power’s 1MW reactor process for producing alumina gives us a zero-emissions product, while its three competitors are using carbon-heavy hydrochloric acid leaching and aluminous clay conversion.Output #3: Exothermic Heat, for Clean Power GenerationWhile hydrogen produced through electrolysis relies on a significant amount of constant renewable energy, removing that energy from the grid, GH Power’s reactor is returning clean energy to the grid through exothermic heat.It’s doing this only 30 minutes after startup, for a self-sustaining reaction.The market applications are truly diverse: This proprietary exothermic reaction technology can produce electricity to power homes and industries, steam to provide district heating, and fuel for cars, trucks, buses, trains–and even large sea-faring vessels. And its green hydrogen can be blended into existing natural gas pipelines to reduce carbon footprints.Approximately 50% of the energy from GH Power’s reactor can be turned into heat, steam or electricity. That will render the company a net power producer to the grid.The team at GH Power represents the leading minds in power generation, and collectively, they have commissioned over 20 power plants.Led by CEO Dave White, a power-generation facility construction veteran, GH Power has been quietly working on its boldest move in the sector yet. Once the reactor in Hamilton is up and running commercially, we could see a clear pathway to a future of rational green hydrogen production.When GH Power switches the switch on its first 1MW reactor in Hamilton, Ontario, the world will be watching the energy transition victory that started back in 2018, when engineers began experimenting for a breakthrough. That breakthrough came when these engineers–who today form GH Power–discovered that they could “react”, in a continuous manner, any form of aluminum, including aluminum waste, to create green hydrogen.Using only two inputs, zero hydrocarbons and only about 1% of the land required to produce solar energy, GH Power is gearing up to bring its first 1MW reactor online commercially. It’s a circular economic model that creates multiple revenue streams, with free cash flow expected in the third quarter of this year, and the company is looking at enhanced returns of 45% before tax credits and 70% after tax credits.  That’s only the beginning. GH Power has originated a pipeline of 5-30 MW power projects, around the world.Scalable, modular, affordable–and vastly cleaner, GH Power’s unique solution for three green outputs helps define how we can truly tackle the energy transition and contribute to net-zero emissions by 2050.There are a number of other companies working on hydrogen technology solutions.  BP (NYSE:BP) is a multinational energy company that has been involved in producing and distributing oil and gas for over a century. In recent years, however, the Big Oil icon has been betting big on a new fuel source: hydrogen technology.BP has acquired a 40.5% stake in a 26-gigawatt renewables project in Australia that could produce green hydrogen and is also looking to create its own hydrogen hub at the 133-year-old northwest Indiana refinery.The goal of these endeavors is to make hydrogen accessible and affordable for consumers by reducing the cost of production and distribution.

407,d581d565-a60a-3963-aa5a-2bd59473c879,GPC,2023-04-14,Genuine Parts (GPC) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/genuine-parts-gpc-earnings-expected-140102155.html,1681394462,STORY,['GPC'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Genuine Parts (GPC) reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 20. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis auto and industrial parts distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.02 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8.6%.Revenues are expected to be $5.69 billion, up 7.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Genuine Parts?For Genuine Parts, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.18%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Genuine Parts will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Genuine Parts would post earnings of $1.90 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.05, delivering a surprise of +7.89%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Genuine Parts doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The trial is one of the most closely watched U.S. defamation cases in years, involving a leading cable news outlet with numerous conservative commentators.Davis said he has ""more than enough jurors"" but will make his final selections on Monday before opening statements. The court will not be in session on Friday.Dominion sued Fox Corp and Fox News in 2021, accusing them of ruining its reputation by broadcasting false claims by Republican former President Donald Trump and his lawyers that the Denver-based company's voting machines were used to rig the outcome of the election against him and in favor of Democrat Joe Biden.The trial is considered a test of whether Fox's coverage crossed the line between ethical journalism and the pursuit of ratings, as Dominion alleges and Fox denies. Fox had argued that coverage of the vote-rigging claims was inherently newsworthy and protected by the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment guarantee of press freedom. Davis rejected that argument.The primary question for jurors will be whether Fox knowingly spread false information or recklessly disregarded the truth, the standard of ""actual malice"" Dominion must show to prevail in a defamation case.The jurors are being drawn from Delaware's New Castle County, where Democrats outnumber Republicans more than two-to-one, according to the state's Department of Elections. Biden represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate from 1973 until 2009.Story continuesFox News and its conservative commentators often were supportive of Trump during his presidency.Fox has argued in legal filings that Dominion's $1.6 billion damages request is ""untethered from reality"" and designed to enrich the company's investors.Davis on Wednesday sanctioned Fox News, handing Dominion a fresh chance to gather evidence after Fox withheld records until the eve of trial. This evidence included recordings made by a former Fox employee, Abby Grossberg, who is suing the network.Davis said he would also very likely tap an outside investigator to look into Fox's late disclosure of the evidence and take whatever steps necessary to remedy the situation, which the judge described as troubling.A Fox spokesperson said in a statement on Wednesday: ""As counsel explained to the court, Fox produced the supplemental information from Ms. Grossberg when we first learned it.""(Reporting by Helen Coster in New York; Additional reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware; Editing by Will Dunham, Noeleen Walder, Aurora Ellis and Cynthia Osterman)]"

Democratic President Joe Biden represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate from 1973 until 2009.Fox News and its conservative commentators were generally supportive of Trump during his presidency.The county’s political composition is likely to “make the defense nervous, but left-leaning people also tend to be in favor of freedom of the press,” said Melissa Gomez, president of MMG Jury Consulting.In Delaware, attorneys are not allowed to speak directly with potential jurors. Instead, Superior Court Judge Eric Davis -- who is presiding over the case -- will question them behind closed doors, using questions both sides have agreed to, including whether potential jurors have ever ""worked in a newsroom"" and whether “they regularly watch any Fox News programs.”Story continuesIf a prospective juror responds “yes,"" Davis may ask follow-up questions.After the judge identifies 36 potential jurors, they will be brought to the court room and each side's attorneys will have six ""peremptory strikes,"" in which they can dismiss a potential juror without giving a reason for doing so.The streamlined process allows for jury selection to happen more quickly than it does in some other states: Davis has allotted two days.But it also means both sides will have a harder time trying to identify prospective jurors’ political views, which could be relevant in this case, said Gomez.“If you have a juror who believes that the election was stolen, it will influence their position,” said Gomez. “Will the facts of the case actually matter to them if they have that underlying belief?”The questions are limited to prospective jurors’ experience rather than their attitudes.Questions that capture prospective jurors’ attitudes are more likely to predict how a juror will lean in the case, according to Christina Marinakis, a jury consulting and strategy advisor at IMS Consulting and Expert Services.“So you're sort of shooting blind when it comes to jury selection,” Marinakis said.Davis on Wednesday sanctioned Fox News, handing Dominion a fresh chance to gather evidence after Fox withheld records until the eve of trial, according to a source who is familiar with the case and was present during Wednesday's court hearing.Davis said he would also very likely tap an outside investigator to probe Fox's late disclosure of the evidence and take whatever steps necessary to remedy the situation, which he described as troubling, the source said.

But now the former president has come roaring back at the popular network for conservative viewers, most notably since his indictment in New York on hush-money charges.The Trump revival was on display Tuesday night, when Tucker Carlson devoted his entire prime-time program to a “historic interview” with him, promising more excerpts on Wednesday. It was two weeks after Sean Hannity similarly gave Trump extensive airtime.Left unmentioned were Carlson's two-year-old private text message s, revealed in a defamation case against the network, in which he disparaged Trump and talked eagerly of putting the former president behind him. In one of the exchanges, from Jan. 4, 2021, Carlson wrote that “we are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights” and “I truly can’t wait.”Trump’s return reverses what some had been calling a “soft ban” by Fox News, which had no on-air interviews with him between Sept. 22, 2022, and Hannity on March 27.“The short answer is, they need each other,” said Jane Hall, a journalism professor at American University and author of “Politics and the Media: Intersections and New Directions.”“He's getting attention, he's getting ratings, and cable news needs it because they've been down,” Hall said.Records released as part of Dominion Voting Systems $1.6 billion defamation case against the network and its parent company, Fox Corp., show that Fox repeatedly aired false allegations about the 2020 presidential elections as part of a bid to win back viewers angered that the network had called Arizona for Joe Biden on election night. The lawsuit also revealed how Fox executives and many of its star hosts, including Carlson, didn't believe those claims but aired them anyway.The judge presiding over that case said Wednesday he was inclined to order an independent review to determine whether the network had improperly withheld evidenceStory continuesA week ago, Fox News Channel carried in full Trump's speech from Mar-a-Lago on the day he was indicted by a Manhattan grand jury on charges that he falsified business records to conceal payments made ahead of the 2016 election to silence a porn star who says she and Trump had an extramarital sexual encounter years earlier; Trump denies the two had sex.The speech reached 6.7 million viewers, or about double the typical audience Carlson generally receives at the same time, the Nielsen company said.Fox says Trump's return is because of the news, not ratings. The Hannity interview was billed as Trump's first after his indictment, Carlson's the first after his arraignment, when the former president pleaded not guilty to the charges. Fox personalities and commentators leapt to his defense when news of the grand jury indictment came out.Trump's higher profile also coincides with his growing strength in polls of Republican voters, according to the network.While Fox News continues as the top-rated cable network, its prime-time viewership was down 18 percent in the first three months of the year, compared to 2022. CNN was down 34 percent in the same measurement and MSNBC was down 8 percent, Nielsen said.“They're in the business of fan service and right now conservative politics is all the Trump show,” said Charlie Sykes, a conservative and founder of the Bulwark website. “If the show is back in town, Fox can either try to counterprogram or buy into it. Right now, what is the counterprogramming?”Trump's return “was always inevitable,” said Sykes, also an MSNBC contributor. “They can't quit him. Fox knows what its audience wants and what its audience will accept.”If Fox wasn't quitting Trump, it surely had been pulling back.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, viewed as Trump's chief GOP rival, has made 12 appearances on Fox News this year — but none since March 13, according to the liberal advocacy group Media Matters for America, which monitors Fox.March 5-11 was the first week this year where the name “DeSantis” received more mentions (177) than “Trump” (142) on Fox, Media Matters said. Others recognized Trump's potency for their viewers as well: The same week, Trump was mentioned 925 times on MSNBC, compared to 268 for DeSantis.Back on Jan. 8, 2021, two days after the U.S. Capitol insurrection, Fox News founder Rupert Murdoch wrote in an email to a former Fox executive that the network was pivoting.“We want to make Trump a non-person,” Murdoch wrote, according to documents revealed as part of an elections technology company's defamation lawsuit against Fox.The trend away from Trump accelerated following the midterm elections when candidates he supported did more poorly than he expected. When he announced in November he was running again for president, Fox didn't carry his speech in full.Other Murdoch-controlled media properties were even harsher: The New York Post headlined its story: “Florida man makes announcement.” Following the midterms, a Wall Street Journal editorial was headlined, “Trump is the Republican Party's biggest loser.”Yet, as spring neared, Fox warmed again to the former president. The network carried Trump's entire 90-minute speech to the Conservative Political Action Committee live on the network March 4.Tuesday night, understandably, Carlson didn't talk about his critical texts and emails directed at Trump following the 2020 election, as seen in court papers related to the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit. Back in January 2021, when Carlson said his show was close to being able to ignore Trump most nights. he wrote, “I hate him passionately.""Carlson said in an interview with WABC radio last month that a wounded Trump had called him, seeking an explanation after the text messages became public. Carlson said he'd been angry about election information passed on by Trump's team that proved false.He told the radio station that he found Trump “funny and insightful” and that he spent four years on the air defending his policies.___More on Donald Trump-related investigations: https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump]"

Discovery.Video TranscriptDAVE BRIGGS: All right, the NBA playoffs are set to tip off this weekend after a regular season that broke some records. The league announcing this week it set new records for total and average attendance at games this season while selling out a record 791 games. The NBA hoping to carry that momentum into strong viewership numbers on ESPN and TNT this spring.Joining us now for what the NBA's success could mean for Warner Brothers Discovery and the overall outlook for the company amid the launch of new streaming platform Max is Brett Feldman, Goldman Sachs managing director. Good to see you, my friend. So curious with this new deal coming up, and obviously, Warner Brothers Discovery looks like a front runner with Disney. But how does the entrance of Amazon and Apple into the sports streaming world raise the price, or at least complicate the matter, for two companies that are in relative cutback mode?BRETT FELDMAN: Well, thanks for having me here. It's great to be on the show. It's really a question about competition. You had the word up there, streaming wars. Investors have been talking about streaming being a war for a long time. And really what the war is about is engagement. You're trying to get your consumers to sign up for your service and to stay with your service because when you have a cable or a satellite package, you pay for it as if it's a utility even if you're not technically in a contract. But you can toggle in and out of your streaming product any time you want.And I really think that yesterday's event, the Warner Brothers press event to announce a new Max product, was really them trying to show the market that they think they're building a streaming product that's going to create that level of engagement so that they can get to profitability over time.Story continuesRACHELLE AKUFFO: And so in terms of timelines then, when you look at what we're seeing with NBA attendance, how soon will that start translating, I guess, more so when we see the bottom lines for some of these streaming companies?BRETT FELDMAN: The question is obviously cost. If you look at what's going on with sports rights, the NFL contract that was signed not that long ago is the most recent example of it. These sports rights have been doubling or tripling in value as they go through a renewal cycle. That's exactly why the value of these teams have been going up so much, which you were talking about during the prior segment. Meanwhile, viewers are moving out of the paid TV ecosystem where they've been so much locked into their subscriptions and into an environment where they can toggle in and out, as we just talked about.So really what companies like Warner or any other traditional media company that has been a partner of the leagues has to do is figure out how to contain that cost because the overall value of the rights are going to keep going up. So they have to ask themselves, does it make sense to pay the full freight to maintain the package of games that I've had all along, or is there some way I can work with the leagues and maybe additional partners to get a contract where it's a manageable cost for me, it brings just enough entertainment, sports entertainment to my viewers, and I can grow and I can make some money?DAVE BRIGGS: Now it was interesting David Zaslav talking in this presentation about the sports assets they have, which are impressive-- March Madness, we mentioned the NBA, the NHL as well. But they will not be folded into Max, and neither will news, CNN. Why not? And at some point, do you think those are all under that streaming umbrella?BRETT FELDMAN: Well, really, we don't know. They kind of teased a little bit at the press event, saying that they do expect that they are going to have live news and sports as part of their streaming offering. But to your point, they didn't explicitly say that it was going to be part of Max. They also said we're going to come back and let you know what we're doing in a couple of months.I think what most investors assumed is that that means they think in a couple of months, they will have resolved their negotiations with the NBA, thereby knowing exactly what they can fold into their streaming service. And whether they're going to bring a separate service to market that is based on live news and sports or maybe whether it's some enhancement to the Max product, we just don't know yet.RACHELLE AKUFFO: And obviously, a lot of companies have been pulling back on their ad spend. What sort of opportunity does this open up?BRETT FELDMAN: Well, it's both sides of the coin if you're looking at a Warner Brothers Discovery. So in the case of Warner Brothers Discovery and many other traditional media companies like Paramount and Disney, what that means is that their traditional networks businesses are seeing a degree of pressure on advertising. That's not just because of the economy, but it's also because you are seeing more advertising inventory being made available to them on streaming platforms. In some cases, it's from the exact same companies, meaning Warner is offering advertisements on HBO or Max, as they're now calling it. Disney is now offering advertising slots on Disney+.And so I think the hope is that if some of the advertising spend that the advertisers are hoping to take away from those traditional channels moves into the streaming platforms, it's going to move on to their platforms. The problem is they're not the only ones out there with advertising. Netflix is out there with advertising. Obviously, there are some mainstays like YouTube and very popular platforms like Roku. So it may not necessarily be that advertising in aggregate is going down. The question is, where is it going?DAVE BRIGGS: I'd also question about where Disney is going. You are bullish on the company. Stock's up 13% this year. We've heard a lot about Bob Iger's plans to reorganize the company, about some cuts and about siloing off ESPN. But in terms of the catalyst for growth, what is it as you see Disney right now?BRETT FELDMAN: They got to figure out how to make money in streaming, and they'll tell you that is absolutely the number one priority for Bob Iger and his management team, as he goes through what is supposed to be a two-year stint in the CEO role. They had record losses in their streaming segment in their fiscal fourth quarter, which was two quarters ago. They lost $1 and 1/2 billion on streaming in that quarter alone. They were able to show some progress towards mitigating those losses as they moved into the early part of this fiscal year. And their anticipation is that they're going to break even or make some money at some point next year. But they still have to show investors how they're going to do that.And inevitably, what that means is that they're going to have to pay close attention to costs. They're also going to have to make sure that they are pricing their product effectively. One of the home runs that we've seen out of Disney very recently was a price increase on Disney+ that they flowed through the service late last year. It was nearly a 40% price increase. It's sort of unprecedented, the extent to which they took up price. And yet, according to the disclosures by management, it had almost no effect on their subscriber trends, meaning that what they've learned is that consumers continue to value their content, just as much in a streaming world as they have in the old world of movies and television.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Certainly seeing that spread throughout the ecosystem. Very interesting insight there, Brett Feldman. Thank you so much for joining us this afternoon.BRETT FELDMAN: Great to be here.]"

Discovery, Inc. Price and ConsensusWarner Bros. Discovery, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. QuoteMax’s Focus on Content to Boost the Top LineThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is looking to offer quality content with Max, which would also boost its top line. Shares of WBD have declined 45.9% in the past year compared with the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s fall of 15.2% in the same period. Max will bring Discovery+’s entertainment content and HBO Max’s premium content together to create an immersive experience for all ages. Max will regularly add fresh content to its platform with an average of 40 new seasons and titles every month.Max will have to compete with established players like Disney DIS, Netflix NFLX and Amazon.com’s AMZN Prime. Disney makes more sci-fi and superhero movies targeting kids and young adults with its content. Netflix makes more original movies and focuses on a larger audience. Netflix mainly targets young adults but the older customers also become a strong audience for its strong content. Amazon Prime appeals to audience aged between 18 and 34. They follow the content strategy of creating quality content in quantity.Upcoming projects of Max are Harry Potter series, The Big Bang Theory and The Penguin, which would give tough competition to Netflix’s Extraction 2, You: Season 4 and Still Time. Amazon’s upcoming projects are The Boys, DOM and Citadel while Disney’s forthcoming series are Star Wars: Visions, Loki Season 2 and Ironheart.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for WBD in 2023 is pegged at a profit of $1.18 per share, indicating year-over-year growth of 156.52%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the first quarter of 2023 is pegged at $10.72 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 239.22%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this entertainment company have returned +5.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry, which Disney falls in, has gained 5.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Disney is expected to post earnings of $0.89 per share, indicating a change of -17.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.98 points to a change of +12.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.46 indicates a change of +37.3% from what Disney is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Disney is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DIS _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Disney, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $22.07 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +14.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $90.25 billion and $96.67 billion estimates indicate +9.1% and +7.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDisney reported revenues of $23.51 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.8%. EPS of $0.99 for the same period compares with $1.06 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.34 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.76%. The EPS surprise was +43.48%.Over the last four quarters, Disney surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Disney is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Disney. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The bank’s earnings and revenues are expected to have increased from the year-ago reported figure.In the prior quarter, M&amp;T Bank surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on a rise in net interest income (NII), supported by solid loan demand and higher rates. However, an increase in credit costs and higher expenses acted as headwinds.M&amp;T Bank has a decent earnings surprise history, having surpassed estimates in two of the last four quarters, missed once and matched in the other. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 3.50%, on average.M&amp;T Bank Corporation Price and EPS Surprise M&amp;T Bank Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseM&amp;T Bank Corporation price-eps-surprise | M&amp;T Bank Corporation QuoteKey Factors to NoteNII: There was a considerable decline in commercial lending, as the lending environment weakened sequentially in the quarter. Given M&amp;T Bank’s substantial exposure to commercial and commercial real estate loans, the company is likely to have been affected. However, commercial real estate loans, residential real estate loans and consumer loans improved modestly in January and February per the Fed’s latest data.Management expected to witness growth in commercial and industrial loans in the quarter on the back of solid loan strength. Its average loan balances increased to $131.5 billion as of Feb 28, from $129.4 billion as of Dec 31, 2022. Also, MTB increased investments in securities to $2.5 billion (as of Feb 28), which is likely to have increased its average interest earning assets.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter average interest-earning assets of $179.9 billion suggests a marginal rise from the prior quarter’s reported number. We estimate the metric to be $170.2 billion.The Federal Reserve raised rates by 50 basis points in the quarter and 25 bps in the prior quarter. The policy rate reached 4.75-5%, the highest since 2008. Hence, decent loan growth and higher rates are likely to have a positive impact on the NII, partially offset by the higher deposit costs as the deposit mix has been shifting to higher cost products throughout the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter NII of $1.8 billion suggests a 1.42% decrease from the prior-quarter’s reported number. We estimate for the metric matches the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Fee Income: M&amp;T Bank is anticipated to have witnessed a decline in trust revenues on a disappointing equity market performance in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $195 is in line with the prior-quarter’s reported number. We estimate the trust income to be $201 million for the quarter.The company removed non-sufficient fund fees and overdraft protection transfer charges from linked-deposit accounts, as well as reduced overdraft fees to $15 in second-quarter 2022. This is likely to have an adverse impact on revenues from service charges on deposits in the to-be-reported quarter compared with the prior-year quarter.The purchase mortgage originations are expected to have continued to decline in the first quarter, whereas refinancing originations are anticipated to have been stable. Also, in the first quarter, mortgage rates remained almost stable, with the rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage reaching 6.32% in March. The rates have jumped from around 3% in the prior-year quarter.The climb in mortgage rates has taken a toll on the origination market. These factors are expected to have lowered MTB’s mortgage banking revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total other income of $569 million suggests a slip of 16.57% from the prior-quarter’s reported level. We estimate the metric to be $607 million.Expenses: The company’s expense base is expected to have been under pressure amid seasonally higher compensation expenses of $100-$105 million in the first quarter of 2023. Also, due to M&amp;T Bank’s acquisition of People’s United in second-quarter 2022, expenses in the quarter under review are likely to be elevated than that reported in the prior-year quarter.Managements’ expectation of increasing expenses sequentially in the quarter is likely to limit operational efficiency and bottom-line growth. We estimate the metric to be $1.4 billion.Story continuesHere is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for M&amp;T Bank this time around.

433,55e6502d-6a7e-32d5-bc34-908f1e2fa9a8,CL,2023-04-14,7 Best Stocks to Buy as Inflation Fears Creep Up,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-stocks-buy-inflation-012758911.html,1681176478,STORY,"['DG', 'SRE', 'FIVE', 'GO', 'MCY', 'CL', 'COST']","[While 2022 represented the year that saw inflation spike higher, the subsequent monetary tightening actions by the Federal Reserve cooled demand for the best stocks for inflation. However, a surprise threat from abroad – namely, the oil production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-member oil-producing nations – risk sending prices northward once again.True, the Fed could respond with even more monetary tightening. However, its hawkish policies over the trailing year appear to have made their impact. The latest employment opportunities data demonstrates that fewer positions are available from the prior count. Therefore, additional tightening could threaten a hard landing for the economy.It’s possible, then, that the Fed could be gingerly about its next policy actions (or do nothing at all). That might raise prices, which then may cynically bode well for these best stocks for inflation.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCLColgate-Palmolive$75.14FIVEFive Below$216.72SRESempra Energy$155.29GOGrocery Outlet$28.88COSTCostco$493.83DGDollar General$216.76MCYMercury General$33.13Colgate-Palmolive (CL)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comA multinational consumer goods giant, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) is one of the more sensible ideas among best stocks for inflation. Essentially, good times or bad, everyone needs to brush their teeth (or at least they should). Further, it’s always possible that consistent brushing may reduce chances of expensive dentist visits. To be clear, that’s not dental advice – just common sense.Financially, CL stock intrigues because of its stable nature. While it doesn’t offer the best metrics ever, CL keeps you in the game. For example, Colgate’s Altman Z-Score pings at 6.54, reflecting high stability and low risk of bankruptcy in the next two years. Operationally, it gets the job done with a three-year revenue growth rate of 5.5%, which is right in the middle.Story continuesHowever, Colgate does benefit from strong profitability. Its net margin comes in just under 10%, outpacing 79.57% of its peers. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg CL as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $79.13, implying almost 5% upside potential.Five Below (FIVE)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockA popular chain of specialty discount retailers, Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) ranks a cut above your typical dollar store. Here, Five Below sells most products for five bucks or less. As well, the company features a collection of intriguing merchandise priced from $6 to $25. Since the Jan. opener, FIVE gained more than 20% of its equity value. In the trailing year, it’s up by almost 22%.As one of the best stocks for inflation, Five Below may still have some legs left. On the balance sheet, the company enjoys a solid Altman Z-Score of 5.42. Operationally, the retailer’s three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 18.8%, outpacing 81.51% of its peers. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period is 18.6%.Better yet, Five Below is highly profitable. Its net margin is 8.5%, above 81.7% of companies in the cyclical retail industry. Lastly, covering analysts peg FIVE as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target is $220.89, implying nearly 7% upside potential.Sempra Energy (SRE)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comAs a public utility firm, Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) benefits richly from a natural monopoly. Basically, the barrier to entry in the utility space is so steep that most would-be competitors don’t even try. In addition, Sempra targets large swathes of the lucrative Southern California market. Symbolizing a sizable component of the economic engine of the U.S., SoCal makes SRE one of the best stocks for inflation.On a relative basis, you might say SRE is still undervalued. Since the Jan. opener, shares only gained a bit over 1%. In the past 365 days, it gave up almost 9% of its equity value. Admittedly, the financial prospects don’t seem appealing. Technically, its Altman Z-Score of 1.07 indicates a distressed enterprise.Here’s the thing: utilities typically don’t feature outstanding financial metrics. But for Sempra’s case, it’s profitable, enjoying a net margin of 14.8%. In closing, analysts peg SRE as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes in at $168.11, implying over 8% upside potential.Grocery Outlet (GO)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Fundamentally, Grocery Outlet (NASDAQ:GO) makes perfect sense as one of the best stocks for inflation. A discount closeout retailer, Grocery Outlet offers deeply discounted, overstocked and closeout products from name brands and private label suppliers. Obviously, with most households hurting from higher grocery prices, a business like Grocery Outlet should flourish.So far, though, GO has been disappointing. Since the Jan. opener, GO slipped by 3%. In the last year, it’s down by an alarming 22%. Admittedly, some of the pensiveness centers on the company not being so fiscally sound. For instance, its Altman Z-Score pings at 2.6, which sits in the grey zone of stability. Also, Grocery Outlet’s three-year revenue growth rate of 4.5% is middling.However, one attractive metric is its gross margin. At 30.52%, the company beats out 72.58% of the competition. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg GO as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes out to $30.56, implying 10% upside potential.Costco (COST)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comIf you’re looking for one of the best stocks for inflation from both an investor and consumer perspective, look no further than Costco (NASDAQ:COST). You can read my take on the topic at TipRanks if you wish. However, the bottom line is that Costco’s business encourages bulk shopping. That’s one of the most effective mechanisms to “beat” inflation. Also, the company caters to a wealthier demographic, insulating the brand from some headwinds.Financially as well, Costco delivers the goods. Up top, the retailer’s cash-to-debt ratio is 1.5 times, ranked better than 71.81% of its peers. Also, its Altman Z-Score pings at a lofty 7.24. Operationally, Costco enjoys an outstanding three-year revenue growth rate of 14%. Its EBITDA growth rate during the same period is 15.4%, besting 63.16% of the field. Also, its net margin is 2.58%, above 62.46% of rivals.Looking to the Street, analysts peg COST as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $550.33, implying over 13% upside potential.Dollar General (DG)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comA chain of variety stores, Dollar General (NYSE:DG) is an obvious choice for best stocks for inflation. One of the most popular dollar stores, Dollar General may be somewhat of a cynical play. With rising prices and hurting consumers, people will look to the retailer to help make ends meet. Thus, demand should swing higher.For now, though, DG stock finds itself down nearly 14% since the beginning of the year. In the past 365 days, it’s down to nearly the same magnitude. However, eventually, Dollar General enjoys a path forward from the malaise. In particular, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 15.9%, above 88.26% of the competition.On the bottom line, the firm’s net margin is 6.38%, outpacing 87.38% of rivals in the defensive retail industry. Finally, analysts peg DG as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $241, implying over 13% upside potential.Mercury General (MCY)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comUnder the context of best stocks for inflation, Mercury General (NYSE:MCY) enjoys a straightforward narrative. Given the vagaries of life, everyone should get insurance coverage. Further, since the Covid-19 crisis, the roads have gotten much more dangerous. Thus, it makes sense for people to protect their financial wellbeing.Despite the common-sense nature of Mercury, MCY slipped 5% since the start of the year. Moreover, in the trailing one-year period, shares stumbled over 40%. To be fair, Mercury could use some help in the financials, ironically enough. Perhaps most glaringly, its three-year revenue growth rate sits at 2.9% below breakeven.However, the pandemic did a number on Mercury’s business.

According to people familiar with the proceedings, the transaction is likely to generate about $1 billion in sale proceeds if consummated.In 2015, IBM acquired The Weather Company to leverage its own cloud infrastructure to provide accurate weather forecasts around the globe that aggregate more than 25 billion forecasts a day. The company expected to profit from the wave of data-crunching software by improving the Weather Company’s modeling technology and developing a new generation of predictive applications for incremental revenues.However, over a period of time, IBM has streamlined its operations in order to focus on its core hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence businesses. It has spun off its legacy Managed Infrastructure Services business in a bid to accelerate its hybrid cloud growth strategy, with a focus on enabling clients with accelerated digital transformation. It has further restructured its segments post the separation of its managed infrastructure services business from Kyndryl.IBM expects growth to be driven primarily by analytics, cloud computing and security services. A better business mix, improving operating leverage through productivity gains and increased investments in growth opportunities will likely drive its profitability.The company has expanded its partner relationships in AI, network automation and security to help the telecommunications industry evolve as 5G and Edge Computing take center stage. It has extended the secured cloud services for business enterprises while improving their performance through reduced latency and higher data security features.In addition, the acquisition of Red Hat has bolstered the Open Hybrid architecture initiative of the company. The deal marks IBM’s largest acquisition ever, and the combined company is likely to alter the dynamics of “the cloud market for business.” Specifically, IBM hopes to leverage Red Hat to help it become the world’s largest hybrid cloud platform provider.More than 4,000 clients are utilizing Red Hat and IBM’s hybrid cloud platform. We remain bullish regarding improving the utility of hybrid cloud services based on the architecture built by IBM and Red Hat by notable clients, including American Express, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone, Banco Sabadell, Broadridge Financial Solutions and Caixa Bank. Red Hat’s expanding foothold across the Asia Pacific is also anticipated to bolster IBM’s TAM (total addressable market).The stock has gained 1.5% over the past year against the industry’s decline of 7.7%.

NOK, Juniper Networks, Inc. JNPR and InterDigital Inc. IDCC.Industry: WirelessLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2077379/3-wireless-stocks-set-to-transcend-margin-woes-on-solid-demandThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry appears well poised to benefit from healthy demand trends with an accelerated pace of 5G deployment and fiber network infrastructure upgrade. However, large-scale investments to support the 5G transition, margin erosion due to price wars, higher customer inventory levels and inflated raw material costs amid a challenging macroeconomic environment and supply chain adversities might erode profitability.Nevertheless, Nokia Corp., Juniper Networks, Inc. and InterDigital Inc. are likely to profit from the increasing demand for state-of-the-art wireless products with a vast proliferation of IoT, fiber densification and a gradual shift to cloud services.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry primarily comprises companies that provide various networking solutions, wireless telecom products and related services for wireless voice and data communications through scalable modular platforms. Their product portfolio encompasses integrated circuit devices (chips) and system software for wireless voice and data communications, analog and digital two-way radio, satellite telecommunications, wireless networking and signal processing, and end-to-end enterprise mobility solutions.The firms also provide a broad range of routing, switching and security products, video surveillance and machine-to-machine communication components that secure VPN appliances, enable intrusion detection and thwart data theft. Some firms even provide electronic warfare, avionics, robotics, advanced communications and maritime systems to the defense industry.What's Shaping the Future of the Wireless Equipment Industry?Fiber Densification, 5G Coverage Expansion: With the exponential growth of mobile broadband traffic and home Internet solutions, demand for advanced networking architecture has increased manifold. This has forced service providers to spend more on routers and switches to upgrade their networks and support the surge in home data traffic.Story continuesA faster pace of 5G deployment is expected to augment the scalability, security and universal mobility of the telecommunications industry and propel the wide proliferation of IoT. Expansion of fiber optic networks to support 4G LTE and 5G wireless standards, as well as wireline connections, are likely to act as tailwinds. The fiber-optic cable network is vital for backhaul and the last mile local loop, which are required by wireless service providers for 5G deployment.Fiber networks are also essential for the growing deployment of small cells that bring the network closer to the user and supplement macro networks to provide extensive coverage. The industry participants are facilitating its customers to move away from an economy-of-scale network operating model to demand-driven operations and seamlessly migrate to 5G by offering easy programmability and flexible automation through steady infrastructure investments.Margin Woes Deter Growth: Although higher infrastructure investments will eventually help minimize service delivery costs to support broadband competition and wireless densification, short-term profitability has largely been compromised. Margins are likely to be affected by the high cost of first-generation 5G products, profitability challenges in China, the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war and pricing pressure in early 5G deals.Uncertainty regarding chip shortage and supply-chain disruptions leading to a dearth of essential fiber materials, shipping delays and shortages of other raw materials are likely to affect the expansion and rollout of new broadband networks. Extended lead times for basic components are also likely to hurt the delivery schedule and escalate production costs.Further, the high technological obsolescence of most products has escalated operating costs with steady investments in R&amp;D. High customer inventory levels owing to a challenging macroeconomic environment and intense market volatility remain another headwind for the companies.Integrated Service Offering with Cloud Focus: The majority of the industry participants offer mission-critical communication infrastructure, devices, accessories, software and services that enable its customers to run businesses with increased efficiency and safety for their mobile workforce. These systems drive demand for additional device sales, software upgrades, infrastructure overhaul and expansion, as well as additional services to maintain, monitor and manage these complex networks and solutions.The comprehensive suite of services ensures continuity and reduces risks for constant critical communication operations. The wide proliferation of cloud networking solutions is further resulting in increased storage and computing on a virtual plane. As both consumers and enterprises use the network, there is tremendous demand for quality networking equipment.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bullish ProspectsThe Zacks Wireless Equipment industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector.

The company is currently acquiring new recycling businesses to grow its overall reach and was recently acquired by a fund managed by Macquarie Asset Management, which will further the recycling company’s growth capabilities.The rapid growth has elevated DTG from a small business with a few dozen employees to an enterprise-level company with nearly one thousand employees. Clausen also anticipates customer demand will also rise with DTG’s growth, expecting call volumes will double from 10,000 calls per month to 20,000.With this business growth came an increased demand on DTG’s backend network. A majority of DTG’s operations are cloud-based, with documents and payments being handled electronically. Not only would Clausen and his IT team need reliable service and security features for the various network underlays at each of the company’s locations, they would also need a solution that made it easy for the small team to monitor and manage DTG’s growing footprint.DTG partnered with Comcast Business to help keep their backend network operations nimble. With SD-WAN on the ActiveCoreSM SDN Platform, DTG has real-time visibility into its expanding network presence as well as unified threat management tools that help the company respond to network security breaches quickly. The Comcast Business solution also helps to ensure that new acquisitions are onboarded to the DTG network quickly and efficiently. Plus, Comcast Business engineers also monitor the company’s network and provide on-demand support in instances of network threats or outages.Story continues“It is essential that businesses looking to grow their operations have in place technology solutions that can simplify IT resource management, so that leaders can be better focused on innovating and ensuring their businesses remain agile,” said Rob Brenner, vice president of Comcast Business for Comcast’s Pacific Northwest Region. “Our partnership with DTG is a testament to the growth potential of all small businesses, and the impact that a secure, centralized network control solution can have.”About Comcast BusinessComcast Business offers a suite of Connectivity, Communications, Networking, Cybersecurity, Wireless, and Managed Solutions to help organizations of different sizes prepare for what’s next.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Comcast Comcast Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP, Daniel Murdock, for US$397k worth of shares, at about US$44.50 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$37.64. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.Insiders in Comcast didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like Comcast better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Comcast insiders own 0.9% of the company, worth about US$1.5b. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Comcast Insider Transactions Indicate?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Comcast shares in the last quarter. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Comcast insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. For example - Comcast has 3 warning signs we think you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best 5% Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Analysts. High-dividend stocks can be an attractive option for investors who are seeking regular income from their investments. However, it's important to note that a high dividend yield can sometimes indicate that the stock price has fallen significantly, which may indicate a riskier investment. It's also important to consider the company's financial health and growth potential, as well as the overall market conditions. According to analysts, dividend yields between 3% to 6% are considered healthy.The current high-interest rates environment has turned investors’ attention toward high-dividend stocks because of their ability to generate stable income. Historically, dividend stocks have massively contributed to the market returns overall, especially during periods when interest rates were high. Since 1926, dividend stocks represented nearly one-third of the S&amp;P 500’s total return and accounted for over 50% during decades with elevated interest rates and slowing growth, as reported by iShares. Last year’s returns show the outperformance of dividend stocks over the wider market. The iShares Core High Dividend ETF, which tracks the performance of relatively high-dividend-paying US equities, gained 7.1% in 2022, compared with an 18.1% decline in the S&amp;P 500. Moreover, the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Payers fell by only 7.6% last year, which is less severe than a 21.1% drop in the S&amp;P 500 Non-Dividend Payers.United Overseas Bank published a report in collaboration with JPMorgan Asset Management, stressing the positive performance of high-dividend stocks over the years. The report mentioned that the MSCI World High Index gained 3.7% from July 2007 to August 2022 with a volatility of 13.3%. In comparison, MSCI World returned 2.1% during this period with high volatility of 16%.Story continuesAnalysts are also presenting a positive stance on quality dividend companies during this period of financial uncertainty. Michael Clarfeld, ClearBridge Investments portfolio manager, spoke to CNBC about dividend companies. Here are some comments from the analyst:“High-quality dividend growers are a good place to be. The upfront yield provides strong downside support and the dividend growth provides a meaningful headwind against rising interest rates and preserves purchasing power.”Some of the best dividend stocks with high yields include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) because of their strong dividend policies. To know more about high-dividend stocks, readers can have a look at 15 Best High Yield Dividend Stocks to Buy.11 Best 5% Dividend Stocks To Buy According To AnalystsPhoto by Austin Distel on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this article, we first screened for dividend stocks with yields above 5%. From the resultant list, we selected companies that have raised their dividends for at least 5 years. We then found the average price targets and ratings of these stocks placed by Wall Street analysts and other investment firms and narrowed them down to the stocks with strongest upside potential based on their current share price and their average price targets. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the upside potential as of April 12.11 Best 5% Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Analysts11. Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO)Upside Potential as of April 12: 8.29%Average Price Target Based on Analyst Ratings: $48.8Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) deals in the manufacturing of tobacco, cigarettes, and other related products. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the company posted net revenue of over $6.1 billion, which showed a 2.3% decline from the same period last year. It remained committed to its shareholder obligation, returning $1.7 billion to investors during the quarter, which places it as one of the best dividend stocks on our list.In addition to Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) are other high-dividend stocks favored by investors.Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.94 per share and has a dividend yield of 8.39%, as of April 12. The company maintains a 53-year streak of consistent dividend growth. According to analysts, the stock has an upside potential of 8.29%, as of April 12.At the end of Q4 2022, 45 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO), compared with 47 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a total value of over $1.8 billion.Broyhill Asset Management mentioned Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We rebalanced our tobacco exposure during the year, reducing our investment in Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) as the future of the company’s combustible cigarette business became increasingly questionable given pending US legislation and a lackluster portfolio of reduced risk products. We reinvested the proceeds in Philip Morris so that relative position sizing is more consistent with our increased conviction.”10. Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM)Upside Potential as of April 12: 14.3%Average Price Target Based on Analyst Ratings: $112.7Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is an American multinational tobacco company that also specializes in other nicotine-containing products. On March 9, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $1.27 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend. It is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as it holds a 14-year track record of consistent dividend growth. As of April 12, the stock has a dividend yield of 5.14%.In March, JPMorgan upgraded Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) to Overweight and also raised its price target on the stock to $116, presenting a positive outlook on the company's earnings growth.In the fourth quarter of 2022, Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) reported revenue of $8.1 billion, which showed a 0.59% growth from the same period last year. At the end of December 2022, the company had over $3.2 billion available in cash and cash equivalents.As per Insider Monkey's Q4 2022 database, 47 hedge funds owned stakes in Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), with a total value of over $6.2 billion. Among these elite funds, GQG Partners was the company's leading stakeholder in Q4.Artisan Partners mentioned Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Our top individual contributors were Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), EOG Resources and Merck. Despite being US-based, tobacco company PM derives all its sales from outside the US. As a result, foreign exchange impacts can be an important driver of near-term returns, and the recent weakening in the US dollar should provide a strong tailwind for earnings due to translation effects. However, our investment case is not tied to currency movements. By virtue of its globally known brands, PM is the best-in-class operator with a well-diversified business, particularly by geography. We believe its next generation heat-not-burn product IQOS should gain share as consumers continue migrating to safer tobacco delivery systems. The company is progressing toward its acquisition of Swedish Match, a Swedish tobacco and nicotine products maker, which was previously held in the portfolio. The deal is a good fit for PM as it reduces PM’s dependence on cigarettes—a category in steady decline—and accelerates the company’s transition to smokeless “reduced-risk” products (RRPs)—a category that has experienced rapid growth over the past five years. PM can also leverage its global scale to generate significant revenue synergies from these complementary product sets, as well as quickly gain access to the US market—the world’s largest market for RRPs and one where regulators have embraced RRPs and other less harmful nicotine products. Looking at PM through our margin-of-safety criteria, the business trades for an undemanding valuation and has extraordinary business economics and a strong credit profile.”9.

Here is what the firm has to say:“There are a few other segments of our portfolios that displayed weakness in the quarter. Cable and telecommunication companies have been an area that has lagged the broader market as their worlds are increasingly colliding. Companies such as Verizon (NYSE:VZ) has been impacted as wireless operator is spending heavily to attract internet subscribers with fixed wired access and the cable companies are trying to build wireless businesses.”7.

(NYSE:EPD) is still owned in the fund and remains one of our largest positions, as it has been since the partnership was founded. This has not been a great investment. Shares are down about 6% since I first wrote about it. However, we have received $8.93 per share in dividends, which is about 34% of the 2018 share price. So, with dividends included we’ve made 28% cumulatively over 5-years. Still not good, but not an impairment of capital either.Since 2018, EPD’s dividend yield has gone from 6.5% to 8% with the annual per share payout growing from $1.72 to $1.96, +14%. The pace of dividend growth has recently increased from about 2% to 5%+. Additionally, Distributable Cash Flow per share (what could be paid to us if management wanted to) has increased 22%, from $2.73 to $3.33, while leverage has come down a little over ½ a turn. So, the balance sheet and cash flow metrics are in better shape than they were 5-years ago, and they were pretty good 5-years ago.The competitive dominance of the asset base, industry leading low leverage, and a founding family with multiple billions of dollars invested alongside us keep it a core holding in the portfolio. We’ll continue to own this company unless the shares become meaningfully overvalued, and if it gets cheaper, we would be very comfortable owning more.”6. The Williams Companies, Inc.

444,507d51ec-fc68-3094-b947-cba6203455d8,PRU,2023-04-14,Investors in Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) have made a notable return of 82% over the past three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-prudential-financial-nyse-pru-140036572.html,1681394436,STORY,['PRU'],"[While Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) shareholders are probably generally happy, the stock hasn't had particularly good run recently, with the share price falling 15% in the last quarter. But we wouldn't complain about the gain over the last three years. It beat the market return of 52% in that time, gaining 56%.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for Prudential Financial In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over the last three years, Prudential Financial failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 0.7% (annualized).Based on these numbers, we think that the decline in earnings per share may not be a good representation of how the business has changed over the years. So other metrics may hold the key to understanding what is influencing investors.Interestingly, the dividend has increased over time; so that may have given the share price a boost. It could be that the company is reaching maturity and dividend investors are buying for the yield.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthPrudential Financial is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Prudential Financial will earn in the future (free analyst consensus estimates)What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Prudential Financial, it has a TSR of 82% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 8.8% in the twelve months, Prudential Financial shareholders did even worse, losing 24% (even including dividends). Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 0.3% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

Brands, Inc.'s (NYSE:YUM ) insider transactions over the last year, we can see that insiders were net sellers. That is, there were more number of shares sold by insiders than there were purchased.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Yum! Brands The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Yum! BrandsOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the COO &amp; Chief People Officer, Tracy Skeans, for US$510k worth of shares, at about US$130 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at below the current price (US$132). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was only 14% of Tracy Skeans's holding. Tracy Skeans was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Yum! Brands Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Yum! Brands. In total, COO &amp; Chief People Officer Tracy Skeans sold US$510k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Insider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It appears that Yum! Brands insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$42m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Yum! Brands Insiders?An insider hasn't bought Yum! Brands stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. Insiders own shares, but we're still pretty cautious, given the history of sales. We'd practice some caution before buying! So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Our analysis shows 4 warning signs for Yum! Brands (2 are significant!) and we strongly recommend you look at these before investing.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

Aon (AON), which belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry, could be a great candidate to consider.When looking at the last two reports, this insurance brokerage has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 3.25%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, Aon came out with earnings of $3.89 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.67 per share, representing a surprise of 5.99%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $2.01 per share and it actually produced earnings of $2.02 per share, delivering a surprise of 0.50%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Aon, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Aon has an Earnings ESP of +1.31% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on April 28, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Specifically, during the week ending March 22, Yahoo Finance reported that depositors drained $126 billion from U.S. banks. Unlike prior such transactions, this time around, the outflow originated from the nation’s largest institutions.Put another way, regular folks are reading between the lines. Additionally, with banking jitters going abroad and surprise production cuts spiking the price of crude oil, the Federal Reserve’s problems overflow the table. There’s only so much that one entity can do, contributing to the pessimism. About the only solution now may be to consider these safe stocks to buy.MSFTMicrosoft$289.39PGProcter &amp; Gamble$150.96MCDMcDonald’s$283.78OLLIOllie’s Bargain Outlet$59.10INTUIntuit$444.72ALLAllstate$116.11ADMArcher Daniels Midland$80.05InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMicrosoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comAs a technology giant, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) might not be everyone’s idea for safe stocks to buy. After all, the mass layoffs that have been occurring since last year mostly impacted the tech sector. Nevertheless, Microsoft is also indispensable in the business world. Basically, if you operate a PC, you must be fluent in Microsoft’s core applications or risk falling behind.Another factor that makes MSFT one of the safe stocks to buy centers on its financial resilience. For example, on the balance sheet, Microsoft features a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.61, above nearly 63% of software companies. Also, its Altman Z-Score pings at 9.14, indicating high stability and very low risk of bankruptcy.As well, the enterprise benefits from a solid revenue trek and a net margin of 33%, well above the competition. Finally, covering analysts peg MSFT as a consensus strong buy. On average, their price target comes out to $297.25, implying 2% upside potential.Story continuesProcter &amp; Gamble (PG)Procter &amp; Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&amp;G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods CompanySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comA multinational consumer goods corporation, Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) specializes in a wide range of personal health/consumer health, personal care and hygiene products. Let’s put it another way. No matter what goes on with the economy, people still need to take care of themselves (physically). Therefore, PG ranks among the safe stocks to buy.Yes, Procter &amp; Gamble is a boring company – there’s no question about it. But it’s also this nature that makes it enticing during this hour. For example, the company enjoys solid stability in the balance sheet, marked by an Altman Z-Score of 5.35.Operationally, the company gets the job done with a three-year revenue growth rate of 5.8%. Here, the enterprise beats out 51.12% of its rivals, which is okay. However, its net margin storms out of the gates at 17.79%, beating out almost 92% of sector peers. Lastly, analysts peg PG as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $157.85, implying nearly 4% upside potential.McDonald’s (MCD)Source: ShutterstockA fast-food icon and a symbol of American capitalism, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) really needs no introduction. As a result, you might say that MCD represents an obvious choice for safe stocks to buy. Fundamentally, the company benefits from the trade-down effect. Rather than picking up your morning coffee (and breakfast items) at an expensive café, you can head down to a cheaper McCafe.Financially, McDonald’s delivers the core elements of a leading example of safe stocks to buy. On the balance sheet, the company enjoys an Altman Z-Score of 4.94, sitting in the safe zone of fiscal stability. Operationally, the Golden Arches prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 3.8%, beating out 72.81% of its peers.Perhaps most significantly, McDonald’s is hugely profitable. Its net margin stands at 26.65%, above 96.57% of companies in the restaurants industry. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg MCD as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $296.04, implying nearly 5% upside potential.Ollie’s Bargain Outlet (OLLI)Woman at the supermarket checkout, she is paying using a credit card, shopping and retail conceptSource: ShutterstockA favorite idea among safe stocks to buy, Ollie’s Bargain Outlet (NASDAQ:OLLI) enjoys significant relevance as a discount retailer. However, it’s more than just that. With Ollie’s offering unsold or overstocked items with brand-name labels, the business is simply more attractive to consumers. Indeed, since the start of the year, OLLI gained over 24% of equity value. In the trailing year, it’s up nearly 14%.Financially, Ollie’s continues to entice onlookers. Notably, the company benefits from fiscal stability. Its equity-to-asset ratio is 0.67 times, above 83.17% of its peers. Further, its Altman Z-Score pings at 5.25, reflecting low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate is 10.9%, above 75.44% of the field.As well, its net margin comes out to 5.63%, ranked better than 85% of firms in the defensive retail industry. Looking to the Street, analysts peg OLLI as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target is $62, implying almost 7% upside potential.Intuit (INTU)Stacks of coins hold up wooden blocks that spell out ""TAX."" FairTaxSource: ShutterstockA business software company, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) specializes in financial software. Intuit’s products include the tax preparation application TurboTax, personal finance app Mint, the small business accounting program QuickBooks, the credit monitoring service Credit Karma and email marketing platform Mailchimp. Since the start of the year, INTU gained over 14% of equity value.Yes, it’s down more than 7% in the trailing one-year period. Still, as the nature of work evolves and people consider jumping to the gig economy, the tax implications associated with gig workers (independent contractors) should bolster INTU. For now, it ranks as one of the safe stocks to buy because of high stability in the balance sheet and strong operational metrics.In particular, it’s worth pointing out the three-year revenue growth rate of 20.4% and net margin of 14.22%. Both stats rank above their respective industry median values. To close out, analysts peg INTU as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $478.94, implying over 7% upside potential.Allstate (ALL)Allstate Insurance officeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAs a major player in the insurance business, Allstate (NYSE:ALL) easily ranks among the safe stocks to buy. It’s not that it has sterling financials. Rather, the company benefits from extreme relevance. Under any circumstance, acquiring financial protection represents a common-sense virtue. But in the wildness associated with the post-pandemic ecosystem, financial protection becomes even more pertinent.To be fair, though, investors don’t quite see the connection between the narrative and the price action. Since the Jan. opener, ALL slipped almost 16%. In the trailing year, it fell nearly 19%. Nevertheless, the company could make a comeback following the Covid-19 malaise.Notably, Allstate’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 14.2%, ranked above 79% of its peers. Also, ALL trades at 0.61-times trailing sales. In contrast, the sector median value is 0.93 times.Finally, analysts peg ALL as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $137.17, implying 19% upside potential.Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)Source: ©iStock.com/AndreyPSA multinational food processing and commodities trading company, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) – commonly known as ADM, which is also its ticker symbol – offers an enticing idea for safe stocks to buy. Fundamentally, humans need to eat. Therefore, if we incur a hard economic landing, ADM should be somewhat insulated from the worst of the pain. However, since the start of the year, ADM stock dipped more than 12%.It’s even worse against the trailing year, with ADM shedding more than 17%. Still, the company benefits from strong operational metrics. In particular, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 16.4%, above 80.78% of companies in the consumer packaged goods industry. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period is an impressive 30.8%.Enticingly, the market prices ADM at a forward multiple of 11.67. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 73.45% of the competition. Lastly, analysts peg ADM as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $102.50, implying over 30% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

472,c2fda108-906b-3c93-883e-1805956a6def,PLD,2023-04-14,20 Biggest Real Estate Companies in USA,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-biggest-real-estate-companies-103854415.html,1681468734,STORY,"['AMT', 'PLD', 'UDR', 'EQIX', 'ARE', 'DLR', 'EQR', 'RKT', 'CSGP', 'SPG', 'SBAC', 'INVH', 'AVB', 'VICI', 'WELL', 'CBRE', 'O']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the 20 biggest real estate companies in USA. For more real estate companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Real Estate Companies in USA. Two children, a car, and a white picket fence - so goes the American dream. Looking at this, you'll realize that the automotive and real estate industries are at the center of American culture. Most people dream to own their house one day and often end up taking out multi-decade long mortgages to afford their own place of living. Apart from houses, several other buildings and properties make up the real estate sector. These range from public places such as parks, to apartment complexes, office buildings, and giant skyscrapers.Naturally, this also means that the real estate industry is among the most closely watched sectors by both governments and the wealthy. The rich are crazy about real estate since they invest copious amounts of wealth in it. After all, having a villa in Beverly Hills has a much different bling to it than a house in a village. Speaking numbers, a report from McKinsey shows that two thirds of global net worth were invested in real estate as of 2020. Within these two thirds, residential and private real estate accounted for almost half, or 46%, of global net worth, with government and public buildings making up another 23%. Growth rates in net worth with respect to the overall gross domestic product (GDP) show that this plowing of funds into a notoriously unproductive asset has led to significant net worth growth as well. McKinsey's data shows that between 2000 and 2020, net worth compared to GDP was a stunning 104% higher than in the three decades between 1970 and 1999. On the most extreme end, France's richest benefited from the real estate boom, as it grew by an eye popping 371% higher than the GDP! Within the net worth growth between 2000 and 2020, two thirds were due to higher asset prices, with saving and investment both accounting for a rather tame 28%.Story continuesAs this should make it clear, real estate is quite lucrative indeed. But just how lucrative is estimated in a research report from Grand View Research. In this report, the firm estimates that the global real estate industry was worth $3.69 trillion in 2021 and despite this huge size, the segment is expected to post a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.2% between 2022 and 2030 to sit at $5.85 trillion by the end of the forecast period. Within the market, the commercial real estate market was the largest constituent segment as it accounted for 35% of the entire market. Apart from residential, the commercial real estate market is another large component of the industry and it will match the broader sector's growth rate by growing at a 5.1% CAGR during the forecast period. Additionally, Grand View Research also highlights that sales by property type, such as villas and second homes, will outpace the broader market in terms of growth by growing at 6.1%. It adds that the Middle East and Africa will also outpace market growth, but Asia Pacific is the largest segment in terms of geography with more than half the market share.In America, the real estate sector is facing some stress these days, This is due to the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes that aim to make borrowing costs for firms and individuals higher to kill GDP growth and fight inflation. The U.S. real estate sector is worth $20 trillion (this is the total value of the properties and not the revenues) and prices dropped by 15% in March 2023 from their peak values. Rising interest rates are playing a role in this, as commercial real estate purchases are rarely made out of pocket and instead, they rely on bank loans and funding. While a 15% drop in itself sounds high, experts worry that prices could drop as much as 30% in case of an economic downturn or a recession.Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD)'s earnings call for its fourth quarter of 2022 provides valuable insight. During the event, management outlined:With regard to our markets and leasing activity, the bottomline is that conditions remain healthy and there is little we see across our results or proprietary metrics that point to a meaningful slowdown. We see a normalization of demand and when combined with low vacancy, it continues to translate to a meaningful increase in rents. Across our markets, rent growth was nearly 5% during the quarter, driving the full year to 28%. Proposal activity for available space was consistent with our recent history, and given persistent low vacancy, there is simply a very small number of units to even propose deals on. As evidenced, over 99% of our portfolio is either currently leased or in negotiation. Utilization remains high at 86%, near its all time record and deal gestation ticked up over the quarter, indicative of more careful consideration and time being taken in leasing decisions.While we are watching e-commerce carefully, its share of overall retail sales have increased to 22%, which is 600 basis points above its pre-pandemic level. Putting the nuance of mix, timing and other factors aside, as measured by retention, occupancy or rent change, it is clear that customers need to commit to space to market conditions, which offer them very little choice. In terms of supply, the development pipeline across our market stands at 565 million square feet and our expectation for the year is that the pipeline will decline. Deliveries will put modest upward pressure on vacancies from 3.3% today towards 4% later in the year. However, new development starts are slowing in response to the market environment, which will reduce vacancies in late 2023 or 2024.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the biggest real estate companies in America, out of which the top ones are Equinix, Inc.

473,bf913dcd-8421-3113-9db3-46da231365c5,STX,2023-04-14,Earnings Preview: Seagate (STX) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-seagate-stx-q3-140002055.html,1681394402,STORY,['STX'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Seagate (STX) reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 20, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis electronic storage maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.22 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -87.9%.Revenues are expected to be $1.98 billion, down 29.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6.32% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Seagate?For Seagate, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -27.82%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Seagate will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Seagate would post earnings of $0.11 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.16, delivering a surprise of +45.45%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Seagate doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Specifically, we decided to study Robert Half International's  ROE in this article.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Robert Half International How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Robert Half International is:42% = US$658m ÷ US$1.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.42.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Robert Half International's Earnings Growth And 42% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Robert Half International has a significantly high ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 16% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Probably as a result of this, Robert Half International was able to see a decent net income growth of 14% over the last five years.Story continuesNext, on comparing Robert Half International's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 14% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is Robert Half International fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Robert Half International Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Robert Half International has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 32% (or a retention ratio of 68%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.Additionally, Robert Half International has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 29% of its profits over the next three years. However, Robert Half International's future ROE is expected to decline to 32% despite there being not much change anticipated in the company's payout ratio.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Robert Half International's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Currently, Paccar has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Fox Factory Holding has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). This means that PCAR's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.PCAR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 10.85, while FOXF has a forward P/E of 21.55. We also note that PCAR has a PEG ratio of 1.09. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. FOXF currently has a PEG ratio of 1.93.Another notable valuation metric for PCAR is its P/B ratio of 2.81. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, FOXF has a P/B of 4.35.Based on these metrics and many more, PCAR holds a Value grade of A, while FOXF has a Value grade of C.Story continuesPCAR stands above FOXF thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that PCAR is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.One company to watch right now is PACCAR (PCAR). PCAR is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 11.02 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 28.83. Over the past year, PCAR's Forward P/E has been as high as 13.22 and as low as 10.39, with a median of 11.63.PCAR is also sporting a PEG ratio of 1.10. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. PCAR's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 2.14. PCAR's PEG has been as high as 1.32 and as low as 1.04, with a median of 1.16, all within the past year.Investors should also recognize that PCAR has a P/B ratio of 2.77. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 3.33. Over the past 12 months, PCAR's P/B has been as high as 3.02 and as low as 2.20, with a median of 2.54.Story continuesValue investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. PCAR has a P/S ratio of 1.29. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 2.58.Finally, we should also recognize that PCAR has a P/CF ratio of 9.60. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 16.83. PCAR's P/CF has been as high as 11.01 and as low as 8.57, with a median of 10.15, all within the past year.These are just a handful of the figures considered in PACCAR's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that PCAR is an impressive value stock right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(UPS) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-parcel-inc-ups-trending-130001524.html,1681390801,STORY,['UPS'],"[United Parcel Service (UPS) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this package delivery service have returned +3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +6.1% change. The Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry, to which UPS belongs, has gained 7.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.UPS is expected to post earnings of $2.33 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -23.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.5%.The consensus earnings estimate of $11.47 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -11.4%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.67 indicates a change of +1.7% from what UPS is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for UPS.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UPS _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For UPS, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $22.97 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -5.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $97.62 billion and $100.37 billion estimates indicate -2.7% and +2.8% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUPS reported revenues of $27.03 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -2.7%. EPS of $3.62 for the same period compares with $3.59 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $27.95 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -3.27%. The EPS surprise was +1.12%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UPS is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UPS. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

488,71c80a13-655e-3d46-af50-10e7044e5f62,AXP,2023-04-14,Analysts Estimate American Express (AXP) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-american-express-axp-140102875.html,1681394462,STORY,['AXP'],"[The market expects American Express (AXP) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 20. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis credit card issuer and global payments company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.66 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -2.6%.Revenues are expected to be $13.96 billion, up 19% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.75% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for American Express?For American Express, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.03%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that American Express will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that American Express would post earnings of $2.18 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.07, delivering a surprise of -5.05%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.American Express doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

MLM is well poised for 2023, given higher public infrastructure investment and continued strength in large-scale energy, domestic manufacturing and multi-family residential projects. Yet, continued inflationary pressure and a slowdown in single-family residential construction are ongoing headwinds.Indeed, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s margins remain vulnerable to ongoing inflationary pressure and lower aggregate volume. Owing to these headwinds, the company’s shares have gained 10.2% over the past six months compared with the industry’s 16.1% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFactors Favoring the StockHigher Infrastructural Spending: Martin Marietta and other concrete &amp; aggregates producers are expected to benefit from strong global trends in infrastructure modernization, energy transition, national security and a potential super-cycle in global supply-chain investments. The need to rebuild the nation’s deteriorating roads and bridges is expected to help MLM.The company expects a diverse mix of federal projects for road and bridge work, water control, harbors and ports and the power grid, which will drive growth in 2023. MLM sees substantial opportunities in 2023 across federally funded infrastructure projects, industrial manufacturing, energy and power. It expects to deliver another year of profitable growth, strong cash flow and attractive returns for shareholders.In the near term, the company expects affordability-driven headwinds in the single-family residential end market. This will be offset by a significant acceleration in public infrastructure investment and continued strength in large-scale energy, domestic manufacturing and multi-family residential projects.Higher Earnings Expectation: Despite the high inflationary pressures and flat aggregates shipments assumption for 2023, the company expects to continue to deliver accelerated margin expansion during the year. The margin expansion is due to the carryover effects of 2022 commercial actions and broad acceptance of Jan 1, 2023 price increases.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings of $14.84 per share calls for 23% year-over-year growth.Long-Term Plan: Martin Marietta has been gaining strength from long-term strategic plans — markedly SOAR (Strategic Operating Analysis and Review) 2025 initiatives. It is to be noted that 2022 marked the 11th year of consecutive growth in consolidated products and services revenues, adjusted gross profit and adjusted EBITDA.Martin Marietta has been focusing on SOAR plans that include portfolio optimization, assessing business combinations and arrangements with other companies engaged in similar businesses, increasing footprint in core businesses, investing in internal expansion projects in high-growth markets and pursuing new opportunities associated with the existing markets served.Story continuesHeadwindsInflationary Pressures: The company uses large amounts of electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources, subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation, which could affect operating results and erode profits.Gross margin across the business (barring Cement) contracted 180 basis points (bps) in 2022. In particular, the 2022 aggregates product gross margin decreased 160 bps to 28% due to higher diesel, repairs, internal freight and depreciation costs.The Building Materials business gross margin (down 140 bps) was negatively impacted by inflationary pressure throughout the year. Magnesia Specialties’ gross margin was down 570 bps due to low demand from domestic steel industry customers for dolomitic lime products and higher energy and contract services costs.3 Better-Ranked Construction Stocks Hogging the LimelightSome better-ranked stocks which warrant a look in the Construction sector include:Installed Building Products, Inc. IBP — holding a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) — is a leading installer of insulation and complementary building products. It primarily banks on a robust pipeline of acquisition opportunities across multiple geographies, products and end markets.Installed Building’s earnings for 2023 are expected to decline 5.7%.

492,e4319c2e-2ee2-3567-b71e-463b3e8ae4a0,ZBH,2023-04-14,"Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.'s (NYSE:ZBH) Financials Are Too Obscure To Link With Current Share Price Momentum: What's In Store For the Stock?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zimmer-biomet-holdings-inc-nyse-195333892.html,1681329213,STORY,['ZBH'],"[Most readers would already be aware that Zimmer Biomet Holdings' (NYSE:ZBH) stock increased significantly by 6.4% over the past month. But the company's key financial indicators appear to be differing across the board and that makes us question whether or not the company's current share price momentum can be maintained. In this article, we decided to focus on Zimmer Biomet Holdings'  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Zimmer Biomet Holdings How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Zimmer Biomet Holdings is:2.4% = US$291m ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.02 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Zimmer Biomet Holdings' Earnings Growth And 2.4% ROEIt is hard to argue that Zimmer Biomet Holdings' ROE is much good in and of itself. Not just that, even compared to the industry average of 11%, the company's ROE is entirely unremarkable. For this reason, Zimmer Biomet Holdings' five year net income decline of 27% is not surprising given its lower ROE. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For instance, the company has a very high payout ratio, or is faced with competitive pressures.Story continuesHowever, when we compared Zimmer Biomet Holdings' growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 14% in the same period. This is quite worrisome.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is Zimmer Biomet Holdings fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.Is Zimmer Biomet Holdings Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Despite having a normal three-year median payout ratio of 45% (where it is retaining 55% of its profits), Zimmer Biomet Holdings has seen a decline in earnings as we saw above. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.Additionally, Zimmer Biomet Holdings has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 12% over the next three years. As a result, the expected drop in Zimmer Biomet Holdings' payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 12%, over the same period.SummaryOverall, we have mixed feelings about Zimmer Biomet Holdings. While the company does have a high rate of profit retention, its low rate of return is probably hampering its earnings growth. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Twitter had been hit by a massive decline in advertising since his acquisition in late October.However, several companies, including snack maker Mondelez International, consumer products company Unilever, and Coca-Cola, that had been among Twitter's top 10 advertisers before Musk took over, are no longer even in the top 50 advertisers in the past two months, according to data compiled by Sensor Tower.Mondelez, Unilever and Coke did not respond to requests for comment. Mondelez CEO Dirk Van de Put told Reuters last fall the Oreo maker had pulled its ads from Twitter because of the risk they would appear next to the ""wrong messages,"" including hate speech.The top 50 advertisers on Twitter spent a combined $83 million over the past two months, down from $102 million in the same period last year, according to Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm.Research firm Insider Intelligence this week slashed its forecast for Twitter's global ad revenue this year by 37% to $2.98 billion. That would represent a 28% decline from Twitter's 2022 ad revenue of $4.14 billion.An emailed request for comment to Twitter, which no longer has a communications team, returned an automated reply with a poop emoji. Musk is set to speak at a major advertising conference in Miami on Tuesday, where he will address marketers seeking answers about his plans for Twitter.Since acquiring Twitter, Musk has ordered a series of rapid changes that have rattled advertisers, including laying off thousands of employees to cut costs and rushing the launch of a subscription to let users pay to have their profiles verified.Story continuesHis controversial tweets, including ones that linked to conspiracy theories or waded into debates about racism, have also given advertisers pause, ad buyers have previously told Reuters.At a conference last month, Musk acknowledged a massive decline in advertising revenue and said he was forced to cut costs quickly.Despite Musk's comments that most advertisers are returning to Twitter, some major brands told Reuters that is not the case for them.An AT&amp;T spokesperson said the wireless carrier, which paused ads in September, had not returned. AT&amp;T was previously No. 33 among Twitter's top advertisers before Musk's acquisition, according to Sensor Tower.Automakers Volkswagen AG and Stellantis also said they had not resumed ads on Twitter. Mars, maker of M&amp;M's and Snickers, said it is not advertising on the platform.Other advertisers formerly in the top 50 Twitter advertisers that were no longer on that list according to Sensor Tower included Merck &amp; Co, Google, Kellogg and Facebook parent Meta Platforms.Those companies did not respond to requests for comment about their ad spending.""Many advertisers don't trust him based on past behavior or don't want to be associated with him,"" Insider Intelligence principal analyst Jasmine Enberg said of Musk.Web traffic to Twitter's ad portal, a website that lets customers set up and purchase ads on Twitter, declined 18.7% in March from the same time last year, said research firm Similarweb, which analyzes traffic to the ad-buying websites of social media platforms.Twitter's ad business is ""eroding"" and its subscription product Twitter Blue is seeing only moderate success, Similarweb said in a blog post.Twitter has the added challenge of competing for brands' marketing budgets at a time when companies are cutting or reevaluating how much they spend on ads amid concerns about the health of the economy, Enberg said.""They're spending on platforms that they believe will provide them the highest return on investment, and that's just not Twitter; it never has been,"" she said.Snap Inc, owner of popular app Snapchat, said in January that tough economic conditions could lead to lower first-quarter revenue.Similarly, Alphabet's Google, the world's largest digital ad platform, posted disappointing quarterly earnings in February due to advertisers' cutting their budgets. Alphabet and Snap both declined comment.(Reporting by Sheila Dang in Dallas; additional reporting by Jessica DiNapoli in New York, Dawn Chmielewski and Deena Beasley in Los Angeles, David Shepardson in Washington and Victoria Waldersee in Berlin; editing by Ben Klayman and Leslie Adler)]"

That is, insiders sold more stock than they bought.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum Occidental Petroleum Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the VP, Chief Accounting Officer &amp; Controller, Christopher Champion, for US$352k worth of shares, at about US$70.37 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$64.84. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign. Christopher Champion was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Does Occidental Petroleum Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Occidental Petroleum insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$132m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Occidental Petroleum Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Occidental Petroleum insiders selling. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Occidental Petroleum. To that end, you should learn about the 2 warning signs we've spotted with Occidental Petroleum (including 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable).But note: Occidental Petroleum may not be the best stock to buy.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Undervalued Energy Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.""It's Obviously A Positive For The Energy Sector""On April 2, OPEC+ announced an oil production cut of 1.16 million bpd, bringing aggregate cuts to 3.66 million bpd which is approximately 3.7% of global demand, according to Reuters. Shortly after the announcement, Hightower Advisors chief investment strategist, Stephanie Link, appeared in an interview on CNBC to discuss this development in the energy sector and what it means for energy stocks. Stephanie Link thinks that ""it's obviously a positive for the energy sector"" as companies in the space will be able to generate more free cash flow and drive shareholder returns through buybacks and dividends, as oil prices rise. However, Link thinks that it could be negative for consumers if oil prices rise, and the Fed might remain hawkish on inflation. She also noted that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve's record low levels are a concern and something needed to be addressed.Stephanie Link discussed her investment strategy for the quarter, stating that she was overweight in oil stocks and owned Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB), and Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG). Link said that Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is a ""high-quality"" and ""diversified"" company that pays decent dividends. Link called Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) a ""wonderful technology company"". She believes that these companies are trading at attractive P/E ratios and generating abundant free cash flow. As of April 5, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is trading at a PE multiple of 9x and is offering a forward dividend yield of 3.60%. Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) is trading at a PE multiple of 20x, as of April 5, and is offering a forward dividend yield of 1.97%.Story continuesStephanie Link also shared her views regarding the outperformance of technology in the first quarter of 2023. Link suggests investors to opt for a more ""balanced approach"" in 2023. Here are some comments from Link:""(technology) it was really more of a macro call. Why they have outperformed is because rates have come down in the first quarter, inflation has started to come down, you've had a flight to safety because of the bank scare, and then also a bit of mean reversion. If you think about it growth, year-to-date, has outperformed value by 12%. But last year, value outperformed growth by 20%. So there was some mean reversion in the first quarter this year as well.""Stephanie Link noted that there are ""great stories and great total addressable markets"" within the tech sector and as tech companies are cutting costs, they are improving their ability to generate cash flow and improve margins. However, she thinks the tech sector has ""moved really far really fast"".Overall, Stephanie Link is bullish on the energy sector and believes that investors should have a balanced portfolio. Some other sectors she likes include industrials, aerospace, agriculture, and China reopening names. Link suggested that consumer spending would continue to rise, mainly focused on services, and there are opportunities for investors within the market to diversify and balance their portfolios.We have compiled a list of the best undervalued energy stocks to buy now according to analysts, which include Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC).

EOG is a US shale-focused E&amp;P company. The current supportive commodity price environment and EOG’s continuing to deliver on its production goals and capex plans have led investors to bid up shares. Its commitment to return excess capital to shareholders via regular and special dividends is also highly appealing, particularly in a period of rising interest rates. The company has proven its ability to create economic value for shareholders, even over the past decade that included the toughest energy commodity environment of the last 30+ years. The company’s strong balance sheet enabled it to increase production capabilities during the downturn. EOG has a low-cost production position with a strong reserve base, giving it an advantage versus peers. Further, EOG’s management focuses on return on invested capital and cash flow generation, distinguishing it from most of the company’s competitors who prioritize growth over profitability.”10.

(NYSE:CVE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Cenovus Energy (Long -13%) shares declined over the quarter due to an ~18% decline in oil prices on increasing fears of a U.S recession and a slowdown in global growth. Given the long-life nature of its oil sand assets and its low cost of production, we estimate Cenovus is free cash flow break-even at an oil price of ~US$40/bbl. Despite the recent fall, oil prices remain more than double this break-even point, implying considerable free cash flow generation potential for the company at current levels, with Cenovus currently trading on a consensus FY22 free cash flow yield of around 20%. There are also additional value realisation catalysts with the company continuing to progress the de-gearing of its balance sheet via organic cash generation and asset sales.”7.

For those who support our deep brain stimulation (DBS) products, the focus is on offering effective care options to the millions of people worldwide who are affected by Parkinson's disease (PD).DBS uses a small, surgically implanted device to send signals to a targeted portion of the brain. The stimulation can improve motor function by reducing disease symptoms. In general, DBS is designed to help people living with PD decrease their medications and experience fewer side effects, such as uncontrolled movements.1For Parkinson's Awareness Month, we sat down with three employees whose passion for working on DBS products has a deeply personal connection.Finding inspiration from her sonsFor Nicky Nault, caring for others is a way of life. As a clinical specialist based out of Boston, Massachusetts, she works with patients and physicians to raise awareness of DBS therapy, how it works and the latest technology available.Recently, Nicky met with a patient who had just received a new, rechargeable Boston Scientific battery for her DBS device. ""Afterward, I asked her to write her name with the stimulation off, and she couldn't due to her tremors,"" Nicky says. ""But after switching the therapy on, she smiled as she clearly wrote out each letter. It was incredible to witness.""*At home, Nicky is a devoted mother. Her daughter Janessa is pursuing a career in the medical device industry and is part of the Boston Scientific BOOST program, which focuses on building career opportunities for Black students and professionals. She hopes to follow in her mother's footsteps in health care. Janessa and Nicky know on a deeply personal level the importance of patient care. They shared in the experience of caring for Nicky's two sons, Avery and Isaiah, who despite fighting difficult battles with mitochondrial disease showed tremendous courage and optimism. Sadly, Avery and Isaiah passed away in 2016 and 2021 respectively, but their memories continue to be a guiding light for the family.Story continues""I see my boys in the patients I work with every day,"" says Nicky. ""I'm grateful to know and be a part of their stories, and when I go to bed at night I know I did my best to help them. Tomorrow, I'll do even better.""Working to honor her grandmotherLike Nicky, transforming lives carries personal meaning for Celine Constant. As a senior multi-channel specialist based in southern France, she uses analytics and digital marketing to identify and connect with PD patients who may benefit from DBS therapy.Celine witnessed the debilitating symptoms of PD firsthand as a teenager, when her grandmother was diagnosed with the illness. ""I was very close with my grandmother and saw all the challenges she faced seeing many different specialists and trying a myriad of treatments."" It was during that time Celine decided she wanted to work in health care.Celine joined the Neuromodulation business in 2015 with a goal of making a meaningful impact for patients like her grandmother. ""For me, it's about providing patients with education and tools, and empowering them to find the best solution for their needs,"" says Celine. ""If I can help lessen the burden of this disease for even one patient and their family, I know I'm living my purpose.""Following in his family's footstepsWhen R&amp;D manager Benny Yeh was a child, he dreamed of helping others. He knew he wanted a career related to health care but wasn't sure if it would mean following in his grandfather's footsteps as a doctor who treated patients or supporting the development of therapies designed to help those patients. As a young adult in college, he found his answer.Benny was always drawn to problem-solving. It's how he ended up studying electrical and biomedical engineering, eventually landing an internship at Boston Scientific.Since joining the company in 2006, he has progressed through the engineering ranks and now leads a team in the R&amp;D division. Benny's team is responsible for creating and sustaining the automated test equipment that ensures every DBS product Boston Scientific manufactures meets the highest quality standards.""We play a role in testing the stimulators, the remote controls, the batteries - everything that makes up the DBS therapy,"" Benny says. While he primarily works from the R&amp;D area at the Valencia, California, site, he recalls a few unforgettable occasions in which he was able to meet some of the patients who use the products he helps test.""When you're in the weeds of the process and the individual pieces that make up something like a DBS device, sometimes you can lose sight of the big picture,"" he says. ""But to go to the hospital or medical facility and see the real people and their families - it's an emotional reminder of why we do this, and why our commitment to quality is so important.""To learn more about careers and apply for a job at Boston Scientific, visit our careers site.

A Look At Its Intrinsic Value,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boston-scientific-corporation-nyse-bsx-120020582.html,1681387220,STORY,['BSX'],"[Key InsightsBoston Scientific's estimated fair value is US$41.64 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityBoston Scientific's US$51.11 share price signals that it might be 23% overvalued The US$53.11 analyst price target for BSX is 28% more than our estimate of fair valueToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Boston Scientific The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.12bUS$2.78bUS$3.28bUS$3.49bUS$3.64bUS$3.76bUS$3.87bUS$3.98bUS$4.08bUS$4.17bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 3.33%Est @ 2.95%Est @ 2.69%Est @ 2.50%Est @ 2.37% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.6% US$2.0kUS$2.4kUS$2.6kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$23bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.2b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.6%– 2.1%) = US$77bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$77b÷ ( 1 + 7.6%)10= US$37bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$60b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$51.1, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Boston Scientific as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.937. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Boston ScientificStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

However, the sector is growing as consumers cautiously continue to spend on essentials. In fact, the sector has managed to put up a decent show even during the prevailing trying times, as demand for goods is still high.According to the latest Mastercard SpendingPulse, retail sales grew year over year in March. E-commerce once again played a major role in boosting sales. Given this situation, stocks like Casey's General Stores, Inc. CASY,Urban Outfitters, Inc. URBN, DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. DKS and Ulta Beauty, Inc. ULTA with a solid online presence are likely to benefit in the near term.Retail Sales Defy Rising PricesThe retail sector has been badly hit by rising commodity prices as the Fed continues to raise interest rates at an aggressive pace to tame soaring inflation. However, sales have still been growing at a steady pace, which is a good sign for the sector.According to the latest Mastercard SpendingPulse, retail sales in the United States rose 4.7% year over year in March. Nominal spending was marginally lower than in February, but spending trends were almost in line with what was seen earlier this year, according to the report.Online sales grew a solid 13% in March on a year-over-year basis. In-store sales also put up a good show, increasing 2.8%. Sales at restaurants climbed 11.6% in March. Grocery sales jumped 5.6%.E-commerce has been the mainstay of the retail sector since the COVID-19 outbreak. Online sales have been contributing to the majority of overall retail sales, although brick-and-mortar stores are trying to regain their lost territory.The pandemic gave e-commerce a major push as millions stayed at home and shopped online, including ordering food, on concerns over contracting the deadly virus. The trend has since continued as consumers have realized the convenience of shopping online.Another factor contributing to the consistent growth in retail sales is increased spending, which is being driven by solid job additions to the economy. The Labor Department reported that nonfarm payrolls increased an impressive 236,000 in March.Story continuesThe labor market has been resilient despite rising inflationary pressures, which is allowing people to spend more freely because more jobs mean more wages.Our ChoicesThis is, thus, the right opportunity to invest in retail stocks that have a strong online presence.Casey's General Stores, Inc. operates convenience stores under the Casey's and Casey's General Store names in 16 Midwestern states, mainly Iowa, Missouri and Illinois.

ULTA appears in solid shape due to strength in its skincare category and robust omnichannel operations. These upsides continued to fuel the specialty retailer of cosmetics, fragrances, haircare and skincare products and related services in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. During the quarter, the top and bottom lines cruised past the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew year over year.Further, management stated that it remains confident about witnessing continued growth in the U.S. beauty category and offered an encouraging view for fiscal 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current fiscal-year earnings per share (EPS) has increased by a couple of cents to $25.23 over the past seven days.  Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have rallied 7.1% in the past three months compared to the industry’s decline of 12.4%. Let’s delve deeper.Ulta Beauty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseUlta Beauty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseUlta Beauty Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Ulta Beauty Inc. QuoteRobust Q4 &amp; GuidanceNet sales rose 18.2% year over year to $3,226.8 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,037.9 million. The uptick can be attributed to the favorable impacts of the continued resilience of the beauty category, retail price increases and the impacts of new brands and product innovation compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.Ulta Beauty posted an EPS of $6.68 in the fiscal fourth quarter, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.69. The company’s EPS increased 23.5% from $5.41 in the year-ago period.Fourth-quarter results gained from solid sales momentum across the company’s store and business channels. ULTA generated strong double-digit comparable sales growth across all major categories. It witnessed an increased market share in prestige beauty. Strong consumer demand was a driver.Ulta Beauty expects fiscal 2023 net sales in the band of $10.95-$11.05 billion compared with the $10.2 billion reported in fiscal 2022. Comps are expected to rise 4-5%. The company expects comp growth in the first half will be in the high-single-digit range, driven by stronger growth in the first quarter and moderate-to-low-single-digit growth in the second half of the year.For fiscal 2023, earnings are envisioned in the band of $24.70-$25.40 per share. This suggests a rise from the $24.01 per share reported in fiscal 2022.Story continuesMain DriversUlta Beauty has been enriching its omnichannel experience through launches like Beauty to Go, options like same-day delivery (in some stores) and unique salon services across stores, among others. In fiscal 2022, the company launched its new alliance with Target and has more than 350 Ulta Beauty at Target shop-in-shop locations (as of the end of the fourth quarter). Management expects this number to reach up to 800 Target locations over time.Moreover, Ulta Beauty is benefiting from its Wellness Shop launch (in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021). It is a cross-category platform providing guests with self-care for the mind, body and spirit across several stores as well as online.The company’s buy online, pickup in store (BOPIS) continued to gain traction in the fourth quarter. Additionally, ULTA’s initiatives to boost online promotions and customer engagement have been supporting online sales growth.With consumers’ growing enthusiasm about online sales, management remains on track with expanding capacity at fulfillment centers, the expansion of ship-from-store capabilities as well as curbside pickups. The company is also benefiting from its mobile app and virtual try-on capabilities.Among BOPIS, same-day delivery and ship-from-store capabilities, 31% of Ulta Beauty’s digital orders were fulfilled by stores in fiscal 2022, up from 28% year over year. That said, store traffic trends were robust in the fourth quarter, rising in the double digits.During the fourth quarter, the company introduced 12 stores, remodeled 12 and relocated one. For fiscal 2023, ULTA expects 25-30 net new stores, along with 20-30 store remodeling and relocation projects.Moving on, Ulta Beauty has been seeing market share gains in major beauty categories for a while now, with skincare standing out due to consumers’ rising interest in self-care and the company’s focus on newness and innovation. The trend continued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, wherein skincare delivered the highest growth.Moreover, the company saw double-digit growth in both mass and prestige, mainly backed by serums, moisturizers, acne treatments and holiday gift sets. Results gained from newness in brands like Drunk Elephant, The Ordinary and Hero cosmetics. These upsides are likely to help Ulta Beauty keep adding new leaves to its growth story.3 Other PicksSome other top-ranked stocks are Build-A-Bear Workshop, Inc.

This has outpaced the Medical sector's gain of 6.85% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 6.51% in that time.Vertex Pharmaceuticals will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be May 1, 2023.

It is worth considering Textron (TXT), which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry.This maker of Cessna small planes and Bell helicopters has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 9.88%.For the most recent quarter, Textron was expected to post earnings of $1 per share, but it reported $1.07 per share instead, representing a surprise of 7%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.94 per share, while it actually produced $1.06 per share, a surprise of 12.77%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Textron, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Textron currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.05%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on April 27, 2023.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Consolidated How Fast Is Coca-Cola Consolidated Growing Its Earnings Per Share?Coca-Cola Consolidated has undergone a massive growth in earnings per share over the last three years. So much so that this three year growth rate wouldn't be a fair assessment of the company's future. So it would be better to isolate the growth rate over the last year for our analysis. Outstandingly, Coca-Cola Consolidated's EPS shot from US$20.23 to US$45.89, over the last year. It's a rarity to see 127% year-on-year growth like that.Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. The music to the ears of Coca-Cola Consolidated shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 8.0% to 10% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well.

Specifically, during the week ending March 22, Yahoo Finance reported that depositors drained $126 billion from U.S. banks. Unlike prior such transactions, this time around, the outflow originated from the nation’s largest institutions.Put another way, regular folks are reading between the lines. Additionally, with banking jitters going abroad and surprise production cuts spiking the price of crude oil, the Federal Reserve’s problems overflow the table. There’s only so much that one entity can do, contributing to the pessimism. About the only solution now may be to consider these safe stocks to buy.MSFTMicrosoft$289.39PGProcter &amp; Gamble$150.96MCDMcDonald’s$283.78OLLIOllie’s Bargain Outlet$59.10INTUIntuit$444.72ALLAllstate$116.11ADMArcher Daniels Midland$80.05InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMicrosoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comAs a technology giant, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) might not be everyone’s idea for safe stocks to buy. After all, the mass layoffs that have been occurring since last year mostly impacted the tech sector. Nevertheless, Microsoft is also indispensable in the business world. Basically, if you operate a PC, you must be fluent in Microsoft’s core applications or risk falling behind.Another factor that makes MSFT one of the safe stocks to buy centers on its financial resilience. For example, on the balance sheet, Microsoft features a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.61, above nearly 63% of software companies. Also, its Altman Z-Score pings at 9.14, indicating high stability and very low risk of bankruptcy.As well, the enterprise benefits from a solid revenue trek and a net margin of 33%, well above the competition. Finally, covering analysts peg MSFT as a consensus strong buy. On average, their price target comes out to $297.25, implying 2% upside potential.Story continuesProcter &amp; Gamble (PG)Procter &amp; Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&amp;G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods CompanySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comA multinational consumer goods corporation, Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) specializes in a wide range of personal health/consumer health, personal care and hygiene products. Let’s put it another way. No matter what goes on with the economy, people still need to take care of themselves (physically). Therefore, PG ranks among the safe stocks to buy.Yes, Procter &amp; Gamble is a boring company – there’s no question about it. But it’s also this nature that makes it enticing during this hour. For example, the company enjoys solid stability in the balance sheet, marked by an Altman Z-Score of 5.35.Operationally, the company gets the job done with a three-year revenue growth rate of 5.8%. Here, the enterprise beats out 51.12% of its rivals, which is okay. However, its net margin storms out of the gates at 17.79%, beating out almost 92% of sector peers. Lastly, analysts peg PG as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $157.85, implying nearly 4% upside potential.McDonald’s (MCD)Source: ShutterstockA fast-food icon and a symbol of American capitalism, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) really needs no introduction. As a result, you might say that MCD represents an obvious choice for safe stocks to buy. Fundamentally, the company benefits from the trade-down effect. Rather than picking up your morning coffee (and breakfast items) at an expensive café, you can head down to a cheaper McCafe.Financially, McDonald’s delivers the core elements of a leading example of safe stocks to buy. On the balance sheet, the company enjoys an Altman Z-Score of 4.94, sitting in the safe zone of fiscal stability. Operationally, the Golden Arches prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 3.8%, beating out 72.81% of its peers.Perhaps most significantly, McDonald’s is hugely profitable. Its net margin stands at 26.65%, above 96.57% of companies in the restaurants industry. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg MCD as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $296.04, implying nearly 5% upside potential.Ollie’s Bargain Outlet (OLLI)Woman at the supermarket checkout, she is paying using a credit card, shopping and retail conceptSource: ShutterstockA favorite idea among safe stocks to buy, Ollie’s Bargain Outlet (NASDAQ:OLLI) enjoys significant relevance as a discount retailer. However, it’s more than just that. With Ollie’s offering unsold or overstocked items with brand-name labels, the business is simply more attractive to consumers. Indeed, since the start of the year, OLLI gained over 24% of equity value. In the trailing year, it’s up nearly 14%.Financially, Ollie’s continues to entice onlookers. Notably, the company benefits from fiscal stability. Its equity-to-asset ratio is 0.67 times, above 83.17% of its peers. Further, its Altman Z-Score pings at 5.25, reflecting low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate is 10.9%, above 75.44% of the field.As well, its net margin comes out to 5.63%, ranked better than 85% of firms in the defensive retail industry. Looking to the Street, analysts peg OLLI as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target is $62, implying almost 7% upside potential.Intuit (INTU)Stacks of coins hold up wooden blocks that spell out ""TAX."" FairTaxSource: ShutterstockA business software company, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) specializes in financial software. Intuit’s products include the tax preparation application TurboTax, personal finance app Mint, the small business accounting program QuickBooks, the credit monitoring service Credit Karma and email marketing platform Mailchimp. Since the start of the year, INTU gained over 14% of equity value.Yes, it’s down more than 7% in the trailing one-year period. Still, as the nature of work evolves and people consider jumping to the gig economy, the tax implications associated with gig workers (independent contractors) should bolster INTU. For now, it ranks as one of the safe stocks to buy because of high stability in the balance sheet and strong operational metrics.In particular, it’s worth pointing out the three-year revenue growth rate of 20.4% and net margin of 14.22%. Both stats rank above their respective industry median values. To close out, analysts peg INTU as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $478.94, implying over 7% upside potential.Allstate (ALL)Allstate Insurance officeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAs a major player in the insurance business, Allstate (NYSE:ALL) easily ranks among the safe stocks to buy. It’s not that it has sterling financials. Rather, the company benefits from extreme relevance. Under any circumstance, acquiring financial protection represents a common-sense virtue. But in the wildness associated with the post-pandemic ecosystem, financial protection becomes even more pertinent.To be fair, though, investors don’t quite see the connection between the narrative and the price action. Since the Jan. opener, ALL slipped almost 16%. In the trailing year, it fell nearly 19%. Nevertheless, the company could make a comeback following the Covid-19 malaise.Notably, Allstate’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 14.2%, ranked above 79% of its peers. Also, ALL trades at 0.61-times trailing sales. In contrast, the sector median value is 0.93 times.Finally, analysts peg ALL as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $137.17, implying 19% upside potential.Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)Source: ©iStock.com/AndreyPSA multinational food processing and commodities trading company, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) – commonly known as ADM, which is also its ticker symbol – offers an enticing idea for safe stocks to buy. Fundamentally, humans need to eat. Therefore, if we incur a hard economic landing, ADM should be somewhat insulated from the worst of the pain. However, since the start of the year, ADM stock dipped more than 12%.It’s even worse against the trailing year, with ADM shedding more than 17%. Still, the company benefits from strong operational metrics. In particular, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 16.4%, above 80.78% of companies in the consumer packaged goods industry. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period is an impressive 30.8%.Enticingly, the market prices ADM at a forward multiple of 11.67. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 73.45% of the competition. Lastly, analysts peg ADM as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $102.50, implying over 30% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

This led to a dull year-over-year performance in fourth-quarter 2022.The company has also been witnessing pressures related to global supply-chain disruptions, energy costs, and rising raw materials, freight and logistic costs. All these factors marred WHR’s margin performance across most regions in fourth-quarter 2022.The company generated a gross profit of $645 million, down 39.3% from $1,063 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Ongoing EBIT of $171 million declined 66% from $502 million in the year-ago quarter. The ongoing EBIT margin of 3.5% contracted 510 bps year over year.Management expects continued investments in marketing and technology, as well as currency headwinds, to negatively impact margins by 125 basis points in 2023. An unfavorable price/mix is likely to affect the ongoing EBIT margin by 225 basis points.For 2023, net sales are anticipated to decline 1-2% to $19.4 billion, in sync with our estimate of a 1.7% decrease. On a GAAP and ongoing basis, Whirlpool expects earnings per share of $16-$18. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Consequently, shares of WHR have lost 13.1% in the past three months, underperforming the industry’s decline of 12.6%.Pricing Actions, Much-Needed SupportThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been on track with early and decisive actions to protect margins and productivity amid the ongoing supply-chain constraints and significant inflationary pressures. It has implemented cost takeout actions, including curtailing structural and discretionary costs, capturing raw material deflation opportunities, effectively managing working capital, and syncing supply chain and labor levels with demand.The company announced significant cost-based price increases of 5% to 18% in various countries. WHR also launched a cost takeout program worth $500 million, which is likely to reduce fixed and variable costs in 2023. Keeping in these lines, management is on track with its cost takeout actions, and expects $800-$900 million related to gains from the aforementioned measures and eased raw material inflation. The company expects to generate $500 million in net cost takeout actions via premium cost reductions of more than $250 million and supply-chain inefficiencies.In fourth-quarter 2022, the company concluded the strategic review of EMEA. As part of this, the company’s Europe major domestic appliance business will form a new entity with Arçelik. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2023. The new company is likely to generate more than €6 billion in annual sales and above €200 million in cost synergies.Story continuesConclusionWe believe that Whirlpool’s productivity and pricing actions will help offset the ongoing supply-chain constraints and significant inflationary pressures. Topping it, a VGM Score of B reflects its inherent strength. Also, earnings estimates for the current financial year have risen 0.6% in the past 60 days.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies are Ralph Lauren RL, PVH Corp PVH and H&amp;R Block HRB.Ralph Lauren, a footwear and accessories dealer, has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

That marks an increase from a 9% average promotion seen in March 2022.CHICAGO, IL - MARCH 24: A customer shops for appliances at a Home Depot store on March 24, 2015 in Chicago, Illinois. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) (Scott Olson via Getty Images)What could be more alarming to investors is that promotions on big-ticket items in all categories sold at Home Depot are running above 2019 levels year-to-date, according to Suzuki's research.Over at Best Buy, appliance promotions were roughly 20% on average in March. A year ago, promotions clocked in at an average of 18%.Meanwhile, the number of appliance categories offered on sale at Best Buy in 2023 (in other words, the breadth of promotions) is tracking above the average of the last three years, Suzuki noted.""This is likely a reflection of softening demand and increasing inventories,"" Suzuki said.To that end, sales in the building materials and appliances category are down 1.7% year to date, per the latest retail sales report.Appliance discounts pick up. (Bank of America)The weakness in big-ticket goods such as appliances reflects a few factors.First, the higher cost of credit has made it much more expensive to purchase appliances that have been jacked up in price over two-plus years of inflation. The average credit card rate right now on a store card could be north of 20%, depending on the store and credit profile of the consumer.Second, consumers continue to show a propensity to buy services like summer vacations as opposed to hard goods post-pandemic.Story continuesAnd lastly, the housing markdown slowdown at the hands of rising interest rates has dented appliance demand.Existing home sales data for February showed a 22.6% year-over-year decline. Prices for those homes dropped 0.2% year over year. New home sales declined 19% in February versus the prior year.""We foresee macro headwinds to slowly turn into tailwinds as the year progresses,"" Whirpool CEO Marc Bitzer told analysts on an early February conference call. ""Needless to say that it is difficult to predict the exact timing of the shift in the macro cycle, but we would expect this to happen towards late Q2 or early Q3.""To combat the sales slowdown, Whirlpool (WHR) is looking to slash $800 million to $900 million in costs this year.Investors are taking a wait-and-see approach to appliance stocks. Whirlpool stock is down 5.7% year to date despite those promised cost cuts, lagging the 7.5% advance for the S&amp;P 500.Home Depot's stock is off by 7% on the year, while Best Buy has shed 6.9%. Lowe's stock (LOW) is up slightly year to date.Suzuki's data suggests that patience is the right call on these appliance names.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Sempra Energy:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.036 = US$2.5b ÷ (US$79b - US$9.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).So, Sempra Energy has an ROCE of 3.6%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Integrated Utilities industry average of 5.0%. View our latest analysis for Sempra Energy roceIn the above chart we have measured Sempra Energy's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Sempra Energy here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?In terms of Sempra Energy's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 3.6% from 4.6% five years ago. However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayEven though returns on capital have fallen in the short term, we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for Sempra Energy. And the stock has followed suit returning a meaningful 62% to shareholders over the last five years. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we would look further into this stock to make sure the other metrics justify the positive view.One more thing: We've identified   2 warning signs  with Sempra Energy (at least 1 which is a bit concerning)  , and understanding them would certainly be useful.While Sempra Energy may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

531,55e6502d-6a7e-32d5-bc34-908f1e2fa9a8,SRE,2023-04-14,7 Best Stocks to Buy as Inflation Fears Creep Up,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-stocks-buy-inflation-012758911.html,1681176478,STORY,"['DG', 'SRE', 'FIVE', 'GO', 'MCY', 'CL', 'COST']","[While 2022 represented the year that saw inflation spike higher, the subsequent monetary tightening actions by the Federal Reserve cooled demand for the best stocks for inflation. However, a surprise threat from abroad – namely, the oil production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-member oil-producing nations – risk sending prices northward once again.True, the Fed could respond with even more monetary tightening. However, its hawkish policies over the trailing year appear to have made their impact. The latest employment opportunities data demonstrates that fewer positions are available from the prior count. Therefore, additional tightening could threaten a hard landing for the economy.It’s possible, then, that the Fed could be gingerly about its next policy actions (or do nothing at all). That might raise prices, which then may cynically bode well for these best stocks for inflation.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCLColgate-Palmolive$75.14FIVEFive Below$216.72SRESempra Energy$155.29GOGrocery Outlet$28.88COSTCostco$493.83DGDollar General$216.76MCYMercury General$33.13Colgate-Palmolive (CL)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comA multinational consumer goods giant, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) is one of the more sensible ideas among best stocks for inflation. Essentially, good times or bad, everyone needs to brush their teeth (or at least they should). Further, it’s always possible that consistent brushing may reduce chances of expensive dentist visits. To be clear, that’s not dental advice – just common sense.Financially, CL stock intrigues because of its stable nature. While it doesn’t offer the best metrics ever, CL keeps you in the game. For example, Colgate’s Altman Z-Score pings at 6.54, reflecting high stability and low risk of bankruptcy in the next two years. Operationally, it gets the job done with a three-year revenue growth rate of 5.5%, which is right in the middle.Story continuesHowever, Colgate does benefit from strong profitability. Its net margin comes in just under 10%, outpacing 79.57% of its peers. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg CL as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $79.13, implying almost 5% upside potential.Five Below (FIVE)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockA popular chain of specialty discount retailers, Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) ranks a cut above your typical dollar store. Here, Five Below sells most products for five bucks or less. As well, the company features a collection of intriguing merchandise priced from $6 to $25. Since the Jan. opener, FIVE gained more than 20% of its equity value. In the trailing year, it’s up by almost 22%.As one of the best stocks for inflation, Five Below may still have some legs left. On the balance sheet, the company enjoys a solid Altman Z-Score of 5.42. Operationally, the retailer’s three-year revenue growth rate comes in at 18.8%, outpacing 81.51% of its peers. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period is 18.6%.Better yet, Five Below is highly profitable. Its net margin is 8.5%, above 81.7% of companies in the cyclical retail industry. Lastly, covering analysts peg FIVE as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target is $220.89, implying nearly 7% upside potential.Sempra Energy (SRE)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comAs a public utility firm, Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) benefits richly from a natural monopoly. Basically, the barrier to entry in the utility space is so steep that most would-be competitors don’t even try. In addition, Sempra targets large swathes of the lucrative Southern California market. Symbolizing a sizable component of the economic engine of the U.S., SoCal makes SRE one of the best stocks for inflation.On a relative basis, you might say SRE is still undervalued. Since the Jan. opener, shares only gained a bit over 1%. In the past 365 days, it gave up almost 9% of its equity value. Admittedly, the financial prospects don’t seem appealing. Technically, its Altman Z-Score of 1.07 indicates a distressed enterprise.Here’s the thing: utilities typically don’t feature outstanding financial metrics. But for Sempra’s case, it’s profitable, enjoying a net margin of 14.8%. In closing, analysts peg SRE as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes in at $168.11, implying over 8% upside potential.Grocery Outlet (GO)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Fundamentally, Grocery Outlet (NASDAQ:GO) makes perfect sense as one of the best stocks for inflation. A discount closeout retailer, Grocery Outlet offers deeply discounted, overstocked and closeout products from name brands and private label suppliers. Obviously, with most households hurting from higher grocery prices, a business like Grocery Outlet should flourish.So far, though, GO has been disappointing. Since the Jan. opener, GO slipped by 3%. In the last year, it’s down by an alarming 22%. Admittedly, some of the pensiveness centers on the company not being so fiscally sound. For instance, its Altman Z-Score pings at 2.6, which sits in the grey zone of stability. Also, Grocery Outlet’s three-year revenue growth rate of 4.5% is middling.However, one attractive metric is its gross margin. At 30.52%, the company beats out 72.58% of the competition. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg GO as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes out to $30.56, implying 10% upside potential.Costco (COST)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comIf you’re looking for one of the best stocks for inflation from both an investor and consumer perspective, look no further than Costco (NASDAQ:COST). You can read my take on the topic at TipRanks if you wish. However, the bottom line is that Costco’s business encourages bulk shopping. That’s one of the most effective mechanisms to “beat” inflation. Also, the company caters to a wealthier demographic, insulating the brand from some headwinds.Financially as well, Costco delivers the goods. Up top, the retailer’s cash-to-debt ratio is 1.5 times, ranked better than 71.81% of its peers. Also, its Altman Z-Score pings at a lofty 7.24. Operationally, Costco enjoys an outstanding three-year revenue growth rate of 14%. Its EBITDA growth rate during the same period is 15.4%, besting 63.16% of the field. Also, its net margin is 2.58%, above 62.46% of rivals.Looking to the Street, analysts peg COST as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $550.33, implying over 13% upside potential.Dollar General (DG)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comA chain of variety stores, Dollar General (NYSE:DG) is an obvious choice for best stocks for inflation. One of the most popular dollar stores, Dollar General may be somewhat of a cynical play. With rising prices and hurting consumers, people will look to the retailer to help make ends meet. Thus, demand should swing higher.For now, though, DG stock finds itself down nearly 14% since the beginning of the year. In the past 365 days, it’s down to nearly the same magnitude. However, eventually, Dollar General enjoys a path forward from the malaise. In particular, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 15.9%, above 88.26% of the competition.On the bottom line, the firm’s net margin is 6.38%, outpacing 87.38% of rivals in the defensive retail industry. Finally, analysts peg DG as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $241, implying over 13% upside potential.Mercury General (MCY)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comUnder the context of best stocks for inflation, Mercury General (NYSE:MCY) enjoys a straightforward narrative. Given the vagaries of life, everyone should get insurance coverage. Further, since the Covid-19 crisis, the roads have gotten much more dangerous. Thus, it makes sense for people to protect their financial wellbeing.Despite the common-sense nature of Mercury, MCY slipped 5% since the start of the year. Moreover, in the trailing one-year period, shares stumbled over 40%. To be fair, Mercury could use some help in the financials, ironically enough. Perhaps most glaringly, its three-year revenue growth rate sits at 2.9% below breakeven.However, the pandemic did a number on Mercury’s business. Moving forward, the narrative should be much more appealing. Notably, Raymond James’ analyst Charles Peters is willing to give Mercury a chance, pegging MCY as a buy. The expert’s price target comes out to $45, implying 38% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on General Electric's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for General Electric How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for General Electric is:2.5% = US$936m ÷ US$38b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.02 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.General Electric's Earnings Growth And 2.5% ROEIt is quite clear that General Electric's ROE is rather low. Even compared to the average industry ROE of 26%, the company's ROE is quite dismal. In spite of this, General Electric was able to grow its net income considerably, at a rate of 45% in the last five years. Therefore, there could be other reasons behind this growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.As a next step, we compared General Electric's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 36%.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for GE? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is General Electric Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?General Electric's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 5.9%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 94% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.Additionally, General Electric has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 7.5% over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that General Electric's future ROE will rise to 15% even though the the company's payout ratio is expected to rise. We presume that there could some other characteristics of the business that could be driving the anticipated growth in the company's ROE.ConclusionIn total, it does look like General Electric has some positive aspects to its business. With a high rate of reinvestment, albeit at a low ROE, the company has managed to see a considerable growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about General Electric (GE).GE currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.77, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 15 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.77 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 15 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 53.3% and 13.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for GEBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for GECheck price target &amp; stock forecast for GE here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying GE, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in GE?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for GE, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 1% over the past month to $1.99.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for GE.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN), TotalEnergies SE (TTE) and Raytheon Technologies Corp. (RTX). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Texas Instruments have gained +6.7% over the past year against the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry's gain of +12.8%. The company is benefiting from growing demand for embedded technologies across the automotive and industrial markets. Moreover, a solid rebound in the automotive market remains a positive.Further, the strengthening demand in industrial, communication equipment and enterprise systems markets is a tailwind. Notably, solid investments in new growth avenues and competitive advantages remain tailwinds. Further, its portfolio of long-lived products and efficient manufacturing strategies are other positives.However, pandemic-led supply-chain disruptions and imposition of new export regulations are headwinds. Further, weakness in the Analog segment of the company is a concern. Additionally, softness in the personal electronics end-market remains an overhang.(You can read the full research report on Texas Instruments here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of TotalEnergies have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry over the past year (+33.5% vs. +17.4%). The company continues to benefit from startups, well-spread LNG assets and an expanding upstream portfolio that has exposure to fast-growing hydrocarbon-producing regions. Lower exposure to mature assets acts as a tailwind.TTE streamlines its portfolio through acquisitions, partnerships and divestitures. TTE has enough liquidity to meet its near-term debt obligations. TTE is making investments to expand the renewable operation and aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.However, TTE's production is impacted by the security-related production cuts in some regions. TTE remains exposed to acquisition-related risks as these assets contribute a sizable volume to production. A natural decline in production and TTE's withdrawal from Russia might affect profitability.(You can read the full research report on TotalEnergies here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Raytheon Technologies' shares have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense Equipment industry over the past six months (+21.4% vs. +18.1%). The company continues to receive ample orders for its combat-proven defense products and expects both domestic and international program growth to remain robust for its defense business.This should boost the revenue generation prospects for its defense business. A steady recovery in commercial air traffic continues to boost commercial OEM as well as commercial aftermarket sales for it. The stock holds a solid solvency position.Yet, economic sanctions imposed by governments in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine might hurt Raytheon. A comparative analysis of its trailing 12-month Price/Book ratio indicates a relatively gloomy picture, which may concern investors'. The appreciating U.S. dollar has been burdening airlines, which may hurt the stock.(You can read the full research report on Raytheon Technologies here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Morgan Stanley and The Progressive Corp..Story continuesZacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double"" From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come.

548,f1cd5dc4-8064-354c-a058-4becaaa0397a,VLO,2023-04-14,Why It's Good to Be an Oil Refiner This Earnings Season,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-good-oil-refiner-earnings-140702978.html,1681308422,STORY,"['MPC', 'CL=F', 'CVI', 'VLO']","[As the energy sector undergoes a significant shift toward renewable energy sources, it's important to keep a tab on the performance of traditional energy sources. According to Bank of America’s recent outlook for the energy sector, the oil refining industry is in a “golden age”, with analysts predicting the best Q1 results ever for U.S. oil refiners. This is excellent news for companies in the sector like Marathon Petroleum MPC, CVR Energy CVI, and Valero Energy VLO. Before getting into the stocks, it's essential to understand what's driving this trend.Key Factors Behind Refiners’ Profit SurgeAt first glance, it may seem counterintuitive that the oil refining industry is doing so well. After all, the world is moving toward renewable energy and oil is widely considered a non-renewable resource. However, there are several factors at play here that are driving the industry's growth.One of the most significant factors driving the oil refining industry's growth is the current demand for gasoline. The pandemic led to a significant drop in gasoline demand in 2020, but this year, demand has rebounded significantly, thanks to the return of normal economic activity. This rebound in demand has led to higher prices for gasoline, which has helped boost oil refiners’ profits.Another factor driving the industry's growth is the current state of the global oil market. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has been limiting oil production to help support prices. Additionally, the recent cold snap in Texas, which is a significant producer of oil, caused significant disruptions to the industry, further driving up prices.The ""Golden Age"" of RefiningAs mentioned in a Bank of America report, the refining industry is currently experiencing a ""golden age."" This can be attributed to several factors, including increased demand for refined petroleum products, low crude oil prices and improvements in refining technology.Story continuesAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the refining industry has seen steady growth over the past decade, with 2022 seeing record-high levels of petroleum product demand. This trend is expected to continue in 2023, with experts projecting a 3.5% increase in demand for gasoline alone.Furthermore, advancements in refining technology have allowed companies to process heavier crude oils, resulting in higher yields of valuable products such as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. This has enabled refiners to maintain profitability despite low crude oil prices.The Impact of Environmental RegulationsWhile the refining industry is experiencing a period of growth, it is not without its challenges. Environmental regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, particularly with regard to greenhouse gas emissions.In response, refiners are investing heavily in technologies that reduce emissions, such as carbon capture and storage and hydrogen production. While these technologies are still in the early stages of development, they have shown promise in reducing the environmental impact of the industry.The Role of Refiners in the Energy SectorAs the Bank of America report noted, oil refiners are leading the energy sector outlook for Q1 2023. This is due in part to the industry's resilience in the face of low crude oil prices as well as increased demand for refined petroleum products.In addition, refiners are playing a key role in the transition to cleaner energy sources. Many companies are investing in renewable fuels such as biofuels and hydrogen as well as CCS technologies. By embracing these technologies, refiners are positioning themselves as key players in the energy transition.Solid Industry RankThe Zacks Oil and Gas – Refining and Marketing is a 16-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #37, which places it in the top 15% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bullish near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Which Companies Will Gain the Most?A company that is enjoying the benefits of the robust refining environment is CVR Energy. CVR has been able to take advantage of the lower crude oil prices to achieve strong operational performance. In addition, the company has undertaken several initiatives aimed at reducing its cost of operations, such as increasing its focus on high-margin products, reducing its headcount and improving its energy efficiency. As a result, CVR is expected to report strong Q1 results, with its share price already reflecting the expected good news.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of 98 cents per share. The estimated figure indicates an astounding 4,800% increase year over year. Currently, CVR Energy carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks hereMarathon Petroleum is set to benefit from the strong refining environment. This downstream operator is focused on optimizing its portfolio and improving its operational performance. Marathon is also making strategic investments aimed at reducing its carbon footprint, in line with the industry's transition toward cleaner energy sources.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of $5.17 per share. The estimated figure indicates a 247% increase year over year. In other words, Marathon Petroleum is expected to report strong Q1 earnings. MPC carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)Valero Energy is among the companies that have leveraged the robust refining environment to great benefit. This is partly due to the company's focus on optimizing its portfolio and capacity utilization, which helped it to achieve strong operational performance.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of $6.70 per share. The estimated figure indicates a 190% jump year over year. Currently, VLO carries a Zacks Rank of 2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.One stock to keep an eye on is Par Pacific (PARR). PARR is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 4.34, which compares to its industry's average of 6.12. Over the past year, PARR's Forward P/E has been as high as 30.94 and as low as 3.01, with a median of 8.51.Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator.

The recent hike takes the dividend to 94.07 cents a share, which will be paid out on May 15, 2023, to shareholders of record as of Apr 21, 2023. This hike in dividend is also applicable for Series A and Series B ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock stockholders of record as of the start of business on Apr 21, 2023. Last April, P&amp;G had hiked its regular quarterly dividend by 5% to 91.33 cents.Since the company's incorporation in 1890, it has paid dividends for 133 straight years and this increase in the quarterly dividend marks the 67th consecutive year of dividend hike. Evidently, PG's strong ability to generate cash flow has allowed it to steadily increase dividends over time.Backed by sound fundamentals and financial strength, PG remains committed to enhancing its shareholder value. The current hike reflects a strong cash flow generation capability, driven by better execution of operating plans. We note that net cash provided by operating activities totaled $7,644 million in the first half of fiscal 2023.We believe that such strategic steps not only drive shareholder value but also raise the market value of the stock. In fact, through these dividend increases, companies persuade investors to either buy or hold the script. People looking for regular income from stocks are most likely to choose companies with a track record of consistent and incremental dividend payouts.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat Else You Should KnowProcter &amp; Gamble’s strong brand and growth strategies have been contributing to its upbeat performance for a while.

Specifically, during the week ending March 22, Yahoo Finance reported that depositors drained $126 billion from U.S. banks. Unlike prior such transactions, this time around, the outflow originated from the nation’s largest institutions.Put another way, regular folks are reading between the lines. Additionally, with banking jitters going abroad and surprise production cuts spiking the price of crude oil, the Federal Reserve’s problems overflow the table. There’s only so much that one entity can do, contributing to the pessimism. About the only solution now may be to consider these safe stocks to buy.MSFTMicrosoft$289.39PGProcter &amp; Gamble$150.96MCDMcDonald’s$283.78OLLIOllie’s Bargain Outlet$59.10INTUIntuit$444.72ALLAllstate$116.11ADMArcher Daniels Midland$80.05InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsMicrosoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comAs a technology giant, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) might not be everyone’s idea for safe stocks to buy. After all, the mass layoffs that have been occurring since last year mostly impacted the tech sector. Nevertheless, Microsoft is also indispensable in the business world. Basically, if you operate a PC, you must be fluent in Microsoft’s core applications or risk falling behind.Another factor that makes MSFT one of the safe stocks to buy centers on its financial resilience. For example, on the balance sheet, Microsoft features a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.61, above nearly 63% of software companies. Also, its Altman Z-Score pings at 9.14, indicating high stability and very low risk of bankruptcy.As well, the enterprise benefits from a solid revenue trek and a net margin of 33%, well above the competition. Finally, covering analysts peg MSFT as a consensus strong buy. On average, their price target comes out to $297.25, implying 2% upside potential.Story continuesProcter &amp; Gamble (PG)Procter &amp; Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&amp;G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods CompanySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comA multinational consumer goods corporation, Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) specializes in a wide range of personal health/consumer health, personal care and hygiene products. Let’s put it another way. No matter what goes on with the economy, people still need to take care of themselves (physically). Therefore, PG ranks among the safe stocks to buy.Yes, Procter &amp; Gamble is a boring company – there’s no question about it. But it’s also this nature that makes it enticing during this hour. For example, the company enjoys solid stability in the balance sheet, marked by an Altman Z-Score of 5.35.Operationally, the company gets the job done with a three-year revenue growth rate of 5.8%. Here, the enterprise beats out 51.12% of its rivals, which is okay. However, its net margin storms out of the gates at 17.79%, beating out almost 92% of sector peers. Lastly, analysts peg PG as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $157.85, implying nearly 4% upside potential.McDonald’s (MCD)Source: ShutterstockA fast-food icon and a symbol of American capitalism, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) really needs no introduction. As a result, you might say that MCD represents an obvious choice for safe stocks to buy. Fundamentally, the company benefits from the trade-down effect. Rather than picking up your morning coffee (and breakfast items) at an expensive café, you can head down to a cheaper McCafe.Financially, McDonald’s delivers the core elements of a leading example of safe stocks to buy. On the balance sheet, the company enjoys an Altman Z-Score of 4.94, sitting in the safe zone of fiscal stability. Operationally, the Golden Arches prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 3.8%, beating out 72.81% of its peers.Perhaps most significantly, McDonald’s is hugely profitable. Its net margin stands at 26.65%, above 96.57% of companies in the restaurants industry. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg MCD as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $296.04, implying nearly 5% upside potential.Ollie’s Bargain Outlet (OLLI)Woman at the supermarket checkout, she is paying using a credit card, shopping and retail conceptSource: ShutterstockA favorite idea among safe stocks to buy, Ollie’s Bargain Outlet (NASDAQ:OLLI) enjoys significant relevance as a discount retailer. However, it’s more than just that. With Ollie’s offering unsold or overstocked items with brand-name labels, the business is simply more attractive to consumers. Indeed, since the start of the year, OLLI gained over 24% of equity value. In the trailing year, it’s up nearly 14%.Financially, Ollie’s continues to entice onlookers. Notably, the company benefits from fiscal stability. Its equity-to-asset ratio is 0.67 times, above 83.17% of its peers. Further, its Altman Z-Score pings at 5.25, reflecting low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate is 10.9%, above 75.44% of the field.As well, its net margin comes out to 5.63%, ranked better than 85% of firms in the defensive retail industry. Looking to the Street, analysts peg OLLI as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target is $62, implying almost 7% upside potential.Intuit (INTU)Stacks of coins hold up wooden blocks that spell out ""TAX."" FairTaxSource: ShutterstockA business software company, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) specializes in financial software. Intuit’s products include the tax preparation application TurboTax, personal finance app Mint, the small business accounting program QuickBooks, the credit monitoring service Credit Karma and email marketing platform Mailchimp. Since the start of the year, INTU gained over 14% of equity value.Yes, it’s down more than 7% in the trailing one-year period. Still, as the nature of work evolves and people consider jumping to the gig economy, the tax implications associated with gig workers (independent contractors) should bolster INTU. For now, it ranks as one of the safe stocks to buy because of high stability in the balance sheet and strong operational metrics.In particular, it’s worth pointing out the three-year revenue growth rate of 20.4% and net margin of 14.22%. Both stats rank above their respective industry median values. To close out, analysts peg INTU as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $478.94, implying over 7% upside potential.Allstate (ALL)Allstate Insurance officeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comAs a major player in the insurance business, Allstate (NYSE:ALL) easily ranks among the safe stocks to buy. It’s not that it has sterling financials. Rather, the company benefits from extreme relevance. Under any circumstance, acquiring financial protection represents a common-sense virtue. But in the wildness associated with the post-pandemic ecosystem, financial protection becomes even more pertinent.To be fair, though, investors don’t quite see the connection between the narrative and the price action. Since the Jan. opener, ALL slipped almost 16%. In the trailing year, it fell nearly 19%. Nevertheless, the company could make a comeback following the Covid-19 malaise.Notably, Allstate’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 14.2%, ranked above 79% of its peers. Also, ALL trades at 0.61-times trailing sales. In contrast, the sector median value is 0.93 times.Finally, analysts peg ALL as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $137.17, implying 19% upside potential.Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)Source: ©iStock.com/AndreyPSA multinational food processing and commodities trading company, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) – commonly known as ADM, which is also its ticker symbol – offers an enticing idea for safe stocks to buy. Fundamentally, humans need to eat. Therefore, if we incur a hard economic landing, ADM should be somewhat insulated from the worst of the pain. However, since the start of the year, ADM stock dipped more than 12%.It’s even worse against the trailing year, with ADM shedding more than 17%. Still, the company benefits from strong operational metrics. In particular, its three-year revenue growth rate pings at 16.4%, above 80.78% of companies in the consumer packaged goods industry. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period is an impressive 30.8%.Enticingly, the market prices ADM at a forward multiple of 11.67. As a discount to projected earnings, the company ranks better than 73.45% of the competition. Lastly, analysts peg ADM as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $102.50, implying over 30% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

For more real estate companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Real Estate Companies in USA. Two children, a car, and a white picket fence - so goes the American dream. Looking at this, you'll realize that the automotive and real estate industries are at the center of American culture. Most people dream to own their house one day and often end up taking out multi-decade long mortgages to afford their own place of living. Apart from houses, several other buildings and properties make up the real estate sector. These range from public places such as parks, to apartment complexes, office buildings, and giant skyscrapers.Naturally, this also means that the real estate industry is among the most closely watched sectors by both governments and the wealthy. The rich are crazy about real estate since they invest copious amounts of wealth in it. After all, having a villa in Beverly Hills has a much different bling to it than a house in a village. Speaking numbers, a report from McKinsey shows that two thirds of global net worth were invested in real estate as of 2020. Within these two thirds, residential and private real estate accounted for almost half, or 46%, of global net worth, with government and public buildings making up another 23%. Growth rates in net worth with respect to the overall gross domestic product (GDP) show that this plowing of funds into a notoriously unproductive asset has led to significant net worth growth as well. McKinsey's data shows that between 2000 and 2020, net worth compared to GDP was a stunning 104% higher than in the three decades between 1970 and 1999. On the most extreme end, France's richest benefited from the real estate boom, as it grew by an eye popping 371% higher than the GDP! Within the net worth growth between 2000 and 2020, two thirds were due to higher asset prices, with saving and investment both accounting for a rather tame 28%.Story continuesAs this should make it clear, real estate is quite lucrative indeed. But just how lucrative is estimated in a research report from Grand View Research. In this report, the firm estimates that the global real estate industry was worth $3.69 trillion in 2021 and despite this huge size, the segment is expected to post a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.2% between 2022 and 2030 to sit at $5.85 trillion by the end of the forecast period. Within the market, the commercial real estate market was the largest constituent segment as it accounted for 35% of the entire market. Apart from residential, the commercial real estate market is another large component of the industry and it will match the broader sector's growth rate by growing at a 5.1% CAGR during the forecast period. Additionally, Grand View Research also highlights that sales by property type, such as villas and second homes, will outpace the broader market in terms of growth by growing at 6.1%. It adds that the Middle East and Africa will also outpace market growth, but Asia Pacific is the largest segment in terms of geography with more than half the market share.In America, the real estate sector is facing some stress these days, This is due to the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes that aim to make borrowing costs for firms and individuals higher to kill GDP growth and fight inflation. The U.S. real estate sector is worth $20 trillion (this is the total value of the properties and not the revenues) and prices dropped by 15% in March 2023 from their peak values. Rising interest rates are playing a role in this, as commercial real estate purchases are rarely made out of pocket and instead, they rely on bank loans and funding. While a 15% drop in itself sounds high, experts worry that prices could drop as much as 30% in case of an economic downturn or a recession.Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD)'s earnings call for its fourth quarter of 2022 provides valuable insight. During the event, management outlined:With regard to our markets and leasing activity, the bottomline is that conditions remain healthy and there is little we see across our results or proprietary metrics that point to a meaningful slowdown. We see a normalization of demand and when combined with low vacancy, it continues to translate to a meaningful increase in rents. Across our markets, rent growth was nearly 5% during the quarter, driving the full year to 28%. Proposal activity for available space was consistent with our recent history, and given persistent low vacancy, there is simply a very small number of units to even propose deals on. As evidenced, over 99% of our portfolio is either currently leased or in negotiation. Utilization remains high at 86%, near its all time record and deal gestation ticked up over the quarter, indicative of more careful consideration and time being taken in leasing decisions.While we are watching e-commerce carefully, its share of overall retail sales have increased to 22%, which is 600 basis points above its pre-pandemic level. Putting the nuance of mix, timing and other factors aside, as measured by retention, occupancy or rent change, it is clear that customers need to commit to space to market conditions, which offer them very little choice. In terms of supply, the development pipeline across our market stands at 565 million square feet and our expectation for the year is that the pipeline will decline. Deliveries will put modest upward pressure on vacancies from 3.3% today towards 4% later in the year. However, new development starts are slowing in response to the market environment, which will reduce vacancies in late 2023 or 2024.With these details in mind, let's take a look at the biggest real estate companies in America, out of which the top ones are Equinix, Inc.

UDR is well-poised to benefit from a diversified portfolio, with a superior product mix of A/B quality properties in urban and suburban communities in both coastal and Sunbelt locations.The company’s efforts to diversify its portfolio with respect to geographies and price points limit its exposure to volatility and concentration risks alongside assuring stable cash flows. Moreover, in recent quarters, UDR has been experiencing strong pricing power, as evidenced by blended lease rate growth.UDR is also leveraging technological investments and process enhancements to drive innovation and margin expansion. Its Next Generation Operating Platform allows the company to electronically interact with and provide service to residents and prospects throughout its diversified portfolio. These efforts are likely to give UDR a competitive edge over its peers.The company maintains a healthy balance sheet position with ample liquidity. It exited 2022 with $1 billion of liquidity. UDR’s debt maturity schedule is well-laddered, with weighted average years to maturity of 6.7 years and a weighted average interest rate of 3.17%. Also, 88.2% of its net operating income is unencumbered. With enough financial flexibility, UDR is well-poised to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Solid dividend payouts are the biggest enticement for REIT investors, and UDR remains committed to that. It has increased its dividend five times in the last five years, and the five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 3.77%. Given its solid financial position and strong cash flows from operations, the company’s dividend payout seems sustainable.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 7.3% in the past six months compared with its industry’s increase of 1.5%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, the struggle to lure renters is likely to persist as supply volumes are expected to remain elevated in several of its markets. With the ongoing construction standing at a high level, a sizeable number of apartment deliveries are expected in the upcoming period.Moreover, UDR faces stiff competition from other housing alternatives, such as rental apartments, condominiums and single-family homes. Such a competitive landscape limits the company’s ability to increase rent, thereby restricting its growth momentum to some extent.Furthermore, a hike in the interest rate is a concern for UDR. Rising rates imply higher borrowing costs for the company, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate. The company has a substantial debt burden and its total debt as of Dec 31, 2022, was approximately $5.5 billion.Our estimate for 2023 interest expenses indicates a year-over-year rise of 11%. Moreover, the dividend payout might become less attractive than the yields on fixed income and money market accounts.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the broader REIT sector are VICI Properties Inc.

Horton, Inc.'s (NYSE:DHI) Stock's On An Uptrend: Are Strong Financials Guiding The Market?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/d-r-horton-inc-nyse-171827526.html,1681319907,STORY,['DHI'],"[Most readers would already be aware that D.R. Horton's (NYSE:DHI) stock increased significantly by 6.0% over the past month. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study D.R. Horton's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for D.R. Horton How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for D.R. Horton is:28% = US$5.7b ÷ US$21b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.28.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of D.R. Horton's Earnings Growth And 28% ROETo begin with, D.R. Horton has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 20% the company's ROE is quite impressive. As a result, D.R. Horton's exceptional 35% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared D.R. Horton's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 30% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is DHI worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether DHI is currently mispriced by the market.Is D.R. Horton Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?D.R. Horton's ' three-year median payout ratio is on the lower side at 7.7% implying that it is retaining a higher percentage (92%) of its profits. So it looks like D.R. Horton is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.Moreover, D.R. Horton is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 11% over the next three years. Consequently, the higher expected payout ratio explains the decline in the company's expected ROE (to 15%) over the same period.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that D.R. Horton's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

Furthermore, the Zacks Transportation-Airline Industry is in the top 13% of over 250 Zacks industries at the moment.  Peak Travel Season Edging closer to the warmer months of the year, we are entering peak travel season and this should certainly give a boost to many airlines. There is also the possibility that travel will be higher in 2023 from lingering pent-up demand following the pandemic.In its latest data at the end of March, the U.S. Travel Associations’ survey of travel spending totaled $93 billion in February which was 5% above 2019 pre-pandemic levels and 9% above 2022 levels.Plus, the Transportation Security Administrations' (TSA) checkpoint travel numbers have seen quite a few days spike above 2019 levels so far this month and are overall higher than last year as shown in the nearby chart.Travel Security AdministrationImage Source: Travel Security AdministrationEarnings Estimate RevisionsIn correlation with the plausibility of higher travel demand, American Airlines’ earnings estimate revisions have continued to trend higher. Fiscal 2023 earnings estimates have now soared 32% over the last 90 days with FY24 EPS estimates rising 20%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAmerican Airlines FY23 earnings are now forecasted to rebound and skyrocket 410% at $2.55 per share compared to EPS of $0.50 in 2022. Even better, fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to climb another 24% at $3.16 per share.On the top line, sales are projected to jump 9% this year and rise another 4% in FY24 to $55.77 billion. More importantly, fiscal 2024 would be 25% above 2019 pre-pandemic sales of $44.54 billion. This will certainly help the company’s bottom line start to catch up as well.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAttractive Valuation Along with its post-pandemic growth recovery, American Airlines’ valuation may be intriguing to investors right now with Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk recently announcing he will purchase a 51% stake in the company.Story continuesNews of Musk’s majority interest in American Airlines surfaced at the beginning of the month. Although the Tesla boss jokingly stated he simply has an abundance of cash and likes buying companies with bird logos (Twitter) there is surely the factor of American Airlines price to earnings discount.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAmerican Airlines stock trades at just 5.1X forward earnings which is nicely beneath the industry average of 11.2X and the S&amp;P 500’s 19X. Shares of AAL also trade 74% below their historical high of 21.1X since merging with U.S Airways in 2013. Plus, American Airlines stock trades at a 22% discount to its historic median of 6.9X.Bottom Line Now appears to be a great time to get in on American Airlines stock with earnings estimate revisions trending higher and shares still near 52-week lows at around $13 per share. The rising earnings estimates also make American Airlines P/E valuation very attractive and indicate its stock could indeed be vastly undervalued right now.It would be no surprise if American Airlines stock begins to fly this year with the Average Zacks Price Target suggesting 37% upside from current levels.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves.

After it posted a wider quarterly loss than expected, Delta's shares dropped 1.7%, pulling down even American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ: AAL) whose shares sank 9% as it revealed a weaker than expected guidance.DeltaDelta reported an adjusted revenue of $11.84 billion that came below analyst estimates that averaged $11.99 billion. For the quarter that ended on March 31st, Delta made a net loss of $363 million, or 57 cents per share, partially due to a new four-year pilot contract. But despite the cost of the 34% raise it gave to pilots, skies are brighter compared to last year’s quarter when net loss amounted to $940 million, or $1.48 per share as travel demand was still recovering. When excluding one-time items, Delta made a net income of $163 million, or 25 cents per share compared to 2022’s first quarter loss of $748 million, or $1.23 per share.Excluding fuel, unit costs rose 4.7% on the year, partly due to winter storms that grounded flights. March domestic sales are back to pre-COVID 2019 levels as corporate bookings are undergoing recovery and loyalty program receiving a boost through the American Express Company (NYSE: AXP) partnership that contributed $1.7 billion in revenue which translates to an increase of 38% from 2022’s comparable quarter. Moreover, Delta revealed that first class revenue has outpaced the one generated by standard seats.Forecasting Record Advance BookingsDespite missing estimates, the Atlanta-based carrier issued second quarter guidance that topped analyst estimates, signaling that despite a weakening macroeconomic environment, travel demand is going strong. Delta is expecting sales in the undergoing quarter to rise 15% to 17% compared to last year’s comparable quarter with adjusted operating margins of 16% and adjusted EPS in the range between $2 and $2.25. Refinitiv survey of analysts estimated revenue growth of 14.7% and EPS of $1.66. Delta plans to increase capacity 17% compared to 2022’s second quarter as it expects a record to be achieved in advance summer bookings.Story continuesAmerican AirlinesDelta reported its earnings a day after American Airlines issued a weaker than expected earnings guidance for the undergoing quarter. American Airlines now expects first quarter EPS to be in the range between $0.01 and $0.05 which is above its prior breakeven outlook, yet below analyst estimates that averaged $0.06. Total revenue per available seat mile is expected to rise 25.5% which is the midpoint of its prior gain forecast that was in the range between 24% and 27%.United Airlines will issue its earnings report on Tuesday, while a week after it will be joined by American Airlines and the struggling Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE: LUV). Delta’s results reflect its strong pricing power and signal that travel demand is going strong, the latter which will be confirmed by the above reports as U.S. carriers tend to make a significant portion of their annual revenue during the spring and summer season.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

577,326a3397-601d-36fd-abd5-b0afc0143f6a,AAL,2023-04-14,American Airlines (AAL) to Report Q1 Results: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-airlines-aal-report-q1-140102570.html,1681394462,STORY,['AAL'],"[American Airlines (AAL) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis world's largest airline is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.03 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +101.3%.Revenues are expected to be $12.23 billion, up 37.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 17.05% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for American Airlines?For American Airlines, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +226.92%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.So, this combination indicates that American Airlines will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that American Airlines would post earnings of $1.14 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.17, delivering a surprise of +2.63%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.American Airlines appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

HCA, Universal Health Services Inc. UHS, Acadia Healthcare Co., Inc. ACHC and Tenet Healthcare Corp. THC.Industry: HospitalLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2076823/4-stocks-in-focus-as-hospital-industry-witnesses-improvementAfter facing multiple issues for several quarters, hospital companies are witnessing improving market conditions thanks to the easing staffing challenges and increasing non-Covid utilization. As serious medical conditions continue to rise, outpatient surgeries and patient days are likely to increase, boosting Zacks Medical-Hospital industry players' revenues. However, growing competition in this market remains a common theme. Technological innovations and adoptions are expected to provide companies with a competitive edge and improve efficiency. Leading industry players like HCA Healthcare Inc., Universal Health Services Inc., Acadia Healthcare Co., Inc. and Tenet Healthcare Corp. should benefit from these developments.About the Industry The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry comprises for-profit hospital companies that provide healthcare through different types of hospitals, such as acute care, rehabilitation and psychiatric. These hospital entities are engaged in internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery, orthopedics and obstetrics, telehealth services, mental health care and diagnostic and emergency services.Revenues of these companies depend on inpatient occupancy levels, medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and provided to patients, and the volume of outpatient procedures. These hospital companies receive payments for patient services from the government under the Medicare program, Medicaid or similar programs, managed care plans (including plans offered through the American Health Benefit Exchanges), private insurers and directly from patients.Story continues4 Key Trends to Watch in the Hospital IndustryRising Patient Volumes: With declining COVID-related utilization of resources, non-COVID admissions are expected to grow. As serious medical conditions are rising, demand for elective procedures is likely to drive patient volumes. Growth in admissions, outpatient surgeries and Medicare reimbursements, and deferred procedures can support hospital companies' revenues. However, inflationary pressures and financial constraints can force patients to delay addressing some non-emergency medical needs. The benefits of the Affordable Care Act and similar safety nets can provide patients with some respite, which can help them navigate tough times.Growing Elderly Population: Steady advancements in science, nutrition and healthcare enable the senior population to witness constant growth. This can result in rising demand for hospital services in the long term. The U.S. Census Bureau's revised report suggests that individuals above 65 years are projected to be one of the fastest-growing segments of the country's population, reflecting a climb from 17% in 2020 to 21% in 2030.By 2034, older adults are expected to outnumber children, a first in the country's history. This demographic change and the rising incidence of diseases will likely be industry drivers. Plus, the increasing number of people signing up for healthcare plans through the Affordable Care Act indicates fewer challenges to visiting hospitals in the future.Technological Advancements: Technological improvements, innovations and wider adoption will continue to support hospital players. This should optimize hospital services, minimize unnecessary expenses and elevate the patient experience. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the adoption of telehealth and telemedicine services, which will likely rise in the future.The companies are leveraging AI and automation along with real-time analytics to provide quality care. AI helps improve clinical workflow management and medical diagnosis that hospitals utilize. The industry players are using the virtual health domain to enhance efficiency by limiting the patients' waiting time and reducing their treatment costs.Rising Expenses: With rising patient volumes, operating costs are bound to go up. Increasing costs of hospital supplies due to inflation will likely reduce margins. Also, growth-project investments will keep expenses elevated, putting pressure on the bottom line. However, improving labor shortages and staffing challenges will provide hospital companies some breathing room. Moreover, renegotiating contracts with suppliers and vendors will provide an impetus.Zacks Industry Rank Depicts Promising ScenarioThe group's  Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Medical sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #103, which places it in the top 41% of nearly 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group's earnings growth potential.Before we present the stocks that you may want to watch, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Medical-Hospital industry has fared better than the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite as well as its broader sector over the past year. During this time period, the stocks in this industry have declined 4.2% compared with the S&amp;P 500's fall of 7.1% and the Zacks Medical sector's decrease of 15.2%.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing hospital stocks, the industry trades at 8.90X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 12.55X and the sector's 8.14X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 9.05X, as low as 5.57X and at a median of 7.80X.4 Stocks Worth Your AttentionWe are presenting four stocks with a Zacks Ranks #3 (Hold) from the Medical-Hospital industry.  You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.HCA Healthcare: The company provides services via surgery centers, free-standing emergency rooms, physician clinics and urgent care centers. Its inorganic growth strategies enable it to persistently expand its network across several markets, increase patient volumes and add more hospitals to its portfolio. Its telemedicine business line is expected to continue benefiting operations. HCA Healthcare also focuses on boosting shareholders' value with dividend hikes and buybacks.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HCA Healthcare's 2023 EPS indicates 1.7% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for its revenues in 2023 signals a 3.9% increase from a year ago. HCA beat earnings estimates twice in the past four quarters and missed on two occasions, the average surprise being 2.3%. Shares of the company have jumped 9.7% in the past month.Universal Health Services: The company operates acute care facilities, and outpatient and behavioral health care units. It focuses on behavioral indications like autism, eating disorders, sexual trauma and disorderliness in the military through its patriot support program. This segment holds immense scope for growth in the days ahead, considering the dire need to address behavioral health issues. UHS' plans to add new capacities in hospitals in important markets of Texas and California to address strong acute care demand are expected to be major tailwinds. It has a strong share buyback plan in place to boost shareholder value.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Universal Health's 2023 bottom line indicates 1.7% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for its revenues in 2023 signals a 5.2% increase from a year ago. UHS beat earnings estimates thrice in the past four quarters and missed on one occasion, the average surprise being 0.2%. Shares of the company have risen 11% in the past month.Acadia Healthcare: ACHC provides behavioral healthcare services in the United States and Puerto Rico.

It is also actively pursuing joint ventures with renowned healthcare systems, which is helping it expand its capabilities through bed additions. The company plans to add roughly 300 beds through facility expansions and open a minimum of six CTCs in 2023. Its moves to streamline its portfolio boost operating efficiency and profitability.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ACHC's 2023 bottom line indicates 9.6% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for its revenues in 2023 signals a 9.6% increase from a year ago. ACHC beat on earnings twice in the last four quarters, met the mark once and missed estimates on another occasion, the average surprise being 2.5%. Shares of ACHC have gained 7.2% in the past month.Tenet Healthcare Corp.: The company, with its subsidiaries, provides healthcare services, primarily through general hospitals and related healthcare units. THC has made several acquisitions, and formed strategic partnerships and alliances to augment the scale of business, operating capacity and geographical presence. Tenet Healthcare's performance has been aided by USPI Holding Company's (Ambulatory Care) operations.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for THC's 2023 bottom line is pegged at $5.15 per share, which remained stable over the past month. The consensus mark for its revenues in 2023 signals a 3.7% increase from the prior year. Tenet Healthcare beat earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, the average surprise being 65.2%. Shares of the company have risen 18.2% in the past month.Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double"" From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.It's a little-known chemical company that's up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap.

Per the ASCE finding, due to the delay in essential pipeline repairs and maintenance, 6 billion gallons of treated water is lost every day in the United States.

American Water Works is the largest and most geographically diverse, publicly traded water and wastewater utility company, which continues to widen its market footprint through strategic acquisitions.Utilities Continue to Consolidate &amp; Make InvestmentsPer the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), an estimated $744 billion investment is necessary to maintain and expand the drinking water and wastewater services to meet demand over the next 20 years.American Water Works continues to expand operations through acquisitions and organic means. In 2022, through 26 closed acquisitions in seven states, AWK added 70,000 customers to its base. AWK’s 21 pending acquisitions (as of Dec 31), when completed, will add another 32,400 customers.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Water Works' 2023 earnings suggests year-over-year growth of 5.76%. The current dividend yield of the company is 1.7%.Other water utilities, like SJW Group SJW, Consolidated Water Co. CWCO and Essential Utilities WTRG, are expanding operations through systematic acquisitions.SJW Group completed more than 25 acquisitions in the 2010-2021 time frame and expanded operations. In January 2022, it closed the acquisition of Texas Country Water in Comal, TX. The deal added more than 1,900 water and wastewater customers to its existing customer base.

The current dividend yield of the company is 1.9%.Consolidated Water acquired the remaining 39% of PERC Water Corporation's (""PERC"") equity ownership for $7.8 million. PERC’s strong operating performance, revenue growth and profitability, as well as its synergies with other areas of CWCO’s business and future growth prospects, are going to boost CWCO’s performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CWCO's 2023 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 75.9%.

(NYSE: SNDR), a premier multimodal provider of transportation, intermodal and logistics services. This is the first third-party transportation shipment on an electric vehicle (EV) for PepsiCo globally and establishes FLNA and its beloved snack products as the first to contract transport on Schneider's electric truck fleet of Freightliner eCascadias.Frito-Lay's first third-party shipment on an electric vehicle arrives at its Rancho Cucamonga plant, transported by Schneider's Freightliner eCascadia electric truck.""Today's milestone shipment underscores the importance of cross-industry collaboration in building a more sustainable food system and achieving Frito-Lay and PepsiCo Positive's goal of net-zero emissions by 2040,"" said David Allen, vice president and chief sustainability officer, PepsiCo Foods North America. ""As a company with massive scale, Frito-Lay looks for opportunities to create positive change – but we can't do it alone. By working with Schneider, we are taking an important step forward in our efforts to reduce value chain emissions and move our snack products in a more sustainable way.""An emissions reduction of more than 70 percent1 is expected this year from the initial EV routes, versus the same shipments on diesel trucks, which is equivalent to eliminating more than 180,000 miles driven by gasoline-powered passenger vehicles2 from the road. Initial shipments on Schneider's growing Freightliner eCascadia fleet will be intermodal inbound and outbound dray moves in southern California, including service to Frito-Lay's Rancho Cucamonga distribution center.""As we roll out our fleet of almost 100 new battery electric trucks, we're thrilled to offer a cleaner mode of freight transportation to valued customers like Frito-Lay, who share our goal of operating in ways that are environmentally responsible,"" said Rob Reich, executive vice president and chief administrative officer, Schneider. ""For decades, we have been committed to improving sustainability at Schneider, and we're proud to now be able to positively impact our customers' operations as well. Working together, we are decreasing the carbon footprint of shipments in southern California and making a positive difference.""Story continuesFrito-Lay and PepsiCo's commitment to net-zero emissions by 2040 is guided by PepsiCo Positive (pep+), an end-to-end transformation that puts sustainability at the center of how the company will create growth and value by operating within planetary boundaries. With third-party transportation and distribution forming 20 percent of PepsiCo's emissions footprint, collaboration with partners from whom these emissions originate is critical. Frito-Lay's partnership with Schneider lays important groundwork for an expansion of low- or zero-emissions vehicle use within its third-party transportation footprint.Within its company-owned fleet, Frito-Lay is also making significant advancements. Among them is the recent transformation of one of Frito-Lay's largest manufacturing facilities, located in Modesto, Calif., as the first to implement site-wide alternative fuel vehicles. To serve the company's hometown market of Dallas-Fort Worth, Frito-Lay also introduced 40 100% electric, zero-emissions route trucks in 2022.To learn more about pep+ and progress towards net-zero goals, visit PepsiCo.com/PepsiCoPositive.About Frito-Lay North AmericaFrito-Lay North America is the $23 billion convenient foods division of PepsiCo, Inc.

In that report, analysts expect Union Pacific to post earnings of $2.59 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 0.78%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $6.09 billion, up 3.89% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $11.44 per share and revenue of $24.84 billion. These totals would mark changes of +0.97% and -0.16%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Union Pacific. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell).

Union Pacific is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Story continuesInvestors should also note Union Pacific's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 17.37. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 17.34, so we one might conclude that Union Pacific is trading at a premium comparatively.Also, we should mention that UNP has a PEG ratio of 1.74. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate.

The top line is likely to have been aided by an uptick in freight revenues.For full-year 2023, management expects operating ratio to improve. Also, capital expenditure is projected to be around $3.6 billion (or less than 15% of revenues). These factors might have aided the bottom-line results. Our estimate for UNP’s first-quarter 2023 earnings is at $2.68 per share, indicating a rise of 4.1% year-over-year. On the flip side, escalating operating expenses, primarily due to rising fuel prices might have hurt first-quarter 2023 results.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Union Pacific this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Union Pacific has an Earnings ESP of -2.20% and a Zacks Rank #3.Highlights of Q4Union Pacific’s earnings of $2.67 per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.75. However, despite being affected by high costs, the bottom line inched up 0.38% on a year-over-year basis. Operating revenues of $6,180 million also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,222.8 million. However, the top line climbed 8% on a year-over-year basis, owing to higher fuel surcharge revenues, volume growth and solid core pricing.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks from the broader Zacks Transportation sector that investors may consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this season.Canadian National Railway Company (CNI) has an Earnings ESP of +1.67% and a Zacks Rank #3.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 20. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis railroad is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.59 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +0.8%.Revenues are expected to be $6.09 billion, up 3.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.09% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Union Pacific?For Union Pacific, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.20%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Union Pacific will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Union Pacific would post earnings of $2.75 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.67, delivering a surprise of -2.91%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Union Pacific doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Ameriprise Financial Services (AMP) holds a Zacks Rank #3 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $7.26 a share 11 days away from its upcoming earnings release on April 24, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $7.26 Most Accurate Estimate and the $7.16 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Ameriprise Financial Services has an Earnings ESP of 1.5%.AMP is part of a big group of Finance stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Ventas (VTR) as well.Ventas is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on May 4, 2023. VTR's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.70 a share 21 days from its next earnings release.For Ventas, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.70 is 0.41%.Story continuesAMP and VTR's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

It is worth considering Ameriprise Financial Services (AMP), which belongs to the Zacks Financial - Investment Management industry.This financial services company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 9.89%.For the most recent quarter, Ameriprise was expected to post earnings of $6.35 per share, but it reported $6.94 per share instead, representing a surprise of 9.29%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $5.82 per share, while it actually produced $6.43 per share, a surprise of 10.48%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Ameriprise lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Ameriprise has an Earnings ESP of +1.12% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher.

Insiders would probably have been better off holding on to their shares given that the average selling price of US$49.88 is still lower than the current share price.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Cisco Systems The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Cisco SystemsIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP &amp; COO, Maria Martinez, sold US$998k worth of shares at a price of US$49.88 per share. That means that even when the share price was slightly below the current price of US$50.11, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 12% of Maria Martinez's stake. The only individual insider seller over the last year was Maria Martinez.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Cisco Systems Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Cisco Systems shares. Specifically, Executive VP &amp; COO Maria Martinez ditched US$998k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It appears that Cisco Systems insiders own 0.03% of the company, worth about US$54m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.So What Does This Data Suggest About Cisco Systems Insiders?An insider sold Cisco Systems shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. Insider ownership isn't particularly high, so this analysis makes us cautious about the company. So we'd only buy after careful consideration. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Cisco Systems. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Cisco Systems you should know about.But note: Cisco Systems may not be the best stock to buy.

Sustainability 101 is a blog series that you can turn to for information about different environmental sustainability terms that may come up at work, during discussions with friends, and even at your annual holiday gathering.We hear the term ""climate change"" often these days: what is it, and what do greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have to do with it?According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Climate Dictionary:Climate ""is the average of weather patterns in a specific area over a longer period of time, usually 30 or more years. Human activity in the industrial age, and particularly during the last century, is significantly altering our planet's climate through the release of harmful [GHGs].""GHGs ""are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, causing global warming and climate change. The main [GHGs] released by human activity are carbon dioxide [CO2], methane, and nitrous oxide, as well as fluorinated gases used for cooling and refrigeration. To prevent catastrophic climate change, the world's governments must work together to significantly reduce [GHG] emissions and keep global warming below the dangerous threshold of 1.5°C.""Global warming ""is an increase in the Earth's average surface temperature that occurs when the concentration of [GHGs] in the atmosphere increases. These gases absorb more solar radiation and trap more heat, thus causing the planet to get hotter. Burning fossil fuels, cutting down forests, and farming livestock are some human activities that release [GHGs] and contribute to global warming.""Climate change ""refers to the long-term changes in the Earth's climate, beyond the increase in average surface temperature. Climate change causes weather patterns to be less predictable, affecting the balance of ecosystems that support life and biodiversity. It also causes more extreme weather events, such as more intense hurricanes, floods, heat waves, and droughts, and leads to sea level rise and coastal erosion by accelerating the melting of glaciers.""Story continuesThe history of climate changeAccording to the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), most of the climate changes we have seen throughout history were ""attributed to very small variations in Earth's orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives."" The mid-1800s marked a shift in these historical cooling and warming trends at about the same time as the onset of industrialization.According to the UN, ""The world is now warming faster than at any point in recorded history. Warmer temperatures over time are changing weather patterns and disrupting the usual balance of nature."" According to NASA, Earth's ""average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities.""How GHG emissions can cause global warming and climate changeCO2 is the prevalent GHG, but there are others, such as methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases. These GHGs trap heat in Earth's atmosphere. According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), ""When sunlight strikes the earth's surface, some of it radiates back toward space as infrared radiation (heat)."" The EIA goes on to explain that GHGs absorb infrared radiation and trap its heat in the atmosphere, creating a GHG effect that results in global warming and climate change.The UN is a great resource on this issue, and, according to its Climate Action website, burning fossil fuels, like coal, natural gas, and oil, for generating power, manufacturing goods, and fueling transportation accounts for over 75 percent of global GHG emissions and nearly 90 percent of all CO2 emissions. Some other activities that create emissions include: deforestation or wildfires (because trees absorb carbon from the atmosphere and release it when they are destroyed) and food production (producing food causes emissions of CO2, methane, and other GHGs in various ways).As society continues to release GHGs into the atmosphere, the Earth's temperature can continue to rise. Estimates show that if we don't take deliberate actions to reduce GHGs, global temperature is on track to increase by 2.5 °C to 4.5 °C by 2100 (4.5 °F to 8 °F).According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), climate science says we must limit warming to no more than 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. And, according to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), ""In order to limit warming to 1.5°C and avoid the worst effects of climate breakdown, global emissions must be halved by 2030.""The impact on lifeAccording to the UN's Climate Action website, there are several effects on life due to climate change; and 13 million people lose their lives every year due to environmental factors. Rising temperatures from climate change leads to ice and snow melting faster, oceans rising and warming, and more extreme weather like heat waves, flooding, fires, hurricanes, and tornadoes. Climate change increases the risk of food shortages from less productive fisheries, crops, and livestock. There are also increased health risks through air pollution and disease. Climate change also increases the factors that put and keep people in poverty, with an estimated 23.1 million people displaced on average each year by weather-related events over the past decade (2010-2019).These rapid changes are detrimental to human life, and negatively impact biological diversity - or biodiversity (the variety of life on Earth, in all its forms, from genes and bacteria to entire ecosystems such as forests or coral reefs).According to the UN, ""exacerbated by climate change, the world is losing species at a rate 1,000 times greater than at any other time in recorded human history,"" with one million species at risk of extinction within the next few decades. Moreover, according to the UN, biodiversity ""forms the web of life that we depend on for so many things - food, water, medicine, a stable climate, economic growth, among others"" and ""is interconnected, intertwined, and indivisible with human life on Earth. Our societies and our economies depend on healthy and functioning ecosystems. There is no sustainable development without biodiversity. There can be no stable climate without biodiversity.""Working together to reduce GHG emissionsIndividuals, companies, and governments are looking at how they can reduce GHG emissions.Certain actions are necessary, like reducing use of fossil fuels, and shifting to low-carbon and renewable energy sources, like wind and solar. And, people are making individual steps, like using light-emitting diode (LED) lightbulbs and switching to electric vehicles (EVs).At Cisco, our company's purpose is to Power an Inclusive Future for All.
