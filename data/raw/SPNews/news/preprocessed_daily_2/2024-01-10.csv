The 127-year-old Dow Jones Industrial Average ascended to a record high, while the broad-based S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and innovation-driven Nasdaq Composite tallied gains of 24% and 43%, respectively.', ""However, stock market corrections, bear markets, and even crashes are a normal and inevitable aspect of putting your money to work on Wall Street. For investors with less tolerance for risk, or who don't have the time to devote to researching individual companies, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can make a lot of sense."", ""An ETF holds a basket of securities within a fund, but is traded like a stock on a major exchange. Depending on an investor's risk tolerance, investing timeline, and financial goals, ETFs can be concentrated or diversified; be targeted at growth, value, or income stocks; and be focused on small-, mid-, or large-cap stocks."", ""With over 3,000 publicly traded ETFs in the U.S., and more than 8,700 globally, there's a good chance an ETF is out there that'll align with your financial goals."", 'With this being said, four ETFs stand out as surefire buys in 2024 that can, by 2030, make patient investors notably richer.', 'The first phenomenal ETF that can really pad your pocketbook while growing your nest egg over the next six years is the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEMKT: SCHD). This fund tries to track the total return (including dividends) of the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index.', ""Although growth stocks have received all the glory in recent years, dividend stocks have been collectively unstoppable for decades. Based on a Hartford Funds report in conjunction with Ned Davis Research, dividend stocks have delivered an annualized return of 9.18% between 1973 and 2022. Not only does this outpace the annualized return of the S&P 500 over this stretch, but it more than doubled the 3.95% annualized return of public companies that don't offer a dividend."", 'As of Jan. 5, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF had more than $76 billion in assets invested in 104 companies. These 104 holdings are primarily time-tested businesses that often have lengthy track records of sustaining profitability during downturns and maintaining or building on their existing capital-return programs. This ETF is 21% less volatile than the benchmark S&P 500, but is delivering more than twice the annual yield (about 3.6%).', ""Another reason investors can feel confident about buying the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF is its low net expense ratio, which describes how much you'll pay in various fees to invest in a fund."", ""This ETF has a total expense ratio of just 0.06%, meaning you'll owe only $0.60 in fees for every $1,000 invested. As your initial investment compounds over time, it means you'll get to hang on to more of your money."", 'A second surefire ETF to buy in 2024 that can make you notably richer by the turn of the decade is the Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: VUG). This fund is trying to mirror the performance of the CRSP U.S. Large Cap Growth Index, and it has delivered an annualized return of 10.75% since its inception in January 2004.', 'As its name implies, this is a large-cap, growth-focused fund -- and it certainly shows it based on its metrics. The Vanguard Growth ETF had nearly $192 billion invested across 221 stocks as of the end of November.', 'Although the aggregate of these holdings had a seemingly frothy price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 35.4, these 221 growth stocks also have an average earnings growth rate of 21.1%. When factoring in this superior earnings growth, the valuation becomes far more reasonable.', 'Something else to consider is the recent outperformance of growth stocks. A Bank of America/Merrill Lynch report released in 2016 found that value stocks had outperformed growth stocks on an annualized basis over a 90-year stretch (1926-2015) -- 17% vs. 12.8%.', 'But thanks to historically low interest rates and a flurry of game-changing innovations and next-big-thing trends, growth stocks have turned the tables on value stocks and handily outperformed since the Great Recession. The Vanguard Growth ETF gives investors a way to capitalize on this trend continuing throughout the 2020s.', ""Investors should also be pleased with the ETF's ultra-low net expense ratio of 0.04%. Since the turnover rate in this fund is rather low (just 5.4% in 2022), investors won't be paying much in the way of fees. Furthermore, the roughly 0.5% yield more than offsets the minimal net expense ratio."", ""The final two surefire ETFs you can buy in 2024 that can make you notably richer by 2030 are the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEMKT: SPY). The reason I've chosen to lump these two ETFs together is because they're both trying to mirror the total returns of the benchmark S&P 500 Index."", ""As I pointed out earlier, stock market corrections are unavoidable for Wall Street's major indexes. Since the start of 1950, data from Yardeni Research shows that the S&P 500 has undergone 39 double-digit-percentage declines. But with the exception of the 2022 bear market, it's put the previous 38 double-digit drops in the rearview mirror. Over extended periods, the high-quality components that make up the S&P 500 push the index higher."", 'A study published last year by Bank of America Global Research adds more fuel to the argument\xa0that buying and holding S&P 500 index funds like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust can be a winning strategy.', 'Researchers examined the probability of an investor generating negative returns in relation to the total returns of the S&P 500 since the beginning of 1929. Whereas a one-day holding period offered a 46% probability of negative returns, a five-year holding period reduced this probability to just 10%. Meanwhile, a rolling 20-year holding period in the S&P 500 has never produced a negative return.', ""The final reason these two index funds make for a smart buy is their minuscule net expense ratios. Although the 0.09% net expense ratio for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust is quite low, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF's 0.03% ratio is even lower. The latter makes even more sense for investors who are putting big bucks to work in an attempt to mirror the performance of the S&P 500."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF wasn't one of them.

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Nucor's  ROE in this article."", 'Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.', ' See our latest analysis for Nucor ', 'Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Nucor is:', '25% = US$5.4b ÷ US$22b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.25 in profit."", 'Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.', ""To begin with, Nucor has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 11% the company's ROE is quite impressive. So, the substantial 36% net income growth seen by Nucor over the past five years isn't overly surprising."", ""As a next step, we compared Nucor's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 27%."", ""The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is Nucor fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide."", 'Nucor has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 9.3%, meaning that it has the remaining 91% left over to reinvest into its business. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.', ""Moreover, Nucor is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 17% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 11% over the same period."", ""On the whole, we feel that Nucor's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, according to the latest industry analyst forecasts, the company's earnings are expected to shrink in the future.

We are webcasting today's conference call live. Thank you for your interest in Acuity Brands. I will now turn the call over to Neil Ashe."", 'Neil M. Ashe', ""Thank you, Charlotte, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. We continue to demonstrate strong execution in our fiscal 2024 first quarter. We increased our adjusted operating profit, our adjusted operating profit margin and our adjusted diluted earnings per share. We generated significant free cash flow, and we allocated capital effectively to drive value. Both our Lighting and our Intelligent Spaces businesses continued to perform well during the quarter. Particularly in ABL, our performance was excellent. We increased adjusted operating profit by $15 million on $71 million less sales and increased the adjusted operating profit margin 280 basis points to 17.5%. Our strategy is yielding results. We're increasing product vitality, elevating service levels, using technology to improve and differentiate both our products and how we operate the business, and we are driving productivity. Today, our products are perceived as being more valuable in the marketplace. At the same time, we are lowering costs. Our product vitality efforts are the combination of new product introductions and improvements to our existing portfolio to ensure that our products are more valuable to our customers and more profitable for us. Our Contractor Select portfolio is about 300 of our most popular products. They are used in common everyday lighting applications and are in stock at retailers and electrical distributors. We continue to invest in product vitality, and we have expanded our Lithonia Lighting ESXF Floodlight family. This is a better product for distributors because it allows them to carry less inventory and is better for contractors because it is easier to install. This product family was first introduced in 2022 to offer a uniform lighting solution for parking lots, walkways and outer buildings. It uses switchable technology to provide installers 36 on-site options, including lumen output, color temperature, photocell and mounting options. Our design select portfolio consists of configurable product options that meet the key choices of lighting specifiers with high levels of service. This quarter, we added additional products in our downlighting, panel, emergency lighting and outdoor categories. As we expand the options available in this portfolio, our focus is on product vitality and making it easier for the specification community to chose superior solutions. Our efforts to elevate service are having a positive impact on our customers. In October, we were once again recognized by the voters of IMARK Electrical as one of the suppliers of the year for 2023. We also continue to invest in productivity improvements in our operations. Earlier this quarter, we traveled with a group of associates to our Mexican manufacturing facilities to open our new state-of-the-art Santa Rosa production facility, which includes our highly efficient new paint line. This facility embraces technology to deliver a better product to our customers and improves the efficiency of the paint line process while also reducing the environmental impact. I'd like to highlight a couple of ways we're doing this. Our paint guns and torque guns in our new facility are powered by a high-efficiency air compressor that aims to reduce approximately half of our CO2 generation compared to the air compressor from our previous paint line. High-efficiency walls, burners and booster technology in our ovens require less gas than similar systems and use around 40% less natural gas than our previous infrared ovens. The transition to this facility has been seamless. We relocated an existing facility to the new SPF facility without any service interruption and now have capacity available for future growth. Our combined paint and natural gas savings are delivering on our required financial return for the facility while also meeting our sustainability objectives. You can learn more about this project and other accomplishments in our recently released EarthLIGHT report, available on our ESG for Investors page on our Investor Relations website.Now moving to our Spaces Group. Our mission in our Intelligent Spaces business is to make spaces smarter, safer and greener through our strategy of connecting the edge to the cloud. Distech has the best edge control devices on the market, while Atrius will be the best in cloud applications. At Distech, we are focused on expanding our addressable market in 2 ways. The first is geographic and the second is increasing what we control in a build space. This quarter, we continued our geographic expansion, adding several new system integrators in the U.K., Asia and Australia. In one of our original markets, France, our hard work is paying off. The Building Services Research and Information Association called out Distech as dominating the French building automation and control systems market in a newly released report. We also continue to increase what we can control in a build space. In October, we launched our Distech Resense Move sensor at several industry conferences in Europe. This is an advanced 7-in-1 ceiling-mounted sensor that is able to detect occupancy in spaces. It counts the number of people using a space, providing feedback on occupancy requirements to the building users. It is AI-powered and can be used to optimize indoor air quality, reduce energy and cleaning costs and enhance occupancy comfort. It will be revealed to our North American and international customers at the AHR Expo in Chicago later this month. Our expansion into refrigeration controls is also going well with the integration of KE2 Therm on track and performing as we expected. During the quarter, we released the KE2 Therm Edge manager with a BACnet communication stack. This is the same open protocol technology that is used by Distech and is an important step to ensure compatibility between both the Distech edge controllers and the KE2 Therm edge controllers. Now turning to our outlook. The changes that we have made to the business are impactful and long lasting. Our order rates are growing both year-over-year and sequentially. We're back to typical lead times and absent the excess backlog from last year, we would be experiencing sales growth. We are focused on controlling what we can control and we are confident our execution will continue. In our Lighting and Lighting Controls business, we will continue to focus on delivering margin and cash flow. In our Spaces group, we will continue to grow geographically and by adding to what we can control in a build space. We're delivering applications that are making a difference. Now I'll turn the call over to Karen, who will update you on our first quarter performance."", 'Karen J. Holcom', ""Thank you, Neil, and good morning to everyone on the call. We started the year with strong performance. We increased our adjusted operating profit by $14 million year-over-year, improved our adjusted operating profit margin by 250 basis points over the prior year and by 40 basis points sequentially. We increased our adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.43 year-over-year and generated cash flow from operations of $190 million. We continue to improve our businesses and allocated capital effectively. For total AYI, we generated net sales in the first quarter of $935 million, which was $63 million or 6% lower than the prior year as a result of the lower net sales in our ABL business. This was partially offset by continued growth in the ISG business of 13% in the quarter. We continue to deliver year-over-year margin improvement. During the quarter, our adjusted operating profit increased by $14 million on lower sales, while we expanded adjusted operating profit margin to 16.5%, an increase of approximately 250 basis points from the prior year. This increase was driven largely by the significant year-over-year improvement in our gross profit margin as we continued to execute and drive margin through product vitality, the management of price and cost and productivity improvements. During the quarter, our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.72, increased $0.43 or 13% over the prior year, primarily as a result of higher net income and to a lesser extent, lower shares outstanding due to the share repurchases. In ABL, net sales were $876 million in the quarter, a decrease of around 7% compared with the prior year, driven by declines across most of our channels, offset slightly by continued strong performance in our retail channel. Sales growth in ABL this quarter had a challenging year-over-year comparison as the results in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 benefited from working down an elevated level of backlog. ABL's adjusted operating profit increased 11% to $154 million on lower net sales and we delivered adjusted operating profit margin of 17.5%, a 280 basis point improvement over the prior year. ISG's net sales for the first quarter were $64 million, an increase of 13% as Distech continued to grow and KE2 Therm performed as we expected. ISG's adjusted operating profit was $10 million. Now turning to our cash flow performance. We generated $190 million of cash flow from operating activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, an increase of $3 million over the prior year, primarily due to an improvement in net income partially offset by a decrease in cash flow from working capital. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we continue to allocate capital consistent with our priorities. We invested $15 million in capital expenditures and allocated approximately $50 million to repurchase around 300,000 shares. Since the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we have repurchased over 9 million shares at an average price of about $143 per share, which was funded by organic cash flow. To wrap up, we had a strong quarter, particularly in ABL. We continued to deliver strong margin and cash flow performance. We grew adjusted operating profit and improved adjusted operating profit margin. We increased adjusted diluted earnings per share, generated strong cash flow from operations and allocated capital effectively. We are pleased with our performance, and we will reevaluate the outlook at the midpoint of the year. Thank you for joining us today. I will now pass you over to the operator to take your questions."", 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo."", ""Joseph John O'Dea"", 'So -- I mean, really impressive gross margin obviously this quarter. I think just any additional detail unpacking that you talked kind of high level on vitality, productivity and price cost. But anything in terms of kind of quantifying that bridge when we think about sequentially gross profit down kind of less than what we saw out of the revenue decline and trying to appreciate sort of what some of the moving pieces are there and then bigger picture just the sustainability of a 45.8% gross margin?', 'Neil M. Ashe', ""Yes. Thank you, Joe. Good morning to all of you. So -- as we unpack the margin performance, a couple of things to talk about. First of all, obviously, our year is off to a really good start. We're taking the companies to levels of performance that it has never seen before and these margins are the results of the impacts of the strategy and the work that our team has been doing to implement that around product vitality, around service, around technology and around productivity. That is culminated in this performance, specifically in this quarter, we're recognizing that our products, as I said in the prepared remarks, are being valued for their impact in the marketplace, which affords us the opportunity to manage price strategically. We continue to take cost out of the production of the products. So the output is the margin that you see. This quarter was mildly impacted by some mix. The -- our Controls business was strong. Our ISG is obviously growth accretive, margin accretive and return accretive, so that has some impact. But when you boil it all down, this quarter is a result, and the margin performance in this quarter, is a result of the strategy and the work that we've been doing around product vitality, around service, around technology and around productivity."", ""Joseph John O'Dea"", ""And just a quick clarification because you did make the point in prepared remarks and just kind of reiterated there, where products perceived is more valuable in the marketplace today. I thought about sort of the pricing dynamic over the last couple of years as being priced in response to cost. But is it fair to sort of deduce that this quarter, you're actually in the market sort of taking price up because it's the value that you're delivering, and so you're still able to achieve price up?"", 'Neil M. Ashe', ""So we -- I believe that's a fair conclusion. Yes, we are realizing the benefits in the first quarter price. We talked about in the last call and in the second quarter, we also implemented a price increase. So we're demonstrating to the market that we will continue to manage price. So -- and that's obviously in the second quarter, so has no impact on these numbers. But -- but as I've said consistently, we're moving to strategically manage price. And by that, we mean that, number one, our products need to be valued in the marketplace because they need to -- to deserve to be valued. We're in a good position on that front. The second around our product vitality efforts is that we need to demonstrate that we can make more money with profit as a result of those prices, which is what we're doing from a cost perspective. So -- so I believe this is a good foundation.Now obviously, these are extraordinary margins. So we don't need to continue to perform at this level for the rest of the year, but to deliver outstanding results, but we feel very good about the how in these margins."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird.', 'Timothy Ronald Wojs', ""Maybe just my first question. Neil, you had kind of talked about in the prepared remarks that order rates kind of improved sequentially and that they're up year-over-year. I know it's probably hard, but I'll ask the question anyway. I mean, how much of that do you think is just the year-over-year comparisons kind of lapping some of the backlog depletion and a lead time improvement versus maybe what's going on in the underlying end market?"", 'Neil M. Ashe', ""Yes. Thanks for the question, Tim. Let me unpack that because I think this is really important. So -- so our net sales is obviously a result of our shipments in the period. The shipments in the period are a result of the orders that led up to at times the lead time basically. So we are now in a position where our lead times have more normalized. In other words, the order and the shipment rates are relatively consistent with each other. And so it's important that on both the sequential basis and on a year-over-year basis, our order rates are modestly up, in other words, without last year's comparable sales would be growing. Last year was -- the net sales were the beneficiary of backlog reduction from orders which had been placed earlier. So -- the order -- when we talk about this order rate being up modestly, that versus the daily order rate of last year's first quarter and last year's fourth quarter. So -- the best way that we've come to think about this is that there was more of a pull forward last year industry-wide than there was a cycle. So -- so in effect, we processed a lot more business last year than that existed. When you smooth the line over time and we've talked about this consistently, when you smooth the line over time, we will be -- the Lighting and Lighting Control business will be a consistent grower."", 'Timothy Ronald Wojs', ""And I guess, have you seen any sort of kind of underlying improvement in the end market? I mean obviously, rates have kind of moved back with what the Fed has done. I'm just kind of curious if you see that in your order rates at all?"", 'Neil M. Ashe', ""Yes. So obviously, we're seeing -- if it's year-over-year improvement and sequential improvement, there is improvement in our order rate. As we look forward to our -- kind of our view on the macro, as I've been consistent with this, we don't have a better crystal ball than you do. Our -- we are confident in the current levels of the order rate and the performance of the order rate. As I said last quarter, we're comfortable operating in this environment. And as we look forward, we feel pretty good about where things are. Our outlook doesn't expect things to get materially better or materially worse basically. So as Karen said, we'll reevaluate at the middle of the year where we are for the rest of the year."", 'Timothy Ronald Wojs', ""And then maybe just the second question, just on maybe margins. Just given where the gross margins have kind of landed over the last couple of quarters, I mean, has that changed how you think about kind of the reinvestment that you'd want to make or need to make in the business to drive above-market growth? Or do you think it's just kind of a higher base level of margin for the business kind of going forward?"", 'Neil M. Ashe', ""It's a little bit of both, and I would say on that front, Tim, we don't believe that these margins are a result of harvesting. So we believe that they're the outcome of the strategy, as I've said kind of -- and I won't continue to be redundant on it. But I believe there are an outcome. So we believe this is a point in time. At the same time, we also are beginning to focus on verticals and areas where we haven't on the Lighting side, either been strong or participated at all. A very small example, we made a tiny investment in Horticulture. Why? Because we think over the next kind of period of time that will be an opportunity and so we're positioning for that now. So we'll start to make those kind of investments, Tim, so that we can continue to hopefully expand the addressable market on the Lighting side. And then I don't want to miss the opportunity to talk about Spaces. And Karen can address the specifics of the quarter -- the financials in the quarter, if necessary later. But in the big picture, the Spaces Group is growth accretive, margin accretive and returns accretive. And we feel really good about what we're doing there and their impact -- their ability to continue to impact the company going forward."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS.', 'Christopher M. Snyder', ""I wanted to follow up on the gross margin up a 410 basis points year-on-year despite the sales decline, which is really impressive. It seems to us that the driver there is one price cost. You guys have helped prices costs have moderated due to the technology, the vitality and all the stuff you mentioned, Neil, but also some level of selectivity, which you've talked to over the past couple of quarters. When we think about that 410 basis points, could you kind of break down the build between selectivity and price cost improvement over the last year?"", 'Neil M. Ashe', ""Yes, I'll start. Karen, you fill in for us. We have not built a walk directly from -- to break down the 410. So I'm going to do this more off the top of my head, Chris, than I am kind of reading on a walk. Big picture. Let's start with -- let's start with price. So -- as we've said consistently, we managed price to where we think we need to be in the marketplace. So -- Obviously, we have real strength in Contractor Select. You can see the retail channel was up this quarter. It's the growth spot despite the fact that net sales were down. So -- so obviously, we're meeting the market at that level of the market. On the project side, we have the ability to choose which projects we take, obviously. So in our pricing and then our bidding on those projects, we are choosing which projects we want to invest it in. And so -- and we do invest in some projects. So this is not -- we're not pure price takers here. We are choosing and based on the marketplace. And that's really the key for us is that when we talk about managing price strategically, we're meeting price where it needs to be. Second, on the cost front. So obviously, there's been material improvements in the portfolio over the course of the last 3 years, and that continues. That has allowed us to create a more normalized distribution of margin within the portfolio. So we don't have the laggards that we had in the past. And so it's not wholly dependent on mix in a way that it has been in the past. Now I would say that this quarter, we had a good quarter in Controls and obviously ISG performed at a higher growth level than ABL. So there is some mix impact, but it is modest. It is not determinative. And then finally, to your point on cost moderating, there are kind of -- there are some obvious post-pandemic costs, which have changed, steel containers, et cetera. And it's worth kind of calling out containers as an example because now we're dealing with obviously the Red Sea challenges. So container costs that were about $3,000 per container can now rise as much as $6,000 per container. With that in context, at the peak, those were in the $20,000 per container kind of rate. So that gives you an idea of kind of where those differences are. And so we have a plan to deal with those higher container costs for the remainder of the year. So when I summarize those 3 things together. One is, as I said in the remarks, our products are being recognized for their value in the marketplace. That's fundamental. That's key. That's number one. Two is, the strategy has produced a more consistent result across our portfolio. So mix is less impactful than it may have been in the past. And then the third is, we've moved aggressively to get to a more consistent cost basis on materials."", 'Christopher M. Snyder', ""I appreciate that. And if I could just may follow up more thematically. It sounds like a lot of it say, we want to get price for the value we're bringing to the market. But the company has always been -- it's prickly. I know, Neil, you have only been there for a few years, but over your time, I think the company has always been a leader on technology and a leader on product quality. So what's kind of flipped there to get the gross margin from 41%, 42% now to 45% plus? Because it feels like a lot of the -- you've always kind of leading on the product technology side."", 'Neil M. Ashe', ""Yes. Thanks, Chris. These things take time. I wish I was not as old as I am, but I've been around the barn more than once. And you just realize that like kind of all of these changes are cumulative and it takes time for them to all kind of line up. And obviously, and this is a conversation that we have with our team here, which is that we're taking the company to levels of performance that it's never seen before. That's true in the market -- broader market where the competence of our product quality cascades through our sales team, through our independent sales agents, et cetera, through distributors, through the service levels and the programs that we've put in place. So those things cumulatively add up to the performance that you're seeing today."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair.', 'Ryan James Merkel', ""So my first question, Neil, can you talk about large projects back market? How is activity? Are you seeing delays, cancellations? Or is that sort of improving? Just what's the latest update?"", 'Neil M. Ashe', ""Yes, Ryan, thanks. I mean we called out the order rate to kind of demonstrate that we're finding a new kind of normal. I think anecdotally, there's a lot of talk around big projects in kind of calendar '25, that sort of period, whether it's infrastructure or other things. I think that's just kind of the general kind of on the street sentiment about kind of what's going on out there. So other than that, we're in a relatively -- I think we're in a kind of a new normal from a consistency perspective."", 'Ryan James Merkel', ""Okay. So you're not seeing large projects be particularly weak?"", 'Neil M. Ashe', ""I mean, anecdotally, there's some discussion about kind of that. I don't know what weak means. And I think that's a -- it's worth us all kind of taking a step back and saying, okay, if we had an industry-wide pull forward over kind of, call it, '22 and '23, which is what we're talking about on our comparables, that has manifested in net sales higher than order rates for some period as we were very clear about that in '23. Now with order rates and shipments more equilibrated and a normal relationship in a period, this is kind of the normal run rate of the market. And so yes, there are some good days and some bad days within that, obviously. So -- but it's not -- we don't -- we're not viewing a cliff on the horizon anywhere."", 'Ryan James Merkel', ""Okay. And then I had a question on gross margin as well. Obviously, first quarter was really strong. Normal seasonality would put you at about 45% for the year. I'm just curious, is there any reason that we should be below that is the biggest risk just sales and fixed cost deleverage at this point?"", 'Neil M. Ashe', 'Karen, do you want to take that?', 'Karen J. Holcom', ""Yes, Ryan. So in terms of seasonality, just when we look at where we are today, I think we are probably -- that Neil said, order rates and shipment rates are coming in alignment. So it's looking like we're getting back to seasonality, but we haven't fully seen that. On the margin side, when you look at where we are comparative to the first quarter last year, we ended up last year at 45.1%. So we increased our gross profit margin throughout the year. And as Neil described, that was a combination of our strategy and also executing on some costs that were higher in the first half of the year that moderated in the second half. So really, if you look at where we are now, we think this is a pretty strong level of gross profit impacted by the mix for Controls impacted by the mix of the higher ISG. So I would say that around this level is probably pretty high, but we expect to be pretty confident in our gross profit margin."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer & Company.', 'Christopher D. Glynn', 'Congrats on a strong start to the year. I was curious on Design Select, still kind of early days, but anything kind of pithy or interesting, you could share about the market reception on that rollout?', 'Neil M. Ashe', ""The market reception has been really strong. So we continue to tweak how it's presented in the market so that people can understand it. The industry has historically focused on something that's called Quick Ship. And so sometimes this is confused for Quick Ship, it is not Quickship -- this is an overhaul of a group of products that the specification community can know that they can choose and the options they can choose with those products. And so that's starting to manifest as we talked about, nothing -- I'm thinking -- I'm trying to think of a pithy answer for you. I don't have a good pithy answer for you, but we're really -- or a good anecdote for you, but it is progressing really well, and we're pleased with where it is."", 'Christopher D. Glynn', ""Okay. Well, that was pithy enough for me. And then on the seasonality, it sounds like I think Karen said, not declaring victory really, if I could paraphrase, but sort of leaning into normal seasonality. I think is the message I got there as we look at the forward quarters. I'm curious, the market is one part of that. And then it sounds like maybe your share momentum relative to the market in any given period might be adding muscle. So I'm curious about the interplay of that versus market when we say that we're kind of leaning towards normal seasonality here."", 'Neil M. Ashe', 'Yes. So let me kind of take your comment. Thank you for paraphrasing Karen. That was a long answer to get to. We\'re not declaring victory yet, but that\'s exactly what the message was meant to be. The -- so building up, first of all, on what we can control. We feel very, very good about what we control. So that is -- that\'s the kind of the foundation. I think a lot of questions we\'ve gotten from this crowd over the course of the last few quarters is, ""Hey, are you sacrificing -- are you sacrificing share for margin?"" And we don\'t believe that we are. We\'ve said that consistently as we\'ve gone through. So -- so that culminates in the order rates that we are describing. So up sequentially and up year-over-year. However, modestly, they\'re up sequentially and year-over-year. So that is, as I said earlier, we believe these things are cumulative. In other words, the market really starting to realize those things. As I said, when we open, we don\'t need to operate at these levels of margin for the rest of the year to deliver outstanding results. So -- so we don\'t have outrageous aspirations for the remainder of the year. But we\'re very confident in the quality, the how of how we\'re delivering these results.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research.', 'Jeffrey Todd Sprague', ""Maybe just kind of picking up on that, I know you don't want to kind of speak to the framework or the guidance every quarter. But coming off this quarter and thinking about what you said about you don't need to do anything heroic now for the remainder of the year. What would -- in your mind, what would drive you to the bottom half or bottom even 2/3 of that larger framework that you put out?"", 'Neil M. Ashe', ""Yes. So let me unpack that a little bit and make sure kind of we're all on the same page. It is not our desire to provide quarterly guidance or update guidance on a quarterly basis. Karen was clear in her prepared remarks that we are going to take a look at the outlook and framework at the middle of the year, which is inconsistent with how we would normally do things. So obviously, we can do the math also. If we take consensus plus our (inaudible) this quarter on an EPS basis, you get way up in the -- in our EPS range. So -- so as she said, we'll take a look going forward in the middle point of the year."", 'Jeffrey Todd Sprague', 'And then just on SG&A. So that did move up a couple of hundred bps on a full year basis last year and up again this quarter, probably some deleverage on the sales decline obviously. But -- where are we at in terms of kind of getting to a normalization there or the ability to deliver some operating leverage on the SG&A line?', 'Karen J. Holcom', ""Sure, Jeff. As you recall in the fourth quarter, we did take some costs out of the ABL business. So we feel pretty good about the cost reductions as we evaluate how we do the work. And we think we're really at the right level of investment from where we need to be to leverage when the sales growth comes back. That being said, in the ISG business, we did have some isolated cost this year that don't really affect the run rate of that business. So overall, I just feel good about the current level of investment going forward that we can leverage."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Osborne with TD Cowen.', 'Jeffrey David Osborne', ""Karen, I just had a question on what was the surprise relative to the guidance that you had given or the commentary 3 months ago around margins declining sequentially. Was it the strength in controls or the strength in the retail channel? Just trying to get a sense of the surprise because Neil had indicated that the 4 areas of vitality service, technology and productivity are essentially a culmination of years of investment. So what was the differential relative to 3 months ago's outlook?"", 'Karen J. Holcom', ""Yes. So what I would say is that I would not use the word surprise. We really weren't surprised by the level of gross margin that you're seeing this quarter. As Neil said, we're taking the company to levels of performance that it hasn't seen before. What -- kind of the gross margin of the 45.8%, the -- not typical level of performance that you would see. It's just a higher mix of control that had some impact this quarter. But overall, it's really the execution of the business, the continued growth of ISG and really the strategy as we execute over product vitality, service, technology and productivity improvements that are driving this level of gross profit margin."", 'Neil M. Ashe', 'Yes, Jeff, just a quick build on that. What Karen had said last quarter is that normally, on a sequential basis, the gross margin would go down from Q4 to Q1.', 'Jeffrey David Osborne', ""Got it. And then what was abnormal then this time? I guess I'm still confused on that."", 'Neil M. Ashe', 'Performance. We continue to perform.', 'Jeffrey David Osborne', ""Perfect. And then, Neil, your predecessor, Vern, would -- I think the past 2 election cycles that highlighted weakness in the end markets and sort of the skittish buyer, if I recall, the terminology correct. I'm just curious, it sounds like your outlook on the macro is a bit more calm and pipeline looks good, et cetera. Do you anticipate the November election having any impact on either larger projects or smaller projects?"", 'Neil M. Ashe', ""I mean I don't know what Vern's logic was there. I can tell you that one thing I do know about Vern's feelings this morning is that he's a proud Michigan Wolverine. So I am sure that he was celebrating late into the night last night. As we look forward on the macro, the -- it is as we have described earlier in the call, we believe that we found a kind of new normal and we're not expecting -- we're not expecting anything extraordinarily positive or extraordinarily negative between now and the end of the calendar year."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.', 'Unidentified Analyst', ""This is Grace on for Brian. I guess there's a lot of questions on margins. So I have -- I just have one question on the demand trend on the order rate. I think a year ago, you were the first one to call out the interest rate impact and slower order rate. Now you talked about order rates up year-over-year and sequentially. So can you talk about what are the drivers of that? Are you taking market share? Is it because of lower interest rates? And also given how interest rates have been trending in the past few months, maybe this is too early to tell, but do you see any order rate acceleration based on your conversation with customers today?"", 'Neil M. Ashe', ""Yes, Grace. I mean, I want to kind of make the same kind of point. So this will be mildly redundant. But the order rate is obviously year-over-year. The issue on a last year basis -- not the issue. The results last year on the net sales basis were the results of order rates that had happened prior to that. We pointed out that through -- kind of through the course of the year that there was an impact on those order rates, you're seeing the impact on those order rates. Now those order rates have normalized, and we have found kind of a consistent level of operating performance. So as we annualize those -- the comps and eliminate the excess backlog impact that happened at the beginning of FY '23, then you'll start to see a kind of more normal performance, specifically from the Lighting business. Obviously, ISG has continued to grow. So over the long arc of time, this will continue the Lighting business, basically had a pull forward, an industry-wide pull forward, and will look like on a compounded annual growth rate exactly where we expect it to be, which is in the kind of mid single digits of growth rate."", 'Operator', ""And I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Neil Ashe for closing remarks."", 'Neil M. Ashe', 'Thank you all for joining us this morning. Obviously, our year is off to a really good start, and we are both pleased about that and encouraged about what that means for the future.We are focused on the strategy, and it is yielding results both in ABL and in the Spaces Group, and we look forward to catching up with you again this time next quarter.

Or did they? Adam Johnson, BullseyeBrief.com Portfolio Manager, joins for another edition of Good Buy or Goodbye.', 'Johnson points towards Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) as a Good Buy. He states that the company has a great focused portfolio, building very purpose-driven properties, developing only for life science companies like Big Pharma. Second, he describes the tenants as ""sticky,"" meaning they tend to stay in those properties for a long time. In addition, because of growth in the life sciences sector and long-lasting tenants, that equates to a stable cash flow.', 'Johnson points out SL Green Realty Corp (SLG) as a Goodbye.

In addition, the company has an inconsistent portfolio of properties, of which he considers many to be ""duds.""

He is going to help us sift through this real estate sector today. So let's focus on real estate investment trusts. And let's kick it right off and look at your good buy, the stock you like here. It's Alexandria Real Estate here."", ""ADAM JOHNSON: I actually think it's a great buy, Julie, as opposed to the other."", 'JULIE HYMAN: A great buy.', 'ADAM JOHNSON: --as opposed to the other.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Are we going have to change the name of the segment?', 'ADAM JOHNSON: Great buy or get out of here. This is my great buy or good buy, as you like to say. A couple of bullet points just to give you acquainted with it-- focused. This company builds very specific purpose built real estate. They sell only, they develop only for the life sciences sector, so biotechnology companies, big biopharma companies.', ""It's very specialized. These companies need laboratories that's got to have the specialized HVAC, right, to get poisonous toxins out, all kinds of filtering. They like to have production spaces, so they can have all their meetings on stage. They do atriums. And this is key, Jules, they only build next to universities. So that there's already infrastructure there and a desire for it so--"", 'JULIE HYMAN: Interesting.', 'ADAM JOHNSON: Focused, purpose built.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Let's talk about the second part. And the tenants, you say, tend to stay there. There's not a lot-- we look at other parts of real estate, people move in, people move out. In this one, not necessarily the case?"", ""ADAM JOHNSON: No, because they are purpose built. In other words, Alexandria won't actually develop a property until it's already pre-leased by about 80%, right? So it's effectively already paid for. That's how they're able to get the loans and lock in the margin. So the tenants, once they ask Alexandria to build these properties for them, they stick around. It's very sticky."", 'JULIE HYMAN: OK. And then finally, you say that there is stable cash flow at this--', 'ADAM JOHNSON: Because of that stickiness. Yeah. And as a matter of fact, their occupancy right now, you probably find this surprising-- I certainly did until I ran the numbers-- 96%.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Wow.', ""ADAM JOHNSON: So for all the gloom and doom about real estate, 96% occupancy. And they're renewing leases at 6% increases. So I like ARE very much. I'm long and as are my clients."", ""JULIE HYMAN: OK. That's a good disclosure to have. We like to ask people what the risk to the potential bull case is. And here you say, could we see health care markets get crimped by regulation, for example?"", 'ADAM JOHNSON: Potentially. Yeah, I mean, if you just-- and again, we have to think big picture here. But if, in fact, the Washington steamroller were to really go after drug pricing-- I know they always say that during election years as they are right now. But if that actually were to gather momentum, then, in theory, that would crimp profits at some of these companies. And so they might not be able to spend the money on this premium real estate.', 'JULIE HYMAN: The other thing I would ask just briefly before we move on to the one that you would avoid is, what kind of growth is this company seeing? In other words, because--', 'ADAM JOHNSON: 6%, 7%, 8% annually.', ""JULIE HYMAN: OK. So we're not talking about huge leaps and bounds, of course, but a steady grower."", ""ADAM JOHNSON: A steady grower. And what attracted to me, you know, I run the Bullseye American Ingenuity Fund. There's a lot of technology. You don't usually think of real estate as ingenious, right? But the way they target the real estate, I think, is ingenious."", ""And I would also add that the stock was trading, oh, about six weeks ago, at a 10-year valuation low. You don't often see a high-quality company trade that low."", ""JULIE HYMAN: OK. So let's talk about the company that you want to avoid. And it is in the dreaded office space--"", ""ADAM JOHNSON: Wouldn't touch it, not with a 10-foot pole."", ""JULIE HYMAN: SL Green here, that's your goodbye. So let's run through it here. Concentrated in NYC, if I'm not mistaken, this is one of the, if not the largest REITs in New York City."", ""ADAM JOHNSON: Oh, it's the largest one, hands down. They own 59 properties here in New York City. That's part of the problem, Julie. I mean, this is the tip of the spear. If you talk about the problems with commercial real estate and office space and the fact that at least here in New York only about 53% of workers are back in the building, right?"", 'JULIE HYMAN: We know that anecdotally certainly.', ""ADAM JOHNSON: Yeah, yeah. So concentrated in New York, that's a big problem."", ""JULIE HYMAN: OK. Let's talk about problem number two for you, inconsistent property mix. What does that mean?"", ""ADAM JOHNSON: So on the one hand, SL Green has got some beautiful properties here. In fact, if you know One Vanderbilt right next to Grand Central, arguably, probably, the prettiest most impressive new building in New York City. The problem is that's only one, and they're long 59 buildings. And they've got some real duds, like the old Bear Stearns, 245 Park Avenue. A bunch of buildings, big blocky, clumsy concrete buildings on Third Avenue, what do you do with them? That's the problem. So it's an inconsistent property mix."", 'JULIE HYMAN: OK. And then thing number three here, 10 and 50 are an alt strategy.', ""ADAM JOHNSON: Yeah. Watch out. You remember back in 2008, Citibank had good bank, bad bank. They put all the bad assets in the bad bank. Well, they put 10 of their 50 buildings, 59 buildings in the alternate strategy portfolio. In other words, we don't know what to do with them. We can't sell them. We can't lease them. They're just sitting there. Do we repurpose them? Do we knock them down, develop, redevelop? So that's a concern that alt strategy group."", 'JULIE HYMAN: OK. So the risk to this downside case is everybody comes back.', ""ADAM JOHNSON: Yeah, everything's great. You know, right come back in, the water is fine. I mean, you look at the Wall Street bank CEOs, and they've all said you got to get back in, David Solomon at Goldman on and on. Jamie Dimon at JP Morgan, get back in the office. And actually, I'm a believer in that. Mentoring happens in the office. It doesn't happen when kids are at home, not working with peers or with seniors to show them the way it's done."", ""So if everybody comes back to work, OK, I guess I'll agree to be just fine. But it doesn't seem to be going that way."", ""JULIE HYMAN: It doesn't feel that way. And then we've got sort of a bonus chart, looking at these two companies and really comparing them here. When we talk about REITs occupancy is really important here, right, what percentage is the occupancy? And there's definitely a clear divide between these two guys."", ""ADAM JOHNSON: Oh, a clear divide. And by the way, hats off to your producers for making this chart, because this says it all, right? Occupancy at Alexandria Real Estate, 96%, versus SL Green, 89%. You know, you were saying earlier, you're surprised it's as high as 89. It sounds like it ought to be 78. But it's 89, fine."", ""Amount of debt, less than 20% of ARE's debt comes due in the next four years, whereas more than 60% of SL Green's debt comes due, so they've got this debt problem. They're going to have to refinance. And obviously, rates are higher. And, by the way, half of the debt at SL Green is floating rate."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Oh, dear.', ""ADAM JOHNSON: So they get squeezed on both fronts. And then you just look at sentiment, the way the Street is looking at these stocks. 12 buys on ARE, no holds, only one sell. And that's a recent one versus 4, 7, and 7. So the Street doesn't like-- I don't like SL Green, the Street doesn't like SL Green. And you got to respect that kind of sentiment."", ""I tend to be a contrarian, but not when it comes to SL Green. This is one where I agree with the Street, I agree with the market's view. And I don't want to touch it. But ARE, another story."", ""JULIE HYMAN: OK. Adam, I'm going to recap, if I can, what we have talked about today. So you're saying by Alexandria Real Estate based on that focused portfolio, the loyal customer base, positive cash flow. On the other side, you say avoid SL Green at all costs based on its not-so-diverse portfolio of buildings here in New York City, high debt, low occupancy. Adam Johnson, what a pleasure to see you--"", 'JULIE HYMAN: Great being with you, Julie Hyman.', 'JULIE HYMAN: --and be on TV with you once again.']"

Despite being the most interest rate-sensitive among its peers, the company’s net interest income (NII) is less likely to have improved in the fourth quarter.Though the Federal Reserve did not raise rates in the quarter, the policy rate stands at a 22-year high of 5.25-5.5% at present. This is likely to have aided BAC’s NII and net interest margin (NIM). But the company’s billions of dollars’ worth of long-dated Treasuries and mortgage bonds, which it piled up at low rates that prevailed during the pandemic, is expected to have weighed on both NII and NIM.The situation is likely to have been further aggravated by the inverted yield curve in the December-ended quarter. Also, per the Fed’s latest data, the overall lending scenario was weak. The demand for commercial and industrial, real estate and consumer loans (except credit card loans) loans was subdued in October and November.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BAC’s average interest earnings assets is pegged at $2.72 trillion, suggesting a 2.7% rise from the year-ago reported number. Our estimate for the metric is $2.63 trillion.Management expects NII (FTE) to be around $14 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII (FTE basis) of $14.04 billion suggests a 5.2% decrease. Our estimate for NII (FTE) implies a fall of 5.3% to $14.02 billion.For 2023, management expects NII (FTE) to witness growth of 9%. Our estimate for the metric is $57.43 billion, implying an increase of 8.6%.', 'Trading Income: Market volatility and client activity were subdued in the fourth quarter. While the risks of a recession in the near term faded, ambiguity related to geopolitical issues, inflation and high rates kept investors on the sidelines. These factors led to reduced volatility in equity markets and other asset classes, including commodities, bonds and foreign exchange.Hence, BAC is less likely to have recorded a solid performance in trading revenues this time.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales and trading revenues of $3.76 billion suggests 6.5% growth from the year-ago reported number. Our estimate for the metric is $3.75 billion.Management projects quarterly trading revenues to be up in the low single-digit range year over year.Investment Banking (IB) Fees: While green shoots were visible in the IB space in the fourth quarter, overall global M&A activities remained muted on a year-over-year basis. Several concerns, including lingering geopolitical tensions, inflation concerns, higher interest rates and China’s economic slowdown, weighed on deal-making. Thus, the deal volume and total value numbers were weak in the fourth quarter.Likewise, the IPO market was subdued after witnessing considerable activity in the third quarter. On the other hand, robust equity market performance drove some activity in follow-up equity issuances. Also, despite seasonality, bond issuance volume was boosted by a decline in yields in the back half of the quarter and a slightly better operating backdrop compared with last year. Hence, BAC’s underwriting fees (accounting for almost 40% of total IB fees) are expected to have improved during the to-be-reported quarter.At Goldman Sachs’ U.S. Financial Services Conference in early December 2023, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan noted, “The M&A deals are coming a little faster.” The company will outperform the industry on IB fees in the quarter. The bank expects to earn approximately $1 billion in IB fees in the fourth quarter, reflecting a low single-digit decline on a year-over-year basis. Moynihan added that the industry-wide IB fee pool is expected to decline 10-15%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for IB income of $1.12 billion indicates a rise of 5.9% from the prior-year quarter level. We expect IB income to be $1.17 billion.Expenses: While BAC was able to manage expenses prudently in the past, expansion into newer markets by opening financial centers, as well as efforts to digitize operations and upgrade existing financial centers, are expected to have kept non-interest expenses elevated in the to-be-reported quarter.The company expects expenses to be roughly $15.6 billion. Our estimate for non-interest expenses stands at $15.83 billion, implying an increase of 1.8%.Asset Quality: Bank of America is expected to have set aside a substantial amount of money for potential bad loans (mainly commercial loan defaults), given an uncertain macroeconomic outlook. Our estimate for provision for credit losses is pegged at $1.52 billion, reflecting a surge of 38.9% on a year-over-year basis.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for non-performing loans of $5.19 billion implies a 36.2% jump year over year. Our estimate for the metric is pegged at $4.11 billion.Charges Tied to Libor Transition: In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Jan 8, 2024, Bank of America stated it will incur a net non-cash pre-tax charge of $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter as it phases out the use of the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index (BSBY).The charge will be presented in “revenue through market making and similar activities.” The company expects the $1.6 billion net impact to be recognized back in its interest income through 2026. This charge will lower BofA’s common equity tier 1 ratio by eight basis points as of Dec 31, 2023.', 'Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for BofA this time.

These enhanced search results will span categories, rivaling Google\'s SGE (Search Generative Experience), which can recommend products and show various factors to consider, along with reviews, prices, images and more.', 'Image Credits: Walmart', 'Ahead of CES, the company had demonstrated an AI shopping assistant that would let customers interact with a chatbot as they shopped, to ask questions and receive personalized product suggestions, as well. At the time, Walmart teased that a generative AI-powered search feature was also in the works. It suggested customers could ask for things like a ""unicorn-themed birthday party"" and get results like unicorn-themed napkins, balloons, streamers and more. Now the feature is rolling out on mobile devices, iOS first.', 'Another potentially promising use of AI involves the replenishment of frequently ordered items.', ""Walmart will initially test this use case with Walmart InHome Replenishment, which will use AI and its existing replenishment expertise combined to create automated online shopping carts for customers with items they regularly order. Because it's only available through the InHome program, these items are then delivered to a customer's fridge in their kitchen or garage using the smart lock-powered InHome delivery service, but it will not be a subscription service."", ""The company also noted that customers will be able to remove items from their basket, as needed, and the service will adjust to customer's changing needs over time."", 'Image Credits: Walmart', ""However, if the feature works well, it's not hard to imagine how it could be put to use to offer replenishment of other household items as well, similar to Amazon's Subscribe-and-Save."", 'Surprisingly, Amazon has not yet leveraged AI to do the same (i.e. to augment or replace Dash Replenishment). However, the online retailer has been putting AI to work in other ways, including by helping connect customers with the right product by summarizing product reviews, highlighting key attributes or helping them find clothes that fit. ', 'Image Credits: Walmart', 'Another new Walmart product making a debut at CES is ""Shop with Friends,"" an AR shopping tool that lets customers share virtual outfits they create with their friends and then get feedback on their finds. The tool combines Walmart\'s AI-powered virtual try-on tech, launched last year, with social features.', 'Image Credits: Walmart', 'CEO Doug McMillon referred to the suite of new products as something he called ""adaptive retail"" -- that is, retail experiences that are personalized and flexible.', '""While omnichannel retail has been around for decades, this new type of retail -- adaptive retail -- takes it a step further, said Suresh Kumar, global chief technology officer, and chief development officer, Walmart Inc., in a statement shared ahead of the CES keynote. ""It’s retail that is not only e-commerce or in-store, but a single, unified retail experience that seamlessly blends the best aspects of all channels. And for Walmart, adaptive retail is rooted in a clear focus on people,"" he said. ', ""The company touched on other ways it's employing AI, as well."", ""Walmart's Sam's Club will introduce an AI and computer vision-powered technology that helps solve the problem of waiting in line for receipt verification when exiting the store. The pilot, currently running in 10 locations, will confirm members have paid for their items without requiring a store associate to check their charts. Instead, computer vision tech will capture images of customers' carts and AI will speed the process of matching cart items to sales. Walmart expects to bring the tech to its nearly 600 clubs by year-end."", 'Image Credits: Walmart', 'In another area, Walmart\'s generative AI tool for store associates, My Assistant, will be expanded to 11 countries outside the U.S. in 2024, where it will work in employees\' native languages. Already, the tool has become available in Canada, Mexico, Chile, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua and is on track for launches in India and South Africa. My Assistant helps employees with writing, summarizing large documents and offering ""thought starters"" to spark creativity, Walmart says.', 'Image Credits: Walmart', 'On the matter of AI, McMillon stressed that the company wouldn\'t prioritize the technology without considering the potential implications. Instead, Walmart\'s ""underlying principle is that we should use technology to serve people and not the other way around,"" he said.', 'Still, McMillon admitted that AI will mean some jobs will be eliminated.', '""No doubt some tasks will go away and some roles will change. And some of them should, like the ones that involve lifting heavy weights or doing repetitive tasks,"" the exec explained. ""As that\'s happening, we\'re designing new roles that our associates tell us are more enjoyable and satisfying, and also often result in higher pay. So we\'re investing to help our associates transition to this shared future,"" McMillon added.', 'During the keynote, McMillon also brought Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella onstage, after announcing that Walmart used large language models from Azure OpenAI alongside its own retail-specific models.', 'Nadella spoke broadly about the breakthroughs made possible with generative AI, including in areas like coding, productivity apps, like Microsoft\'s own, healthcare, education and more, adding that with new technology, ""one has to be mindful that you want to be able to amplify the opportunity with it...and then also be very mindful of the unintended consequences of this technology.""', 'Outside of AI, Walmart is looking to other new technology for faster deliveries.', ""The company announced it's expanding its drone delivery service in the Dallas-Ft. Worth metro to 1.8 million households, or 75% of the metroplex area. The deliveries, which take place in 30 minutes or less, are powered by Wing and Zipline. Walmart also notes that 75% of the 120,000 items in a Walmart Supercenter meet the size and weight requirements for drone delivery. To date, Walmart has done over 20,000 drone deliveries in its two-year trial."", 'Walmart experiments with generative AI tools that can help you plan a party or decorate', 'This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/09/walmart-debuts-generative-ai-search-and-ai-replenishment-features-at-ces/']"

In fact, the share price has declined rather badly, down some 59% in that time. Some might say the recent bounce is to be expected after such a bad drop.

One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price."", ""Nordstrom became profitable within the last five years. Most would consider that to be a good thing, so it's counter-intuitive to see the share price declining. Other metrics may better explain the share price move."", 'The most recent dividend was actually lower than it was in the past, so that may have sent the share price lower. The revenue decline of around 0.2% would not have helped the stock price.

It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. If you are thinking of buying or selling Nordstrom stock, you should check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts."", ""It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Nordstrom's TSR for the last 5 years was -53%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return."", ""Nordstrom shareholders gained a total return of 12% during the year. But that was short of the market average. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it is certainly better than the yearly loss of about 9% endured over half a decade. So this might be a sign the business has turned its fortunes around. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

But a big yield sometimes signals big risks, which is the case for this consumer staples stock today. And why most dividend-focused investors will be better off owning a far more boring company like Realty Income (NYSE: O) despite its lower 5.3% dividend yield."", ""Here's what you need to know."", ""Although Altria can boast that it has increased its dividend annually for years on end, income-focused investors need to look past a company's dividend streak when making an investment decision. When you do that here, there's one big trend that stands out: cigarette volumes. In the third quarter of 2023, volume in the company's most important business fell 11.6% year over year."", ""That's a terrible number. If it were just one quarter, maybe investors could overlook it as a hiccup. But this is a long-term trend. To put some numbers on that, cigarette volume was 19.3 billion in the third quarter of 2023 compared to 29.7 billion in the third quarter of 2018. Clearly, Altria's cigarette business is in a long-term downward trend."", ""It has been offsetting that volume decline with price increases, which allowed it to keep growing the dividend. But that can go on for only so long before the company hits a tipping point and price increases start to cause people to quit smoking faster than price increases can offset. The company has failed multiple times to find a product to replace cigarettes, and Altria's high dividend yield is really a reflection of the fact that Wall Street is worried about its long-term future. And that concern seems justified."", 'At the other end of the spectrum is Realty Income, which continues to expand its business as it increases its dividend. This real estate investment trust (REIT) has grown in multiple ways over the years. Not only has it bought individual properties, but it has acquired portfolios of assets, and it is even consolidating its net lease niche (a net lease requires the tenant to pay for most property-level expenses). On that last front, it recently agreed to buy Spirit Realty (NYSE: SRC), which will expand its property portfolio from roughly 13,100 to over 15,100.', ""Realty Income is already the largest competitor in the space, and its growth enables it to more easily tap capital markets to fund its expansion efforts. Add in an investment-grade credit rating, and there's a strong financial foundation here. Realty Income's 29 consecutive annual dividend increases certainly make it stand out against a company like Altria, with a business that is slowly withering away."", ""To be fair, Realty Income does come with some caveats. For example, given that the REIT is more than twice as large as its closest peer, it has to make a lot of deals to grow. That's just a function of its size and means that slow and steady is the likely course. This is pretty much what investors have gotten over the long term: The dividend growth rate over the past 29 years was just 4.3% a year on an annualized basis. In other words, Realty Income won't be an exciting stock to own, but it will likely keep the spending power of your dividend on par with, or slightly ahead of, the rate of inflation growth over time. That's not bad at all if you are trying to live off the income your portfolio generates."", ""If you are a dividend investor trying to supplement your retirement with income stocks, you need to avoid getting drawn into a yield trap. Yes, the yield you buy might be huge, but if the dividend isn't sustainable, you are only buying yourself heartache down the line. Given the trends in Altria's core business, its high yield comes with huge risks. This is why a boring and reliable dividend stock like Realty Income, also an industry leader, would likely be a better choice despite its lower yield."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Altria Group right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Altria Group, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Altria Group wasn't one of them.

That's a fairly modest payout that isn't hard to beat. The danger with high-yielding dividend stocks, however, is that sometimes it can be hard to tell which payouts are safe and sustainable and which ones are too risky to invest in. "", 'Below are three stocks with high yields that are good buys, followed by one that investors are better off steering clear of.', ""Realty Income (NYSE: O) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) with a diverse portfolio of clients that spans 85 industries. That diversification helps make Realty Income one of the more stable REITs to invest in. It's unique in many respects, including the fact that it pays dividends on a monthly basis -- most dividend stocks pay every quarter. As of December, the company has declared a dividend for 642 straight months (53.5 years). It has also increased its dividend for 105 consecutive quarters (26.25 years)."", ""The REIT's dividend is also sustainable. In its most recently reported quarter (ended on Sept. 30, 2023), the REIT posted funds from operations per share of $1.04. Meanwhile, over a three-month period, Realty Income's dividend payments total just under $0.77. That makes its 5.3% yield look safe."", 'With interest rates potentially coming down this year, making REITs more attractive buys, Realty Income could make for a great stock to load up on right now.', ""Oil and gas giant ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) is another high-yielding stock investors should consider for their portfolios. The company profited from higher commodity prices in recent years, and earnings are still strong even as prices have been coming down. While the days of $100/barrel oil have receded for the time being, ExxonMobil also doesn't need those kinds of prices to turn a profit, or for its 3.7%-yielding dividend to be sustainable."", ""Through the first nine months of 2023, the company's earnings per share were just $6.98 -- far lower than the $10.17 it reported in the same period in 2022. But the good news for investors is earnings per share remains far higher than the $2.73 it paid out in dividends during that stretch. ExxonMobil has a good buffer even if oil prices fall."", ""The company's dividend survived when oil prices briefly went negative in 2020, and as long as things don't get nearly as bad again, this should make for a fairly safe income stock to hang onto for the foreseeable future. ExxonMobil has increased its annual dividend for 41 straight years."", ""Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) pays an incredibly high yield of 6.6%, which is the highest on this list. The top telecom's stock hasn't been a popular buy with investors, though, as its business growth rate has been sluggish; for 2023, it projects its wireless service revenue will grow between just 2.5% and 4.5%."", ""Concerns about cleaning up lead-covered cables have also created another risk for investors to consider. But that could take years to sort out, and Verizon is also generating enough profit for investors not to worry about its business. Verizon's payout ratio is just 53% of earnings, which should give investors some confidence that even if economic conditions worsen this year, the business will remain in good shape to continue paying a dividend."", ""Although Verizon's returns over the years haven't been impressive, this could still make for a dependable dividend stock to buy and hold. Last year the company raised its dividend for the 17th consecutive year -- the longest streak among U.S. telecom stocks."", 'Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) would have been the highest-yielding stock on this list if not for its recent dividend cut, where it slashed its payout by a mammoth 48%. Even with the reduced dividend, however, the stock is paying a relatively high yield of 4%.', ""The problem is that the business remains unprofitable. Walgreens is no longer benefiting from an uptick in traffic related to customers getting COVID-19 vaccinations, and it's also investing heavily into launching primary care clinics. The new dividend is lower, but as long as the company remains unprofitable, another dividend cut could still be possible."", ""While cutting the dividend will free up cash, it doesn't mean the company will get out of the red anytime soon. The safer option for dividend investors is to simply avoid Walgreens for the time being."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Verizon Communications right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Verizon Communications, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Verizon Communications wasn't one of them.

The real estate investment trust (REIT) made $9.5 billion in investments last year -- a figure that doesn't include its pending acquisition of fellow REIT Spirit Realty. That topped 2022's total and blew past its guidance, which the REIT boosted several times. "", 'The company capitalized on the challenging market environment to make more investments last year, filling in the gap as rivals retreated. That enabled it to lock in higher real estate cap rates on deals that would boost its cash flow per share, giving it more money to continue increasing its dividend (which at the current share price yields an attractive 5.2%).', 'Realty Income initially anticipated that it would only make about $5 billion in new investments last year. That would have been a meaningful decline from 2022, when it made $9 billion in investments. The REIT wanted to be more conservative, given the steep rise in interest rates and the expectation that they would continue increasing through 2023. ', 'However, despite the headwinds from those higher rates (which increased its borrowing costs and weighed on its share price, driving up its cost of capital), Realty Income went on an acquisition spree in 2023. It ended up securing $9.5 billion in deals, exceeding even its final updated guidance figure of $9 billion. The company ended the year strong, securing $2.7 billion in new investments in the final quarter. It made a steady diet of sale-leaseback acquisitions to complement a couple of larger deals (most notably buying $1.5 billion of convenience store properties from EG Group and making a $950 million investment into the real estate assets of The Bellagio Las Vegas). ', ""Realty Income didn't make deals for the sake of hitting a number. It remained disciplined. The cap rate on new investments secured during the fourth quarter was 7.6%, which pushed its 2023 total to 7.1%. By pushing for higher cap rates, the REIT more than offset the increase in its cost of capital to make accretive investments that grew its cash flow per share. "", 'Those accretive acquisitions enabled the REIT to continue increasing its monthly dividend. It raised its payment five times last year by a total of 3.2%. ', 'Realty Income has already lined up a needle-moving deal for 2024. In October, it agreed to acquire fellow REIT Spirit Realty for $9.3 billion. The company hopes to close that deal early this year. While it recently revealed that there have been several shareholder lawsuits filed that could delay or derail the deal, it believes they are without merit. ', ""The Spirit merger would be highly accretive. Realty Income estimates the deal would add more than 2.5% to its adjusted funds from operations (FFO) per share this year. That's more than half its annual target of growing its adjusted FFO by 4% to 5% each year. "", 'The company estimates it could push its growth rate into its annual target range by reinvesting the free cash flow it retains after paying dividends into new property investments. After acquiring Spirit, it anticipates producing more than $800 million in post-dividend excess cash each year. With leverage, it could internally fund more than $1 billion of new property acquisitions this year without raising additional equity capital. ', ""However, with interest rates expected to fall somewhat this year, the REIT's share price has been on the rise. Because of that, it should be able to sell stock if it needs to do so to fund additional new investments as opportunities arise. Factor in its elite balance sheet, and Realty Income could easily acquire several billion dollars of properties in sale-leaseback deals or larger portfolio acquisitions this year. These deals will grow the REIT's cash flow, which should enable it to continue increasing its dividend. It has raised its dividend 123 times since its public market listing in 1994 (and for more than 25 straight years), putting it in an elite group of dividend stocks. "", ""Acquisitions are the main drivers of Realty Income's growth strategy. The company makes accretive deals that increase its cash flow per share, allowing it to steadily raise its dividend. The REIT had a banner year in 2023 and has already set the stage for an even bigger year in 2024 by agreeing to acquire Spirit Realty. That deal and those to follow should enable the REIT to continue increasing its payouts. That makes it a great option for investors seeking a steadily rising passive income stream."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Realty Income wasn't one of them.

Thus, the company’s trading numbers are expected to have provided little support to its quarterly results, slated to be announced before the opening bell on Jan 16.While the risks of a near-term recession faded in the fourth quarter, ambiguity among investors remained on lingering concerns related to high inflation and other geopolitical issues. Due to this, not much volatility was witnessed in the markets. Moreover, client activity was relatively subdued.Nevertheless, as the Federal Reserve pointed out that it would no longer raise interest rates in 2023 and gave indications of rate cuts in 2024, the overall performance of the equity markets improved substantially toward the end of 2023 on the grounds of increased liquidity.', 'Thus, despite subdued volatility and trading volumes, Morgan Stanley’s trading revenues are expected to have witnessed decent improvement, supported by strong equity market performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s equity trading revenues is pegged at $2.21 billion, suggesting a rise of 1.5% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. The consensus estimate for fixed-income trading revenues of $1.45 billion indicates a year-over-year increase of 2.3%.Our estimates for equity trading revenues and fixed-income trading revenues are $2.15 billion and $1.33 billion, respectively.', 'Investment Banking (IB) Income: While green shoots were visible in the investment banking space in the fourth quarter, overall M&A activities remained subdued on a year-over-year basis. Headwinds like lingering geopolitical tensions, inflation concerns, higher interest rates and China’s cool-down weighed on deal-making, particularly larger offerings in developed nations.Thus, total deal volume and value numbers remained weak in the quarter. While Morgan Stanley’s position as one of the leading players in the space is likely to have provided some leverage, overall growth in advisory fees is not expected to have been that impressive in the quarter.The consensus estimate for advisory fees is pegged at $469 million, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 34%. Our estimate for the same is pinned at $537.7 million, indicating a 24.4% dip.Because of the above-mentioned macro concerns, the IPO markets did not witness much activity in the quarter. While follow-up equity issuances were decent on the back of robust equity market performance toward the end of the year, bond issuance volumes were soft.Hence, Morgan Stanley’s underwriting fees are not expected to have improved much in the quarter on a year-over-year basis.The consensus estimate for fixed-income underwriting fees is pegged at $293 million, suggesting a decline of 6.7% from the year-ago reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for equity underwriting fees of $256 million indicates an increase of 12.8%. The consensus estimate for total underwriting fees of $549 million implies a rise of 1.5% from the prior-year quarter.Our estimate for fixed-income underwriting fees is $285.2 million, while that for equity underwriting fees is $212.6 million.Because of the expected decline in advisory revenues, growth in total IB income is likely to have been muted. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for IB income of $1.03 billion indicates a year-over-year decline of 17.8%. Our estimate for IB income is pegged at $1.04 billion.Net Interest Income (NII): The overall lending scenario was weak in the to-be-reported quarter. Per the Fed’s latest data, while the demand for commercial and industrial loans was decent in October, the demand declined in November. The demand for real estate loans and consumer loans was also moderate in the two months.While interest rates remained high in the fourth quarter, the Fed paused its rate hike cycle, with indications of rate cuts in 2024. Thus, despite higher rates, Morgan Stanley’s NII is expected to have been negatively impacted by muted loan growth and rising deposit and funding costs.The consensus estimate for NII is pegged at $1.89 billion, suggesting a decline of 18.3% on a year-over-year basis. Our estimate for NII is $1.92 billion, implying a decline of 17.2%.Management stated that it expects NII to trend lower in the fourth quarter on a sequential basis.Expenses: Cost reduction, which has long been the main strategy of Morgan Stanley to remain profitable, is unlikely to have provided major support in the December-ended quarter. As the company has been investing in franchises, overall costs are anticipated to have flared.We expect fourth-quarter total non-interest expenses of $9.71 billion.', 'According to our proven model, the chances of Morgan Stanley beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings this time are low.

That's a fairly modest payout that isn't hard to beat. The danger with high-yielding dividend stocks, however, is that sometimes it can be hard to tell which payouts are safe and sustainable and which ones are too risky to invest in. "", 'Below are three stocks with high yields that are good buys, followed by one that investors are better off steering clear of.', ""Realty Income (NYSE: O) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) with a diverse portfolio of clients that spans 85 industries. That diversification helps make Realty Income one of the more stable REITs to invest in. It's unique in many respects, including the fact that it pays dividends on a monthly basis -- most dividend stocks pay every quarter. As of December, the company has declared a dividend for 642 straight months (53.5 years). It has also increased its dividend for 105 consecutive quarters (26.25 years)."", ""The REIT's dividend is also sustainable. In its most recently reported quarter (ended on Sept. 30, 2023), the REIT posted funds from operations per share of $1.04. Meanwhile, over a three-month period, Realty Income's dividend payments total just under $0.77. That makes its 5.3% yield look safe."", 'With interest rates potentially coming down this year, making REITs more attractive buys, Realty Income could make for a great stock to load up on right now.', ""Oil and gas giant ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) is another high-yielding stock investors should consider for their portfolios. The company profited from higher commodity prices in recent years, and earnings are still strong even as prices have been coming down. While the days of $100/barrel oil have receded for the time being, ExxonMobil also doesn't need those kinds of prices to turn a profit, or for its 3.7%-yielding dividend to be sustainable."", ""Through the first nine months of 2023, the company's earnings per share were just $6.98 -- far lower than the $10.17 it reported in the same period in 2022. But the good news for investors is earnings per share remains far higher than the $2.73 it paid out in dividends during that stretch. ExxonMobil has a good buffer even if oil prices fall."", ""The company's dividend survived when oil prices briefly went negative in 2020, and as long as things don't get nearly as bad again, this should make for a fairly safe income stock to hang onto for the foreseeable future. ExxonMobil has increased its annual dividend for 41 straight years."", ""Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) pays an incredibly high yield of 6.6%, which is the highest on this list. The top telecom's stock hasn't been a popular buy with investors, though, as its business growth rate has been sluggish; for 2023, it projects its wireless service revenue will grow between just 2.5% and 4.5%."", ""Concerns about cleaning up lead-covered cables have also created another risk for investors to consider. But that could take years to sort out, and Verizon is also generating enough profit for investors not to worry about its business. Verizon's payout ratio is just 53% of earnings, which should give investors some confidence that even if economic conditions worsen this year, the business will remain in good shape to continue paying a dividend."", ""Although Verizon's returns over the years haven't been impressive, this could still make for a dependable dividend stock to buy and hold. Last year the company raised its dividend for the 17th consecutive year -- the longest streak among U.S. telecom stocks."", 'Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) would have been the highest-yielding stock on this list if not for its recent dividend cut, where it slashed its payout by a mammoth 48%. Even with the reduced dividend, however, the stock is paying a relatively high yield of 4%.', ""The problem is that the business remains unprofitable. Walgreens is no longer benefiting from an uptick in traffic related to customers getting COVID-19 vaccinations, and it's also investing heavily into launching primary care clinics. The new dividend is lower, but as long as the company remains unprofitable, another dividend cut could still be possible."", ""While cutting the dividend will free up cash, it doesn't mean the company will get out of the red anytime soon.

In other words, it ran out of room to supplement the dividend with reserve cash. And unless earnings improved, it would have had to take on debt to support the dividend -- which would just weaken an already struggling business.', 'By cutting the dividend nearly in half, Walgreens will save somewhere in the ballpark of $800 million a year. The savings can shore up the balance sheet and improve the business.', ""Walgreens isn't the first company to announce a sizable cut, hoping it can turn things around over time."", 'Pipeline giant Kinder Morgan (NYSE: KMI) slashed its dividend by 75% in early 2016 due to overexpansion followed by an oil and gas crash. Since then, Kinder Morgan has tightened its capital expenditures and operates an extremely disciplined and reliable business built on long-term contracts and reliable cash flows.', ""For six straight years now, Kinder Morgan has raised its dividend. It still isn't where it was pre-cut. But it's a far more sustainable dividend, and the balance sheet is in its best shape in over a decade. With a yield of 6.3%, the Kinder Morgan of today is an attractive high-yield income stock worth considering."", ""Integrated oil and gas major Shell (NYSE: SHEL) is another good example. Shell cut its dividend by nearly two-thirds during the crash of 2020. Before the cut, Shell paid $0.94 per share per quarter. It has since more than doubled its dividend from that initial post-cut level of $0.32 a share to $0.66 a share, and the stock is up over 70% in the last three years.Shell was overextended and couldn't afford its dividend. It wanted to allocate capital toward lower-carbon ventures and diversify the business. But it couldn't do so amid a downturn and with the looming expense of its dividend."", 'The cut hurt, but it ultimately benefited the business. Shell yields 4%, which is still a good dividend yield, especially considering that the business is in much better shape today.', ""Although Walgreens' dividend cut was the right long-term move, the stock is still not worth buying now. For a dividend cut to be effective, the company has to be able to chart a path toward future growth. Walgreens is losing market share to its competitors. The dividend may be lower, but it is still a massive expense Walgreens currently can't afford."", ""There are far better stocks out there that have earnings growth, are a good value, and have a comparable yield to Walgreens. Walgreens could be a good investment in time. But whenever a company issues this big a change, it's usually best to wait a few years to see if the savings were used wisely or if the company wasted the opportunity to turn things around."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walgreens Boots Alliance right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walgreens Boots Alliance, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Walgreens Boots Alliance wasn't one of them.

Shares of the Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company have declined 12.9% in the past three months against the industry’s 1.8% growth.Let’s delve deeper.', 'Hormel Foods continues to operate in a dynamic operating landscape, including sluggish consumer demand, inflationary hurdles and challenges in the company’s turkey business. Also, the company has been witnessing rising advertising expenses for a while. During the fiscal 2023, the company’s advertising investments were $160 million, up from $157 million reported in the year-ago period. In its last earnings call, management highlighted that it expects advertising investments to remain escalated during the fiscal 2024 as it continues to support leading brands in the marketplace. Certainly, a rise in such costs is likely to put pressure on the company’s profits.', 'Hormel Foods has been battling weakness in the International segment for a while. The fiscal 2023 remained particularly challenging for this business, thanks to softness in China, soft commodity markets and higher-than-anticipated elasticities on branded export business. In the fiscal fourth quarter, International net sales declined 12% due to reduced branded export sales and soft sales in China. In its last earnings call, management highlighted that it expects results in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 to remain drab in the particular segment, with recovery starting in the second quarter.', 'Hormel Foods is on track to transforming and modernizing the company. Management has been committed to strengthening its business on the back of strategic acquisitions.

However, sales declined due to the soft Organic business, reflecting ongoing pressure on some categories due to reduced consumer demand.', 'Adjusted earnings of $2.79 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.76 and increased 1.5% year over year. The upside was backed by a reduced tax rate, lower interest expenses and a decline in diluted shares outstanding, partly offset by reduced adjusted operating income.Consolidated net sales of $549.6 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $543 million. However, the metric fell 1.6% from the year-ago quarter’s levels. The downside was a result of softness in the Organic business to the tune of 2.4%.', 'Helen of Troy Limited price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Helen of Troy Limited Quote', 'The Organic business was hurt by lower sales of hair appliances, humidification and air filtration products in the Beauty & Wellness category stemming from SKU rationalization efforts, lower consumer demand and a delayed start to the illness season. Organic business sales were also hurt by lower brick-and-mortar sales in the insulated beverage category within the Home & Outdoor segment. These were somewhat compensated by higher consumer demand for home and travel-related products, growth in online channel sales and increased sales of thermometry, heaters and water filtration products.The consolidated gross profit margin expanded 210 basis points (bps) to 48%, mainly attributed to reduced inbound freight costs, the positive impacts of SKU rationalization efforts in Beauty & Wellness and a favorable customer mix in Home & Outdoor. However, a less favorable product mix for Beauty & Wellness was a downside. We had expected the gross profit margin to expand nearly 200 bps to 47.9%.The consolidated SG&A ratio declined 250 bps to 27.8%. The adjusted operating income decreased 3.1% to $89.8 million, with the adjusted operating margin contracting 30 bps to 16.3%.The margin contraction resulted from elevated annual incentive compensation expenses, greater marketing expenses, higher distribution expenses, a lesser positive product mix within Beauty & Wellness and associated with Rite Aid’s bankruptcy. This was partly made up by the factors that worked well for the gross margin, along with reduced wages and salary stemming from Project Pegasus, as well as a decline in outbound freight costs.', 'Net sales in the Home & Outdoor segment advanced 3.1% to $235.9 million, as the Organic business rose 2%. The growth in Organic sales was backed by elevated home category sales in the club, online and brick and mortar networks stemming from robust consumer demand and stronger distribution. The growth of insulated beverageware in the online channel and increased closeout channel sales were also upsides.These were partly negated by a sales decline in Bed, Bath & Beyond due to its bankruptcy, lower brick-and-mortar sales in the insulated beverageware category and reduced home category sales within the closeout channel. We had expected net sales in the Home & Outdoor segment to increase 3% to $235.8 million.Net sales in the Beauty & Wellness segment declined 4.9% to $313.7 million due to the Organic business’ decline of 5.5% stemming from the soft sales of hair appliances, humidification products, air filtration products and fans. This resulted from low consumer demand and SKU rationalization.This was partially made up by strength in thermometry that fueled international sales, sales growth of heaters and water filtration products and increased prestige haircare products sales. We had expected Beauty & Wellness net sales to decline 7% to $306.6 million.', 'Helen of Troy ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $25.2 million and total short and long-term debt of $735.6 million.

The project aims to streamline indirect spending and improve cash flow and working capital. The company expects that these initiatives will result in operational efficiencies and serve as a foundation for funding future investment in growth. As part of Project Pegasus, management expects to achieve annualized pre-tax operating profit improvements of $75-85 million to be substantially generated by the fiscal 2026-end.', 'Management now anticipates consolidated net sales revenues in the range of $1.975-$2 billion, representing a decline of 4.7% to 3.5%. This compares with the prior view of $1.965 billion-$2.015 billion. The updated view continues to include a combined year-over-year downside of nearly $70 million (3.4%) attributable to the Bed, Bath & Beyond bankruptcy and the Pegasus SKU rationalization effort.The sales view considers HELE’s year-to-date performance, ongoing consumer spending pressure, uncertainties in discretionary categories, illness incidences lower than the pre-pandemic period and lower-than-anticipated holiday sales. However, management believes retail inventory levels are healthy, expecting a closer alignment between sell-in and sell-through for the remainder of fiscal 2024.Segment-wise, Home & Outdoor net sales are anticipated to decline 1.5-0.5% compared with the prior projection of a decline of 1.7% to an increase of 1.0%. Meanwhile, Beauty & Wellness net sales are forecasted to decline 7.5%-5.9%\xa0 compared with the earlier estimate of an 8-5.8% decline.Non-GAAP adjusted EPS is envisioned in the range of $8.60-$8.85, suggesting a decline of 9-6.3%. Earlier, management expected the adjusted EPS to be $8.50-$9.00. GAAP EPS is now projected in the range of $6.67-$7.05 compared with the previous range of $6.36-$7.03.Helen of Troy now expects consolidated adjusted EBITDA to be $330-$335 million, down from the previous range of $338-$348 million. The updated guidance indicates growth of 0.8%-2.3% from the year-ago period reported figure.Management continues to expect free cash flow of $250-$270 million and the net leverage ratio at the end of fiscal 2024 to be 2.0-1.85. Furthermore, Helen of Troy expects fiscal 2024 interest expenses of $52-$54 million, a reported GAAP effective tax rate range of 20.0%-19.0%, and an adjusted effective tax rate range of 14.5%-13.5%. The weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the fiscal are estimated to be 24.0 million.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 8.5% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 3.4% growth.', 'Sysco Corporation SYY, a food and related product company, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Just what am I talking about? These are securities that are currently trading no higher than 10% of their 52-week lows. At the same time, they (at time of writing) feature a consensus view of at least moderate buy.', 'Put another way, we’re not talking about garbage ideas that will likely fall lower still. Rather, Wall Street experts have tagged these enterprises as featuring stocks with comeback potential. Of course, you want to be careful. The suits – as smart and experienced as they may be – offer recommendations or endorsements, not guarantees. You’re going to still have to conduct your due diligence.', 'Nevertheless, I don’t know about you but if I’m going to dig in the dumpster, I’d rather do it in a rich neighborhood than an impoverished one. Do you get my drift? You can reach out to me on X if you don’t. For those who get me, below are the comeback stocks to consider.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com', 'Let’s get the core statistics out of the way first. In 2023, shares of multinational pharmaceutical giant Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) dropped 29%. It’s only modestly higher from its 52-week low of $48.25. However, analysts anticipate that BMY ranks among the comeback stocks, pegging it a moderate buy. Also, the average price target lands at $60.67.', 'In part, competitive pressures stymied BMY throughout much of last year. For instance, Cytokinetics (NASDAQ:CYTK) delivered positive late-stage clinical trial data for its heart failure drug. As it turns out, the underlying therapeutic competes with Bristol-Myers’ variant, pressuring the larger pharmaceutical firm.', 'Still, it’s important to remember that the broader global prescription drug market reached a valuation of $1.04 trillion in 2022. By 2030, the segment may command a total value of more than $1.89 trillion.', 'Plus, with the volatility that BMY incurred, it now trades at a discount. Specifically, the market prices shares at 6.88X forward earnings, below the sector median 14.6X. Thus, it’s one of the stocks with comeback potential.', 'Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com', 'A specialist in the field of workers’ comp, Amerisafe (NASDAQ:AMSF) might seem an odd idea for comeback stocks. Surely, that is what apparently most investors believe. Last year, AMSF gave up more than 10% of equity value. Shares presently trade near their 52-week low of $45.34. Still, covering analysts peg Amerisafe as a consensus moderate buy with an average price target of $57.50.', 'At first glance, Amerisafe seems too boring of an enterprise to be relevant. However, the needs of companies seeking workers comp solutions may rise. True, the sector tends to be much more stable than other insurance-related segments. Stated differently, fewer chances for catastrophic damages exist. However, industry experts have noted that the severity of claims have increased, possibly leaving underinsured businesses exposed.', 'Also, a possibly improved economic backdrop in 2024 could lead to a sustained rise in the labor market. If so, Amerisafe should rise in relevance. Therefore, I believe it’s one of the stocks with comeback potential.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'A world-renowned oil and gas giant, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) really needs no introduction. However, because of the political and ideological winds favoring clean-emission transportation, XOM appears to suffer from relevancy issues. Still, it’s arguably one of the comeback stocks to buy. Analysts anticipate a robust recovery in XOM, rating shares a consensus moderate buy. As evidence, their average price target stands at $129.', 'As stated above, the push for cleaner emissions – specifically the adoption of electric vehicles – pose a challenge to Exxon and its hydrocarbon peers. However, it’s not entirely clear how truly accelerative this trend may be. Recently, ABC News stated that EV sales have slowed. To be fair, industry insiders suggest there’s no need for panic. Still, that’s what you would expect to hear from those with a vested interest in the space.', 'Even discounting this new element, hydrocarbons command high energy density. In many cases, fossil fuels simply offer more conveniences. Thus, XOM ranks among the stocks with comeback potential.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'A multinational food processing and commodities trading specialist, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) intuitively presents a solid case for comeback stocks, in my humble opinion. Mainly, people must eat and bad things happen when they don’t. Still, the Street didn’t see it that way, with ADM falling over 19% in 2023. Nevertheless, analysts peg ADM a moderate buy with an average price target of $93.44.', 'Aside from the critical need of the underlying sector, Archer Daniels should benefit from broader growth trends. Specifically, the global food processing market came in at $134.21 billion in 2021. By 2030, this segment could reach $400.43 billion. That would come out to a CAGR of 11.82% from 2022. And who knows? If population growth accelerates faster than expected, this demand profile may be conservative.', 'What investors should focus on is ADM’s forward earnings multiple of 10.76X. That’s lower than the sector median value of 15.21X. Further, because the market itself enjoys a double-digit CAGR, the discount is credible. It’s one of the comeback stocks to consider.', 'Source: DutchMen / Shutterstock.com', 'A company that doesn’t require an extensive introduction due to its patently obvious business, British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) carries controversy. Still, politically or ideologically agnostic investors should give BTI a second look before dismissing it. Yes, it suffered a loss of almost 28% last year, which isn’t encouraging. However, it does enjoy a moderate buy rating with a $38 average price target, possibly making it one of the stocks with comeback potential.', 'Now, you’ve surely heard that global smoking statics have declined over the past several years, possibly making BTI less relevant. While it’s true that smoking has declined overall, the total number of tobacco users remains high due to population growth. Also, not all countries have witnessed a decline; some have actually seen growth in smoking prevalence.', 'Plus, the most important factor is vaping. That’s a wildly popular subsegment of the personal liberties space and it will likely only rise. Therefore, BTI easily ranks among the underappreciated comeback stocks to consider.', 'Source: Misunseo / Shutterstock.com', 'Another enterprise that doesn’t require much guessing as to its main operations, SSR Mining (NASDAQ:SSRM) focuses on precious metals. In addition to gold and silver, SSR also produces copper, lead and zinc. However, the market doesn’t see much point in SSRM, which dropped almost 34% of equity value in 2023. Nevertheless, analysts are warm to it being one of the comeback stocks, pegging it a moderate buy. Also, the price target stands at $16.38.', 'To be completely upfront, SSRM obviously ranks among the speculative prospects for comeback stocks. Investors should be under no illusions here. That said, if the Federal Reserve reduces interest rates this year – an action that it hinted at recently – then SSRM could entice. After all, the international markets price gold and other commodities in dollars. If the greenback becomes devalued, commodities should rise.', 'To sweeten the pot, shares trade at 10.64X trailing-year earnings. In contrast, the sector median value comes in at a loftier 16.66X. If you’re looking for a speculative discount, SSRM could be one of the compelling comeback stocks.', 'Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com', 'Based in China, ZTO Express (NYSE:ZTO) represents one of its home market’s leading express delivery companies. Unfortunately, due to pressures impacting the Chinese consumer, the market hasn’t been friendly to ZTO, sending it down nearly 23% last year. However, analysts expect shares to rank among the comeback stocks of 2024, rating ZTO a consensus strong buy. Moreover, the average price target clocks in at $58.98.', 'As with SSR Mining, ZTO Express represents a speculative idea among stocks with comeback potential. Here, the risks center on the viability of the Chinese economy. As an export-driven economy, if the greenback drops in value, that could add pressure to China. At the same time, a stabilized outlook in the U.S. should also be a net positive for the Asian juggernaut.', 'Admittedly, it’s not an easy idea to propose. That said, ZTO trades at a forward rate of return of 16.7%, ranked better than 60.89% of its peers.

This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.', '2 Stocks to Add to Your Watchlist', 'The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.', 'The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock.

That translates to an average annual return of 10.2%, compounded.', ""That's more than twice the return investors could earn if they held cash right now, even with interest rates at a 15-year high."", ""But, historically, investors who purchased specific individual stocks have far outperformed the return of the S&P 500. I'm going to share 10 stocks that have crushed the index since their initial public offering (IPO), and they have the potential to help you beat the market going forward, too."", ""Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is the parent company of popular social networks Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Its stock came public in 2012, and it has since gained 826%, which translates to a compound annual return of 22.4%. That's twice the long-run average of the S&P 500."", ""But it hasn't always been smooth sailing. Meta stock fell 76% from peak to trough between 2021 and 2022 and then roared back to life with a 194% gain in 2023. In the third quarter of 2023 (ended Sept. 30), the company delivered a record amount of revenue, and its net income (profit) surged 163% year over year."", 'Meta stock is still cheap relative to the broader technology sector, and more market-beating returns might be ahead this year and beyond as the company ramps up its investments in the artificial intelligence (AI) space.', 'The next market-beating stock is Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW), a world-leading cybersecurity company that came public in 2012. Its stock has soared by 1,920% since then, or by a compound annual rate of 31.4%, and it spent much of 2023 making record highs.', ""Investors have rewarded the company's growing investments in futuristic AI-powered cybersecurity, which are already attracting significant amounts of revenue. Palo Alto's one-year-old Cortex XSIAM product is a security operations solution designed to reduce reliance on human-led, manual incident response with the help of AI. It has already amassed $1 billion in bookings, with one large organization using it to protect 300,000 computers and devices (endpoints)."", 'Palo Alto is on track to deliver a record-high $8.2 billion in total revenue during the current fiscal year 2024 (ending July 31, 2024). Considering that the cost of cyberattacks continues to soar, investing in one of the largest cybersecurity providers in the world might be a great move for your money going forward.', ""Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the parent company of Google, but it's also home to other famous tech subsidiaries like YouTube and self-driving vehicle developer Waymo. Google stock came public in 2004 (it changed its name to Alphabet in 2015), and it has since delivered a return of 6,311%. That's equivalent to a compound annual gain of 24.5%."", ""Advertising dollars generated from Google Search remain Alphabet's single largest source of revenue, but a notable contribution also comes from its cloud computing platform, Google Cloud. It's growing in importance because it's where the conglomerate monetizes many of its AI initiatives, from new data center chips to large language models that form the foundation of AI software applications."", 'Like Meta, Alphabet stock also trades at an attractive valuation compared to its big-tech peers, and that could pave the way for more upside going forward.', 'Next up is streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). It came public in 2002, shortly after the dot-com tech bubble burst, and its stock has delivered a red-hot gain of 44,146% since then. That translates to an annual return of 33.7%, compounded.', 'Netflix has disrupted everything from video rental stores to cable television. Its streaming service has become the largest in the world, with 247 million paying members, and the company continues to grow its addressable market by offering cheaper subscription tiers and by expanding into new territories.', 'Netflix is the only stand-alone streaming provider generating a profit, which bodes well for its long-term staying power compared to its peers, many of which are slashing costs right now. That could lead to more market share for Netflix over time and more gains for its stock.', ""Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) recently became the world's first $3 trillion company, and its stock has been one of the best performers in the history of the market. It has delivered a gain of 181,080% since its IPO in 1980, or a compound annual return of 19%."", ""The iPhone smartphone has become the company's biggest value creator, leading to other billion-dollar hardware products like the Watch and AirPods. Apple also has a booming services segment led by the subscription-based Apple Music, Apple News, and Apple TV. But AI might be one of the biggest reasons to own the stock going forward."", ""The company's iPhone 15 Pro features an Apple-designed A17 Pro chip that can process AI workloads on-device. It's reportedly working on a large language model and AI chatbot, and the ability to run such applications on the smartphone (as opposed to in the cloud) could mark a new dawn in mobile computing and pave the way for new features. It's hard to go wrong owning this tried-and-true long-term performer."", ""It started out selling books online in 1994, but Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has transformed into one of the most diversified technology companies in the world. It came public in 1997, and its stock has soared by 193,553% since. That's a compound annual return of 33.8%, tripling the long-run average annual return of the S&P 500."", ""E-commerce remains Amazon's largest source of revenue, but the company draws most of its profit from its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is spearheading the company's AI initiatives, from developing data center chips to helping businesses develop their own AI applications. Amazon even purchased a $4 billion stake in leading AI start-up Anthropic late last year."", ""But there's even more to this company. Its streaming service -- Prime -- is second only to Netflix in memberships, and its digital advertising business is one of the fastest-growing pieces of the entire company. Simply put, Amazon stock is a great way for investors to expose their portfolios to the digital economy, and it's trading at a very attractive valuation."", 'Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was the star of 2023, logging a bigger gain than any other stock in the S&P 500. It has a history of spectacular growth; it came public in 1999, and since then, its stock has surged 196,288%. That translates to a 37.2% annual return, compounded.', ""Nvidia's business is currently driven by astronomical demand for its AI data center chips, specifically the H100 and upcoming H200. The world's largest data center operators have raced to give their business customers access to enough computing power to handle AI workloads so they can develop applications and integrate productivity-boosting AI into their workflows. Nvidia has a dominant market share in this area, and there are very few viable alternatives right now."", ""In the recent fiscal year 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 29, 2023), Nvidia's data center revenue surged by a whopping 279% year over year, to $14.5 billion. The company's Q4 forecast suggests it will end the year with a record $58.8 billion in total revenue, and Wall Street predicts it could deliver $92.2 billion in fiscal 2025. In other words, there appears to be plenty of growth left in the tank."", ""Founded in 1977, Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) is one of America's oldest technology companies. It executed its IPO in 1986, and its stock has since recorded a gain of 221,826%, translating to a compound annual return of 23.1%."", ""Oracle started out developing database management software, but today it's a leading provider of cloud-based applications designed to boost productivity in dozens of industries. Investors are intently focused on the infrastructure segment of Oracle's cloud business because the company says its Nvidia GPU chip clusters can train AI models at twice the speed and for half the cost of other leading cloud providers."", ""Oracle has already signed up leading AI start-ups like Cohere and Elon Musk's xAI, and the company is now building 100 new data centers (on top of its existing 66) because it can't keep up with demand. Therefore, now could be a great time to buy Oracle stock ahead of what could be a growth surge in the coming years."", ""Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is nipping at Apple's heels for the title of world's most valuable company. It has a market cap of $2.7 trillion, so it isn't far away. However, Microsoft has delivered a much larger gain than Apple since its IPO in 1986 (it came public with a much smaller valuation). Microsoft stock has soared 504,247% to date, or by 25.9% compounded annually."", 'Microsoft still operates some of its flagship software products, like the Windows operating system and Word. But it also expanded into hardware (computers and devices), gaming, cloud computing, and AI. Last year, Microsoft invested $10 billion in leading AI start-up OpenAI, which developed the ChatGPT chatbot.', ""Microsoft has integrated OpenAI's latest GPT-4 models into its Azure cloud platform, Bing search engine, 365 document suite, and Edge internet browser, among other products. It's allowing the company to successfully monetize AI already, with 18,000 businesses signed up to its Azure OpenAI Service cloud segment and tens of thousands of organizations using its AI Copilot tool for 365 in the early access program."", ""Those AI integrations could drive the next leg of Microsoft's growth, and with its stock near an all-time high, investors certainly appear optimistic."", ""Finally, the stock on this list that has created the most value is Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). It's an investment company led by none other than Warren Buffett, who steered it to a 3,787,464% increase in value between 1965 (when he took the helm) and 2022."", ""That is a compound annual return of 19.8%, and while it's a lesser yearly gain than some other stocks I've mentioned, Berkshire's ability to nearly double the performance of the S&P 500 on a consistent basis for 58 years shouldn't be overlooked."", 'Berkshire owns a $358 billion portfolio of publicly traded stocks and securities, with large positions in Apple, Bank of America, American Express, and Coca-Cola. It also wholly owns private companies like Dairy Queen, Duracell, and GEICO. Its diverse exposure to so many different industries has been the secret sauce to its consistent returns over such a long period of time.', ""If you're looking for a stock with a solid track record of crushing the S&P 500, then look no further."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

It’s an opportunity if you are a rare graphite processing company with operations in both the U.S. and China.', 'One of the biggest news pieces on the graphite scene since Beijing’s export restrictions was a\xa0proposed SPAC deal in December 2023\xa0that could see\xa0Graphex Group (NYSE American: GRFX), with a market cap of $40 million, sell its USA processing business for between $100 million and $200 million. The USA processing business would be spun off as a separate Nasdaq listing.', 'Graphex isn’t a cash-guzzling mining operation with years-long exploration processes to get through: The USA spinoff will be processing graphite—a first in the country—and that’s where some 85% of the graphite profit is. The company is now moving forward quickly with design and equipment selection for its flagship Detroit graphite processing plant and the hunt is on for additional locations, with major JV and offtake deals apparently underway.', 'Beijing’s market-dominating move has also helped strengthen Graphex China’s operations in East Asia, where output is now expected to triple by the first quarter of 2025.', 'Led by veteran energy sector leader\xa0John DeMaio, Graphex USA is leading a SPAC deal that not only awards shareholders through a buyout worth multiples of the current market capitalization but also gives investors exposure to the most critical supply line for North America’s massive EV push.', 'On December 6,\xa0Graphex Group (NYSE American: GRFX)\xa0and its wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary,\xa0Graphex Technologies, LLC entered into a Letter of Intent (LOI) with an independent NASDAQ-listed blank check company to acquire 100% of the equity interest of Graphex Tech.\xa0', 'The pre-money enterprise value, net of liabilities, for Graphex Tech is anticipated to be between $100 million and $200 million in a deal that is set to close in the first half of 2024.', 'This is a US-based company that is building its first graphite processing plant in Detroit, Michigan, and is now on the hunt for more locations across the U.S. and Canada.', ""It's also in advanced and late-stage testing with the auto industry, battery manufacturers, and OEMs (original equipment manufacturers). And it already has JVs and offtake deals with non-Chinese entities that meet the strict compliance requirements set down by the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)."", 'And it’s a critical metals segment that will play a huge role in defining North American security and the energy transition.', 'Graphite is the biggest—and most critical--component in any lithium-ion battery. It makes up 95-99% of the anode (negative electrode). The average lithium-ion battery contains 15X more graphite than lithium, and for lithium, North America already has a much clearer path to supply not dominated by China.', 'North America\xa0has zero commercial production of refined graphite.', 'Graphex could end up being the first to domesticate this supply chain.', 'Right now, it’s in the final stages of the construction of its 15,000-ton-per-annum graphite refining facility in Detroit--the heart of America’s auto industry. First production is expected in the first quarter of 2025.', 'The Safe China Exposure', 'The team at\xa0Graphex Group (NYSE American: GRFX)\xa0has over a decade of experience processing graphite in Asia.

And that’s exactly where Graphex USA is focusing. There won’t be any mining overhead expenses--\xa0just multi-source, IRA-compliant graphite processing capabilities.', 'By the third quarter of 2024, Graphex Asia aims to double its graphite production from 10,000 metric tons per year to 20,000 metric tons per year. By the first quarter of 2025, the company aims to triple this to 30,000 metric tons, with bank financing already approved for the production ramp-up. And they are hoping to get ~$5500 per metric ton for that graphite.', 'And back on the home front in North America, Graphex believes it has multiple raw graphite supply deals lined up to feed its Detroit processing plant—along with other proposed new plants as they come online--in accordance with the IRA sourcing requirements for North American supply that doesn’t come from China.', 'Late last year, Graphex entered into an LOI with Northern Graphite Corporation (TSXV:NGC) for raw material supply, and signed an MOU with Reforme Group Pty Ltd. And in January this year, they joined forces with Northern Graphite to build a\xa0large-scale graphite processing facility\xa0in Quebec’s Baie-Comeau region. The partners are now evaluating\xa0sites to house a facility that could produce up to 200,000 tons of graphite annually. They also have an LOI with Canada-based Gratomic for raw graphite to evaluate building.', 'Then, in August this year, they signed the biggest supply deal yet with\xa0Syrah Resources’ Balama graphite operation in Mozambique, the largest in existence outside of China, with a production capacity of 350,000 metric tons per year.', 'Source: Syrah Resources', 'Both Mozambique and Tanzania are poised to become major graphite miners, home to the fifth- and sixth-largest graphite reserves in the world, respectively.', 'With Beijing’s restrictions on graphite exports, Graphex represents an interesting way for non-Chinese investors to gain exposure to the China graphite market. Graphex Asia already has the necessary export licenses.', 'In 2021, China only housed some 22% of global graphite reserves, yet it produced over 79% of the world’s supply because of its processing power. That same year, the U.S. was 100% reliant on foreign sources of processed graphite, one-third of which came from China.\xa0 Graphex Group (NYSE American: GRFX) is North America’s first chance at diversifying this supply with an unprecedented domestic solution.', 'Other miners to keep an eye on in 2024:', ""Compass Minerals International (NYSE: CMP), based in Overland Park, Kansas, is a leading provider of essential minerals, including salt, sulfate of potash, magnesium chloride, and even\xa0sustainable lithium.

It’s an opportunity if you are a rare graphite processing company with operations in both the U.S. and China.', 'One of the biggest news pieces on the graphite scene since Beijing’s export restrictions was a\xa0proposed SPAC deal in December 2023\xa0that could see\xa0Graphex Group (NYSE American: GRFX), with a market cap of $40 million, sell its USA processing business for between $100 million and $200 million. The USA processing business would be spun off as a separate Nasdaq listing.', 'Graphex isn’t a cash-guzzling mining operation with years-long exploration processes to get through: The USA spinoff will be processing graphite—a first in the country—and that’s where some 85% of the graphite profit is. The company is now moving forward quickly with design and equipment selection for its flagship Detroit graphite processing plant and the hunt is on for additional locations, with major JV and offtake deals apparently underway.', 'Beijing’s market-dominating move has also helped strengthen Graphex China’s operations in East Asia, where output is now expected to triple by the first quarter of 2025.', 'Led by veteran energy sector leader\xa0John DeMaio, Graphex USA is leading a SPAC deal that not only awards shareholders through a buyout worth multiples of the current market capitalization but also gives investors exposure to the most critical supply line for North America’s massive EV push.', 'On December 6,\xa0Graphex Group (NYSE American: GRFX)\xa0and its wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary,\xa0Graphex Technologies, LLC entered into a Letter of Intent (LOI) with an independent NASDAQ-listed blank check company to acquire 100% of the equity interest of Graphex Tech.\xa0', 'The pre-money enterprise value, net of liabilities, for Graphex Tech is anticipated to be between $100 million and $200 million in a deal that is set to close in the first half of 2024.', 'This is a US-based company that is building its first graphite processing plant in Detroit, Michigan, and is now on the hunt for more locations across the U.S. and Canada.', ""It's also in advanced and late-stage testing with the auto industry, battery manufacturers, and OEMs (original equipment manufacturers). And it already has JVs and offtake deals with non-Chinese entities that meet the strict compliance requirements set down by the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)."", 'And it’s a critical metals segment that will play a huge role in defining North American security and the energy transition.', 'Graphite is the biggest—and most critical--component in any lithium-ion battery. It makes up 95-99% of the anode (negative electrode). The average lithium-ion battery contains 15X more graphite than lithium, and for lithium, North America already has a much clearer path to supply not dominated by China.', 'North America\xa0has zero commercial production of refined graphite.', 'Graphex could end up being the first to domesticate this supply chain.', 'Right now, it’s in the final stages of the construction of its 15,000-ton-per-annum graphite refining facility in Detroit--the heart of America’s auto industry. First production is expected in the first quarter of 2025.', 'The Safe China Exposure', 'The team at\xa0Graphex Group (NYSE American: GRFX)\xa0has over a decade of experience processing graphite in Asia.

There won’t be any mining overhead expenses--\xa0just multi-source, IRA-compliant graphite processing capabilities.', 'By the third quarter of 2024, Graphex Asia aims to double its graphite production from 10,000 metric tons per year to 20,000 metric tons per year. By the first quarter of 2025, the company aims to triple this to 30,000 metric tons, with bank financing already approved for the production ramp-up. And they are hoping to get ~$5500 per metric ton for that graphite.', 'And back on the home front in North America, Graphex believes it has multiple raw graphite supply deals lined up to feed its Detroit processing plant—along with other proposed new plants as they come online--in accordance with the IRA sourcing requirements for North American supply that doesn’t come from China.', 'Late last year, Graphex entered into an LOI with Northern Graphite Corporation (TSXV:NGC) for raw material supply, and signed an MOU with Reforme Group Pty Ltd. And in January this year, they joined forces with Northern Graphite to build a\xa0large-scale graphite processing facility\xa0in Quebec’s Baie-Comeau region. The partners are now evaluating\xa0sites to house a facility that could produce up to 200,000 tons of graphite annually. They also have an LOI with Canada-based Gratomic for raw graphite to evaluate building.', 'Then, in August this year, they signed the biggest supply deal yet with\xa0Syrah Resources’ Balama graphite operation in Mozambique, the largest in existence outside of China, with a production capacity of 350,000 metric tons per year.', 'Source: Syrah Resources', 'Both Mozambique and Tanzania are poised to become major graphite miners, home to the fifth- and sixth-largest graphite reserves in the world, respectively.', 'With Beijing’s restrictions on graphite exports, Graphex represents an interesting way for non-Chinese investors to gain exposure to the China graphite market. Graphex Asia already has the necessary export licenses.', 'In 2021, China only housed some 22% of global graphite reserves, yet it produced over 79% of the world’s supply because of its processing power.

The renewable energy stock surged 29.2% in December, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.', 'A massive macroeconomic development lifted hopes for investors in NextEra Energy Partners, and if things play out as expected, 2024 could be a solid recovery year for the stock.', 'NextEra Energy Partners stock cratered when in late September, management slashed its annual dividend growth targets through 2026 by half to only 5% to 8% with an annual target of 6%. Until then, the company appeared to be going strong, acquiring renewable assets from its parent company, NextEra Energy, and third parties and generating steady, contracted cash flows from them to grow dividends.', ""Issues started to crop up as interest rates rose. The thing is, NextEra Energy Partners relies on low-cost funding for growth, particularly convertible equity portfolio financing (CEPF), which is converted into equity over time. But with interest rates rising and NextEra Energy Partners' stock price falling at the same time in recent months, the company's cost to issue new shares to buy out those financings creeped higher, making its dividend growth goal of 12% to 15% unsustainable. Income investors dumped the stock as its appeal as a dividend growth stock waned, and several analysts slashed their price targets. The stock's yield shot up to double digits, and currently sits at 11%."", 'NextEra Energy Partners, however, already unveiled a transition plan. In December, it sold a portion of its natural gas assets as planned, raising net proceeds of $1.4 billion from energy infrastructure giant Kinder Morgan. With NextEra Energy Partners aiming to use part of the proceeds to buy out CEPFs through 2024 and 2025, investors were convinced the company was already working on a turnaround. As part of its turnaround plan, NextEra Energy Partners also identified wind assets to repower through 2026 and expects the move to generate attractive cash flows that should help fund its dividends.', ""The biggest catalyst for NextEra Energy Partners stock in December, though, was the Federal Reserve meeting, which set expectations of interest rate cuts in 2024 and 2025 rolling.

Currently, ES holds the stakes via two separate joint ventures with Ørsted, the Danish energy company.In addition, Eversource said that it has recently identified new issues, including supply-chain constraints and uncertainty surrounding the re-bid process in New York state, which are impacting the sale price.An after-tax impairment charge of $800-$900 million is what the company intends to declare for each of them.

The USA processing business would be spun off as a separate Nasdaq listing.', 'Graphex isn’t a cash-guzzling mining operation with years-long exploration processes to get through: The USA spinoff will be processing graphite—a first in the country—and that’s where some 85% of the graphite profit is. The company is now moving forward quickly with design and equipment selection for its flagship Detroit graphite processing plant and the hunt is on for additional locations, with major JV and offtake deals apparently underway.', 'Beijing’s market-dominating move has also helped strengthen Graphex China’s operations in East Asia, where output is now expected to triple by the first quarter of 2025.', 'Led by veteran energy sector leader\xa0John DeMaio, Graphex USA is leading a SPAC deal that not only awards shareholders through a buyout worth multiples of the current market capitalization but also gives investors exposure to the most critical supply line for North America’s massive EV push.', 'On December 6,\xa0Graphex Group (NYSE American: GRFX)\xa0and its wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary,\xa0Graphex Technologies, LLC entered into a Letter of Intent (LOI) with an independent NASDAQ-listed blank check company to acquire 100% of the equity interest of Graphex Tech.\xa0', 'The pre-money enterprise value, net of liabilities, for Graphex Tech is anticipated to be between $100 million and $200 million in a deal that is set to close in the first half of 2024.', 'This is a US-based company that is building its first graphite processing plant in Detroit, Michigan, and is now on the hunt for more locations across the U.S. and Canada.', ""It's also in advanced and late-stage testing with the auto industry, battery manufacturers, and OEMs (original equipment manufacturers).

J&J projects that between 2025 and 2030, its operational sales will rise by a compound annual growth rate between 5% and 7%. This year, it expects to grow between 5% and 6%.', 'Those are encouraging numbers for a diversified company that generated $99 billion in revenue over the trailing 12 months.', 'One way Johnson & Johnson can enhance its growth is through acquisitions.

There are more than 50,000 lawsuits the company faces, with plaintiffs alleging the products contained asbestos which led to them getting cancer. Johnson & Johnson attempted to resolve the issue by using a controversial strategy known as the Texas two-step, where it would put the liabilities into a subsidiary and bankrupt it, thus limiting the parent company's overall liability. The strategy has failed in the courts twice, and the threat to the business is a significant one."", ""In the past, the company paid out $2.1 billion in damages to 22 women who developed ovarian cancer allegedly due to the asbestos contained within Johnson & Johnson's products.

In the first nine months of 2023, Merck recorded $18.4 billion in sales from Keytruda, representing nearly half of the company’s top line during the period.', 'Last month, Pfizer completed its acquisition of ADC drugmaker Seagen for a total value of $43 billion. As a result of this acquisition, PFE’s oncology portfolio doubled in size, with 60 programs spanning multiple modalities, including ADCs, small molecules, bispecifics and other immunotherapies. The acquisition also added four of Seagen’s marketed drugs, namely Adcetris, Padcev, Tukysa and Tivdak, to Pfizer’s portfolio of marketed products.

There is nothing quite like getting paid to own shares in a company, and for those who opt to reinvest their dividends, doing so works wonders on long-term returns. Still, not every dividend stock is created equal, and some might end up disappointing investors by slashing their payouts or suspending them altogether.', ""Let's look at two that are unlikely to do so anytime soon: Medtronic (NYSE: MDT) and Visa (NYSE: V). Here is why these two dividend stocks are worth holding on to forever."", ""Being an innovator in the healthcare industry is a great way to have a long-lasting business. That describes Medtronic well. The medical device expert has been a leader in its field for decades and develops products that are essential for physicians and patients -- the company's portfolio includes devices across four main categories: neuroscience, diabetes care, medical-surgical, and cardiovascular health."", ""Although it has encountered some issues lately, especially with the pandemic and its aftereffects, there is much to look forward to with Medtronic. For one, the company is still innovating, as evidenced by its work in Wall Street's newest big thing: artificial intelligence (AI). Medtronic is hard at work incorporating AI into its business. In diabetes care, Medtronic finally earned clearance for its MiniMed 780G last year. It is an automatic insulin delivery system that tracks patients' blood sugar levels and delivers insulin as needed."", ""Although Medtronic trails other companies such as Abbott Laboratories and DexCom in this niche, the diabetes market is vast, with some 422 million patients worldwide. Medtronic's work here could meaningfully impact financial results for a long time. Elsewhere, the company is developing a robotic-assisted surgery system called the Hugo. Although not yet cleared in the U.S., it is already in use in other countries."", ""As Medtronic argues, less than 5% of eligible procedures are performed robotically, so there is massive white space ahead in this industry. Medtronic's innovative abilities have long allowed it to deliver solid and consistent financial results. Further, the healthcare leader has raised its dividend for 46 consecutive years. In a few years, it should join the elite rank of Dividend Kings. Medtronic currently offers a solid yield of 3.26%."", ""The company's excellent track record and robust underlying business should allow it to continue thriving and rewarding shareholders with payout increases for a long time."", ""Most people are familiar with Visa's brand and logo. The company stands as one of the leading payment network providers in the world. Millions worldwide use a credit card that bears Visa's name daily, and every time they do, Visa earns money."", ""That's a great business model that has helped Visa's financial results improve as people displace their use of cash and checks with credit cards. It's why the company's revenue, earnings, and cash flow have all grown rapidly in the past decade. Visa's dividend has, too."", ""Although the company isn't a Dividend King, its payouts are up by an incredible 420% in the past decade. What's next for Visa? More of what the company has accomplished so far. It is unlikely to get knocked off its pedestal since it practically runs a duopoly with its only notable direct competitor: Mastercard. Visa's network effect ensures that any company trying to challenge it will have difficulty. The network effect happens when a company's service becomes more valuable with use."", ""In Visa's case, the more merchants join its ecosystem, the more attractive it becomes to consumers. However, some might feel as though there are no more significant growth opportunities for Visa. After all, the company's business is ubiquitous. Credit cards and digital payment methods are all the rage these days, and there can't possibly be that much cash and check usage remaining."", ""But as the company has repeatedly pointed out, that's not true, especially in developing countries. Visa still sees a massive opportunity as economies, spending, and consumption grow. That's why Visa should be around, and continue to perform well, for a long time. The dividend should be safe, too, although the company's yield looks unimpressive at 0.8%.

Additionally, macroeconomic pressures eased, allowing some medical technology companies to return to more normal growth margins.', '“I feel like 2023 has actually been the first year post-COVID which has really been a strong growth year for medtech on the top line,” said Shagun Singh, an RBC Capital Markets analyst. However, Singh added that medtech stocks were “a bit of a roller coaster ride” last year due to concerns around topics like inpatient hospital volumes and the popularity of weight loss drugs.', 'Industry executives reported improving business trends and a solid operating environment in the third quarter of 2023 on their latest earnings calls. Medtronic, which typically is the last large medtech company to report, even hinted the final months of the year had similar stability.', 'Singh said macroeconomic factors like potential interest rate cuts and inflation still pose lingering questions that will impact industry trends this year.', 'With plenty going on in the medtech industry, Wall Street analysts and healthcare experts helped MedTech Dive break down key financial trends, regulations and product categories to watch in 2024:', 'Medtech dealmaking slowed in the past two years after a flurry of activity in 2021. BTIG analyst Marie Thibault said M&A is going to “speed up” this year after the recent slowdown, as medtech companies debut new products or gain regulatory clearances and macroeconomic conditions improve.', '“Large companies might have more of an appetite for M&A because interest rate hikes are possibly stopping and starting to reverse [in 2024],” Thibault said. “They can make the math work a little easier on return on invested capital, right? If your comparison is no longer such a high interest rate and what you could get on the cash. And you can look around and look for innovative new products or innovative companies that are still in a little bit of a rut valuation-wise.”', 'Thibault said new products coming to market in pulsed field ablation and mitral and tricuspid repair and replacement could attract interest from larger companies, as well as commercial monopolies like mechanical circulatory support and intravascular lithotripsy, a treatment for kidney stones.', 'Boston Scientific kicked off 2024 M&A activity on Monday with its $3.7 billion acquisition of Axonics. Several deals were also announced in the final months of 2023, possibly signaling companies are more willing to spend this year: Johnson & Johnson said it will spend $400 million for Laminar to increase its competitive edge in the growing left atrial appendage closure market; Zimvie plans to sell its spine unit for $375 million; and Integra plans to acquire J&J’s Acclarent subsidiary for $275 million.', '“It’s pretty hard to get any worse, from an IPO standpoint, from zero, right?”', 'Richard Newitter', 'Truist Securities analyst', 'Michael Weinstein, senior analyst at Moody’s Investors Service, said companies prioritized R&D spending last year as M&A slowed and firms executed more tuck-in acquisitions, trends that may continue.', ""“I think we'll see continued focus on R&D spend and innovation internally. But if the right transaction were to come along — I think even this year we could have seen some transactions but didn't,” Weinstein said. “It depends on what becomes available for sale.”"", 'Truist Securities analyst Richard Newitter said there may also be an appetite for companies to explore IPOs because of the medtech investment community’s interest in growth opportunities after a two-year dearth of new public companies.', ""“It’s pretty hard to get any worse, from an IPO standpoint, from zero, right?” Newitter said. “There's an appetite for new growth areas and new issuance. Obviously, rates going lower and the rebound, or at least the start of a rebound in [small- to mid-cap] valuations [may] make it a little bit more amenable for exit and small caps exploring the IPO market in 2024.”"", 'While medtech companies reported more stable financials and growth, the positive environment could have set up a tougher 2024 in terms of year-over-year comparisons.', '“I think it returns to the way this industry looked prior to the pandemic: Innovation matters, growth matters — top line is a major driver of this industry and this market,” said Mayuri Shah, a partner with Bain & Company.', 'Some companies are likely to preview how the year will play out in comments at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference this week and during the fourth-quarter earnings season, which begins at the end of the month.', 'One variable that could make this year a bit more difficult for companies is procedure backlogs drying up. Thibault said that companies dependent on more urgent procedures, such as cardiac surgery, have mostly worked through backlogs.', 'Meanwhile, Newitter said that orthopedic companies may still benefit from backlogs for hip and knee replacements in the U.S., but the boost won’t be “anything close to what the bolus was, if you will, in the first half of ‘23.”', '“I think it returns to the way this industry looked prior to the pandemic: Innovation matters, growth matters — top line is a major driver of this industry and this market.”', 'Mayuri Shah', 'Bain & Compay partner', 'One of the more contentious regulations over the past few years has been the Food and Drug Administration’s proposed rule to increase oversight of lab-developed tests. The rule received thousands of responses during the public comment period, with industry groups and hospitals claiming it would limit patients’ access to essential tests.', 'The American Clinical Laboratory Association, which represents companies including Labcorp and Quest Diagnostics, asked the agency to withdraw the proposed rule. Regardless, the Biden administration has scheduled the release of the final rule for April.', 'In an email to MedTech Dive, TD Cowen analyst Eric Assaraf questioned whether the Department of Health and Human Services “will actually release [the final rule] given the pushback, and if they do, I fully expect it to be challenged in court.”', 'Assaraf said Congress will need to codify the FDA’s regulatory authority over LDTs into law, whether the agency finalizes the rule or not. However, the opportunities to do that this year may be limited.', '“The next legislative catalyst to potentially attach LDT reform could be the next spending bill in January/February, but I think it’s a low likelihood that it will be included,” Assaraf wrote. “There will be less opportunities to get a bill done as we get closer to the elections, so it might have to wait until the lame duck [session] or 2025.”', 'The year ended with several big announcements in the pulsed field ablation (PFA) space. Medtronic received the first FDA approval for a PFA device, and Boston Scientific said that it expects the agency to approve its Farapulse system in the first quarter of 2024, ahead of its previous projection for the second half of the year.', 'Multiple analysts with whom MedTech Dive spoke highlighted PFA as a product category to watch, and the announcements from Medtronic and Boston Scientific may have teed up what will be a big year.', ""“[Adoption is] going to come very quickly,” Thibault said. “Doctors are very excited about [PFA], they've been hearing their peers in Europe have access to some of it, and they're eager to try it. Even if we haven't necessarily seen efficacy be higher, we are seeing faster throughputs on the procedures, it's a safer technology. I do think you're going to see that shift happen quickly.”"", 'With multiple competitors likely to hit the U.S. market this year, including Medtronic’s PulseSelect system, a key question is who will ultimately lead the space. Thibault said Farapulse “might have the upper hand eventually” despite slightly trailing Medtronic’s PulseSelect rollout, which the company said will begin in early 2024.', 'Singh said that Farapulse could be one of the biggest product launches of the year, calling PFA a brand-new technology in a “massive $8 billion” electrophysiology market.', 'The skyrocketing interest in weight loss drugs was one of last year’s biggest healthcare developments. In the medtech space, the interest in GLP-1s panicked investors about the impact on companies and, ultimately, led to a stock sell-off.', 'Concerns about a potential drop in demand for device treatments increased after some trial results showed that the medications were associated with improved heart health and even helped some patients reduce their insulin use or stop it altogether. Diabetes technology companies like Insulet and Tandem Diabetes Care saw their stocks decrease, while surgical robotics maker Intuitive Surgical faced questions from analysts about a slowdown in bariatric surgery volumes associated with the drugs.', '“I do not think the same level of concern and fear-mongering is going to happen again in 2024. I think that is behind us.”', 'Marie Thibault', 'BTIG analyst', 'Multiple CEOs downplayed the risks to the space as questions came up during third-quarter earnings calls.', 'Analysts think fears about the impact of the drugs have peaked. However, interest and concern around the medications are not likely to disappear completely.', ""“I do not think the same level of concern and fear-mongering is going to happen again in 2024. I think that is behind us,” BTIG’s Thibault said. “I don't think the topic is dead.”"", 'Truist’s Newitter said that companies are taking a more pragmatic view of the potential impact on the medical device industry. The medications may eventually harm certain procedure categories but not for quite some time, he added.', ""“It's going to be so far out in the future, it's not even an investable timeframe,” Newitter said. Given how under-penetrated medical technologies and therapies are in numerous disease states, weight loss drugs are “unlikely to even put a dent into the growth opportunity at that point in time … to warrant the amount of market cap destruction, or anything close to the market cap destruction, that occurred throughout the fall of ‘23,” he said."", 'This story was originally published on MedTech Dive.

That’s the mistake, it can never happen.”', 'But Calhoun emphasized that he is “confident” in the FAA’s ongoing work to “inspect each and every one of the airplanes” and make “certain that they’re in conformance with our design, which is a proven design.”', '“I’m confident that that process will not only prevent an accident, but maybe more importantly, the data we collect from each and every one of those inspections, the data we collect will inform all of the actions that we have to take as a company,” Calhoun said.', 'Still, Calhoun acknowledged that a “quality escape occurred” at some point that allowed the plane to fly in the first place, and said he looks forward to sharing more details about this after the investigation concludes.', 'Meanwhile, as scrutiny is increasingly placed on aviation supplier Spirit Aerosystems, Calhoun told CNBC that he is confident in their CEO Patrick Shanahan. “We’re not going to point fingers there. Because yes, it escaped their factory, but then it escaped ours too,” he said. “So we’re all in this together. We have to figure this one out.”', '“This one is a horrible escape,” Calhoun said. “We’ll make sure that we take steps to ensure that it never, never can happen.”', 'On Saturday, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered most Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft to be temporarily grounded as regulators and Boeing investigate the cause of the incident. The order applies to some 171 planes.', 'That has led to hundreds of cancelations, particularly from Alaska Airlines and United Airlines, which have dozens of the 737 Max 9 planes.', 'Alaska Airlines acknowledged Wednesday the Boeing 737 Max 9 will not fly for at least several more days, extending its cancelations for flights scheduled on that plane through Saturday. United Airlines said it is canceling 167 Boeing 737 Max 9 flights today and expects significant cancellations on Thursday, too.', '“We regret the significant disruption that has been caused for our guests by cancellations due to these aircraft being out of service,” Alaska Airlines said in a statement.\xa0“We are working around the clock to reaccommodate impacted guests on other flights.”', 'The top safety inspector probing the Boeing 737 Max 9 blowout warned regulators Wednesday about hastily allowing the plane model to fly again. Jennifer Homendy, chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, told CNN’s Poppy Harlow on “CNN This Morning” Wednesday that the FAA and Boeing “really need that information about how that occurred before they can take actions to unground the planes.”', '“I would recommend that they not put those back in service until they absolutely know how this occurred,” said Homendy. “That will tell them what inspections need to take place and what repairs need to take place.”', 'Meanwhile, Spirit AeroSystems — the Boeing contractor that builds the 737 Max 9 fuselage — says it is now part of the NTSB investigation.', 'Outside of the airline industry, the accident has caught the attention of lawmakers.\xa0In a statement on Tuesday, Republican Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio called for the Senate Commerce Committee to convene a hearing to “evaluate incidents involving the 737 Max,\xa0Boeing’s engineering and safety standards, and\xa0the\xa0quality of oversight provided by the FAA and other relevant government agencies.”', 'President Joe Biden is monitoring the issue, the White House said Tuesday.', 'For five years, Boeing has faced repeated quality and safety issues with its aircraft, leading to the long-term grounding of some jets and the halt in deliveries of others.', 'The 737 Max’s design was found to be responsible for two fatal crashes: one in Indonesia in October 2018 and the other in Ethiopia in March 2019. Together, the\xa0two crashes killed all 346 people\xa0aboard the two flights and led to a\xa020-month grounding\xa0of the company’s best-selling jets, which\xa0cost it more than $21 billion.', 'Internal communications released during the 737 Max grounding showed one employee describing the jet as “designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.”', 'Late last month, Boeing asked airlines to inspect all of their 737 Max jets for a potential loose bolt in the rudder system after an airline discovered a potential problem with a key part on two aircraft.', 'Its quality and engineering problems have extended beyond the 737. Boeing also had to twice halt deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner, for\xa0about a year\xa0starting in 2021\xa0and again in 2023, due to quality concerns cited by the FAA.\xa0And the\xa0777 jet\xa0also suffered a grounding after an engine failure on a United flight\xa0scattered engine debris\xa0onto homes and the ground below.', 'CEO David Calhoun acknowledged the company’s “mistake” related to the Alaska Airlines incident at a staff-wide “safety meeting” Tuesday.', '“We’re going to approach this number one acknowledging our mistake,” Calhoun told staff, according to a partial readout of the meeting shared with CNN. “We’re going to approach it with 100% and complete transparency every step of the way. We are going to work with the NTSB [National Transportation Safety Board] who is investigating the accident itself to find out what the cause is.”', 'A company source previously told CNN that Boeing believes “the mistake in question” was introduced in the aircraft’s manufacturing supply chain, however it is not immediately clear if Calhoun identified any specific error during the presentation.', 'Now investigators want to know more.', '“I have a lot of questions on that statement,” Homendy told CNN Wednesday.\xa0“He stated that mistakes were made, and I’d like to understand what mistakes he is referring to.”\xa0\xa0She said she has not yet spoken to Calhoun.', 'Calhoun appeared to address some of the images that emerged from the accident during his remarks to employees Tuesday, including some that showed a gaping hole in the side of the plane.', '“When I got that picture, all I could think about – I didn’t know what happened so whoever was supposed to be in the seat next to that hole in the airplane,” Calhoun said. “I’ve got kids, I’ve got grandkids and so do you. This stuff matters. Every detail matters.”', 'Of the ongoing investigation, Calhoun added that he “trust[s] every step they take, and they will get to a conclusion.”', 'Despite its problems, Boeing capped its best year since the 737 Max grounding\xa0in 2019, reporting record new plane orders in December and one of its best years for sales ever.', 'The American plane maker reported 1,456 gross orders for the year, which was one of its best years ever. Adjusted for canceled orders, the annual total came to 1,314 commercial aircraft, its third best year on record by that measure and its best total since 2014.', 'Much of its success is due to the fact that Boeing and Airbus\xa0are the only two\xa0major global aviation companies. That means Boeing probably doesn’t have to worry about being forced out of business, no matter how extensive its mistakes. Neither company could accommodate all commercial aircraft demand, and both have a backlog of orders stretching back years.', 'But the problems have meant that Boeing continues to fall further behind Airbus.', 'A preliminary report is expected in three to four weeks, NTSB spokesperson Eric Weiss said.', 'On Monday night, NTSB said it’s continuing to recover items sucked out from the plane. On Sunday, a Portland schoolteacher\xa0found a piece of the aircraft’s fuselage\xa0that had landed\xa0in his backyard and reached out to the agency. Two cell phones that were likely flung from the hole in the plane were also found in a yard and on the side of the road and turned over to investigators.', 'Early details are still shocking. The damage extended to several rows on the plane. The two seats next to the detached door plug just happened to be empty when the blowout happened, but had their headrests torn off, according to NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy.', 'On Monday, United Airlines — which has more Max 9s than any other US carrier — said it found loose door plug bolts on an undisclosed number of its Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft as it was performing the FAA-mandated inspections of the jets.', 'Alaska Airlines also said Monday it found loose hardware on some of its 737 Max 9 planes during inspections.', '– CNN’s Catherine Thorbecke, Chris Isidore, Greg Wallace and Pete Muntean contributed to this report.

Internal communications released during the 737 Max grounding showed one employee describing the jet as “designed by clowns, who in turn are supervised by monkeys.”', 'The latest safety saga also puts a spotlight on the fact that Boeing most likely doesn’t have to worry about being forced out of business anytime soon, no matter how extensive its mistakes. Boeing and Airbus are the only two major global aviation companies, neither company could accommodate all commercial aircraft demand alone, and both have a backlog of orders stretching back years.', 'CNN’s Chris Isidore, Gregory Wallace, Pete Muntean, Betsy Klein and Taylor Romine contributed to this report.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

And we'll start with Match Group, owner of dating apps, such as Tinder. Shares rising after Elliott Management poorly building a roughly $1 billion stake in the company. So that's the headline here. Match on the move today."", ""The Journal is saying Elliott Investment Management built this stake. Apparently, Paul Singer and the crew there, they have plans, Julie, to get this stock moving higher. We don't know what those plans are just yet based on these reports. Will they be nominating directors? We don't know that either."", ""If you look at the stock, it's kind of tough-sledding. It's down about 10% in the past 12 months. Obviously, lots of competition. And then also, we've just heard these stories about the kids, the youngins maybe not as interested in the dating apps, Julie, as they might once have been."", ""JULIE HYMAN: You know, and we both met our partners IRL, as the kids say, which I'm still a fan of that, old-fashioned the way maybe. I mean, when you talk about how the stock is performed, indeed it has been disappointing. Remember, this used to be owned by IAC, Interactive Corp. It started trading on its own, I believe, back in 2021, if I'm not mistaken, and traded it over $150 a share at one point."", ""Now, today, it's trading at about $39 a share. So you can see where a company like Elliott would want to maybe see some opportunities to boost that up. It is a lot bigger than the other dating apps in terms of market cap, in terms of number of users, in terms of the suite of other apps. It owns OkCupid, for example, as well. So we'll see what kind of opportunities Elliott's looking for here."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Now, we should mention not a single sell on this name on the Street, by the way. Not a single one. And it could be worse. If you check out rival Bumble, by the way, that stock's down about 30% in the past 12 months. So there you go."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Not great anyway you slice it, I suppose. Let's to talk about the big M&A, potential M&A story that we have been watching today. And that's Hewlett-packard. According to reports, Hewlett-packard Enterprise on the verge of acquiring Juniper Networks. That move would come as HPE looks to accelerate its AI product rollout."", ""The Wall Street Journal reporting a deal could be unveiled sometime this week. And we're talking about around $13 billion. That's the number that both the journal and Bloomberg have put here on what HPE might pay for Juniper. Investors don't seem too thrilled about it. And HPE, the shares down pretty sharply on the day. Of course, Juniper shares have been surging here."", 'I think of Juniper mostly, as we talked about earlier, maker of switches, maker of routers.

Juniper, best known for the hardware, the switches, and the routers. But they do have this AI business they bought in 2019. It's growing fast. It's this AI-based wireless platform. And perhaps, that's what HP CEO Antonio Neri now has his eyes on. The Journal says if it's going to happen, we could hear about it soon maybe this week. So look for headlines."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Juniper shares have not been doing very well, so-- for quite a long time.', ""JOSH LIPTON: They haven't. But when you read through the analyst notes to another question they had for Juniper is, why now, though? What triggered it? Because they actually-- the analysts say, they actually are seeing strength in their enterprise market. So another interesting question. Why now? Yeah."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. All right. Let's talk Illumina, shall we?"", 'JOSH LIPTON: Go ahead.', ""JULIE HYMAN: All right. Shares of biotech company Illumina popping in today's trading session. The company posting preliminary fourth-quarter revenue that did top expectations. One analyst over at Cowen saying this is a good start under the new CEO Jacob Thaysen."", ""And it's important that there's a new CEO, because last year was a drama-filled year for Illumina. It came under activist pressure as well from Carl Icahn, who wanted it, the company, to not buy back Grail, a unit that it had had owned and then spun off and then bought again. And then it ended up by the end of the year dissolving that buy, right? The CEO, who had been the CEO, left, Thaysen took over. A lot happened."", ""JOSH LIPTON: There's a lot of soap operas. So then you did have this new CEO Jacob Thaysen. And he was CEO back in September. Because the other CEOs, to your point, there was this kind of abrupt departure. And it was amid the proxy fight and the regulatory headaches. Even with today's pop, though, by the way, the stock still, I mean, it's looking tough here. You're still down about 30% in the past 12 months."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. But even so, they came out with this preliminary revenue. $1.12 billion is what Illumina is now talking about. $1.07 billion is what analysts had been looking for. So again, people looking for some relief. And the company, you know, we should point out, and our Anjalee Khemlani was covering it, the JP Morgan Health conference going on in San Francisco, and you tend to get a lot of announcements from health care related companies in this time that do push around the stock. So we'll be watching."", 'This is something that came ahead of a presentation they made out there. And so we could potentially get more of those.', ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah. So it sounded like, Julie, so basically it was the Q4 beat to your point. And the full-year sales, they're going to decline but decline less than what they figured when they last spoke, yeah.""]"

Following a disappointing earnings report, investors seemingly couldn’t rid themselves quickly enough of NKE. Nevertheless, investors should also keep in mind that the discretionary retail brand powerhouse may soon enjoy economic and monetary policy tailwinds. If so, NKE stock could jump higher, factoring into my contrarian bullishness.', 'While a blue-chip stalwart like NKE stock deserves to be framed under a long-term context, you can’t ignore the immediate impact, especially one as meaningful as an earnings report. Specifically, Nike’s second quarter of Fiscal 2024 represented a disappointment. Predictably, investors rushed for the exits.', 'According to Vince Condarcuri, the first warning stemmed from the mixed nature of the Q2 report. Yes, earnings per share landed at $1.03, which beat analysts’ consensus view of 84 cents per share. And sales did rise by 1% on a year-over-year basis to hit $13.4 billion. However, this figure dipped by 1% on a currency-neutral basis. As well, the end result missed analysts’ expectations by $40 million.', 'Not helping matters was that in Q1, Nike posted sales of $12.94 billion, which fell a bit short of the $13 billion consensus target. Therefore, Wall Street worried that this was the beginning of a bad trend.', 'To be fair, it wasn’t all doom and gloom. Condarcuri noted, “NIKE Direct revenues and NIKE Brand Digital sales increased 6% and 4%, respectively, on a reported basis. In addition, the company’s gross margin increased by 170 basis points to 44.6%.” This latter point is significant because it demonstrates the pricing power underpinning NKE stock; that is, Nike doesn’t always need to resort to margin-killing discounts and promotions.', 'Still, what really may have driven NKE stock southward is management’s expectations of the future. Pointedly, the leadership team anticipates full-year sales to grow by only 1%. That contrasts rather sharply with the prior estimate of mid-single-digit growth.', 'Although the Federal Reserve aggressively attacked inflation through higher interest rates, the pace of rising prices has been stubbornly elevated throughout much of the past year. Combined with the high borrowing costs, NKE stock suffered due to the dark clouds against the consumer economy.', 'However, that might change in 2024.', 'As TipRanks contributor Nathan Reiff mentioned, NKE stock looks enticing despite the ugly drop following earnings. A major catalyst contributing to the bullish thesis is that Nike “seems to have found continued success in its direct-to-consumer approach.” That’s a solid company-specific driver. When combined with potentially positive fundamentals, the sports apparel brand could be a winner this year.', 'Throughout most of 2023, one of the major headwinds for the consumer discretionary space overall was the rising dollar value. Looking at the dollar index (based in real terms), the benchmark increased from 114.06 points in January 2023 to 117.37 points in October 2023. In fairness, since October, the index declined. Still, this doesn’t change the fact that the greenback effectively increased in value compared to other currencies.', 'And that’s not just a theoretical musing. Between November 2022 and November 2023, the personal saving rate increased from 3.3% to 4.1%. Last year, the saving rate peaked at 5.3% in May, which isn’t surprising. When the dollar rises in value, you have a natural incentive to save money.', 'However, the general cycle in American life is that money today is worth more than money tomorrow. For you baseball fans, that’s why the Shohei Ohtani contract – which involved a $680 million deferral – raised eyebrows.', 'Still, the wrinkle is that the Federal Reserve may move to a more dovish or accommodative policy. Policymakers recently hinted at the possibility of interest rate cuts this year. If so, the dollar – all other things being equal – should not be worth more over time.', 'That means an incentive will exist to do something with the money, including spending it on discretionary items like Nike-branded products. That’s good for stakeholders of NKE stock but not so much for Shohei Ohtani.', 'Now, one of the main drawbacks of considering NKE stock at the moment centers on its valuation. Frankly, it’s not cheap. For example, NKE stock trades at around 3x trailing-year sales. That’s a bit pricey compared to the underlying retail apparel industry’s price-to-sales ratio of 1.22x.', 'However, that doesn’t really tell the whole story. For example, Grand View Research stated that the global footwear market size reached a valuation of $387.74 billion in 2022. Further, the sector is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 4.3% from 2023 to 2030, culminating in industry revenue of $543.9 billion.', 'According to one report from RunRepeat, Nike held 38.2% of the total footwear market in 2022. And given that other market research has long shown Nike’s ever-expanding presence in just this one segment, the dynamic confirms that the brand resonates with consumers.', 'Admittedly, it’s difficult to ascertain a “realistic” valuation of NKE stock. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that its overpriced profile requires a broader context before passing judgment.', 'Turning to Wall Street, NKE stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 20 Buys, nine Holds, and one Sell rating. The average NKE stock price target is $123.59, implying 19.94% upside potential.', 'Despite a recent earnings miss and its lofty valuation, NKE stock could see a rebound due to potential policy tailwinds. A dovish Fed easing interest rates might boost consumer spending and weaken the dollar, both benefiting Nike. The brand’s strong direct-to-consumer approach and dominant footwear market share further bolster its long-term prospects. While NKE seems pricey compared to the retail sector, its premium valuation should be considered in light of its unique brand strength and growth potential.', 'Disclosure']"

With a swoosh on his striped shirt, he gazed at the room and said, “I guess, hello world, huh?”', ""It all sounded so innocent until Nike launched its “Hello, World” campaign a few days later. That wasn't put together overnight, but so what? It worked."", 'Just about everything did when it came to Woods and Nike.', '“Amazing run. Great partnership,” said Mark Steinberg, his agent at Excel Sports.', 'There was some downtime during a commercial shoot in Florida in 1999 when Woods began bouncing a golf ball off his wedge and a producer decided to catch it on camera. The result was a 30-second spot of Woods bouncing the ball while switching hands, going through the legs, behind the back and then popping it up in the air and making solid contact with a baseball swing. Pure magic.', ""One of the most famous shots in Masters history was his pitch up the slope on the 16th green, back down the slope toward the hole and then the ball comes to a stop — with the swoosh in full view — before dropping for birdie. That wasn't scripted, of course. It just seemed that way."", 'Woods had switched to the Nike golf ball in May 2000 and then won the next four majors, the only player in history to hold them all at the same time.', 'He switched to Nike irons a week before the Ryder Cup in 2002. Asked about the timing of the change, Woods said: “Off the record? Because the majors are over.” Asked for a comment on the record, he thought for a minute, laughed and said, “Because the majors are over.”', 'And now the partnership is over after 27 years.', 'Woods has had three regular caddies and two agents during that time. He has had six corporate sponsors on his bag and four swing coaches. He has used three golf balls and and four brands of irons.', 'What never changed was his relationship with Nike.', '“I would have thought without a doubt he would have been a lifer,” Curtis Strange said.', 'Strange has his own history with Nike Golf. He and Peter Jacobsen wore the swoosh when it was best known for sneakers, particularly the Air Jordan created for Michael Jordan, who remains the one athlete forever linked with Nike.', 'Strange had a swoosh with “Nike Golf” in block letters when he won back-to-back in the U.S. Open, the first to do that since Ben Hogan. He even wore a red shirt on Sunday for the second title at Oak Hill in 1989. Not many remember that. Even fewer probably cared.', '“They were still so young,” Strange said. “Even when they pushed us a little bit in ads and posters, it was a small piece of the market.”', 'And then it became much bigger when Nike co-founder Phil Knight signed Woods.', '“What Michael Jordan did for basketball, Tiger Woods absolutely can do for golf,” Knight told Golf World magazine about the original deal (5 years, $40 million) that seemed so enormous at the time and now looks to be what his father, Earl Woods, once called it — chump change.', ""“The world has not seen anything like what he's going to do for the sport,” Knight said. “It's almost art. I wasn't alive to see Claude Monet paint, but I am alive to see Tiger play, and that's pretty great.”"", 'He was right about what Woods did for his sport. He created a popularity boom not seen since Arnold Palmer, and Woods was the catalyst behind network TV deals that made everyone richer than they imagined, at least in the non-Saudi division.', 'But it never really translated into success for Nike Golf. It outsourced the golf ball. It once made a square-shaped driver (Woods never used it). And then it abandoned the equipment in 2016 and stuck with apparel.', 'Brooks Koepka remains a Nike athletic and equipment holdout — he still uses a Nike 3-iron.', 'Knight told Bloomberg in a 2017 interview about Nike\'s decision to get out of the golf equipment business that it was a “fairly simple equation.""', '""We lost money for 20 years on equipment and balls and realized next year wasn\'t going to be any different,” he said.', ""Woods wasn't giving Nike much visibility lately, either, mainly a product of knee surgeries, five back surgeries and most recently the February 2021 car crash outside Los Angeles that shattered bones in his right leg and led to ankle fusion surgery in April."", 'And then he switched to FootJoy shoes when he did return following the car crash, saying he needed “something that allowed me to be more stable.” Nike responded by saying it would work with Woods to “meet his needs.” Woods was still wearing FootJoy a month ago.', ""Woods, who turned 48 a few weeks ago, wants to play a tournament a month if his body allows. He gets more eyeballs than any golfer in history. But it's still only six tournaments."", ""Woods spoke of “another chapter” in his social media post announcing the end with Nike. Steinberg, the agent, hinted at “an exciting announcement” at Riviera in February. But it will be a different look. It's hard to imagine Woods can create the moments he had with Nike over the years, mainly because Woods is more about medical science than painting like Claude Monet."", 'Nike still has Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy, and Nelly Korda from the LPGA Tour, in its stable. Cutting ties with Woods will lead to speculation its day in golf are numbered, though there has been no indication of that.', 'As for Woods? He will show up in Los Angeles for the first time without a swoosh to be found. At least the Sunday shirt will be red.', '___', 'AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf']"

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

Wells CEO Charles Scharf has said the bank will take additional severance charges of between ""$750 million to a little less than $1 billion"" in the fourth quarter due to job cuts.', 'At Bank of America, fourth quarter profits are expected to fall roughly 18% from a year ago due to its FDIC assessment and other charges related to year-end ESG financing and the reconfiguration of one of its benchmark lending rates.', 'Another challenge for JPMorgan and some of its rivals is a prolonged slump in investment banking, which just had its worst year in a decade.', 'This is a particularly acute issue for Wall Street specialists like Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), which report their results next Tuesday.

(NASDAQ: MYNZ) and its\xa0flagship product ColoAlert®, an accurate, non-invasive and easy-to-use, early-detection diagnostic test for colorectal cancer (CRC).', 'Mainz Biomed made significant progress in the battle against CRC last year, promising to bring to the market the most advanced at-home diagnostic screening tool.', 'Mainz Biomed made significant progress in the battle against CRC last year, promising to bring to the market the most advanced at-home diagnostic screening tool.', 'Mainz Biomed just issued a report that summarizes its key product and commercial development in 2023. Its CRC screening test that is based on\xa0real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction-based (PCR) multiplex detection of molecular-genetic biomarkers in stool samples is already marketed across Europe with the company continuing to expand its international commercialization. During 2023, Mainz Biomed reported groundbreaking results both from its\xa0European ColoFuture and U.S. eAArly DETECT studies.\xa0ColoFuture reported sensitivity for colorectal cancer of 94% with specificity of 97% and sensitivity of 80% for advanced adenoma (AA),\xa0a type of pre-cancerous polyp often attributed to this deadly disease. eAArly DETECT reported sensitivity for CRC of 97% with a specificity of 97% and a sensitivity for advanced adenoma\xa0of 82%. Therefore, both studies delivered results that exceeded those of existing market alternatives. Moreover, Mainz Biomed has been ramping up preparations for its\xa0pivotal FDA PMA clinical trial (ReconAAsense) which remains on track to commence patient enrollment by mid-2024. If successful, Mainz Biomed would gain a gold-standard status for at-home CRC screening with\xa0the potential to prevent CRC through early detection of precancerous adenomas.\xa0Throughout the year, Mainz Biomed made numerous strategic partnerships across Germany, Israel, Romania, Poland, the UK and Spain to equip itself with the highest quality scientific and technology experts to enhance and expand its flagship product, along with developing PancAlert,\xa0its\xa0Company’s early-stage screening test for pancreatic cancer.', 'Moderna’s next innovation is focused on cancer.', 'The combination of Moderna’s cancer vaccine and Merck’s blockbuster cancer drug, helped lower the risk of late-stage skin cancer from returning after three years by as much as 49%.The good news from the combined treatment of Moderna’s mRNA cancer vaccine and Merck & Co (NYSE: MRK) Keytruda drug is encouraging with the two announcing their plans to test their winning combination on other types of cancers, including lung cancer. Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel believes the skin cancer vaccine could launch as early as 2025. But personalizing a vaccine to a specific patient by tailoring it to the specific genetic makeup of the patient’s tumor and developing a cost-effective vaccine for the masses are two entirely different things.\xa0Moreover, the skin cancer study in question involved patients whose tumors were already surgically removed, and therefore, the treatment was merely successful at preventing the tumor from coming back and ending in the worst outcome.', 'Moderna is keen on bringing the attention towards its next innovation- designing a vaccine that can teach immune cells how to recognize and combat tumors which promises to be the next best thing in a $200 billion a year oncology drug market. But the market will continue to focus on Moderna’s revenue forecast for Covid shots with 2023 sales falling a bit less than expected, at around $6.7 billion, which is slightly above the lower end of its full-year forecast. Moderna also reiterated its goal of returning to sales growth in 2025, with its shares rising 2.3% in response after weak vaccine sales dragged down its shares more than 40% last year.', 'A new era of pharmaceutical innovation is ahead.', 'Pfizer and Moderna have entered the crowded cancer drug market. This is undoubtedly the most competitive growth area for pharma, but one where until now, remains filled with lost battles. But with mRNA technology, scientists are doing something entirely new when it comes to cancer treatment- personalization.\xa0This technology empowered Moderna to personalize a cancer vaccine and in case of Mainz Biomed, integrating the portfolio of mRNA biomarkers not only brought groundbreaking results in early detection of colorectal cancer, but also the possibility of preventing CRC altogether by detecting\xa0precancerous adenomas.\xa0Therefore, 2024 promises to bring the long-anticipated advancement of science in its battle against cancer.', 'DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

Per the agreement terms, the pharma giant will acquire all outstanding shares of Ambrx for $28 per share in cash, aggregating to $2.0 billion.', 'A clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, Ambrx is focused on developing next-generation antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) designed to target multiple cancer indications. Its lead asset, ARX517, targets the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expressed in prostate cancer cells. The candidate is being evaluated in the phase I/II APEX study in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).', 'Apart from ARX517, Ambrx is also evaluating other ADC candidates, including ARX788 and ARX305, in separate clinical studies for metastatic HER2+ breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma indications, respectively.', 'The transaction, expected to be completed by first-half 2024, is subject to customary closing conditions and clearance from regulatory authorities. Ambrx’s and J&J’s board of directors have already approved this transaction.', 'Following this news announcement, Ambrx’s shares surged 101.5% on Jan 8. In the past year, the stock has skyrocketed 1,007.7% against the industry’s 12.9% fall.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Ambrx currently lacks a steady revenue stream due to a lack of approved drugs. The company is dependent on its pipeline candidates for growth. An acquisition by a big pharma giant like J&J, which has high reserves of cash flow and expertise in the oncology space, would enable the company to ramp up the development of its pipeline. Once the pipeline candidates are approved for marketing, Ambrx will have access to J&J’s larger and well-established commercial supply chain and network distribution.', 'J&J expects the acquisition to diversify its oncology portfolio, enabling it to design, develop and market targeted oncology therapeutics. The pharma bellwether clearly sees potential in ARX517, as it intends to accelerate the APEX-01 study. This is substantiated by the encouraging results shared by Ambrx last October from the phase I portion of the APEX study, wherein treatment with ARX517 led to at least a 50% reduction in prostate-specific antigen levels in more than half of the study participants.', 'The above transaction is one of the few deals in the ADC space. Last year, pharma giants like Merck MRK and Pfizer PFE made several similar deals to expand their portfolios to develop novel ADC therapies.', 'Last October, Merck entered into an agreement with Daiichi Sankyo to jointly develop and market the latter’s three investigational ADC candidates for a total consideration of up to $22 billion. To further diversify its oncology pipeline, Merck recently made a $680-million buyout offer for cancer drugmaker Harpoon Therapeutics and expects to complete it by the first half of 2024.', 'Through these deals, Merck intends to reduce its dependence on the blockbuster anti-PD-1 therapy Keytruda, which is expected to face generic erosion following the loss of patent exclusivity post-2028. In the first nine months of 2023, Merck recorded $18.4 billion in sales from Keytruda, representing nearly half of the company’s top line during the period.', 'Last month, Pfizer completed its acquisition of ADC drugmaker Seagen for a total value of $43 billion. As a result of this acquisition, PFE’s oncology portfolio doubled in size, with 60 programs spanning multiple modalities, including ADCs, small molecules, bispecifics and other immunotherapies. The acquisition also added four of Seagen’s marketed drugs, namely Adcetris, Padcev, Tukysa and Tivdak, to Pfizer’s portfolio of marketed products.

While people may disagree over how quickly AI will change the drug industry, technological optimism is a fitting match for this year’s more bullish JPM mood.', 'Other topics were top of mind, too. Back-to-back neuroscience buyouts have put that field in the spotlight, while industry veterans debated the effects of last year’s market downturn on the sector’s future. Pfizer fielded questions on obesity drugs, an area that Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly now dominate.', 'PureTech Health is the “OG” hub-and-spoke biotech, jokes CEO and founder Daphne Zohar. Formed in 2005, the company was an early adopter of a model in which a central parent forms subsidiaries that each develop their own drugs. The strategy was out of necessity, she says. The company didn’t have enough cash early on to advance all of its ideas, so it used subsidiaries to draw in more investors.', 'That model led to a startup called Karuna Therapeutics. Schizophrenia experts convened by PureTech had theorized that a discarded, but potent Eli Lilly medicine, xanomeline, could be paired with another that blunts its side effects. They cut a deal for rights to xanomeline and planned an experiment to test the theory. In the meantime, “probably 100 investors passed on the idea,” according to Zohar. The only reason Karuna survived was a grant from the Wellcome Trust.', 'The experiment succeeded, leading to a yearslong ascent by Karuna, which in December was bought by Bristol Myers Squibb for $14 billion. It’s PureTech’s biggest hit: The firm has already received $815 million on the $18.5 million it invested, according to Zohar. It will get another $300 million when the deal closes, and potentially $400 million more in milestones.', 'PureTech is already working on a sequel. The same team that worked on Karuna’s drug is behind a young neuroscience startup called Seaport Therapeutics. The company intends to tweak drugs that have shown promise in testing but have flaws such as liver toxicity or low absorption by the blood.', '“We’re calling it a ‘Karuna on steroids,’” Zohar said. — Ben Fidler', 'Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla had a tough sell to make investors Monday at JPM.', 'Company shares fell by more than one-third in value over the past year as sales for its COVID-19 products shrank in 2023. In October the company announced layoffs and cost cuts as it revised its revenue forecasts down.', '""Clearly 2023 was not a good year for us,"" Bourla said Monday in San Francisco.', 'As part of its adjustments, Pfizer has reduced its COVID product inventory to better match anticipated demand in 2024. Boula said the company is now ready to start the year with a ""clean slate.""', 'Pfizer is still facing tough investor questions, though.', 'Last year, the company launched an RSV vaccine for older adults and maternal immunization, a product it forecast to become a blockbuster seller. Yet so far GSK has been able to win greater market share with its rival RSV vaccine. Bourla disclosed that Pfizer’s shot took only 35% of the U.S. market in 2023.', 'The company is also struggling to develop an obesity drug that can match fast-selling medicines from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.', '""Obesity is going to be a big market, period,"" Bourla said. ""Pfizer will play in the market.""', 'Pfizer has hit setbacks, though. In December, the company said it was discontinuing development of a twice-daily GLP-1 agonist due to side effects.', 'The experimental drug, an oral pill called danuglipron, was expected to have an advantage over Novo’s and Lilly’s injections. Pfizer is continuing to test a once-daily version of the pill.', 'Despite the setback, Bourla is confident Pfizer still has the ""capability"" to play a part in the obesity drug market. The pharma is eyeing early-stage licensing deals over later-stage assets, Bourla said. — Delilah Alvarado', 'John Maraganore spent nearly two decades turning a small startup into a pioneering developer of new medicines. The company he built, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, is now one of the sector’s largest companies and the leading maker of treatments involving a drugmaking method known as RNA interference.', 'To get there, Alnylam endured years of setbacks and stock price gyrations. Such a journey is tougher in today’s environment, when companies with broad drug platforms are having a harder time raising cash. A recent report from HSBC’s innovation banking division found that funding for biotechs with platform technologies fell by more than half in 2023 amid a shift towards clinical assets.', 'Maraganore — now a consultant and biotech adviser — still believes new Alnylams can emerge today, despite investors’ higher expectation. But he expects those companies will be constructed more efficiently, with smaller staffs, and focused from the outset on “product opportunities,.” Investment horizons will be shorter, with a timeline from formation to clinical trials that’s “much more reasonable,” he said.', '“Every cycle I’ve seen, there’s some sort of learning that informs the next generation of companies getting started,” Maraganore said. Going forward, “we’re going to see a bit more of a grounded approach to company building.” — Ben Fidler', 'GSK arrived at JPM on the heels of a good year. The company punctuated CEO Emma Walmsley’s presentation Tuesday with an acquisition of asthma drugmaker Aiolos Bio.', 'In her presentation, though, Walmsley highlighted GSK’s strength in infectious disease. The company has enjoyed a strong launch for its RSV vaccine Arexvy, the first preventive shot approved in the U.S. Cleared for use in adults over the age of 60, Arexvy competes with Pfizer’s vaccine Abrysvo.', 'However, GSK so far appears to have the upper hand, winning a majority market share. It’s also been helped by a partnership with major pharmacy retailer CVS.', 'Walmsley said GSK expects the infectious disease market to be worth more than 100 billion pounds, and sketched out 20 billion pounds in peak year sales estimates for its portfolio of products.', 'GSK and Pfizer could have another competitor in Moderna, which is advancing an mRNA-based vaccine for RSV. Sanofi and AstraZeneca also sell an antibody to protect newborns from RSV.', '""There\'s never been a solution before and we welcome the fact it’s a competitive area,"" said Walmsley.', 'GSK plans to expand Arexvy’s use in younger adults, with a regulatory decision expected this year. — Delilah Alvarado', 'Ned Pagliarulo contributed writing', 'This story was originally published on BioPharma Dive.

However, with the S&P 500 rising sharply in 2023, it has become significantly more difficult to find bargains."", 'With that in mind, here are two stocks that look ridiculously cheap right now, and both have the potential to deliver market-beating returns for many years to come.', 'If you had told me a couple of years ago that PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) would be a $60 stock once again, I would have laughed. After all, it briefly surpassed $300 in 2021. But here we are.', ""After a period of rapid pandemic-fueled growth in 2020 and 2021, PayPal's user growth sharply declined, and management conceded that its near-term goal of 750 million active users wasn't going to happen anytime soon (for context, there are currently 428 million). There was also not a clear growth strategy, and management made some moves -- or at least planned to -- that left investors scratching their heads. For example, at one point PayPal was reportedly considering buying Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) at a huge premium."", ""While user growth is certainly lacking these days, that doesn't mean the company's growth story is over. One big factor is that PayPal is seeing a lot of churn from barely active accounts that were formed during the growth boom. However, management is focusing on PayPal and Venmo's most active users to maximize engagement, and it's working. Despite a 1% decline in active users, PayPal managed to grow payment volume by 15% year over year in the most recent quarter."", ""It's also important to mention how financially strong this business is. Not only does PayPal have about $11.5 billion in cash on its balance sheet, it generates about $5 billion in annualized free cash flow that it can use to pursue acquisitions, invest in its own growth, or (the recent focus) buy back stock at a cheap valuation."", 'Speaking of valuation, PayPal trades for less than 12 times forward earnings -- an absurdly low valuation for this fintech leader.', ""Dream Finders Homes (NYSE: DFH) isn't exactly a household name -- at least not yet.

For the most part, these are areas with above-average job and wage growth, positive net migration, and (relatively) affordable home prices."", ""The company uses a land-light model, which is only used by one other major builder, NVR (NYSE: NVR). Instead of buying large amounts of land, Dream Finders buys purchase options on land but doesn't actually buy any lots until it's ready to build a home for a customer. This makes the business highly capital-efficient and is one of the big reasons NVR has been one of the best-performing stocks in the entire market throughout its 30-year public history."", 'Recent results have been excellent. Dream Finders home closings increased 17% year over year in the most recent quarter, net new orders grew by 38% despite the high mortgage rate environment, and earnings per share increased by 9% despite higher buyer incentives and interest expenses.', ""Now, it's worth noting that Dream Finders Homes' stock price has increased by 230% over the past year. In simple terms, the environment for homebuilders turned out to be far stronger than most experts had predicted. So, it isn't quite as absurdly cheap as it once was. But given how well it's doing in a bad real estate market, and its future growth potential, a valuation of just 13.3 times forward earnings sounds more than reasonable."", ""To be perfectly clear, I'm confident that investors who invest in PayPal and Dream Finders at these levels will be handsomely rewarded. In fact, Dream Finders is a top-five position in my own stock portfolio, and I recently added shares of PayPal as well."", ""Having said that, there's a lot of execution risk (a lot needs to go right). Dream Finders will need to navigate the normalization of the housing market, and PayPal is still figuring out its growth strategy now, just to name a couple of things. The point is that these are two very cheap stocks that are capable of long-term, market-beating returns, but it's wise not to expect a smooth ride along the way."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in PayPal right now?', 'Before you buy stock in PayPal, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and PayPal wasn't one of them.

The sector is famous for dynamic, growth-oriented companies that are big on promise, but often lack the consistent profits and free cash flow necessary to fund big dividends."", ""However, there are many tech stocks that pay dividends. Let's look at three that income-oriented investors should consider."", ""First up is International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM). To start, let's acknowledge that IBM has long been a laggard within the tech industry. Indeed, over the last 10 years, IBM's revenue declined by 38%, and its share price fell by 13% over the same period."", ""Yet IBM's massive dividend -- the stock currently boasts a dividend yield of 4.2% -- has ridden to the rescue over the past decade. The stock's total return (which includes dividend payments) is a far more respectable 36%, with almost all of that gain coming over the last 12 months."", 'IBM Total Return Level data by YCharts', ""What's more, the company's long-promised strategic shift finally appears to be paying off. Revenue increased 20% over the last three years, as the company welcomed numerous partnerships in the lucrative cloud services sector."", ""Granted, IBM stock does have one weakness that could turn off some investors: its valuation. Shares trade at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21x, placing it on the upper end of the range for the value-oriented investor. That said, other valuation measures are more favorable. The company's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, for example, is 2.4x -- far more reasonable, and, in fact, cheaper than some other legacy tech stocks."", 'At any rate, dividend-seeking investors should keep IBM in mind due to its fat dividend and revitalized revenue growth.', 'Next is AT&T (NYSE: T). Like IBM, AT&T has also relied on a massive dividend to compensate for its sinking stock price. Shares of AT&T currently trade for less than $18/share, down more than 34% from where they traded in 2014.', ""However, AT&T's fat dividend has more than made up the difference. The stock's total return over the last 10 years is a gain of 40%.

The company has paid down more than $30 billion in long-term debt since the dividend cut, bringing its total long-term debt to $133 billion. ', ""While that's still a ton of debt, AT&T is now in a far better position to service that debt with its almost $20 billion in annual free cash flow. In short, the company's big dividend looks safe. "", 'As for valuation, AT&T shares boast a tiny price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of only 7, making the stock quite attractive to value-oriented investors.', ""Last is Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO). This Web 1.0 giant is more than just alive and kicking -- it's thriving. The company, which designs and makes networking products, generated $13.6 billion in net income on $58 billion in revenue over the last 12 months."", "" Moreover, the company's free cash flow -- the lifeblood that makes hefty dividends possible -- increased to $16.3 billion. Speaking of its dividend, Cisco pays $1.56/share, good for a 3.1% dividend yield -- not at all shabby, and more than double the S&P 500 average of 1.4%."", ""What's more, Cisco isn't just a cash cow; the company is still growing at an impressive rate. Cisco grew revenue by 21% over the last 10 years, and free cash flow has surged by 53% over the same period."", 'CSCO Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts', ""Better still, value-oriented investors need not fret. Cisco's P/E multiple of 13x makes it far cheaper than the S&P 500 average (24.6x)."", 'In short, investors can get good value, and an attractive dividend from a company that is growing handsomely.

The company headquartered in Armonk, New York, which is commonly called IBM, had a change in its chief executive officer in the middle of the pandemic lockdowns in April 2020, and the change in leadership seems to have paid off.', 'The technology giant, known for its dividend yield rather than capital appreciation, delivered 15.5% in 2023, outperforming the Dow Jones Index by almost two percentage points. Add in its juicy 4.1% annualized dividend yield, which brings total gains in 2023 to 19.6%, and there are compelling reasons to invest in the company.', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with IBM.', 'Through my research, I illustrate how business fundamentals, cash flows and margins have started to look much better.', '2023 was a year that most economists and market strategists got wrong. According to Bloomberg, while some economists baked in too much pessimism in the economy, market strategists issued calls for 2023 to be bleak. As the economic slowdown narratives faded with blowout U.S. gross domestic product estimates consistently surprising on the upside, according to Fortune, markets eventually became optimistic and the S&P 500 index notched a 24.7% gain in 2023. The Dow Jones Index underperformed at 13%, but IBM recorded almost 20% gains this year, taking into account its 15.5% stock performance and the 4.1% annualized yield.', 'While still impressive, many would view IBM as having underperformed the S&P 500 Index last year. However, when looking at larger historical performances and accounting for the severe volatility all investors were subject to in 2022, IBM has actually been outperforming the benchmark index. Its incredible performance is illustrated in the chart below.', 'This feat is something that would not have been deemed possible given how severely IBM underperformed between 2012 and 2020.', ""While IBM is a popular pick among investors, especially value-focused investors hunting for yield, I will not go too deep into the history of the company. But I will point out that it had trouble retaining its client base, especially in the last decade, as it missed out on the cloud computing era of software development and distribution. With the rise of cloud computing, IBM severely lost market share to cloud hyperscalers such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google."", ""Realizing it missed out on the opportunity, IBM acquired Red Hat, the maker of open-source cloud software products meant for enterprises to build software applications in the cloud, in 2019. This acquisition became pivotal to the technology giant fully pivoting into its cloud business. Later, IBM's new CEO, Arvind Krishna, offered a glimpse of his vision in an open letter in late 2021, where he outlined the key strategies for his vision to take IBM forward. At the center of his vision was to revamp IBM's entire product portfolio around the hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence."", ""Today, IBM calls itself a hybrid cloud company that helps enterprises build and scale AI, automation and hybrid-cloud-based solutions. As per its latest earnings report, the company makes most of its revenue from its Software and Consulting business verticals. While Software accounts for around 42% of sales, Consulting rakes in about 30% of the company's revenue. Since Software is the highest-margin business segment within IBM, I usually look for upward trends in this segment. Moreover, with Red Hat, Automation and AI part of the Hybrid Cloud subsegment, I want to see continued growth in the Software segment."", ""The most interesting part about IBM's reversal in business fortunes is that strength has started to return to its core Software segment. The Software segment is not only important to its overall growth narrative, but it also allows the company to leverage its position in the cloud computing space, which is still largely controlled by cloud hyperscalers. Within the Software segment, IBM's Hybrid Cloud business is critical. As can be seen in the chart below, this segment has started delivering consistent accretive growth to IBM's top and bottom lines."", ""In the third quarter of 2023, Red Hat and Automation led the year-over-year growth in Hybrid Cloud's 8% growth, with Red Hat up 9% and the Automation segment up 14%. For a company that was expected to grow in the low single digits for a good part of the last two decades, near double-digit growth is quite a welcome change. Typically, its software business is 80% subscription-based, while the remaining 20% is consumption-based. IBM's chief financial officer, James J. Kavanaugh, recently discussed the strength of its Subscriptions software business:"", '""If I extract out that 20% portfolio of consumption-based services and just look at the core subscription-based businesses of Red Hat, OpenShift and Ansible, we grew 19% overall. 110%-plus NRR on that renewal rate of that business. And within that 19%, OpenShift and Ansible were north of 40%. So, putting all that together, Software is at the high end of our segment model; we\'re only building in high single digits growth.""', 'Finally, growth in the software segment is critical for IBM because this is a high-margin business, helping IBM book approximately 80% of revenue from this segment as gross profits. In a later section, I will unpack why this is important from a valuation standpoint.', ""I previously mentioned IBM's Consulting business has started to scale its contributions to the top line in a very meaningful way. What is more interesting to me is that as I looked back over the past two years of available quarterly filings and compared IBM's Consulting business with its closest rival in the space, Accenture (NYSE:ACN), I noticed that IBM's Consulting business has been delivering steady and respectable contributions to its top line. Even better, the company appears to be gaining ground in market share versus Accenture, as can be seen in the chart below."", ""A peek under the hood reveals a clearer picture as to why IBM has been able to deliver such consistent gains even as enterprises around the world have been cutting their budgets for consulting projects. At the core of the Consulting business is the Application Operations and Management Consulting segment, which is directly tied to IBM's aspirations to scale capabilities for its clients in the hybrid cloud. As can be seen, Application Operations along with business transformation have formed the bedrock of IBM's consistency on a year-over-year basis in its consulting business."", ""On the third-quarter earnings call with analysts, the CFO alluded to the strength in IBM's Consulting Business by adding that most of the growth was because it opened IBM's technology to strategic partnerships, particularly with the cloud hyperscalers. I believe this may have been one of the key reasons why IBM continued to reap benefits from greater cloud ecosystem velocity due to the partnerships. The continued growth in IBM's Consulting business gives me further hope that IBM will be able to achieve its target of 6% to 8% growth this year."", ""Per its most recent quarterly earnings, IBM's revenue was $14.8 billion, up 4.5% year over year. As I had talked about earlier in the post, the growth in earnings was driven by its Software segment and its Consulting business segment, which grew 7.8% and 5.6% year over year. While Software contributes 42% to IBM's top line, Consulting adds another 33%."", ""I mentioned earlier that the performance of IBM's Software business is crucial to the overall growth of the company; not just because it focuses on the hybrid cloud, but also because this is a high-margin business segment with 79.5% of its software business revenue being recognized as gross profit. Software's gross margins saw a nice bump up by 0.5% on a year-over-year basis. In addition, IBM's Consulting business saw a meaningful increase in its gross margins by 1.4% to 27.4%, thus lifting its overall gross margins by 1.7% to 54.4%. The incremental gains in gross margins also helped increase the non-GAAP operating margin by 1.7% to 15.6%."", 'In terms of free cash flow, its free cash grew by $1 billion to $5.1 billion, aided by strong growth in its operating cash flow, up $3 billion to $9.5 billion.', 'IBM projects its fiscal 2023 revenue will grow between 6% and 8%, while its non-GAAP earnings per sharewill decline by 5%. In fiscal 2024, consensus estimates project IBM to grow its revenue by 2.9%, with earnings per share rising by 4.4%. Assuming a 4.4% growth in earnings, this would mean IBM is trading at 17.8 times its forward earnings. Given the market estimates the S&P500 to trade at around 20 times its forward earnings, as per FactSet, this would give IBM at least 12% upside.', 'A major risk to IBM\'s positive outlook would be if enterprise spend were to suddenly fall, causing many enterprise clients to renegotiate their deals and push out their budget plans into subsequent periods. I use the word ""suddenly because, so far,enterprise IT spend is expected to grow 8% into 2024, per Gartner. This is a strong projection, and these forecasts actually bode well for the revenue outlook of IBM into 2024. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, if there is a recession or even a soft landing, as Bank of America predicts, IBM\'s management may be forced to re-evaluate their forecasts lower for 2024.', ""A strong dollar could be another factor that could hurt the optimistic outlook for IBM. A majority of the company's consulting and software revenue comes from outside the U.S. If the dollar were to get stronger, it would dent the outlook for IBM to continue its growth into 2024. For example, one of the reasons that could push the dollar higher could be a reorientation by the Federal Reserve toward pushing interest rates higher."", 'Despite these risks, I still believe IBM would provide even greater opportunities to initiate or add to positions were we to see any downturn in the stock.', 'With the turnaround at IBM well underway, I believe this company has some great tailwinds that position the stock for upside. The accretive strength of its consulting and software businesses, with a renewed focus on hybrid cloud and AI technologies, has provided some opportunities for meaningful upside.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

And for many, the most accessible way to obtain new skills is through quality short-term programs, including online learning.', 'Adoption of flexible learning and working models are seemingly at an all-time high - thanks in part to the rise of remote work and online learning during COVID - yet Americans have difficulty accessing federal resources for short-term training and quality online programs. Fortunately, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce advanced two different pieces of legislation - both with strong bipartisan support - to remedy this problem and make learning more affordable and accessible for Americans who need it most.', 'The Bipartisan Workforce Pell Act would allow low-income students and learners to access federal funds, including for quality short-term and online learning courses. A Stronger Workforce for America Act would modernize our public workforce system and dedicate more funding toward quality programs for in-demand skills to help more Americans enter the workforce and continue advancing in their careers. Together, these pieces of legislation represent an urgent and viable opportunity for Congress to seize this session.', ""Employers such as IBM know that talent is everywhere, but opportunity is not. We recognize that a college degree is not the only credential that signifies workforce readiness and competency. It's critical for Congress to support multiple pathways to obtaining skills that help make learning and workforce development affordable and accessible regardless of a person's place, pace, or path. Which is why IBM recently announced a commitment to skill two million people in AI by the end of 2026, with a focus on underrepresented communities through IBM SkillsBuild."", ""Currently, millions of working adults and students who enroll in short-term programs to upgrade their skills and compete in today's job market must predominantly pay out of pocket. This, of course, creates barriers for many and excludes low-income Americans from some of the fastest growing and most in-demand careers in technology."", ""Having time and being able to control one's schedule is a privilege most working adults don't have. Limiting federal funding to programs that tie students to being at a physical location at a preordained times excludes many and ignores the realities of today's adult learners."", ""Outdated barriers like this exist throughout America's workforce and education programs, further separating the needs of workers from the demands of learning institutions. Instead, these two pillars should be working together to fill in-demand positions more quickly in critical sectors such as AI and cybersecurity."", ""The IBM Policy Lab's Technology Workforce Playbook for the U.S. outlined several policy recommendations for Congress to approach these challenges holistically for students, professionals, and those in between looking to make a career change - and we are thrilled many of our recommendations were incorporated into these bipartisan bills."", ""As we usher in the new year and members of Congress return to Washington from their districts, we're welcoming advancement of these two smart, bipartisan bills. As such, IBM urges the House to keep the momentum going and swiftly pass the Bipartisan Workforce Pell Act and A Stronger Workforce for America Act and send to the Senate for immediate consideration."", ""It's time for Congress to modernize workforce development programs and recognize the importance of flexibility for low-income and adult learners at different stages in their lives."", ""Justina Nixon-Saintil is IBM's Chief Impact Officer and Vice President of Corporate Social Responsibility."", 'View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from IBM on 3blmedia.com.', 'Contact Info:Spokesperson: IBMWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/ibm Email: info@3blmedia.com', 'SOURCE: IBM', 'View the original press release on accesswire.com']"

The U.S. manufacturer is trying to change its supply chains to ensure all its EVs sold in the U.S. still qualify for tax credits, following a rule change meant to exclude models that rely on China-sourced parts. Last week, GM promised to make up the difference for models losing the tax credit with a $7,500 incentive.', ""Japanese carmakers also reported declines in sales over 2023, like Mitsubishi's 60% drop in revenue from China between April and September.

The CPCA forecasts 25% growth in Chinese EV sales in 2024, slower than the 36% growth recorded last year and the whopping 96% growth recorded in 2022.', 'A slower and more competitive domestic market is now pushing Chinese carmakers to focus even more on exports.

Ryan, thank you for joining us this morning. So as we look at this EV transition, we keep hearing about some of the demand slipping, but what's at the root cause of it? Is it just about inflation or what else is at play?"", ""RYAN ROBINSON: Well, Hi Rochelle, thanks for having me. So we think that there's an elephant in the room here and that's vehicle affordability.

Now it's about 67%, so there is a bit of that lift and we think that's got a lot to do as I said with affordability. When you consider where consumers or US consumers are at the moment, we've got about 43% of consumers that are telling us that they wouldn't be able to afford a major unexpected expense in the next three months."", ""You've got half of consumers telling us that they're concerned about the level of savings that they have. And concern about credit card debt in our studies has risen from about 23%, where we were this time last year, to about 30% on the last study-pulse, which was just a couple of weeks ago. So there definitely is an affordability issue out there. And we think it's a huge concern for the industry going forward."", ""RACHELLE AKUFFO: So, Ryan, how big is the gap between what people are willing to pay for an EV based on your survey versus what we're currently seeing by some of these EV makers out there?"", ""RYAN ROBINSON: Yeah, so, overall in our study, we asked consumers just what they're expecting to pay for their next vehicle? So just overall kind of transaction price. And about 8 out of 10 consumers are telling us that they're expecting to pay less than $50,000 for their next vehicle."", ""When you bring it down to what consumers are actually concerned about and where the rubber meets the road for them is monthly payment. And, again, you could argue that the concern is at least as great or even the situation is greater when you factor in the impact of elevated interest rates right now. You've got 84% of consumers telling us that they're expecting to pay less than $600 a month."", 'And when you consider where average monthly payments are right now, a lot of people out there, a lot of people that are tabulating these numbers on a month-to-month basis are clocking in well over $700.

A closer look suggests a bearish view for American Airlines and a neutral view for United.', 'Both companies are among the largest U.S.-based airlines, each with a nearly 100-year history. Shares of American Airlines are down 4% over the last year after rallying 19% over the last three months. United Airlines stock is off 6% over the last year, although it has bounced only 7% over the last three months.', 'With such a significant difference in their three-month rallies, it should come as no surprise that AAL is trading at a higher valuation than UAL. We’ll compare their price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios to gauge their valuations against each other and against that of their industry.', 'For comparison, the U.S. airline industry is trading at a P/E of 14. Over the last three years, the industry lost money due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so there is no three-year average P/E to consider.', 'At a P/E of 6.0, American Airlines is trading at a steep discount to its industry but slightly higher than United. Unfortunately, American Airlines swung to a loss during the third quarter, suggesting a bearish view might be appropriate despite the discounted price.', 'During the third quarter, American Airlines reported losses of $545 million as its revenue remained flat year-over-year while its expenses rose. The company also slashed its full-year adjusted earnings guidance to a new range of $2.25 to $2.50 per share versus its previous projection of between $3 and $3.75 per share.', 'While American Airlines swung to a net loss in the third quarter, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) both reported increasing revenues and profits of about $1.1 billion for the quarter. American Airlines’ management blamed the third-quarter loss on higher fuel prices and the new contract with its pilots, which added more than $9 billion in additional benefits and compensation.', 'Given that United and Delta both generated solid third-quarter results despite those industry-wide challenges, it’s clear that American Airlines’ financial position is not as strong. The fourth-quarter earnings report due later this month should provide an important update on the airline’s financial condition.', 'However, its long-term stock-price losses and recent loss suggest this might not be a stock worth holding in the near term in anticipation of an eventual recovery.', 'American Airlines has a Hold consensus rating based on three Buys, seven Holds, and one Sell rating assigned over the last three months. At $14.68, the average American Airlines stock price target implies upside potential of 2.1%.', 'At a P/E of 5.0, United Airlines is trading at a steep discount to its industry and at a discount to AAL. However, United is clearly in a better financial position than American Airlines, and its stock price has held up much better over the long term. Thus, a bullish view seems appropriate, albeit with a warning about the risks of owning these shares.', 'For the third quarter, United reported a 12.5% year-over-year increase in revenue to $14.5 billion, with $1.1 billion in net profits, indicating continued strength. However, it did cut its guidance and issue warnings about rising fuel prices and the suspension of flights to Israel amid the war there. As such, Wall Street now seems to have priced in those concerns, as the consensus for adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter now stands at $1.70 per share.', 'What’s particularly interesting about United Airlines is its long-term stock-price action. The entire travel industry sold off hard in the early days of the pandemic as the whole world shut down and borders were closed. As a result, UAL and AAL both saw their stock prices plummet in early 2020, sending ripple effects throughout their past stock-price action.', 'However, United shares are roughly flat over the last three years and off 47% over the last five years, indicating that they haven’t recovered since the early 2020 sell-off. Additionally, the stock is down only 4% over the last decade.', 'Thus, since United Airlines has held up better than American Airlines, both recently in terms of profits and over the long term, this could be a good time to buy a few shares. However, the fourth-quarter earnings release could change this view, depending on what it shows.', 'United Airlines has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 11 Buys, five Holds, and one Sell rating assigned over the last three months. At $60.67, the average United Airlines stock price target implies upside potential of 39.3%.', 'The last few years have not been easy for airlines, but United is clearly in a much better position than American Airlines based on recent profits.

So ultimately here at the end of the day, we were taking a look at Boeing shares. They are lower right now and over the past five days losing about 10%."", ""One of the things that jumped up during our discussion with Steve Trent of Citi who looks across this entire industry and his analysis that came forward this morning, he said he thinks it's hard to say whether or not this is going to affect some of the airlines that have purchase orders in where they've got a guaranteed amount that they will purchase but then they will also have an amount that is an option on the other side of the agreement that they can choose to exercise or not."", ""The issue that they need to consider that he so aptly notes, it doesn't seem like as of right now, you're going to see a concerted move because there have been so many delays in equipment over the last couple of years.

What type of pricing power do the airlines lose in that instance as well Here', ""STEVE TRENT: Yeah. I think probably it's still somewhat early to gauge the customer reaction. Absolutely passenger comfort is a very big deal. From what kind of aircraft are they flying on to people getting nervous about turbulence. You know, and as long as you're in a seat belt, turbulence is not really a dangerous thing but it's uncomfortable for many people."", ""So absolutely, this is something to watch for the group. If we do get into a situation where these problems are prolonged or there turns out to be another issue with the Max 9. I think from Friday's incident from everything we've seen, this was an extremely fortunate occurrence that it did not occur at cruising altitude when the air pressure differential is massively bigger and when people are moving up and down the cabin. That would have been an entirely different story."", ""So everything I can see, the flight crew did a marvelous job putting the plane into an emergency dive, getting back down to a safer altitude. Is that going to make a dent in people getting on the Max 9? I think it's a wait and see. But as I mentioned, you know, this seems to be, at this juncture, a manufacturing issue and not a design flaw."", '- Steve, how do airlines, though, think about future orders, right? Just in terms of the competition out there between Boeing and Airbus. The fact that maybe United would think twice before making some of those future purchases down the line. Walk us through that type of thinking and some of the trends that maybe you are looking out for in terms of the impact that that could then have on these stocks.', ""STEVE TRENT: Yeah. So if one looks at the big airlines, especially, they all have skin in the game with one or both major manufacturers. So you really don't have great many options when one thinks about acquiring larger gauge planes. I think down the road, one of the things that it could be interesting to look at is to what extent do the airlines start to opt to lease instead of buy."", ""So if you do see a trend towards leasing, for example, it could mean, A, the OEMs continue to have a lot of production issues or B, there is some reticence on the airlines part to take on the asset risk of some of these new planes. So we haven't really seen that so far. You know, and fortunately, at least at this juncture, the loose bolts is somebody didn't put the door plug on properly, not like some kind of major flaw in the Max 9's fluid dynamics.""]"

That trend is unlikely to change over the long term, but there's an important wrinkle here that investors shouldn't ignore when looking at industry leaders Carnival Corp.\xa0(NYSE: CCL) and Royal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE: RCL). Read this before you buy either of these stocks."", ""Carnival's stock has experienced a dramatic rise of around 85% over the past year. Royal Caribbean shares have done even better, up more than 120%. For comparison, the S&P 500 index has advanced roughly 20% over the same span, which most investors would consider a very compelling performance. The two cruise lines put the market's gain to shame."", 'There is no question that investors have had very good reasons to be bullish about Carnival and Royal Caribbean. For example, after the stocks plunged in 2020, revenue and earnings for both companies have recovered strongly. And bookings remain solid for both cruise lines. For example, Carnival noted in its fiscal fourth-quarter 2023 earnings release that it had record 2023 revenue, record booking volumes over the Black Friday/Cyber Monday selling period, and that the fourth quarter saw customer deposits 25% above previous record levels. In Royal Caribbean\'s third-quarter 2023 earnings release, CEO Jason Liberty noted, ""Our booked load factors are higher than all prior years and at higher rates."" At this point, it looks like both companies are probably going to have pretty good years in 2024.', ""But given the huge gains in the shares of both cruise stocks, it seems like investors may already be pricing in a lot of that good news. Indeed, even if the positive outlook among investors is justified, 80% plus share price gains in a year is something that should cause you to step back and carefully consider your investment decisions. Trees don't grow to the sky, as goes an old saying about getting too positive about good trends."", ""The big problem here is that cruising is, at best, a luxury service. So demand will wax and wane along with economic activity. If there's a recession, investors are likely to dump Carnival and Royal Caribbean. It's not fair to look at the pandemic as a reference point here (given the government mandated closures), so it's best to go back to the Great Recession. As the chart below illustrates, these two stocks can get hit hard during a weak macroeconomic environment as the market assumes that customers will pull back on spending."", ""The problem today is that, valuation wise, it is hard to get a good read on what these two companies are worth because of the massive impact of the pandemic period. Notably, Carnival's stock is still far below its pre-COVID levels while Royal Caribbean is only back to where it was before that illness upended its business. So it isn't that hard to think that there's more upside potential here."", ""That said, credit card debt hit an all-time high in 2023 and delinquency rates are heading higher. Meanwhile, large banks like Bank of America have been adding to their loan loss reserves, which is what they do when they are expecting an increase in the number of customers who are unable to pay their loans. There are clear signs that the U.S. economy isn't hitting on all cylinders right now. All it would take is some negative economic news and Wall Street could start to run for cover, which would likely hit Carnival and Royal Caribbean shares particularly hard, given their impressive advances."", ""There's nothing wrong with Carnival or Royal Caribbean and it seems like 2024 will be a strong year, business-wise, for both at this point. However, given the big price advances over the past year, it is also pretty clear that Wall Street recognizes this fact already. And with so much good news already priced in to the stocks, investors have to consider how much further there is to run versus what happens if the story shifts in a negative direction. More conservative investors and those with a value bias might want to tread with caution here."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Carnival Corp. right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Carnival Corp., consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Carnival Corp. wasn't one of them.

An ABR of 1.44 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.', 'Of the 16 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 12 are Strong Buy and one is Buy.

According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.', 'Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.', ""In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement."", ""Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision."", 'ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank', 'In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.', 'The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', ""It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', 'There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.', 'Is RCL a Good Investment?', 'In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Royal Caribbean, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.6% over the past month to $6.59.', ""Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Royal Caribbean.

There is nothing quite like getting paid to own shares in a company, and for those who opt to reinvest their dividends, doing so works wonders on long-term returns. Still, not every dividend stock is created equal, and some might end up disappointing investors by slashing their payouts or suspending them altogether.', ""Let's look at two that are unlikely to do so anytime soon: Medtronic (NYSE: MDT) and Visa (NYSE: V). Here is why these two dividend stocks are worth holding on to forever."", ""Being an innovator in the healthcare industry is a great way to have a long-lasting business. That describes Medtronic well. The medical device expert has been a leader in its field for decades and develops products that are essential for physicians and patients -- the company's portfolio includes devices across four main categories: neuroscience, diabetes care, medical-surgical, and cardiovascular health."", ""Although it has encountered some issues lately, especially with the pandemic and its aftereffects, there is much to look forward to with Medtronic. For one, the company is still innovating, as evidenced by its work in Wall Street's newest big thing: artificial intelligence (AI). Medtronic is hard at work incorporating AI into its business. In diabetes care, Medtronic finally earned clearance for its MiniMed 780G last year. It is an automatic insulin delivery system that tracks patients' blood sugar levels and delivers insulin as needed."", ""Although Medtronic trails other companies such as Abbott Laboratories and DexCom in this niche, the diabetes market is vast, with some 422 million patients worldwide. Medtronic's work here could meaningfully impact financial results for a long time. Elsewhere, the company is developing a robotic-assisted surgery system called the Hugo. Although not yet cleared in the U.S., it is already in use in other countries."", ""As Medtronic argues, less than 5% of eligible procedures are performed robotically, so there is massive white space ahead in this industry. Medtronic's innovative abilities have long allowed it to deliver solid and consistent financial results. Further, the healthcare leader has raised its dividend for 46 consecutive years. In a few years, it should join the elite rank of Dividend Kings. Medtronic currently offers a solid yield of 3.26%."", ""The company's excellent track record and robust underlying business should allow it to continue thriving and rewarding shareholders with payout increases for a long time."", ""Most people are familiar with Visa's brand and logo. The company stands as one of the leading payment network providers in the world. Millions worldwide use a credit card that bears Visa's name daily, and every time they do, Visa earns money."", ""That's a great business model that has helped Visa's financial results improve as people displace their use of cash and checks with credit cards. It's why the company's revenue, earnings, and cash flow have all grown rapidly in the past decade. Visa's dividend has, too."", ""Although the company isn't a Dividend King, its payouts are up by an incredible 420% in the past decade. What's next for Visa? More of what the company has accomplished so far. It is unlikely to get knocked off its pedestal since it practically runs a duopoly with its only notable direct competitor: Mastercard. Visa's network effect ensures that any company trying to challenge it will have difficulty. The network effect happens when a company's service becomes more valuable with use."", ""In Visa's case, the more merchants join its ecosystem, the more attractive it becomes to consumers. However, some might feel as though there are no more significant growth opportunities for Visa. After all, the company's business is ubiquitous. Credit cards and digital payment methods are all the rage these days, and there can't possibly be that much cash and check usage remaining."", ""But as the company has repeatedly pointed out, that's not true, especially in developing countries. Visa still sees a massive opportunity as economies, spending, and consumption grow. That's why Visa should be around, and continue to perform well, for a long time. The dividend should be safe, too, although the company's yield looks unimpressive at 0.8%. No matter, Visa appears to be in an excellent position to continue boosting its payouts for a while."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Medtronic right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Medtronic, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Medtronic wasn't one of them.

This was a commendable feat, considering that the year was also marked by exacerbated worries about rising inflation and the possibility of the U.S. defaulting on its debt.', ""Although the current inflation level in the U.S. remains above the Federal Reserve's annual target of 2%, it has eased significantly from that at the start of 2023. Subsequently, the central bank has suggested three rate cuts in 2024.

Customers are increasingly preferring cloud-based Microsoft 365 subscriptions over perpetual licenses. In the third quarter, Microsoft 365 commercial revenue rose year over year by 18%.

The company is now moving forward quickly with design and equipment selection for its flagship Detroit graphite processing plant and the hunt is on for additional locations, with major JV and offtake deals apparently underway.', 'Beijing’s market-dominating move has also helped strengthen Graphex China’s operations in East Asia, where output is now expected to triple by the first quarter of 2025.', 'Led by veteran energy sector leader\xa0John DeMaio, Graphex USA is leading a SPAC deal that not only awards shareholders through a buyout worth multiples of the current market capitalization but also gives investors exposure to the most critical supply line for North America’s massive EV push.', 'On December 6,\xa0Graphex Group (NYSE American: GRFX)\xa0and its wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary,\xa0Graphex Technologies, LLC entered into a Letter of Intent (LOI) with an independent NASDAQ-listed blank check company to acquire 100% of the equity interest of Graphex Tech.\xa0', 'The pre-money enterprise value, net of liabilities, for Graphex Tech is anticipated to be between $100 million and $200 million in a deal that is set to close in the first half of 2024.', 'This is a US-based company that is building its first graphite processing plant in Detroit, Michigan, and is now on the hunt for more locations across the U.S. and Canada.', ""It's also in advanced and late-stage testing with the auto industry, battery manufacturers, and OEMs (original equipment manufacturers). And it already has JVs and offtake deals with non-Chinese entities that meet the strict compliance requirements set down by the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)."", 'And it’s a critical metals segment that will play a huge role in defining North American security and the energy transition.', 'Graphite is the biggest—and most critical--component in any lithium-ion battery. It makes up 95-99% of the anode (negative electrode). The average lithium-ion battery contains 15X more graphite than lithium, and for lithium, North America already has a much clearer path to supply not dominated by China.', 'North America\xa0has zero commercial production of refined graphite.', 'Graphex could end up being the first to domesticate this supply chain.', 'Right now, it’s in the final stages of the construction of its 15,000-ton-per-annum graphite refining facility in Detroit--the heart of America’s auto industry. First production is expected in the first quarter of 2025.', 'The Safe China Exposure', 'The team at\xa0Graphex Group (NYSE American: GRFX)\xa0has over a decade of experience processing graphite in Asia. The current CTO has designed and built multiple Asian plants, from Korea to China.', 'All that China-based experience is now being rebuilt in North America, led by Graphex Technologies President John DeMaio-- former President, CEO, and Board Member of JouleSmart Solutions, general manager of Siemens Smart Infrastructure, VP of MWH Global, VP of SPG Solar and COO of Thompson Solar Technologies.', 'From an investor’s point of view, the key to profiting from the graphite supply chain is not mining—it’s processing, which represents over 85% of the value of this segment. And that’s exactly where Graphex USA is focusing. There won’t be any mining overhead expenses--\xa0just multi-source, IRA-compliant graphite processing capabilities.', 'By the third quarter of 2024, Graphex Asia aims to double its graphite production from 10,000 metric tons per year to 20,000 metric tons per year. By the first quarter of 2025, the company aims to triple this to 30,000 metric tons, with bank financing already approved for the production ramp-up. And they are hoping to get ~$5500 per metric ton for that graphite.', 'And back on the home front in North America, Graphex believes it has multiple raw graphite supply deals lined up to feed its Detroit processing plant—along with other proposed new plants as they come online--in accordance with the IRA sourcing requirements for North American supply that doesn’t come from China.', 'Late last year, Graphex entered into an LOI with Northern Graphite Corporation (TSXV:NGC) for raw material supply, and signed an MOU with Reforme Group Pty Ltd. And in January this year, they joined forces with Northern Graphite to build a\xa0large-scale graphite processing facility\xa0in Quebec’s Baie-Comeau region. The partners are now evaluating\xa0sites to house a facility that could produce up to 200,000 tons of graphite annually. They also have an LOI with Canada-based Gratomic for raw graphite to evaluate building.', 'Then, in August this year, they signed the biggest supply deal yet with\xa0Syrah Resources’ Balama graphite operation in Mozambique, the largest in existence outside of China, with a production capacity of 350,000 metric tons per year.', 'Source: Syrah Resources', 'Both Mozambique and Tanzania are poised to become major graphite miners, home to the fifth- and sixth-largest graphite reserves in the world, respectively.', 'With Beijing’s restrictions on graphite exports, Graphex represents an interesting way for non-Chinese investors to gain exposure to the China graphite market. Graphex Asia already has the necessary export licenses.', 'In 2021, China only housed some 22% of global graphite reserves, yet it produced over 79% of the world’s supply because of its processing power. That same year, the U.S. was 100% reliant on foreign sources of processed graphite, one-third of which came from China.\xa0 Graphex Group (NYSE American: GRFX) is North America’s first chance at diversifying this supply with an unprecedented domestic solution.', 'Other miners to keep an eye on in 2024:', ""Compass Minerals International (NYSE: CMP), based in Overland Park, Kansas, is a leading provider of essential minerals, including salt, sulfate of potash, magnesium chloride, and even\xa0sustainable lithium.

That's a fairly modest payout that isn't hard to beat. The danger with high-yielding dividend stocks, however, is that sometimes it can be hard to tell which payouts are safe and sustainable and which ones are too risky to invest in. "", 'Below are three stocks with high yields that are good buys, followed by one that investors are better off steering clear of.', ""Realty Income (NYSE: O) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) with a diverse portfolio of clients that spans 85 industries. That diversification helps make Realty Income one of the more stable REITs to invest in. It's unique in many respects, including the fact that it pays dividends on a monthly basis -- most dividend stocks pay every quarter. As of December, the company has declared a dividend for 642 straight months (53.5 years). It has also increased its dividend for 105 consecutive quarters (26.25 years)."", ""The REIT's dividend is also sustainable. In its most recently reported quarter (ended on Sept. 30, 2023), the REIT posted funds from operations per share of $1.04. Meanwhile, over a three-month period, Realty Income's dividend payments total just under $0.77. That makes its 5.3% yield look safe."", 'With interest rates potentially coming down this year, making REITs more attractive buys, Realty Income could make for a great stock to load up on right now.', ""Oil and gas giant ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) is another high-yielding stock investors should consider for their portfolios. The company profited from higher commodity prices in recent years, and earnings are still strong even as prices have been coming down. While the days of $100/barrel oil have receded for the time being, ExxonMobil also doesn't need those kinds of prices to turn a profit, or for its 3.7%-yielding dividend to be sustainable."", ""Through the first nine months of 2023, the company's earnings per share were just $6.98 -- far lower than the $10.17 it reported in the same period in 2022.

ExxonMobil has a good buffer even if oil prices fall."", ""The company's dividend survived when oil prices briefly went negative in 2020, and as long as things don't get nearly as bad again, this should make for a fairly safe income stock to hang onto for the foreseeable future. ExxonMobil has increased its annual dividend for 41 straight years."", ""Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) pays an incredibly high yield of 6.6%, which is the highest on this list. The top telecom's stock hasn't been a popular buy with investors, though, as its business growth rate has been sluggish; for 2023, it projects its wireless service revenue will grow between just 2.5% and 4.5%."", ""Concerns about cleaning up lead-covered cables have also created another risk for investors to consider. But that could take years to sort out, and Verizon is also generating enough profit for investors not to worry about its business. Verizon's payout ratio is just 53% of earnings, which should give investors some confidence that even if economic conditions worsen this year, the business will remain in good shape to continue paying a dividend."", ""Although Verizon's returns over the years haven't been impressive, this could still make for a dependable dividend stock to buy and hold.

The segment was one of the biggest growth drivers in the Nasdaq Composite's 43% rise in 2023, with countless companies benefiting from increased interest in AI."", 'However, data from Grand View Research suggests the sector is just getting started. The AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% through 2030, which would see it exceed a $1 trillion valuation before the end of the decade.

Let's take a look at whether Nvidia or Intel is the better AI stock this January."", ""Nvidia's business exploded in 2023, with its stock up more than 245% since last January. The company's years of dominance in graphics processing units (GPUs) allowed it to get a head start in AI as its chips became the preferred hardware for developers everywhere."", 'While chip rivals like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have vested interests in the GPU sector, they have focused primarily on fighting over share of the central processing unit (CPU) market.

This chart shows its revenue, operating income, and free cash flow have plunged since 2020."", ""The company enjoyed years of almost unrivaled dominance in CPUs, which saw it grow complacent as its technology started to stagnate. In 2020, Apple acted on years of frustration with Intel's chips, ending a 15-year partnership in favor of chips developed in-house. Meanwhile, AMD's powerful line of Ryzen CPUs has seen the company consistently steal market share from Intel. Since the first quarter of 2017, Intel's share of the CPU market has dwindled from 82% to 61% in Q4 2023."", ""However, recent headwinds have seemingly put Intel back on a growth path.

So, this analysis really boils down to which of these stocks I'd rather own. And in doing that, there's one metric that stands out for me."", ""First, let's start with the old-guard FAANG component.

If you had invested $10,000 into Netflix on Oct. 31, 2011, and held on until it peaked a decade later in 2021, your investment would have turned into nearly $590,000.

It has posted seven straight quarters of revenue growth under 10%. In its efforts to reinvigorate its growth, management has tried cracking down on password sharing and rolling out an ad-supported subscription tier. Those moves have been fairly successful, and management expects to report nearly 11% revenue growth for Q4.

Nvidia led the way in 2023, with demand for its GPUs powering artificial intelligence (AI) models to more than triple its revenue in its fiscal Q3 2024.

Here's how these three did it and what may be in store for these 2023 winners in 2024."", ""To no one's surprise, the big theme of the past year was artificial intelligence. The debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot occurred in November 2022; six months later, Nvidia posted explosive revenue growth in May 2023, indicating a new arms race was underway for AI supremacy."", 'That event propelled several participating stocks higher, and the momentum continued in fits and starts throughout the year.', ""Super Micro Computer is a close partner of Nvidia, dating back to both companies' founding in 1993. Under founder and CEO Charles Liang, Super Micro has carved out a profitable niche for itself in the server industry, which investors tend to think of as commoditized."", ""But Super Micro has a unique approach, forming its servers out of building blocks, breaking each part of the server into individual components that can be arranged and customized in myriad ways. Furthermore, Super Micro has been at the forefront of energy-efficient server design for years. While not many cared about energy efficiency in decades past, AI chips are incredibly energy-hungry and generate a lot of heat. So, energy efficiency can translate into big dollars for today's AI data center operators."", ""The result is that Super Micro has seen a deluge of AI-related orders. Revenue grew 37% in fiscal 2023, which ended in June. And based on the midpoint of management's guidance for fiscal 2024, the company should grow another 40%-plus this year."", ""Super Micro came into the year at quite a low valuation of just around 8 times earnings. Now, with AI-fueled growth in sight, it's around 32."", 'As Nvidia was exploding higher, investors soon came to wonder who might challenge its AI supremacy in the future. Eventually, they came around to believing in AMD, which also came into the year at a relatively low point after falling 55% in 2022.', 'While some rebound was somewhat inevitable, AMD\'s outsized gains were definitely fueled by AI enthusiasm in the second half of the year. In June, AMD unveiled its MI300 AI accelerator, its answer to Nvidia\'s H100. The chip has some unique properties, including a 12-part ""chiplet"" architecture, as opposed to Nvidia\'s single-die architecture, along with a greater capacity to handle more high-bandwidth memory.', 'While investors initially had a muted reaction to the June presentation, they certainly felt much better when CEO Lisa Su confirmed the MI300 was shipping in the fourth quarter. On the third-quarter earnings release and conference call on October 31, Su projected $400 million in MI300 revenue for the fourth quarter while projecting more than $2 billion in MI300 revenue in 2024.', ""While far, far below the levels of revenue generated by Nvidia's H100, the quick ramp from AMD seemed to spur optimism that AMD will be able to carve out a small niche for itself in the AI accelerator market, which Su projects could grow to a stunning $400 billion by 2027."", 'Finally, Palantir also came into the year after a nasty two-year downturn, having fallen 65% in 2022. So, it was likely due for a bounce as well.', 'But Palantir surprised analysts by reaching generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profitability in 2023, showing off impressive operating leverage that got investors comfortable with its ability to eventually generate significant profits. Of note, Palantir achieved GAAP net income profitability over four straight quarters, qualifying the company to potentially join the S&P 500 index.', 'Palantir got its start using data and analytics to find and dismantle terror networks for the U.S. government but has since expanded into commercial big data applications across a host of verticals. The company was founded in 2003 and has been a pioneer in data analytics, machine learning, and everything artificial intelligence ever since. So, investors grew more confident that Palantir would be a winner in the AI space as it incorporated generative AI into its software platforms.', ""It's probably a lot to ask for a repeat performance for these stocks in 2024, but the AI revolution could be a multiyear phenomenon, just like the internet revolution was a multiyear growth story from 1995 to 1999, before the bubble burst in 2000."", ""Personally, I am more bullish on the hardware side of things for now. As is the case with Palantir and any machine learning, data analytics, or automation software, it's still unclear whether generative AI will help these businesses innovate or if it will potentially commoditize their offerings and lead to more competition."", ""That's not to say the hardware space isn't competitive -- it is. However, generative AI likely offers much more growth opportunity for hardware suppliers while not adding any more competition than that which already exists. Therefore, I'd expect further gains for Super Micro and AMD as long as they execute as they have been."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Super Micro Computer wasn't one of them.

Robinson Worldwide Inc., had resigned his posts. The company’s stock, which had already dropped more than 15% from around $120 a share in August, registered little immediate reaction to Biesterfeld’s abrupt departure.', 'Analysts, however, were less forgiving, raising concerns about a leadership vacuum and the company’s general direction. Almost to a person, they began lowering their 12-month price targets, with many dropping their estimates into the double-digit range.', 'The ensuing 12 months proved those analysts right. In a rough trucking market, and with no clarity on a recovery plan, C.H. Robinson (NASDAQ: CHRW) shares followed the path of least resistance, which was down. Shares descended into the high $70s in the fall before drifting up into the mid to high $80s, the level it trades at today. It took six months for the board and an executive search committee to pick Biesterfeld’s successor. When it came, the new leader, an outsider with no C-suite experience and a relatively modest transportation background, was not who many had expected.', 'A year and a week since Biesterfeld stepped down, the story has largely stayed the same. Robinson’s North American truckload volumes, the core business of the company, continue to decline. C.H. Robinson’s freight forwarding business, whose performance was so strong during the pandemic that the company considered selling it at a premium, has fallen back and is no longer on the block. Questions have been raised about the cost-effectiveness of its proprietary technology, Navisphere, especially when less-expensive and equally functional off-the-shelf alternatives exist.', 'The company’s costs have risen and remain mis-aligned with volume trends. Margin pressure continues almost unabated. Analysts are hard-pressed to identify trends that illustrate short to intermediate-term improvement, especially with demand and pricing expected to remain weak at least through the first half of the year. On the anniversary of Biesterfeld’s departure, Ken Hoexter of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch published a note setting a 12-month price target of $80 a share, more than $7 a share below where shares traded on Tuesday', 'The question is whether C.H. Robinson’s problems are due to the punishing cyclicality of the current trucking market, or if the company faces a secular problem separate from industry cycles, namely if it has lost its relevance. There are approximately 18,000 brokers in the U.S., and C.H. Robinson’s volumes could likely be absorbed without much of a hiccup should the company slide into some form of long-term abyss.', 'All of this is to the chagrin of C.H. Robinson’s long-term shareholders, who have relatively little to show for their investment over the past 15 years. On Jan. 5, 2009, as financial markets were mired in the depths of the Global Financial Crisis, the company’s shares closed at $49.29 per share. An expected close on Tuesday of slightly below $87 a share means that shares have gained, on a compounded basis, 3.88% a year, a dismal performance given how much the shares of competitors and the major equity indices have appreciated over that time. C.H. Robinson’s shares currently pay a dividend of 2.79%', 'Mollifying aggrieved shareholders is just one of the issues on the plate of Dave Bozeman, who became president and CEO of the company at the end of June. Bozeman’s hiring came despite concerns that five years serving as vice president of Amazon Transportation Services did not qualify him to run a $15 billion global enterprise, especially with Jim Barber on C.H. Robinson’s board. Barber, who expressed interest in being CEO, had served as COO of UPS Inc. (NYSE: UPS), and had run UPS’ vast international business.', 'Bozeman has begun to remake the C-suite, starting with a new CFO to replace Mike Zechmeister, who will retire by the end of May if a successor hasn’t been named by then. He is also pushing to improve productivity at the company’s North American Surface Transportation unit, by far its biggest operation, by 15% in 2023 and by 50% over the next three years. To do that, Bozeman has said he will embrace lean process strategies, uncommon among transport companies. Bozeman has created an office designed to support the company’s strategic initiatives to be run by Jim Reutlinger, a lean process expert.', 'In a statement to FreightWaves, C.H. Robinson acknowledged that it “could have done a better job managing costs” during the pandemic-driven market upcycle, when it brought on a lot of people and boosted its IT spending only to be saddled with excess expenses during the subsequent downturn. It added in the statement that the “strategies and productivity improvements currently being implemented, combined with our expert people and strong customer value proposition, are putting the company in a better and more competitive position.”', 'Bozeman had nothing to do with C.H. Robinson’s subpar performance over the past decade in a half. For that, there are any number of explanations. Founded in 1905, Robinson spent 92 years as a private company before going public in mid-1997. Not every deeply ingrained privately held culture is able to optimally adapt to the unfamiliar rigors of the public markets.', '“I’ve always contended that the worst thing they could have done was to go public,” said Jason H. Seidl, analyst at investment firm Cowen & Co.', 'C.H. Robinson’s first 10 or so years as a public firm were bountiful, mainly because it remained the go-to broker in a world where many carriers did not have in-house brokerage businesses. C.H. Robinson’s world began to change after asset-based carriers, realizing that the company was using their assets to call on their customers, and reaping big margins in the process, began to develop their own brokerage arms and in the process undercut C.H. Robinson on pricing. according to Seidl,', 'A source familiar with C.H. Robinson said the proliferation of asset-based brokerage divisions was part of the problem, but far from all of it. Pure-play truckload brokerages such as TQL, Arrive Logistics and Echo Global Logistics, have been around for 10 years or more and have managed to compete with C.H. Robinson and grow their truckload volumes over the past five years while Robinson’s traffic has stagnated or declined, the source said.', 'The rivals’ push into C.H. Robinson’s core business begs the hardest question of all, the source said. “If you’re not a truckload broker, then what are you doing,” the source said.', 'Part of the blame, the source said, lies with board governance. Four of the company’s 12 board members have served for 10 years or more, and must take some degree of responsibility for the company’s underperformance, the source said. Two board members were added in 2022 at the request of Ancora, which owns 2% of Robinson’s stock and has been pushing for changes within the enterprise.', 'The post At C.H. Robinson, it’s been a long, difficult trip appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

C.H. Robinson, this rejection is considered a victory for the brokerage industry.', 'In a long list of denials of certiorari posted Monday, the court without comment said it would not review the appeal brought by Ying Ye, the widow of a man killed in 2017 in an accident in Texas. Ye’s action against Global Sunrise was brought in Illinois, where the carrier is based. Ye won her lawsuit against Global Sunrise, being awarded $10 million in April 2022 in summary judgment handed down by the federal court.', 'Ye also attempted to bring freight broker GlobalTranz into the lawsuit, as it was GlobalTranz that hired Global Sunrise. But both the federal District court and an appeals court of the 7th Circuit rejected the claim, primarily by citing the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act (FAAAA). The FAAAA holds that a state may not take action that could impact a transportation “price, route or service.”', 'Ye then appealed to the Supreme Court, which rejected her attempt Monday.', 'There had been some rooting among the legal bar for the Supreme Court to take up the Ying Ye case, so as to settle the question over broker liability that remains unresolved given the Miller decision in the 9th Circuit. Not surprisingly, GlobalTranz, with a victory in hand, was not one of them.\xa0', '“Presumably, the court either determined that the circuit split was still too shallow or that the issue did not yet rise to the level of an issue of great public importance,” Marc Blubaugh, head of the transportation practice at the Benesch law firm, said in an email to FreightWaves.', 'The result means that there is no final settlement for now of whether a broker is liable under federal tort law for an action taken by a truck it hired. The issue is not restricted just to bodily injury; Landstar (NASDAQ: LSTR) last year won a case on appeal to the 11th circuit regarding its liability over the theft of a truck and its cargo that it had brokered, with the court finding the 3PL not liable.', 'But in the Miller v. Robinson case, coming out of a 2016 accident that left Alan Miller a quadriplegic, the 9th Circuit ultimately held that C.H. Robinson (NASDAQ: CHRW) was liable for hiring the trucking company involved in the crash. The 3PL giant took the case to the Supreme Court on appeal, but like in the Ying Ye case, certiorari was denied in June 2022.

Robinson liable. “The panel concluded that negligence claims against brokers, to the extent that they arise out of motor vehicle accidents, have the requisite ‘connection with’ motor vehicles,” the court wrote. “Therefore, the safety exception applied to plaintiff’s claim against C.H. Robinson.”', 'But the court’s certiorari denial means that federal courts not in a jurisdiction where the question of broker liability has largely been settled — like the 7th Circuit, where the Ying Ye case was tried, or the 11th, which ruled in the Landstar case — can turn to the Miller precedent from the 9th Circuit, a prospect the 3PL industry finds worrisome.', '“As a result, the application of the so-called ‘safety exception’ under the FAAAA will continue to play out in lower courts — both state courts and federal courts,” Blubaugh said. “Fortunately, from the freight brokerage industry perspective, the vast majority of lower courts are now adopting the well-reasoned approach of the 7th and 11th Circuits.”', 'Blubaugh cited a recent state court decision that went in favor of C.H. Robinson in an action brought by parents of a man killed in an accident in Florida. The truck had been hired by C.H. Robinson.', '“The FAAAA expressly preempts plaintiffs’ claim against freight broker C.H. Robinson in this case, and the claim does not fall within the FAAAA’s safety exception,” the court in Palm Beach County wrote, citing the 7th and 11th Circuit decisions.', 'In that case, Landstar is also a defendant, but it was acting as a motor carrier, not as a broker, so it was not involved in the question over the FAAAA.', 'More articles by John Kingston', 'Logistics M&A slower, but opportunities still there', 'Convoy autopsy continues; Panel sees capacity issues, lack of disclosure', 'The inside story of how GlobalTranz and Worldwide Express came together', 'The post Supreme Court rejects review in broker liability case, leaving the issue unresolved appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

Backed by fellow billionaire Ike Perlmutter, the ousted former head of Marvel Entertainment, Peltz claims that Disney’s failures have cost shareholders $70 billion over recent months.', 'Last week, the plot thickened when the media giant announced that\xa0investment firm ValueAct Capital supported its proposed slate of directors. Disney agreed to share information with the investor, which isn’t looking to nab board seats, essentially allowing the hedge fund to become an insider-outside advisor.', 'The conflict has so far attracted four activist investors, with ValueAct and Trian as the key players among them, operating with starkly different strategies. ValueAct is known as a quiet, collaborative, behind-the-scenes partner to companies under pressure, while Trian’s Peltz is considered loud and adversarial. In fact, Puck News just dubbed Peltz, Rasulo, and Perlmutter Hollywood’s “Villains of the Year.”', 'More drama may unfold before Disney’s general meeting, for which the company has not announced a date. In the meantime, governance experts share these takeaways from the action-packed situation:', ""—CEOs should not orchestrate succession planning. Remember that Iger returned to Disney after his chosen successor, Bob Chapek, failed, kicking off this latest round of governance battles, says Charles Elson, founding director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. Outgoing CEOs often pick successors for the wrong reasons, he adds, and Iger’s return and strong influence over the board underscore why an incumbent chief executive's opinions during the CEO search should be viewed as “interesting [and] informative, but not dispositive.”"", '— The strongest defense against an activist is an independent board. The key to protecting a company from proxy battles is having “independence, expertise, and strong and broad equity ownership on the part of the board,” says Elson. That’s because shareholders tend not to question whether a truly independent board is making honest decisions even when performance falters, he explains. As such, shareholders will be less likely to side with an activist who wants directors replaced. However, when both performance and governance are under pressure, which is the case with Disney, activist investors have the upper hand, says Elson, who believes\xa0Peltz has a “pretty good chance” of winning a seat.', ""—Activism is evolving. Some activists feel less beholden to the historical model of the vicious corporate raider, says Michael Useem, professor emeritus of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Many new generation activists—and some of the originals—will take a stance like ValueAct and say, “We're not here to be a thorn in your side. We're here to get value out of a stock [that] is not expressed in the stock price,” he explains. That may involve a fight for board seats, but it doesn’t have to."", '—Effective directors stay open to activists’ arguments. “What’s happening at Disney reconfirms that company directors must master the art of working with activists,” says Useem. Twenty years ago, he explains, a director’s knee-jerk reaction would be to “put out your stiff hand and tell activists to go away.” Today, wise directors need to know how to exercise independent judgment while acknowledging that activists often understand the company as well as they do.', 'Lila MacLellanlila.maclellan@fortune.com@lilamaclellan', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

The rule's impact extends beyond traditional sectors to the gig economy, affecting app-based delivery and ride-hailing services. The Chamber of Progress estimates a potential negative impact on approximately 3.4 million gig workers, resulting in $31 billion in lost income. Despite concerns raised by companies like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash, which fear disruptions to their business models, the rule is set to take effect on March 11.

While the lowest estimate indicates a decline of 31.8% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 68% upside.

That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable."", ""But, for FTI, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside."", ""Here's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price Targets"", 'According to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.', ""While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?"", 'They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.', ""However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces."", 'That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.', 'Why FTI Could Witness a Solid Upside', ""There has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher.

After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.4%, as two estimates have moved higher compared to no negative revision.', ""Moreover, FTI currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates.

In 2022, the gene-editing specialist earned approval for two therapies in the U.S.: Zynteglo, which treats the beta thalassemia (TDT) genetic blood condition, and Skysona, a treatment for cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD), an inherited disorder that attacks nerve sheaths in the brain. And last year, Bluebird Bio got the green light for yet another gene-editing treatment, Lyfgenia, which targets sickle cell disease (SCD).', ""The approval of Lyfgenia was particularly noteworthy because it boasts a target market that is exponentially larger than that of Zynteglo and Skysona combined. Despite this important development, there are severe issues with Bluebird Bio, specifically as it relates to its newest medicine, Lyfgenia. Let's consider two reasons it might not end up being the lifeline Bluebird hopes it will be."", ""There aren't many treatment options for SCD, so the approval for Lyfgenia should be welcome. It is a gene-editing therapy that rids patients of the disease after just one treatment course. However, Lyfgenia did not have an easy path to approval. It encountered several safety problems in clinical trials and was even put on clinical hold as a result of suspected adverse reactions."", ""Now that it is on the market, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has included a boxed warning for hematologic malignancy (blood cancer). This warning likely partly explains why Bluebird's shares dropped after the approval of Lyfgenia. Of course, it isn't a deal breaker for the therapy. The risk of blood cancer associated with it isn't that high; otherwise, it is unlikely that the FDA would have approved it in the first place."", ""Still, this isn't ideal for Bluebird and its newest gene-editing therapy."", ""Gene-editing treatments aren't known for being cheap. Bluebird's Zynteglo and Skysona cost $2.8 million and $3 million, respectively. Lyfgenia will go for even higher than that at $3.1 million. Now here is why that could be a problem: Lyfgenia isn't the only SCD gene-editing therapy that recently received FDA approval. Working in partnership together, Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics got the green light for a competing treatment called Casgevy."", ""However, Casgevy will cost just $2.2 million, and in addition, it does not come with a boxed warning\xa0for blood cancer. These factors put Bluebird at a bit of a disadvantage, and that's before considering the fact that Vertex Pharmaceuticals has an excellent track record of negotiating deals with third-party payers. Again, none of this means Lyfgenia won't be successful, but its chances would likely be higher otherwise."", 'The good news is that Bluebird Bio is making some progress despite these issues. The biotech has already signed two outcome-based reimbursement agreements. The SCD market in the U.S. is vast; Bluebird estimates that there are roughly 20,000 patients eligible for Lyfgenia, compared to a maximum total of 1,540 combined for Zynteglo and Skysona. At a price of $3.1 million, that adds up to an addressable market of $62 billion for Bluebird.', ""With the challenge from Vertex and CRISPR's Casgevy, Bluebird Bio won't capture this entire market, but it doesn't need to do that to be successful. The company currently sports a market cap of just $264 million. Even seizing a small fraction, say 10%, of its addressable market in the next five years could be a significant win for the company. However, a lot could go wrong for Bluebird."", ""It could run out of money, safety issues could force it to pull Lyfgenia off the market, or the challenge from Casgevy could prove too formidable. Bluebird Bio's shares have significantly lagged behind the market in the past few years for a reason: The company's stock looks too risky. That hasn't changed, and only those investors comfortable with elevated risk and volatility should consider initiating a small position.

SCD requires lifelong treatment and significant use of health care resources, and ultimately results in a reduced life expectancy, decreased quality of life and reduced lifetime earnings and productivity.

Shares of the beverage behemoth declined even as the S&P 500 rallied by 22%. Coke's 5% drop was enough to make it the sixth-worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average."", ""Still, 2024 could be much better for shareholders. Let's look at some big reasons for investors to like Coke's prospects for the year ahead."", 'Coke stock joined other Dow consumer staples giants like Procter & Gamble in losing ground last year. But the beverage leader is enjoying much stronger operating momentum. The big knock against P&G, after all, is that it has had to rely exclusively on higher prices to boost sales in 2023. Volumes declined in the most recent quarter as overall growth landed at 7%.', 'Compare that result with Coca-Cola, which posted an 11% jump in organic revenue last quarter thanks to a balance between rising prices and increased sales volumes. Coke won market share in its core on-the-go beverage niche and is finding plenty of growth in core areas like sparkling sodas and non-traditional beverages such as energy drinks, sports drinks, and waters. ""We delivered an overall solid quarter and are raising our full year ... guidance,"" CEO James Quincey told investors in late October.', 'Shareholders should also see their returns bolstered by more direct cash headed their way in 2024. Last quarter, Coke boosted its earnings outlook to call for an 8% increase for the full 2023 year. Gains might land even higher if cost inflation keeps moderating, as it did starting late last year.', ""That profit bounce should easily fund the company's next dividend increase, which is expected to be announced in mid-February. Coke has hiked its dividend in each of the last 60 years, including a 5% boost early last year."", ""The poor performance of the stock lately means investors get a higher yield from picking up Coke's shares today. You'll collect a 3.1% yield on top of any capital appreciation by purchasing Coca-Cola at today's prices. That's better than P&G's 2.5% yield and PepsiCo's 2.9% yield."", 'There\'s a good reason why the ""Dogs of the Dow"" strategy, which focuses on buying the worst performers of the Dow from the prior year, is so popular with investors. The Dow is packed with high-performing companies like Coca-Cola that have a good chance at bouncing back simply because they start the new year off at a discount. These weaker stocks tend to have higher dividend yields, too.', ""Investors can add a relatively cheap price to that list of reasons to like Coke's chances for 2024. Shares are trading at 5.7 times annual sales, down from the over 6 times sales that investors were paying in early 2023."", 'Sure, you could buy Pepsi for about half of that price. But a Coke investment comes with greater income, faster growth, and much higher profit margins than Pepsi. These stellar metrics should support better returns for investors holding this stock in 2024 and beyond.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Coca-Cola wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Many people (myself included) aim to collect more passive income in 2024. The more passive income you generate, the more financially independent you'll become. "", ""There are many ways to earn passive income. Investing in dividend stocks is one of the easiest ways. Many companies pay their investors a portion of their profits in dividends each quarter. Food stocks can be a great way to satisfy your income craving because many companies in the sector generate lots of steady cash flow, allowing them to pay higher-yielding dividends. Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC), Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), and Hershey's (NYSE: HSY) stand out for their tasty dividends."", ""Kraft Heinz currently offers a delicious 4.2% dividend yield. That's more than double the dividend yield of the S&P 500. Because of that, you'll collect a lot more dividend income each year from Kraft Heinz than you'd receive by investing in an S&P 500 index fund (which currently has a 1.5% dividend yield). For example, every $1,000 invested in Kraft Heinz would produce about $42 of annual dividend income compared to about $15 for a similar investment in an S&P 500 index fund. "", ""The company's portfolio of beloved food brands generates lots of cash flow. Kraft Heinz produced $2.6 billion in cash from operating activities through the third quarter of last year. That gave it money to pay dividends ($1.5 billion), invest in expanding its business ($779 million), and strengthen its balance sheet. The company's growing earnings and falling debt allowed it to reach its targeted leverage ratio by the end of Q3 (3.0 times). "", 'With its balance sheet back where Kraft Heinz wants it to be, its high-yielding dividend is on a firmer foundation. The company previously had to cut its dividend in early 2019 (from $0.625 per share each quarter to the current rate of $0.40 per quarter) to retain additional cash to strengthen its balance sheet. With that target achieved, Kraft Heinz is in a much better position to start growing its dividend again in the future. ', ""Coca-Cola's dividend can quench an investor's thirst for income and growth. The beverage giant has increased its dividend for 61 straight years, including by 4.6% in 2023. That puts it in the elite class of Dividend Kings, companies with 50 or more years of dividend increases. At the current stock price, Coca-Cola offers a 3.1% dividend yield, which is more than double the rate of the S&P 500. "", ""The company produces a torrent of cash flow. Its cash flow from operations totaled $8.9 billion through last year's Q3, up $861 million from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola produced $7.9 billion in free cash after funding capital expenses (up $636 million year over year), easily covering its dividend payments (about $4.1 billion). "", ""Coca-Cola expects its earnings and cash flow to continue rising. It's targeting 4% to 6% organic revenue growth over the long term, which should support 7% to 9% yearly earnings-per-share growth (90% to 95% of which it expects to convert into free cash flow). That growing free cash flow should enable Coca-Cola to continue increasing its dividend. "", ""Hershey's pays a sweet dividend. The snacking and confectionery company currently offers a 2.5%-yielding payout. While that's lower than the others on the list, Hershey's more than makes up for that with its growth. It gave investors a 15% raise last year and has increased its payout each year since 2010, growing it at a more than 10% compound annual rate. "", ""The company's strong and growing cash flow is a big driver of the rising dividend. Hershey's increased its cash flow from operations at a 13.3% compound annual rate from 2017 to 2022. It pays out about half that rapidly rising cash flow in dividends. That enables it to retain the other half to fund its growth (including making acquisitions), maintain a strong balance sheet, and opportunistically repurchase shares. "", ""The company expects its earnings and cash flow to continue rising in the future. It aims to deliver 6% to 8% annual earnings-per-share growth over the long term. With operating cash flow historically growing faster than earnings, Hershey's is in an excellent position to continue increasing its dividend at a healthy rate each year. "", ""Food companies tend to be very profitable. That enables them to generate enough cash to fund their growth while distributing a portion of their growing profits to investors via dividends. Kraft Heinz, Coca-Cola, and Hershey's pay tasty dividends, making them delicious options for those seeking to boost their income this year."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Kraft Heinz right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Kraft Heinz, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Kraft Heinz wasn't one of them.

He didn't become a billionaire overnight, but over time, he's built his own fortune and that of many others through his leadership of Berkshire Hathaway. As chairman, he's helped deliver a compounded annual gain of nearly 20% over 57 years -- that's compared to a 9.9% compounded increase for the S&P 500."", ""And that means it's no surprise investors far and wide look to Buffett for advice. Of course, most of us don't have billions of dollars to invest like Buffett, but here's the good news: We still can use some of the champion investor's techniques, and those techniques could lead us to investing success."", ""So if you want to follow in Buffett's footsteps this year and over time, do these three things."", ""Warren Buffett never invests in a company he doesn't understand. Why? Because you have to understand a company's business in order to predict whether it may grow market share, dominate in its industry -- or fall flat when faced with competition. Understanding the business also helps you determine whether that company will need to invest heavily, and in what areas, in the coming years and whether that particular company has what it takes to fund growth."", ""This may sound like an easy rule to follow, but sometimes it isn't. A certain stock or other asset -- like a cryptocurrency -- may soar over a period of days or weeks. And, out of a fear of missing out, investors want to get in on the action. It's at these times we should remind ourselves of these words from Buffett and consider whether we truly understand the business (or industry) before buying."", ""It's OK to miss out. Buffett does -- for instance, he hasn't been heavily present in the area of technology, which has well outperformed the general market over the past decade. Still, by investing in what he knows best, Buffett has managed to grow his portfolio significantly over the long haul. And you could do the same."", ""Dividend stocks generally won't deliver explosive growth in a short period of time, but they will offer you steady passive income year after year, which could add up to a big win over time. In 2022, Berkshire Hathaway's investment in Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) brought in $704 million in dividend payments -- up from $75 million back in the mid-1990s."", ""Of course, most of us don't have the ability to buy millions of shares in a company and earn a dividend of this size. But even a small purchase could offer you much-appreciated annual income you can collect -- or reinvest into that same stock to increase your position. It's a win-win situation."", ""To maximize your dividend growth potential, consider Dividend Kings, or companies that have lifted their dividends for at least 50 consecutive years. This shows their commitment to dividend growth, so there's reason to be optimistic they'll keep boosting these payments over time -- and that equals growing passive income for you."", 'Warren Buffett has said Berkshire\'s favorite holding period is ""forever."" I\'ll refer again to Coca-Cola, one of Buffett\'s favorite companies. He and his team started buying the shares in the late 1980s and have held on ever since.', ""As we've seen, Berkshire has benefited significantly from Coca-Cola dividends -- but also from the stock's performance over that time period. If Buffett sold the shares during some of the periods when performance stagnated, he would have missed out on the gains that followed."", ""So it's crucial to consider a company's long-term potential, and if prospects are strong, hold on even during times of general stock market weakness -- or when the company's industry temporarily falls out of favor with investors. For example, during economic rough patches, stocks linked to consumer spending may suffer even though some have what it takes to win over time."", ""To follow in Buffett's footsteps, don't be bothered by near-term trends and movements and instead remain focused on a company's ability to grow earnings over a period of years. If the future looks bright for this player, you'll want to stick with it -- and potentially win over the long term, just like Warren Buffett."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Coca-Cola wasn't one of them.

Combined, those turbines supply 22 percent of the electrical needs for those facilities.

The two projects combined will create 40.8 megawatts of renewable energy, bringing Whirlpool Corp. into the top 25 percent of companies on the Environmental Protection Agency's national Green Power Partnership list."", '""Our focus on sustainability goes back over 50 years, and these new onsite installations are a significant step toward achieving our net zero target by 2030 for our operations,"" said Pam Klyn, Whirlpool Corporation\'s executive vice president of corporate relations and sustainability.

Or did they? Adam Johnson, BullseyeBrief.com Portfolio Manager, joins for another edition of Good Buy or Goodbye.', 'Johnson points towards Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) as a Good Buy. He states that the company has a great focused portfolio, building very purpose-driven properties, developing only for life science companies like Big Pharma. Second, he describes the tenants as ""sticky,"" meaning they tend to stay in those properties for a long time. In addition, because of growth in the life sciences sector and long-lasting tenants, that equates to a stable cash flow.', 'Johnson points out SL Green Realty Corp (SLG) as a Goodbye. He explains that the company\'s portfolio is too focused on New York City, rather than spread across the country. In addition, the company has an inconsistent portfolio of properties, of which he considers many to be ""duds."" In fact, 10 of the company\'s buildings are in the ""Alt strategy"" category, which according to Johnson means they do not know what to truly do with them.', 'Click here to see more Good Buy or Goodbye or you can watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live here.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino"", '[MUSIC PLAYING]', 'JULIE HYMAN: It\'s a big noisy universe of stocks out there. Welcome to ""Good Buy or Goodbye."" And that\'s where we help you sift through that noise to figure out the best moves for your portfolio. Today we\'re focusing on real estate, which had a rocky year last year, a lot of debate about whether it indeed was a good investment and also debate about maybe it wasn\'t as monolithic as it looked here.', ""I want to bring in Adam Johnson now of Bullseye Brief. He is going to help us sift through this real estate sector today. So let's focus on real estate investment trusts. And let's kick it right off and look at your good buy, the stock you like here. It's Alexandria Real Estate here."", ""ADAM JOHNSON: I actually think it's a great buy, Julie, as opposed to the other."", 'JULIE HYMAN: A great buy.', 'ADAM JOHNSON: --as opposed to the other.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Are we going have to change the name of the segment?', 'ADAM JOHNSON: Great buy or get out of here. This is my great buy or good buy, as you like to say. A couple of bullet points just to give you acquainted with it-- focused. This company builds very specific purpose built real estate. They sell only, they develop only for the life sciences sector, so biotechnology companies, big biopharma companies.', ""It's very specialized. These companies need laboratories that's got to have the specialized HVAC, right, to get poisonous toxins out, all kinds of filtering. They like to have production spaces, so they can have all their meetings on stage. They do atriums. And this is key, Jules, they only build next to universities. So that there's already infrastructure there and a desire for it so--"", 'JULIE HYMAN: Interesting.', 'ADAM JOHNSON: Focused, purpose built.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Let's talk about the second part. And the tenants, you say, tend to stay there. There's not a lot-- we look at other parts of real estate, people move in, people move out. In this one, not necessarily the case?"", ""ADAM JOHNSON: No, because they are purpose built. In other words, Alexandria won't actually develop a property until it's already pre-leased by about 80%, right? So it's effectively already paid for. That's how they're able to get the loans and lock in the margin. So the tenants, once they ask Alexandria to build these properties for them, they stick around. It's very sticky."", 'JULIE HYMAN: OK. And then finally, you say that there is stable cash flow at this--', 'ADAM JOHNSON: Because of that stickiness. Yeah. And as a matter of fact, their occupancy right now, you probably find this surprising-- I certainly did until I ran the numbers-- 96%.', 'JULIE HYMAN: Wow.', ""ADAM JOHNSON: So for all the gloom and doom about real estate, 96% occupancy. And they're renewing leases at 6% increases. So I like ARE very much. I'm long and as are my clients."", ""JULIE HYMAN: OK. That's a good disclosure to have. We like to ask people what the risk to the potential bull case is. And here you say, could we see health care markets get crimped by regulation, for example?"", 'ADAM JOHNSON: Potentially. Yeah, I mean, if you just-- and again, we have to think big picture here. But if, in fact, the Washington steamroller were to really go after drug pricing-- I know they always say that during election years as they are right now. But if that actually were to gather momentum, then, in theory, that would crimp profits at some of these companies. And so they might not be able to spend the money on this premium real estate.', 'JULIE HYMAN: The other thing I would ask just briefly before we move on to the one that you would avoid is, what kind of growth is this company seeing? In other words, because--', 'ADAM JOHNSON: 6%, 7%, 8% annually.', ""JULIE HYMAN: OK. So we're not talking about huge leaps and bounds, of course, but a steady grower."", ""ADAM JOHNSON: A steady grower. And what attracted to me, you know, I run the Bullseye American Ingenuity Fund. There's a lot of technology. You don't usually think of real estate as ingenious, right? But the way they target the real estate, I think, is ingenious."", ""And I would also add that the stock was trading, oh, about six weeks ago, at a 10-year valuation low. You don't often see a high-quality company trade that low."", ""JULIE HYMAN: OK. So let's talk about the company that you want to avoid. And it is in the dreaded office space--"", ""ADAM JOHNSON: Wouldn't touch it, not with a 10-foot pole."", ""JULIE HYMAN: SL Green here, that's your goodbye. So let's run through it here. Concentrated in NYC, if I'm not mistaken, this is one of the, if not the largest REITs in New York City."", ""ADAM JOHNSON: Oh, it's the largest one, hands down. They own 59 properties here in New York City. That's part of the problem, Julie. I mean, this is the tip of the spear. If you talk about the problems with commercial real estate and office space and the fact that at least here in New York only about 53% of workers are back in the building, right?"", 'JULIE HYMAN: We know that anecdotally certainly.', ""ADAM JOHNSON: Yeah, yeah. So concentrated in New York, that's a big problem."", ""JULIE HYMAN: OK. Let's talk about problem number two for you, inconsistent property mix. What does that mean?"", ""ADAM JOHNSON: So on the one hand, SL Green has got some beautiful properties here. In fact, if you know One Vanderbilt right next to Grand Central, arguably, probably, the prettiest most impressive new building in New York City. The problem is that's only one, and they're long 59 buildings. And they've got some real duds, like the old Bear Stearns, 245 Park Avenue. A bunch of buildings, big blocky, clumsy concrete buildings on Third Avenue, what do you do with them? That's the problem. So it's an inconsistent property mix."", 'JULIE HYMAN: OK. And then thing number three here, 10 and 50 are an alt strategy.', ""ADAM JOHNSON: Yeah. Watch out. You remember back in 2008, Citibank had good bank, bad bank. They put all the bad assets in the bad bank. Well, they put 10 of their 50 buildings, 59 buildings in the alternate strategy portfolio. In other words, we don't know what to do with them. We can't sell them. We can't lease them. They're just sitting there. Do we repurpose them? Do we knock them down, develop, redevelop? So that's a concern that alt strategy group."", 'JULIE HYMAN: OK. So the risk to this downside case is everybody comes back.', ""ADAM JOHNSON: Yeah, everything's great. You know, right come back in, the water is fine. I mean, you look at the Wall Street bank CEOs, and they've all said you got to get back in, David Solomon at Goldman on and on. Jamie Dimon at JP Morgan, get back in the office. And actually, I'm a believer in that. Mentoring happens in the office. It doesn't happen when kids are at home, not working with peers or with seniors to show them the way it's done."", ""So if everybody comes back to work, OK, I guess I'll agree to be just fine. But it doesn't seem to be going that way."", ""JULIE HYMAN: It doesn't feel that way. And then we've got sort of a bonus chart, looking at these two companies and really comparing them here. When we talk about REITs occupancy is really important here, right, what percentage is the occupancy? And there's definitely a clear divide between these two guys."", ""ADAM JOHNSON: Oh, a clear divide. And by the way, hats off to your producers for making this chart, because this says it all, right? Occupancy at Alexandria Real Estate, 96%, versus SL Green, 89%. You know, you were saying earlier, you're surprised it's as high as 89. It sounds like it ought to be 78. But it's 89, fine."", ""Amount of debt, less than 20% of ARE's debt comes due in the next four years, whereas more than 60% of SL Green's debt comes due, so they've got this debt problem. They're going to have to refinance. And obviously, rates are higher. And, by the way, half of the debt at SL Green is floating rate."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Oh, dear.', ""ADAM JOHNSON: So they get squeezed on both fronts. And then you just look at sentiment, the way the Street is looking at these stocks. 12 buys on ARE, no holds, only one sell. And that's a recent one versus 4, 7, and 7. So the Street doesn't like-- I don't like SL Green, the Street doesn't like SL Green. And you got to respect that kind of sentiment."", ""I tend to be a contrarian, but not when it comes to SL Green. This is one where I agree with the Street, I agree with the market's view. And I don't want to touch it. But ARE, another story."", ""JULIE HYMAN: OK. Adam, I'm going to recap, if I can, what we have talked about today. So you're saying by Alexandria Real Estate based on that focused portfolio, the loyal customer base, positive cash flow. On the other side, you say avoid SL Green at all costs based on its not-so-diverse portfolio of buildings here in New York City, high debt, low occupancy. Adam Johnson, what a pleasure to see you--"", 'JULIE HYMAN: Great being with you, Julie Hyman.', 'JULIE HYMAN: --and be on TV with you once again.']"

A closer look suggests a bearish view for American Airlines and a neutral view for United.', 'Both companies are among the largest U.S.-based airlines, each with a nearly 100-year history. Shares of American Airlines are down 4% over the last year after rallying 19% over the last three months. United Airlines stock is off 6% over the last year, although it has bounced only 7% over the last three months.', 'With such a significant difference in their three-month rallies, it should come as no surprise that AAL is trading at a higher valuation than UAL. We’ll compare their price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios to gauge their valuations against each other and against that of their industry.', 'For comparison, the U.S. airline industry is trading at a P/E of 14. Over the last three years, the industry lost money due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so there is no three-year average P/E to consider.', 'At a P/E of 6.0, American Airlines is trading at a steep discount to its industry but slightly higher than United. Unfortunately, American Airlines swung to a loss during the third quarter, suggesting a bearish view might be appropriate despite the discounted price.', 'During the third quarter, American Airlines reported losses of $545 million as its revenue remained flat year-over-year while its expenses rose. The company also slashed its full-year adjusted earnings guidance to a new range of $2.25 to $2.50 per share versus its previous projection of between $3 and $3.75 per share.', 'While American Airlines swung to a net loss in the third quarter, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) both reported increasing revenues and profits of about $1.1 billion for the quarter. American Airlines’ management blamed the third-quarter loss on higher fuel prices and the new contract with its pilots, which added more than $9 billion in additional benefits and compensation.', 'Given that United and Delta both generated solid third-quarter results despite those industry-wide challenges, it’s clear that American Airlines’ financial position is not as strong. The fourth-quarter earnings report due later this month should provide an important update on the airline’s financial condition.', 'However, its long-term stock-price losses and recent loss suggest this might not be a stock worth holding in the near term in anticipation of an eventual recovery.', 'American Airlines has a Hold consensus rating based on three Buys, seven Holds, and one Sell rating assigned over the last three months. At $14.68, the average American Airlines stock price target implies upside potential of 2.1%.', 'At a P/E of 5.0, United Airlines is trading at a steep discount to its industry and at a discount to AAL. However, United is clearly in a better financial position than American Airlines, and its stock price has held up much better over the long term. Thus, a bullish view seems appropriate, albeit with a warning about the risks of owning these shares.', 'For the third quarter, United reported a 12.5% year-over-year increase in revenue to $14.5 billion, with $1.1 billion in net profits, indicating continued strength. However, it did cut its guidance and issue warnings about rising fuel prices and the suspension of flights to Israel amid the war there. As such, Wall Street now seems to have priced in those concerns, as the consensus for adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter now stands at $1.70 per share.', 'What’s particularly interesting about United Airlines is its long-term stock-price action. The entire travel industry sold off hard in the early days of the pandemic as the whole world shut down and borders were closed. As a result, UAL and AAL both saw their stock prices plummet in early 2020, sending ripple effects throughout their past stock-price action.', 'However, United shares are roughly flat over the last three years and off 47% over the last five years, indicating that they haven’t recovered since the early 2020 sell-off. Additionally, the stock is down only 4% over the last decade.', 'Thus, since United Airlines has held up better than American Airlines, both recently in terms of profits and over the long term, this could be a good time to buy a few shares. However, the fourth-quarter earnings release could change this view, depending on what it shows.', 'United Airlines has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 11 Buys, five Holds, and one Sell rating assigned over the last three months. At $60.67, the average United Airlines stock price target implies upside potential of 39.3%.', 'The last few years have not been easy for airlines, but United is clearly in a much better position than American Airlines based on recent profits. Additionally, UAL’s stock price has held up far better than AAL’s over the last 10 years, with United off only 4% and American down 46%.', 'As a result, this could be a good time to buy the dip in United Airlines in hopes of a full recovery from the pandemic, although investors may want to keep the position small for now due to the high risk associated with the stock. There’s no guarantee that the tough times are over, but the risk-reward profile looks attractive now.', 'Disclosure']"

American Airlines Group is still a bargain right now according to our price multiple model, which compares the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, we’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. we find that American Airlines Group’s ratio of 5.93x is below its peer average of 10.54x, which indicates the stock is trading at a lower price compared to the Airlines industry. However, given that American Airlines Group’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility."", ""Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. American Airlines Group's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 73%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value."", 'Are you a shareholder? Since AAL is currently below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current price multiple.', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on AAL for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future profit outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy AAL. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed assessment.', ""With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for American Airlines Group (of which 2 are concerning!) you should know about."", 'If you are no longer interested in American Airlines Group, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.', 'Have feedback on this article?

It’s an opportunity if you are a rare graphite processing company with operations in both the U.S. and China.', 'One of the biggest news pieces on the graphite scene since Beijing’s export restrictions was a\xa0proposed SPAC deal in December 2023\xa0that could see\xa0Graphex Group (NYSE American: GRFX), with a market cap of $40 million, sell its USA processing business for between $100 million and $200 million. The USA processing business would be spun off as a separate Nasdaq listing.', 'Graphex isn’t a cash-guzzling mining operation with years-long exploration processes to get through: The USA spinoff will be processing graphite—a first in the country—and that’s where some 85% of the graphite profit is. The company is now moving forward quickly with design and equipment selection for its flagship Detroit graphite processing plant and the hunt is on for additional locations, with major JV and offtake deals apparently underway.', 'Beijing’s market-dominating move has also helped strengthen Graphex China’s operations in East Asia, where output is now expected to triple by the first quarter of 2025.', 'Led by veteran energy sector leader\xa0John DeMaio, Graphex USA is leading a SPAC deal that not only awards shareholders through a buyout worth multiples of the current market capitalization but also gives investors exposure to the most critical supply line for North America’s massive EV push.', 'On December 6,\xa0Graphex Group (NYSE American: GRFX)\xa0and its wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary,\xa0Graphex Technologies, LLC entered into a Letter of Intent (LOI) with an independent NASDAQ-listed blank check company to acquire 100% of the equity interest of Graphex Tech.\xa0', 'The pre-money enterprise value, net of liabilities, for Graphex Tech is anticipated to be between $100 million and $200 million in a deal that is set to close in the first half of 2024.', 'This is a US-based company that is building its first graphite processing plant in Detroit, Michigan, and is now on the hunt for more locations across the U.S. and Canada.', ""It's also in advanced and late-stage testing with the auto industry, battery manufacturers, and OEMs (original equipment manufacturers). And it already has JVs and offtake deals with non-Chinese entities that meet the strict compliance requirements set down by the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)."", 'And it’s a critical metals segment that will play a huge role in defining North American security and the energy transition.', 'Graphite is the biggest—and most critical--component in any lithium-ion battery. It makes up 95-99% of the anode (negative electrode). The average lithium-ion battery contains 15X more graphite than lithium, and for lithium, North America already has a much clearer path to supply not dominated by China.', 'North America\xa0has zero commercial production of refined graphite.', 'Graphex could end up being the first to domesticate this supply chain.', 'Right now, it’s in the final stages of the construction of its 15,000-ton-per-annum graphite refining facility in Detroit--the heart of America’s auto industry. First production is expected in the first quarter of 2025.', 'The Safe China Exposure', 'The team at\xa0Graphex Group (NYSE American: GRFX)\xa0has over a decade of experience processing graphite in Asia.

And that’s exactly where Graphex USA is focusing. There won’t be any mining overhead expenses--\xa0just multi-source, IRA-compliant graphite processing capabilities.', 'By the third quarter of 2024, Graphex Asia aims to double its graphite production from 10,000 metric tons per year to 20,000 metric tons per year. By the first quarter of 2025, the company aims to triple this to 30,000 metric tons, with bank financing already approved for the production ramp-up. And they are hoping to get ~$5500 per metric ton for that graphite.', 'And back on the home front in North America, Graphex believes it has multiple raw graphite supply deals lined up to feed its Detroit processing plant—along with other proposed new plants as they come online--in accordance with the IRA sourcing requirements for North American supply that doesn’t come from China.', 'Late last year, Graphex entered into an LOI with Northern Graphite Corporation (TSXV:NGC) for raw material supply, and signed an MOU with Reforme Group Pty Ltd. And in January this year, they joined forces with Northern Graphite to build a\xa0large-scale graphite processing facility\xa0in Quebec’s Baie-Comeau region. The partners are now evaluating\xa0sites to house a facility that could produce up to 200,000 tons of graphite annually. They also have an LOI with Canada-based Gratomic for raw graphite to evaluate building.', 'Then, in August this year, they signed the biggest supply deal yet with\xa0Syrah Resources’ Balama graphite operation in Mozambique, the largest in existence outside of China, with a production capacity of 350,000 metric tons per year.', 'Source: Syrah Resources', 'Both Mozambique and Tanzania are poised to become major graphite miners, home to the fifth- and sixth-largest graphite reserves in the world, respectively.', 'With Beijing’s restrictions on graphite exports, Graphex represents an interesting way for non-Chinese investors to gain exposure to the China graphite market. Graphex Asia already has the necessary export licenses.', 'In 2021, China only housed some 22% of global graphite reserves, yet it produced over 79% of the world’s supply because of its processing power. That same year, the U.S. was 100% reliant on foreign sources of processed graphite, one-third of which came from China.\xa0 Graphex Group (NYSE American: GRFX) is North America’s first chance at diversifying this supply with an unprecedented domestic solution.', 'Other miners to keep an eye on in 2024:', ""Compass Minerals International (NYSE: CMP), based in Overland Park, Kansas, is a leading provider of essential minerals, including salt, sulfate of potash, magnesium chloride, and even\xa0sustainable lithium.

Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher.

The sector is famous for dynamic, growth-oriented companies that are big on promise, but often lack the consistent profits and free cash flow necessary to fund big dividends."", ""However, there are many tech stocks that pay dividends. Let's look at three that income-oriented investors should consider."", ""First up is International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM). To start, let's acknowledge that IBM has long been a laggard within the tech industry. Indeed, over the last 10 years, IBM's revenue declined by 38%, and its share price fell by 13% over the same period."", ""Yet IBM's massive dividend -- the stock currently boasts a dividend yield of 4.2% -- has ridden to the rescue over the past decade. The stock's total return (which includes dividend payments) is a far more respectable 36%, with almost all of that gain coming over the last 12 months."", 'IBM Total Return Level data by YCharts', ""What's more, the company's long-promised strategic shift finally appears to be paying off. Revenue increased 20% over the last three years, as the company welcomed numerous partnerships in the lucrative cloud services sector."", ""Granted, IBM stock does have one weakness that could turn off some investors: its valuation. Shares trade at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21x, placing it on the upper end of the range for the value-oriented investor. That said, other valuation measures are more favorable. The company's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, for example, is 2.4x -- far more reasonable, and, in fact, cheaper than some other legacy tech stocks."", 'At any rate, dividend-seeking investors should keep IBM in mind due to its fat dividend and revitalized revenue growth.', 'Next is AT&T (NYSE: T). Like IBM, AT&T has also relied on a massive dividend to compensate for its sinking stock price. Shares of AT&T currently trade for less than $18/share, down more than 34% from where they traded in 2014.', ""However, AT&T's fat dividend has more than made up the difference. The stock's total return over the last 10 years is a gain of 40%. "", 'T Total Return Level data by YCharts', ""Currently, AT&T pays a dividend of $1.11/share, which equates to a dividend yield of 6.4%. That's one of the biggest dividend yields within the tech sector."", 'True, AT&T did slash its dividend in 2022 for the first time in 35 years. However, that move -- while painful -- has paid off. The company has paid down more than $30 billion in long-term debt since the dividend cut, bringing its total long-term debt to $133 billion. ', ""While that's still a ton of debt, AT&T is now in a far better position to service that debt with its almost $20 billion in annual free cash flow. In short, the company's big dividend looks safe. "", 'As for valuation, AT&T shares boast a tiny price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of only 7, making the stock quite attractive to value-oriented investors.', ""Last is Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO). This Web 1.0 giant is more than just alive and kicking -- it's thriving. The company, which designs and makes networking products, generated $13.6 billion in net income on $58 billion in revenue over the last 12 months."", "" Moreover, the company's free cash flow -- the lifeblood that makes hefty dividends possible -- increased to $16.3 billion. Speaking of its dividend, Cisco pays $1.56/share, good for a 3.1% dividend yield -- not at all shabby, and more than double the S&P 500 average of 1.4%."", ""What's more, Cisco isn't just a cash cow; the company is still growing at an impressive rate. Cisco grew revenue by 21% over the last 10 years, and free cash flow has surged by 53% over the same period."", 'CSCO Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts', ""Better still, value-oriented investors need not fret. Cisco's P/E multiple of 13x makes it far cheaper than the S&P 500 average (24.6x)."", 'In short, investors can get good value, and an attractive dividend from a company that is growing handsomely. All that makes Cisco a must-know name for income investors looking for a solid dividend-paying tech stock.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in AT&T right now?', 'Before you buy stock in AT&T, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and AT&T wasn't one of them.

Simultaneously, oil prices witnessed a robust rebound. The S&P 500 saw a continuation of losses for the current year, with the technology segment facing downward pressure. This trend was accentuated by Samsung Electronics Co. announcing its sixth consecutive quarter of declining operating profit, contributing to the overall unease in the tech shares. However, amid this scenario, Juniper Networks Inc. saw a notable surge in its stock value. This uptick was reportedly fueled by speculation that the company was in advanced discussions regarding a potential acquisition by Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. The intricacies of the market dynamics were further highlighted by fluctuations in Treasury 10-year yields, surpassing the 4% threshold. These movements added an element of uncertainty to the broader market sentiment. In the oil sector, prices showcased resilience as they staged a strong rebound, marking a considerable shift in a wide-ranging trajectory. Amidst these developments, HSBC expressed caution, suggesting that the Goldilocks scenario, characterized by an optimal economic environment, might undergo a reversal. The bank pointed out concerns that market expectations around the Federal Reserve's actions might be overstated, contributing to the cautious sentiment prevailing in financial markets. In summary, the day's market wrap unfolded against a backdrop of varied movements, with technology stocks facing headwinds, oil prices displaying resilience, and broader market sentiments swayed by uncertainties in Treasury yields and potential shifts in economic scenarios as noted by HSBC."", ""The Biden administration recently introduced a rule via the U.S. Department of Labor, compelling companies to classify certain workers as employees rather than independent contractors, reported Reuters. Issued on January 9, the rule is anticipated to increase labor costs in industries relying on contract labor and freelancers. Business groups and Republican lawmakers criticized the rule, citing concerns about job losses and potential litigation. It replaces a Trump-era regulation and is expected to face legal challenges. The rule's impact extends beyond traditional sectors to the gig economy, affecting app-based delivery and ride-hailing services. The Chamber of Progress estimates a potential negative impact on approximately 3.4 million gig workers, resulting in $31 billion in lost income. Despite concerns raised by companies like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash, which fear disruptions to their business models, the rule is set to take effect on March 11. The Labor Department will consider various factors in determining a worker's classification, but business groups argue that the extensive list may lead to confusion and inconsistent results, potentially sparking costly class-action lawsuits alleging misclassification."", 'In financial markets, notable equities such as Citigroup Inc.

As of the closing bell on January 8, Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) experienced a modest change in its stock price, showing a commendable +1.14% increase in response to Brackett's downgrade.

This allows American Express to earn greater economics than peers on each card transaction.

Over time, these investments have helped American Express build its brand and attract more lucrative, high-spending card customers. We expect this business model and customer-centric approach will continue to drive industry-leading growth for years to come. Concerns over the near-term economic outlook allowed us to purchase shares of American Express at a 13x P/E on next year’s consensus earnings estimate.
