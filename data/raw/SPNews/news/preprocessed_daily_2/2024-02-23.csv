Verisk Analytics, Inc. isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).', ""Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. Currently, all participants are in listen-only mode. After today's prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, where we will limit participants to one question so that we can allow everyone to ask a question. We will have further instructions for you at that time. For opening remarks and introduction, I would now like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead."", ""Stacey Brodbar: Thank you, operator and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-K can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including those related to our financial guidance."", ""Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Finally, I'd also like to remind everyone that the financial results for recent dispositions are included in our consolidated and GAAP results but are excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures. A reconciliation of reported and historic non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call is provided in our 8-K and today's earnings presentation posted on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. However, we are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable expected GAAP results because of the unreasonably effort and high unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from projected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gains and losses from dispositions and other non-recurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant."", ""And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Lee Shavel."", ""Lee Shavel: Thank you, Stacey. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in this morning's call. I am pleased to be here today to recap what was an exceptional year for Verisk, marked by strategic, organizational and cultural change matched with outstanding financial performance and value creation for clients and shareholders alike. Elizabeth will provide the financial detail but in summary, we delivered 8.7% organic constant currency revenue growth in 2023, the strongest performance on record since our initial public offering back in 2009. And we exceeded the expectations we set at Investor Day in March. We combine this with double-digit organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth and 150 basis points of margin expansion on an Insurance-only basis, achieving the low end of the initial margin improvement goal of 300 basis points one year earlier than our original target of 2024."", ""And we have plans in place to build on that in 2024 and beyond. Despite the separation of our non-Insurance business, we still grew free cash flow 6% to over $800 million and above our 2022 level on an unadjusted basis. Over the past two years, we demonstrated capital discipline by returning over $4 billion in proceeds from recent dispositions, to shareholders through share repurchases reducing our share base by about 10%. This also served to substantially improve our capital efficiency, and boost our returns on invested capital. And while our strong 2023 revenue growth was exceptional, the long-term opportunity of addressing our clients' most pressing needs, gives me confidence in our strategy to drive consistent and predictable growth in 2024 and beyond."", 'The insurance industry backdrop in which we are operating, is relatively comparable to 2023. Insurance carriers continue to deal, with cyclical challenges on profitability resulting from higher losses and the lagging effects of inflation, by restricting new business in profit-challenged markets. The most recent AM Best data shows losses for the first nine months of 2023 were $32.2 billion, a further deterioration from the $24.5 billion in net losses recorded through the first six months of the year and tracking way ahead of the pace of losses in 2022. This caused AM Best to downgrade their outlook for the homeowners line from stable to negative, while also maintaining their negative outlook on personal auto. To some extent, profitability challenges in the industry were the result of higher catastrophe-related losses.', 'Our own PCS data, points out that 2023 was the highest year on record for frequency of catastrophe activity, with 74 events. While 2023, did not have a major tropical hurricane make US landfall, wind and severe convective storms were dominant and the major source of events in the year. That said, the fourth quarter of 2023 was a relatively quiet period with only seven events, and was lower than the fourth quarter of 2022, which experienced 13 events. On the more positive end, carriers are having success raising rates and driving premium growth and are taking the very early steps in certain lines to unwind restrictions on writing new business, as they achieve rate adequacy. In fact, net written premium growth increased 10.8% for the first nine months of 2023.', ""More structurally, the insurance industry continues to be challenged by the rapid pace of technological change including, digitalization and cloud migration. This is being compounded by the fact, that the industry also faces technological debt and aging legacy systems. In addition, the industry continues to experience growing regulatory focus on issues of data privacy, fairness and climate risk. Our business model and strategy are designed to address our customers' most pressing needs, both from a cyclical and structural perspective. We invest on behalf of the industry, applying our industry knowledge and technical expertise at scale, to deliver value to our clients at a lower cost of investment and ownership than any one participant can achieve individually."", 'As we work with our clients on a more integrated basis, the opportunities to develop new solutions expands. We are focused on the three key priorities, we articulated back at Investor Day namely, delivering consistent and predictable top line growth, driving operating efficiency and profitability and ensuring disciplined capital allocation. Let me spend a few minutes on how we plan to go after each in 2024 and beyond. Our first priority is delivering consistent and predictable growth, through strategic dialogue with clients in innovation. Throughout 2023, we made substantial progress on our initiative to elevate the strategic dialogue with our clients, and to become their strategic data analytic and technology partner. During the year, I met with over three dozen client CEOs and senior leaders representing over half of the US property and casualty insurance industry direct written premium to discuss how we could better support their objectives.', 'Three primary themes came up repeatedly. How can you accelerate and expand the delivery of data and analytics to our organization? How can Verisk augment the capabilities of our colleagues to improve their ability to manage the amount of information they receive? And finally, how can Verisk help better connect the ecosystems we operate in to improve our efficiency. On the acceleration point, we are intensively addressing this opportunity across our businesses, but perhaps most significantly in our Core Lines Reimagine project to reengineer how we deliver our core data sets and analytics to meet the rapidly evolving ingestion demands of our clients. Prospectively, we see the application of low no-code and micro services technology that we have successfully deployed in the life insurance industry, having material significance to the property and casualty segment and have been working with clients on testing applications.', 'On augmentation, we have already been applying generative AI technology through our Discovery Navigator solution to dramatically accelerate the summarization of large and complex medical files in our casualty business. Prospectively, we have been developing and working with clients to refine several augmented underwriting applications. On connectivity, we have been investing in our Xactware platform to support the integration of more ecosystem and partners. Last week, I attended our Elevate Conference in Salt Lake City, which had record attendance from our insurance contractor, adjuster clients, and over 30 ecosystem partners. Both clients and partners expressed enthusiasm for our delivery of improved connectivity and efficiency, demonstrating the network potential of this business.', ""Finally, on connectivity, we were thrilled at last week's announcement of Marsh's expansion of its digital trading initiative on the Verisk Whitespace platform. This builds on a successful pilot in 2023, which traded over $400 million in premium and is a gratifying endorsement by a world-leading insurance broker that should draw more participation onto a data-first platform that will drive greater efficiency for the market. With expansion across its UK specialty and international placement business, Marsh anticipates that over 90% of all client premium in that segment will flow through the platform by the end of 2024. Our strategic conversations are also helping to drive more informed innovation. In our conversations with clients, we repeatedly hear about the increasing regulatory focus and reporting requirements on fairness and unfair discrimination."", ""To address this need during the fourth quarter, we launched FairCheck, a solution designed to address issues of fairness and discrimination in the underwriting process. FairCheck helps insurers test their personal lines' models and variables to respond to regulatory change and to evaluate and mitigate the potential for unfairly discriminatory outcomes. This solution is an extension of the work we did internally to assess Verisk's own personal auto rating model, to determine whether there were unfair pricing outcomes regarding race. We recently signed a national property and casualty carrier to be our first customer. Internally during 2023, we worked with an outside consultant to sharpen our go-to-market strategy and are implementing the first steps of this changed approach in 2024."", 'This includes an investment behind sales effectiveness, incorporating a change to the composition of incentives to be more in line with industry best practices. In addition, we have identified pricing and packaging opportunities within property estimating solutions and extreme event solutions. And we will be bringing them to market throughout this year. Our second priority from Investor Day is driving operating efficiency and profitability. We remain committed to driving operating efficiency and margin expansion over time. We are leaning into our global talent optimization initiative, tapping into the talent-rich and low-cost markets like Krakow Poland and Hyderabad India. We have recently expanded our real estate footprint in both markets to support our growth.', 'Additionally, we should continue to achieve savings as we modernize and optimize our technology infrastructure across all our legacy systems, including our internal financial and human capital ERP upgrade, which is underway and which should start delivering early efficiency benefits in 2025 with the full impact to be achieved in two to three years. As we look out, we see opportunity in improving our operational efficiency by careful reviews of our workflow and processes. We will continue to deploy our Lean Six Sigma program to drive additional savings and continue to focus on our organizational structure and efficiency. And finally, our third priority is disciplined capital allocation. Disciplined capital allocation underscores all our decision-making at Verisk.', 'We invest our strong free cash flow into value-creating opportunities that support growth with attractive returns. Excess capital is returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In 2023, our return on invested capital was approximately 26% with incremental returns on capital at approximately 19%, as continue to invest our capital at high internal rates of return. We are excited about the many opportunities we have to invest across our business in emerging technologies, including generative AI, low no-code applications and international expansion. We also are investing behind upgrades and re-platforming of our core solutions, some of which have been underinvested and need modernization to support future innovation. The most notable example is our Core Lines Reimagine project.', 'As we highlighted before, we are about one-third of the way through this project from an investment perspective and we are engaging our clients as we plan for customer-facing modules launching in 2024. While there is still much work to be done, we are already driving returns through strong contract renewals with our largest customers, as they recognize the value of the program. We are also investing in modernizing our property estimating solutions platform to advance our strategic goal of creating a more open ecosystem that is resilient, redundant and available for all stakeholders. We are simplifying partner integration and developing new services to enable deeper workflow integration, richer solutions and better client services. This initiative should increase our agility and create a more dynamic work environment for both our clients and our development teams.', 'We are also excited about the opportunities to continue to create incremental value in our insurance related acquisitions. For example, in claims, we are driving growth and synergies in our three recent acquisitions in Germany, where we have a leading market position in the bodily injury space and are adding services and technology offerings in the auto and property spaces through the acquisitions of ACTINEO, Krug and Rocket respectively. These acquisitions enable us to deliver solutions and add value to our German customers across the entire claims life cycle. Before we close, I want to address the recent leadership announcements naming three new business leaders to the Verisk Senior Operating Committee. Rob Newbold was named President, Extreme Events taking over the reins from Bill Churney who retired at the end of the year.', ""And Doug Caccese and Saurabh Khemka, who are recently named Co-Presidents of Underwriting Solutions replacing Neil Spector who has moved into a strategic advisory role. All three leaders are evidence of our deeply talented management bench and focused leadership development and succession planning process. I want to thank both Bill and Neil for their many contributions to Verisk and to me personally as I stepped into the role of CEO. And while we will miss them, they have left their business in the very capable hands of talented, experienced and energized leaders. 2023 was a demonstration of Verisk's evolving culture. We delivered strong financial success, while absorbing organizational and leadership change. And I am excited about having the fresh perspective and energy of these three leaders as we move into 2024."", ""With that, I'll hand it over to Elizabeth to review our financial results."", 'Elizabeth Mann : Thanks Lee, and good day to everyone on the call. I am pleased to share that Verisk delivered a solid fourth quarter capping off an outstanding 2023. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, fourth quarter revenue was $677 million, up 7.4% versus the prior year, reflecting solid growth in underwriting and more modest growth in claims. Income from continuing operations was $182 million, down 15.5% versus the prior year, while diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.25, down 8.8% versus the prior year. The year-over-year decline in both measures were primarily due to a $19 million litigation reserve expense related to our former Financial Services segment that was previously sold, alongside a one-time tax benefit of $30 million, or $0.19 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022.', 'Additionally, elevated depreciation and amortization expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023, resulting from the completion and implementation of certain large internally developed software projects during the year, also contributed to the decrease. These factors were partially offset by strong revenue growth, lower net interest expense and the benefit from our accelerated share repurchase program. Moving to our organic constant currency results. Adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, our operating results demonstrated solid growth for most of our businesses. In the fourth quarter, OCC revenues grew 6% with growth of 7.3% in underwriting, and 2.8% in claims. Normalizing for the $5.6 million in storm-related revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022, total OCC revenue growth would have been 6.9% and claims OCC revenue growth would have been 6.0%.', 'As expected and as we highlighted in prior quarters, some of the environmental trends recorded elevated growth earlier in the year began to normalize in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we did begin to overlap tougher comparisons in many of our businesses. That said, 2023 was a record year for Verisk, with total OCC revenue growth of 8.7%, driven by strong growth of 8.5% in underwriting and 9.3% in claims. Growth for the full year was broad-based with almost all businesses delivering better-than-expected results. Throughout 2023, our increased focus on the Insurance business and our energized organization, capitalized on three key industry and environmental trends to amplify our growth. These trends included, the pricing environment, resulting from the hard insurance market, the high transaction activity, driven by elevated shopping activity for auto insurance and the active US weather patterns that Lee highlighted.', 'Our subscription revenues, which comprise 80% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 7.3% on an OCC basis during the fourth quarter, with growth in almost all our subscription-based solutions. The drivers of growth we experienced in the quarter were consistent with trends we saw throughout 2023. More specifically during the quarter, we experienced the continued benefit on certain of our revenues from the stronger net premium growth in 2021, which is currently reflected in some of our contract pricing. In anti-fraud, we saw underlying strength in the business with growth augmented by the continued benefit from the conversion to subscription from previously transactional customers through our claims essential bundle. That said, we have started to anniversary the benefit we experienced from these conversions and are expecting the benefit from this transition to continue to moderate in 2024.', 'These strengths were offset in part by continued weakness within Verisk Marketing Solutions and a more normalized level of attrition across the business, including some reduction in the level of contractor activity, due to the weather and some pressure within our Insurtech customer segment. Our transactional revenues, representing 20% of total revenue in the fourth quarter, increased a modest 0.8% on an OCC basis, reflecting a tough comparison versus the prior year, which included revenues associated with Hurricane Ian. Adjusting for the storm impact, transactional revenue growth would have been 4.1%. During the quarter, we continued to see strong results from our auto solutions, driven by healthy consumer shopping activity and the final quarter of benefit from the large nonrate action deal we signed for 2023.', 'We have begun to overlap the positive inflection in shopping behavior from last year and are expecting growth to moderate in 2024. Our transactional revenue growth also benefited from double-digit growth within life insurance solutions, as we are seeing strong customer demand for incremental services. And within our extreme events business, we saw better-than-expected transactional growth driven by securitizations. Moving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 6.5% in the fourth quarter, while total adjusted EBITDA, margin which includes both organic and inorganic results was 53.4%, up 70 basis points from the reported results in the prior year. The fourth quarter margin rate reflects the positive impact of sales leverage, cost discipline and foreign currency changes.', 'This was offset in part by margin pressure from higher incentive compensation, acquisitions and organic investments for future growth. 2023 was a year of tremendous growth and efficiency for Verisk as evidenced by total OCC adjusted EBITDA growth of 11.5%, while total adjusted EBITDA margin was 53.5%, up 150 basis points from the prior year. This margin rate reflects core operating leverage from the strong revenue growth and cost discipline across the organization. As Lee discussed earlier, delivering operational efficiency and profitability remains a key priority for us as we move forward into 2024 and beyond. We have confidence we can continue to make further progress, while also balancing investments to support future growth. Continuing down the income statement, net interest expense was $28 million for the fourth quarter compared to $41 million in the prior year.', 'The current level of net interest expense reflects lower year-over-year debt balances as well as higher interest on cash balances. Depreciation and amortization of fixed assets was $68 million for the quarter, an increase of 57%. The increase was primarily driven by an additional $23 million of expense related to the timing of certain large internally developed software projects that were completed and placed into service during the year. On taxes our reported effective tax rate was 24.9% compared to 9.9% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year increase in the tax rate is related to the one-time tax benefit of $30 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and a $19 million litigation reserve taken in the fourth quarter 2023 that we mentioned earlier.', 'Adjusted net income decreased 9.3% to $204 million and diluted adjusted EPS decreased 2.1% to $1.40 for the fourth quarter. These changes reflect the negative impact from the one-time tax benefit in the prior year quarter and higher depreciation and amortization expenses, partially offset by solid revenue and EBITDA growth lower net interest expense and a lower average share count. The share count reflects the impact of the additional $250 million of share repurchases executed in the fourth quarter as well as the final settlement of our $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase plan that we entered into in March. From a cash flow perspective, on a reported basis net cash from operating activities increased 1.4% to $252 million, while free cash flow increased 15.8% to $196 million.', 'It is important to note that the prior year cash flow figures still include the results of our previously divested Energy business. So, these growth figures understate the full cash flow growth potential of our Insurance-only business. On dividends and repurchases, during 2023, we returned $3 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. We are pleased to share that the Board has approved a $0.05 or 15% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.39 per share. In addition our Board has also authorized an additional $1 billion in share repurchases, bringing our total authorization to $1.6 billion. On guidance, we are pleased to deliver our expectations for 2024 with growth and margins in line with our Investor Day target and they build upon the exceptional performance we delivered in 2023.', 'More specifically, we expect consolidated revenue for 2024, to be in the range of $2.84 billion to $2.9 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.54 billion to $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin in the 54% to 55% range. This margin reflects strong cost discipline, while also funding incremental investment opportunities that we expect to drive future growth. These opportunities include investing in our sales force to drive greater sales effectiveness, expanding internationally through acquisitions and building our capabilities with new advanced technologies including Generative AI. Walking further down the P&L, we expect depreciation and amortization of fixed assets in the range of $210 million to $240 million and amortization of intangibles of approximately $75 million.', 'Both items are subject to the timing of completion of projects and foreign currency changes. We expect our tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. This all culminates in adjusted earnings, in the range of $6.30 to $6.60 per share. We also expect capital expenditures to be between $240 million and $260 million as we continue to invest organically to drive future growth. A complete list of all guidance measures can be found in the earnings slide deck, which has been posted to the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. And now, I will turn the call back over to Lee, for some closing comments.', ""Lee Shavel: Thanks, Elizabeth. In summary, we're excited about the opportunity that lies ahead. Our motivating purpose is to partner with our clients in building resilience for individuals, communities and businesses globally. The combination of our focused business model, deep customer relationships and strategy to deliver value for clients through improved decision-making and operational efficiency is a formula that will also deliver value to our shareholders through growth and returns. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk, given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. With that, I'll ask the operator, to open the line for questions."", 'See also 12 Best Ways To Leave Money To A Child and 10 Countries with the Most Military Drones in the World.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Degner', ""Thanks, Laith, and thanks to all of you for joining the call today. Range's 2023 plan was successfully executed with a consistent theme throughout the year. Operating safely while driving continued operational improvements. Generating free cash flow with a peer-leading capital efficiency and prudent allocation of that free cash flow, balancing returns of capital to shareholders with further debt reduction and the long-term development of our world-class asset base. I believe our fourth quarter results are a great example of continued advancement against those key objectives and showcase the resilience of Range's business and a low point of a cycle.Likewise, our year-end reserves update and 16th consecutive year of positive performance revisions points to the repeatable nature of our Marcellus inventory. As we look towards the year ahead, you will hear those themes repeated. And I believe the resilience that our business has in a lower price environment will be a key differentiator for Range.Maintaining a flexible hedge program to cover fixed costs and capital commitments is clearly beneficial in periods of price weakness like we find ourselves in today. However, the real value proposition over the long run is underpinned by ranges low sustaining capital requirements. Our low capital intensity is the result of Range's class-leading drilling and completion costs, shallow base decline, large blocky core inventory and talented team. Altogether, these results in a required reinvestment rate that is lower than any of our peers, which provides Range a solid foundation for consistently generating significant free cash flow and returns to shareholders.Further bolstering Range's durability is our liquids contribution, which is approximately 30% of our total production volume. Our liquids revenue is expected to provide an uplift to natural gas prices and using today's strip pricing, it's very meaningful. For context, Range's NGL barrel is currently priced around $24 per barrel using strip prices for 2024. That is equivalent to $1.60 per Mcf premium to recent Henry Hub pricing. When we roll all of that together, our liquids revenue uplift, our low maintenance capital and a thoughtful hedging program, you get the lowest breakeven among natural gas producers and the most resilient organic free cash flow, as evidenced by our 2023 results and 2024 projections.Importantly, with our vast inventory of derisked high-quality Marcellus wells, we have the ability to compound our per share growth in free cash flow for decades to come.Turning to our near-term plans. For 2024, Range expects to generate healthy free cash flow at strip pricing with all-in capital spending between $620 million and $670 million. This capital plan consists of approximately $575 million to support our base level maintenance production plan, similar to the past few years, along with additional investments in three categories.First is additional acreage spending above maintenance levels, which not only allows for longer laterals, but actually offsets most of our lateral footage being turned to sales. Keeping our 28 million feet of core Marcellus inventory relatively unchanged. Second is an investment in expanding our water infrastructure, which provides a very quick payback and supports a low D&C and LOE cost in the future. And lastly, is flexible drilling and completion capital, like we had in 2023, which increases our year-end inventory of drilled and/or completed lateral footage, providing us optionality and flexibility as we evaluate the optimum setup for following years.The overall number of drilling rigs and frac crews will be the same as last year, with the additional inventory generated as a result of simply retaining the equipment, which maintains operational efficiencies and provides flexibility for 2025 and beyond.Given the macro backdrop, Range is planning a maintenance production profile that is similar to recent years, at 2.12 to 2.16 Bcf equivalent per day. Approximately 3/4 of the lateral footage that will turn to sales this year will be located across our wet and super-rich acreage positions, providing the added benefit of our NGL uplift to overall cash flow and price realizations, with the remainder of our program focused on our dry gas footprint.Our operational cadence for 2024 will consist of two horizontal drilling rigs operating throughout the year, resulting in a total combined footage of approximately 750,000 lateral feet being drilled or about 100,000 feet more than what we will turn to sales. 2024 completions will be executed utilizing a single new electric fracturing fleet operating through the year as well.Consistent with the maintenance production program, approximately 640,000 lateral feet from 50 new wells is expected to go into production in 2024. With more than half of the new wells being drilled, developed on pads with existing production. Returning to pads with existing production has been a repeatable part of the Range story for many years and supports both our capital and operational efficiency. Similar to prior years, our activity and capital will be weighted towards the front half of the year, while our quarterly production profile is expected to be back half weighted as the new turning lines materialize in the back half of 2024. First quarter production is expected to be around 2.1 Bcf equivalent per day before building into the second half of the year.Our operational review for the past year showcased the continued theme of execution excellence. That starts with our drilling highlights. 2023 saw several new efficiency records set for the program while drilling a total combined lateral footage of nearly 700,000 feet. The team managed to drill 8 of the top 15 longest laterals in Range's program history with 40% exceeding 15,000 feet laterally. 4 of the wells had a lateral length greater than 20,000 feet with the longest 2 laterals extending 4 miles. Our large contiguous acreage position affords us the ability to drill these type of long laterals, increasing efficiencies and allowing us to access more reserves from a single location, all while reducing our overall footprint and consolidating infrastructure requirements.In addition to the new horizontal link record set by the team, we also set new benchmark rates for daily drill footage. The average daily lateral footage drilled in 2023 was more than 4,600 feet per day, a step change increase of 38% over the previous year, with the fastest drilling day exceeding 7,450 feet drilled in a 24-hour period. The efficiency gains we see from longer laterals and faster daily drilling rates are key to the program's success. But equally important was that the team managed to simultaneously improve its pinpoint accuracy when in zone. Over the years, our drilling and geoscience teams have set an extremely precise standard for our horizontal targeting, typically with a tolerance of less than 20 feet.In 2023, with all the long lateral and high drilling rate success the team had, they did it while staying within their high-graded targets for more than 93% of the lateral footage drilled in the year. A noteworthy achievement by the team. This type of laser focus plays a role in the positive performance revisions and consistent reserve reporting that investors have come to expect from Range.Moving to completions. Several new completion efficiency records were established during the year to include the following: increasing overall efficiencies to 9 stages per day, a 10% improvement over the prior mark, which was just set in 2022, achieving our highest pad average of 13.4 stages per day, a mark set during the fourth quarter. Successfully completing Range's longest well to date with a total measured depth of 29,500 feet and setting a new record of 17 stages completed in a 24-hour period. These incremental gains in operational efficiency could not have been accomplished without reliable logistics supporting each stage. And the Range water operations and logistics team played a critical role in supporting these efforts.But these operational results are incomplete if we can't execute safely. In addition to the highlights shared today, the team also delivered on one of our best safety and environmental performances in the company's history. We look forward to sharing more on these results in our upcoming corporate sustainability report in the months ahead.Turning quickly to marketing. During the quarter, Range's weighted average NGL price was $24.91 per barrel. This is a $2.42 per barrel premium to the Mont Belvieu index and the highest quarterly premium in company history. This performance was driven by Range's flexible LPG export program and strong seasonal butane values during the quarter. Full year 2023 saw $1.24 per barrel NGL premium and was also a company best on an annual basis. We expect Range to maintain a differential to the Belvieu index of $1 minus to $1 premium for 2024 by leveraging our export capacity and flexible transportation options.To the extent that export dynamics remain tight in the Gulf Coast as they were in the second half of 2023, we would expect our access to the East Coast to be advantaged, pushing us towards the premium side of our guidance. And as I mentioned at the beginning of these remarks, Range's NGL barrel is currently priced well above natural gas prices, supporting our durable free cash flow profile.Turning to natural gas. Near-term prices are obviously incredibly challenging for the industry, and we expect these historically low price levels should help keep a lid on natural gas production across the U.S. We're encouraged by reduced industry activity in the Haynesville and Tier 2 basins, along with maintenance programs being planned in the Marcellus. This moderated industry activity, along with LNG project start-ups expected in the second half of 2024 and continued strength in gas power generation provides the potential for the domestic market to rebalance later this year.While beyond this year, continued growth in global demand for U.S. natural gas, combined with domestic power and industrial demand, and Tier 1 well inventory exhaustion all set up a strong outlook for long-term U.S. gas fundamentals.Before handing over to Mark, I'll reiterate a message we've shared previously. We believe the future of natural gas and NGLs is strong, and the Range team remains focused on generating free cash flow while advancing our overall efficiencies and delivering repeatable well performance across our large contiguous inventory. I believe the positive results we generated in 2023 and plan to build upon in 2024, are a reflection of that focus and show the resilience of Range's business.I'll now turn it over to Mark to discuss the financials."", 'Mark S. Scucchi', ""Thanks, Dennis. 2023 highlighted the strengths and the weaknesses of companies in the energy sector. For upstream producers, quality assets with low full cycle costs, the ability to reach a diverse set of customers with a variety of price points, and a rock-solid balance sheet to provide flexibility were all necessary to create value. Range has each of these key attributes and through sound execution by the team, the company generated strong free cash flow, reduce debt, pay dividends, bought back shares and reinvested in operations not only for maintenance, but to prudently position the company for the future. As we sit here in early 2024, with an efficient plan to maintain steady production, we are also carefully positioning the business for evolving domestic and international demand for natural gas and natural gas liquids. As incremental demand materializes, Range will be positioned to be a reliable long-term energy supplier that generates strong returns from a resilient business.Let's start with capital allocation in 2023. Cash flow before working capital of approximately $1.1 billion funded our capital investments of $614 million, a reduction in debt net of cash of $292 million along with roughly $96 million in dividends and share repurchases. This allocation demonstrates the fact that in a low commodity price setting, range comfortably maintained base production that drove strong cash flow on the back of cash margins equating to greater than 40% of realized price per unit. This resilient margin attributable to an advantageous commodity mix paired with a diverse sales portfolio and competitive unit costs allowed prudent investments in the business and cash returns from the business while further strengthening the balance sheet.Over the past 2 years, Range has reduced net debt by an aggregate $1.2 billion and returned capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends totaling $535 million. In total, that is more than $1.7 billion in capital returned to stakeholders. With the balance sheet in great shape and a reduced share count, continued resilient value generation is the goal.Driving 2023 strong financial results was the tireless operating team focused on safety and efficiency. The team delivered planned production at a competitive drilling and completion capital cost which included building a few wells for inventory. With perhaps the lowest decline rate of comparable companies, Range's capital efficiency stands out in terms of cost per Mcfe, full cycle break even costs, and the required reinvestment rate of cash flow to maintain production. As a percentage of cash flow, Range should regularly be near the lowest call on cash for sustaining CapEx. We expect this to be true of this asset base for many years.Focusing on the fourth quarter for a moment. Operating results achieved cash flow before working capital of $300 million. Cash flow was a result of realized price per unit of $3.25 per Mcfe. Margin benefited from lower expenses with an $0.11 reduction in unit costs compared to fourth quarter last year, driven primarily by lower GP&T and lower interest expense. Fourth quarter cash margins per unit of production were $1.42, a healthy 44% margin despite lower commodity prices.As we often mentioned, Range's gas processing cost is linked to NGL prices such that gathering, processing and transportation expense decreased during the fourth quarter serving as a right way risk relationship between costs and pricing. Also reducing costs in Q4 were lower fuel and electricity costs.Taxes have become a relevant topic with company profitability. In 2023, Range's cash taxes are only at the state level for a total of roughly $1.5 million for the year. At year-end, 2023, Range had federal NOL carryforwards totaling $1.8 billion. These NOLs will serve to reduce taxable income in coming years. For some added understanding, the first layer of federal NOLs totaling approximately $158 million can be used to reduce up to 100% of taxable income. The approximate remaining $1.7 billion of federal NOLs can be used to reduce up to 80% of a given year's taxable income. At current strip pricing and Range's expected profitability, we believe we will benefit from the full utilization of these NOL carryforwards in coming years.Turning from 2023 accomplishments to where the company is headed in 2024. Given the strong foundation provided by high-quality assets and low financial leverage, we intend for Range's strategic focus to remain consistent. Maximize the value of a multi-decade project inventory, generate free cash flow, prudently return capital and reinvest in the business. With a thoughtfully constructed hedging program, we seek to participate in improved long-term market dynamics while increasing confidence in near-term forecasted cash flow, all to support consistent, efficient operations, preserving the balance sheet and creating additional optionality around capital allocation. We believe Range's results demonstrate a successful hedging philosophy that has served the company well and will continue to do so in the future.Presently, Range has approximately 55% of 2024 natural gas hedged with an average floor price of $3.70. Into 2025, approximately 25% hedged with an average floor price of $4.11, providing range a stable base to consistently generate free cash flow through market cycles.Range's Business Plan continues to be executed on what we believe is the largest high-quality asset in Appalachia, paired with a transport and sales portfolio delivering production across the U.S. and internationally, all underpinned by a strong financial foundation. We have the team, assets and balance sheet to succeed through price cycles, and we believe the range of business can and will continue to deliver significant value to investors.Dennis, back to you."", 'Dennis L. Degner', ""Thanks, Mark. Before moving to Q&A, I'd like to congratulate our team for their accomplishments discussed today and their dedication to our continued safety performance, operational improvements and progress towards our stated financial objectives. 2024 looks like it's going to be a challenging year for the industry, but Range's business has never been stronger, having derisked a high-quality inventory measured in decades and translated that into a business capable of generating free cash flow through these types of cycles.With that, let's open up the line for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question is going to come from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America.', 'Douglas George Blyth Leggate', ""Dan, thanks for all your comments. And obviously, a tremendous asset base that you've spelled out in spades every quarter that certainly in our book at least is not yet recognized in your stock. But I do have a more macro question to kick off, if I may. You've obviously seen what happened to gas prices and indeed your own share price in the sector in the last couple of days in response to one of your large peers making some decisions about the timing of when to produce. So I'm just curious about your thinking on that topic. Obviously, with 1 frac crew, you can't exactly drop activity but you could curtail the timing of completions perhaps into a better gas markets. So I'm just curious if you could walk us through how you think about that?"", 'Dennis L. Degner', ""I think the way you've asked the question is something that we've given a lot of conversation and thought to over the past several weeks. We like the flexibility. And I know we've used that word a lot in our prepared remarks today, but we like the flexibility of this program that sets up. If you look back for our ability to basically shape the curve of when our wells will turn in line this year. When you look at the past several years, there have been times when clearly, we've chosen to look at shut-in economics. And we've looked at dry gas portions of the field, and we know where -- let's just say that gas curtailment could take place and have a commensurate cost reduction that goes along with it, while supporting really our price realization uplift associated with our NGLs in the [wet] side of it. So as we look kind of on the program going forward and the inventory build that would support our setup for 2025, we see that we'll have the flexibility to basically adjust timing for turn in lines based upon what the macro is telling us and what the basin fundamentals are looking like.With our transport and the ability to get gas, 80% of our gas out of the basin and virtually 100% of our NGLs out, it does change the calculus for us quite a bit. But we will remain absolutely very sensitive given the flexibility that we've baked in and the cash flow that the business will throw off this year. We like our flexibility to shape those target lines with what makes sense for the business."", 'Douglas George Blyth Leggate', ""I appreciate that. I know it's a tricky one to navigate. It's easy for us to [pin] on it, but you've got to execute. My follow-up is also a kind of high-level question. I mean the operations -- the quarter obviously look great. The productivity continues to be very predictable and credit to Laith and the team for helping us see that, if you like. But you're already the most capital efficient gas producer frankly, in the country. My question is others are not. And with that in mind, I'm curious how you see your role in the consolidation wave, if any, on what's going on in the sector right now? Putting good assets in the hands of great management is a pretty easy way to create value and just curious how you think about that?"", 'Dennis L. Degner', ""Well, I think as we look at M&A, our view today isn't a whole lot different than the way we've looked at it in the past. We know what some of the in-basin opportunities look like. Whatever we would embrace from an M&A standpoint has to make -- it has to look a lot like Range. And it has to make Range a better company and stay -- keep us on the path of the objectives that we've been talking about kind of quarter after quarter and somewhat staying the course.When you look at the team that we put in place, the successes they've been able to accomplish, there's no doubt the capital efficiency that Range has harvested is something that we think could be replicated, if you will, in other parts of the basin. But we also know that, again, we remain focused on the large inventory that we have. And even we haven't even talked about the inventory below the Marcellus with the Utica or even the Upper Devonian. So in a lot of ways, we feel like we can take this what we're doing today, replicate it year after year and decade after decade and not have to necessarily look at an M&A possibility to further, which is an enhanced capital efficiency.But size and scale is something that certainly we've been asked about a number of times, and it's a common question. And there could be some positive benefits whether it's leveraging cost of services, let's just say, combining transport and other processing and gathering type of cost structure. So we see that there are those opportunities. But when you look -- as you pointed out, Doug, where we're at with some of our metrics, it would have to look a lot like Range or we go the other way. So we like where we're at. We feel like we've got the team and the inventory, as Mark and I both touched on today to kind of keep forging the path that we're on."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Nitin Kumar with Mizuho Securities.', 'Nitin Kumar', ""I want to start off, Mark, in your prepared remarks, you talked about returning cash to shareholders, but the last couple of years, your favored debt reduction as a primary source for deploying your free cash flow. Now that you're at least within the range of the targets for your debt, how should we think about cash returns going forward? Is this a year -- is 2024 a year where we could see some more cash return for shareholders directly?"", 'Mark S. Scucchi', ""I think as Dennis has highlighted in a couple of his responses in both of us in our comments this morning, flexibility and resilience are a couple of the hallmarks of the Range business and how we're trying to build it and have built it over the last couple of years, having paid off north of $2.5 billion in debt. We've come a long way and reposition the balance sheet. So one of the key principles that we have laid out in the return of capital program is, again, flexibility, optionality rather than a hard and fast approach.You've seen us tilt over the last couple of years to larger share repurchase programs. And as prices come down, we favored the debt reduction. At the end of the day, as I mentioned in my opening comments, debt reduction is still a return to the equity holders as you think about enterprise value and shifting that value in favor of the equity holders.So where I'm headed with that is the balance sheet is basically at the high end of our target range. We have positioned the balance sheet directionally where we want it, and we'll continue to do so over the years, but we have added flexibility. So the starting point for 2024 is our program generates free cash flow. So we have optionality, and we'll lean in and be opportunistic in those share repurchases. We certainly have latitude to make those decisions. We do favor the share repurchases, given the disconnect in intrinsic value we see between the underlying asset and share price right now, versus a more heavily weighted dividend-type program though a modest base dividend makes sense to us as well.So long-winded answer to your question, but we will remain opportunistic. If you saw a major disconnect, a major pullback for some reason, I think we certainly would look very closely at leaning in harder. So it's good in a free cash flow positive program to have that optionality and have the balance sheet where we are to be able to make those decisions and respond to market conditions."", 'Nitin Kumar', 'Great. I guess my second question is also around financial, so maybe for Mark, but you talked about having hedged about 25% of your 2025 volumes. Very attractive floor, north of $4. Can you talk a little bit about now that you are kind of at the high end of your leverage targets. You certainly have a low cost structure. How should we think about hedging going forward? Is it a formulaic 50% of volumes? Or is that -- or 25%, whatever it is? Or do we see less hedging from Range because your balance sheet is in a much stronger position?', 'Mark S. Scucchi', ""So there's more of a philosophical objective we're trying to achieve. We like as a starting point, considering what it takes to cover your fixed costs to your capital program. So that obviously varies by year, varies by what price is available to you and so forth. So 2025 is a pretty good example. That hedge floor of $4.11 for 2025 and about 25% of natural gas, that essentially covers that fixed cost element of our cost structure. And that can be an example going forward. So it's not so much hard coded to that percentage. It's what it takes to achieve that philosophical risk mitigation strategy."", 'Operator', 'And our next question is going to come from the line of Bertrand Donnes with Truist.', 'Bertrand William Donnes', ""Just want to clarify a previous answer. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned the slightly lower 1Q production level, which using your full year range sets you up for a pretty good ramp into the end of the year. I just want to understand if that's what we should expect in '25, just a similar drop-off in 1Q again with kind of that seasonal peak. Or do you envision maybe using the wells in process to level that out going forward? Or is the decision for the wells in progress just purely based on where gas prices are at the time?"", 'Dennis L. Degner', ""Yes, we -- I think the way to think about 2025 is very similar to 2023, 2022. And I would expect our production profile to look very similar to '24. When you think about the way the maintenance program gets shaped, it does have more activity in capital in the front half of the year, and then you see those turn-in lines come to fruition in the back half of the year. So '24 should look a lot similar to that. And the way we're planning -- look, I think the way we think about 2025 today is the program starts with a base maintenance production type scenario. And so what that would present is, clearly, the opportunity to complete some wells early in the year that we have built up in inventory through that in-process inventory of 2024, but similar to our conversations in prior cycles, it would just translate that into some turn in lines that would be more toward the midpoint of the year and into the back half of '25."", 'Bertrand William Donnes', ""That makes sense. And then the second one is you outlined on your full year guide a greater than 30% liquids cut in the full guide. I just wasn't sure if there was any moving parts on that. Is it maybe lower in 1Q and then higher in 4Q? And then does that set up the next year for a higher average percentage?"", 'Dennis L. Degner', ""Yes. I think which you should expect from a percentage liquids should be really similar to what we've conveyed. I wouldn't expect there a lot of variable -- a lot of variance in quarter-over-quarter. And part of it is because the weight of our production and activity this year will be on the liquids-rich side. So we don't tend to overcorrect. I will just say the program a lot through the balance of the year. So what you'll see is, I'll just say, again, through that back half weighted type turn-in-line profile, you'll see our liquids contribution be very consistent with what we've reported in prior quarters."", 'Operator', 'And our next question is going to come from the line of Paul Diamond with Citi.', 'Paul Michael Diamond', ""Just a quick question on guidance. You guys talked about $15 million to $20 million you deploy around water infrastructure and some other kind of operational expenses. Just wanted to get an idea of how you guys see that being deployed? Whether it's consistent over time or you see that being more summer-weighted? Or just kind of how to think about the directionality of that and when you'd expect them to be deployed?"", 'Dennis L. Degner', ""Paul, I think a good way to think about how that capital will get deployed would be really fairly evenly through the balance of the year. We're talking about small capital and really small projects in the grander scheme of things. But the majority of that is going to be on the water infrastructure build-out. It allows us, as we continue to get to this place where we've got 1,500 producing drilled and completed wells, you can imagine we've moved further and further from our core water infrastructure that we invested in a little over a decade ago now at this point. And so as we're building that out through the balance of this year, we'll be able to start to utilize it in the second half or the back half of the year. So I would expect that expenditure component or that bucket of spend to really be more spread across fairly evenly through the year."", 'Paul Michael Diamond', ""Understood. And just a quick follow-up and just kind of touching on your guys' philosophy surrounding those 100,000 feet of wells in progress. How do you envision those being over time? Is that purely a economics based on the fundamental pricing on the ground? Or is it something you anticipate holding inventory to some level or just how are you guys thinking about the eventual deployment of that excess?"", 'Dennis L. Degner', ""Yes, Paul, I think this is one of the -- I'll go back to kind of the fundamental thought. It really gets back to what's the macro and the basin fundamentals, international macro? What do we -- what signals are we seeing from the market that would suggest how we utilize that in-process inventory. So I know we keep using the word flexibility, but we do believe that, that's the right setup for us. It will either allow us to think about getting a head start in 2025 depending upon what pricing looks like or it allows us to be even more capital efficient through that 2025 program as maybe I think you're pointing out, we could utilize that inventory without having to be in a blowdown mode like we've seen maybe from some other reports."", 'Operator', 'And our next question is going to come from the line of Jacob Roberts with TPH & Co.', 'Jacob Phillip Roberts', 'We were hoping to -- if you were able to provide some commentary or even percentages as to where the wells in progress inventory sits in terms of a spud to a waiting turn-in-line -- timeline?', 'Dennis L. Degner', 'Could you repeat the question one more time for me?', 'Jacob Phillip Roberts', ""Sure. I'll try to simplify it. Perhaps just at the end of 2024, the wells in progress inventory, can you frame if these are DUCs or deferred turn-in-lines in the mix there?"", 'Dennis L. Degner', ""Okay. Thanks, Jake. Sorry about that. It was a little hard to hear on my end. I think as we -- a good way of thinking about that inventory at the year-end, it will be a bit of a mix. So as you can imagine, by retaining -- we've got a really lean program. And so by having two horizontal rigs that we're going to maintain through the balance of the year, of which we would need those for a maintenance level type program for 2025, some of the inventory that gets generated, their horizontal wells that basically are not getting completed, but they'll be ready for completion right out of the gates to start the year.In some of this spend that we've outlined, it is retaining or keeping good efficiencies with our one dedicated frac crew. So you think about it as kind of a low-level program where two rigs are generating enough activity for that on base level of frac crew day in and day out. And it's really as a function of the efficiencies that we've talked about really through our prepared remarks, 10% improvement in frac stages per day last year and then, of course, the 38% improvement daily drill footage on the drilling side. So it's kind of all of a byproduct that. But we'll have some extra fracs that we'll complete this year, but there will be, let's just think in composite, there's going to be somewhere between 7 to 10 wells in total aggregate that will basically on an equivalent basis, be carried into next year."", 'Jacob Phillip Roberts', ""Great. My second question is on the incremental land spend. Your comments about replacing the lateral feet drilled every year against what is a very long inventory. We're curious how aggressive Range will be spending these dollars. And then perhaps in subsequent years, what the runway looks like to continue that sort of replacement rate of 500,000 lateral feet versus the 650,000 lateral feet kind of base case?"", 'Dennis L. Degner', ""Well, Jake, I think the way we would think about it is we put that framework in there from a land spend, and we view it as an opportunistic kind of view. When you think about '23 and I'll kind of back up for half a second, if you look at 2023 at this period time a year ago, we were communicating a plan that had an average lateral length of 10,500 feet. But by the time we got to the end of the year and you look at the turn-in-lines and the drilling activity, the average was just under 13,000 feet. So by nature of what we did through the year by extending laterals, some of that resulted in some opportunistic, we'll call it Open Track leasing that we deployed through the year to extend those laterals, provide some of our most capital-efficient wells in the numbers that we report on.So this is a way of framing it where we think we can do this year-over-year in a lot of portions of our field. But we also have a lot of it that's also secured that's HBP as well. So we see line of sight for the next few years to continue to do this. And there's also leasing opportunities we'll just say within the heart of the field that we haven't fully expanded on, whether it's some of the state parks or other areas that could also provide future opportunities for us. So we see a decent runway here yet."", 'Operator', 'And our next question is going to come from the line of Michael Scialla with Stephens.', 'Michael Stephen Scialla', ""Just wanted to ask about the decision to spend on some of these other things above the maintenance capital level. Are you really looking for -- I guess the main question is why now, but it's obviously you're looking at things in the future, but with gas prices where they are and some of your competitors trimming budgets, was the compelling force to spend those dollars today or this year, rather?"", 'Dennis L. Degner', ""Michael, I think I'd start this by kind of saying, look, the water infrastructure is we've had a very low, I'll just say, ongoing investment into the water infrastructure, but as an example, it's been a significant piece of our story that kind of supports our low capital efficiency. So this felt like the right time for us to invest in expanding that infrastructure as we think about what the future could hold for additional activity, again, as we continue to move back to pads with existing infrastructure, really supports, again, that low cost dollar per foot -- or dollar per barrel type basis. And quite honestly, it supports recycling of water from other producers, which is -- it's a key component for low-cost water to our doorstep on location, if you will.I think the other part from a land perspective, I think we just talked about it a little bit, but we kind of see some of this as lease management, but also it's overall allowing us to extend these laterals and the ability to deliver some of our most capital-efficient wells.The additional activity that's in that bucket, that's really just not picking up three rigs going down to one at the end of the year and then trying to pick those other two rigs up in January. It's utilizing existing drilling rigs. We've got relationships with these service partners. They've delivered some of our best efficiencies, which we've highlighted this past year. We couldn't be happier with the direction that we've been moving with both the crews, the service partners and our team. It feels like this is the right time to continue to maintain that momentum as you think about 2025. And look, we can make decisions to make changes based upon what the setup is for 2025. But we've got 1 base frac crew. And one drilling rig alone will not supply enough, we'll just say wells to keep that one frac crew busy. So this is a very lean program, something that we've reinforced now time and time again.But I think when you look at also some of the investments we're making now, I guess the other part would be this probably in a lot of ways, depending upon how you think about 2025 and 2026, could be lower cost investments at this moment versus what we could see in the future years. And so we feel like it's a good window. These are low dollars in the grander scheme of the overall value of the program, and we think it sets up a really nice story.I'll hand it over to Mark real quick."", 'Mark S. Scucchi', ""Sure. I think, Dennis, obviously just highlighted the key operational reasons and drivers. So just zooming back out to the financial point of view is now an appropriate time to do it. I think the simple answer to the question is yes. If you look at what the program is, we achieving our core objectives to generate free cash flow, fund the maintenance program strengthen and bolster the balance sheet, return capital to investors and prudently invest in the company. I think we check each of those boxes quite comfortably.So if you look at our reinvestment rate into D&C activity for the year, for a maintenance program, it's peer leading. There's a slide on Page 7 of our deck to highlight that. If you look over the last couple of years, Range is in the 25% to call it, 50% of cash flow for reinvestment and maintenance program, depending on the prevailing price environment. Industry is at 75% to greater than 100% call on [capital] to hold their production flat. So for Range, Dennis's point, this is an opportunity when we think costs are appropriate in advance of what they could be in coming years as demand eventually does materialize and grow, we can build, again, very modest investments.Just-in-time inventory works fine most of the time, but if you can make very modest investments and have a small inventory of wells that are more operationally efficient and friendly from a cost perspective and creates that flexibility to repeat something that I said earlier for 2025? Do we maintain the inventory? Do we build it? Or do we have the option of using some of that if, for some reason, prices remain subdued? That's the resilience and the flexibility of the Range story of why we generated cash flow last year, and we'll do so again in 2024 we fully expect."", 'Michael Stephen Scialla', 'That makes a lot of sense, and I appreciate all the detail on that. You mentioned, Dennis, I heard you are at 29,000 or a little over 29,000 feet lateral, you keep pushing these things further and further. I guess as you do that, does the infrastructure there, does that create any infrastructure requirements for longer laterals? And do you see any -- have you had any issues producing these longer laterals over the longer term?', 'Dennis L. Degner', ""Yes, we've actually seen good repeatable performance out of the wells, no issues on the operational front from a -- I'll just say the ability to complete these wells also. Production facilities at the surface haven't -- we've upgraded some of our design over the course of time. But what we haven't done, Michael, is trying to design them for repeat production. So we keep the infrastructure fully utilized, and we basically keep our cost structure as low as possible by doing so. So we have the ability to continue to do this for quite a while. So it's pretty encouraging the way we've set up the time. So keeps us from basically spending, I think, too much money inefficiently on the facility design by trying to reach that peak performance out of the gates knowing that whether it's in the months that follow, we're going to basically be well within the limitations of that equipment."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani with ROTH MKM.', 'Leo Paul Mariani', ""I wanted just to hit on a couple of the numbers here. I appreciate some of the detail on the taxes. I think that's always helpful for the analyst community. But just to kind of maybe dumb that down a little bit for me here. Did I hear that you guys are maybe expecting around 80% shield on your cash taxes on the Federal level in 2024?"", 'Mark S. Scucchi', ""In 2024, I think you're going to be better than that. We'll defer taxes. The first layer of the federal NOL, call $160 million lets you offset 100% of your pretax income. And you still have the annual deductions for that year. And then there's the next layer that allows you to offset up to 80% of taxable income. So in 2024, at the federal level, I would expect minimal taxes. The effective tax rate probably looks quite similar to where we were at 2023. And for the next couple of years, you might slowly, as you move into that second layer of NOLs, where you're shielding or deferring taxes on 80% of your income, you would still have several years to work through a couple of more years in any event, '26 and probably into '27 to dramatically reduce taxes before you start to see any material sort of uptick."", 'Leo Paul Mariani', ""Okay. That's nice to hear for sure. And then I just wanted to follow up a little bit on what you guys were saying on kind of candence of capital in production. I appreciate you giving that first quarter production number, it sounds like it's down about 5% versus the prior quarter. You did mention that you are looking at potentially deferring some turn in lines with the weaker gas prices here. I'm not sure if that's a factor in the first quarter or maybe it's just a fewer turn-in-lines here and perhaps some maintenance. And then just on the CapEx side, you did say it was a little more front-end weighted. So any help on that? It should be like 55% in the first half? Just trying to get a little sense of the cadence on the production and the CapEx here in the near term."", 'Dennis L. Degner', ""So I think a good way to think about our production is it's going to feel very consistent and, I'll say, a normal profile to what we delivered actually last year. So you might see that character move a little bit where our low point is going to be more, I think, looking like Q1 instead of last year, it was more Q2. But if you look quarter-over-quarter, the profile is very consistent. And so having the 1 frac crew, again, as we're kind of churning through our turn-in lines, you're going to start to see that production profile then start to manifest itself through Q2, Q3 and Q4 with the peak clearly in Q4 as we get ready to walk into the winter of '24 and '25. But it will be real consistent with the profile that we've delivered the last couple of years. It will look kind of business as usual for us."", 'Leo Paul Mariani', ""Okay. No, that's helpful. And then just -- any comment on the capital. I know it's front-end weighted but is it significantly front-end weighted or maybe just a little bit because I know you guys are talking about some of that extra capital, which might happen late in the year this year?"", 'Dennis L. Degner', ""Yes, I would expect the capital to look again real similar to last year. All in all, service on a quarter-over-quarter basis, service costs really have moved down a little. So you would expect to see, I'll just say, mid- to low single-digit relief in that front. But as you look through the year, our quarter-over-quarter capital reporting from '23 should look pretty similar."", 'Operator', ""We are nearing the end of today's conference. We will go to the line of Noel Parks with Tuohy Brothers."", 'Noel Augustus Parks', 'Just had a couple of things. You were touching on the service cost cycle just now. And I wonder if you -- this last cycle was -- of inflation was pretty unusual with kind of everybody coming back online after COVID. And so I just wondered kind of where we have some operators talking about slowing their rig activity, rig and frac activity. Do you have any sense of where we are or might be headed in the service cost cycle? Are we headed back to, say, 2019 levels? Do you think -- just any thoughts you have on that?', 'Dennis L. Degner', ""Noel, I think I would start off as saying its early. And it's tough to kind of frame I think at this point what the math and the calculus could really look like. I do think that you've probably heard me say this in the past, with service costs have come up. And I do think that this environment that we're in could look and feel a little different than past cycles where you have traditionally let's say, commodity prices up, service cost up, commodity prices down, service costs down. I think it will be a blend of those. And I think we've already seen that through the balance of 2023, where we've seen relief in areas like tubular goods as an example, and maybe some of the other consumables that we've had and or that we utilize in some services.But as you would imagine, on the electric fracturing fleet side, those fleets are at very high utilization. So it's certainly created its unique demand, if you will. So drilling rigs, we've all coalesced to kind of a similar super-spec rig configuration. We're all drilling long laterals across multiple basins. And so that's provided even though some rigs will certainly could come out of the mix based upon some of the recent reporting I would expect there to be some relief potentially there, but it's got to play out with some other rigs that potentially drop out of the mix in the next 3 to 6 months.I think we look at last year as a trend, it took a while for us to see some relief, and it probably came more at the midyear point than it did in Q1. So could see some relief, but I think it's still early and now that as you look at our capital efficiency numbers and really just the overall cost per foot values that we've reported in the past because of our strong relationships and history with our service providers and our service partners know that we'll look to basically take opportunities where we can to work together, reduce cost, because we know at some point in time, it will probably go the other way."", 'Noel Augustus Parks', ""Got it. And I just was thinking about the commodity price environment. And weak winter weather and a weak heating season is a movie we have seen before. And with still pretty much everyone focused on the uptick, or I should say, the step up in demand that we're going to see in the next couple of years with LNG capacity. It kind of seems like we have the speeding trains headed to each other where you have seasonality having its traditional effect this year. But we know that there's a big ramp-up of demand coming. Do you think we -- are we kind of getting to the last years and the last innings of having things be so heavily impacted by winter weather as far as demand? Because it just seems like at some point, and I don't know if it's really in the strip yet at some point, [destock] just kind of have to collide, it seems to me. So any thoughts here on that would be great."", 'Dennis L. Degner', ""Yes, a good question. It's something we talk about, as you can imagine, pretty frequently here in the shop. And I think we basically have highlighted something on Slide 19, we think, is worth kind of pointing out. I think when you start to think about LNG demand that's going to be coming online through the balance of -- between now and 2028, when you look at res/com, industrial, you look at exports to Mexico remain really resilient. You start to factor all of that in and plus power burn what we saw last year, in my mind, a little bit of an underappreciated story on the repeatability of that as you start to see at times underperformance by some of the other alternative power sources.So when you start to factor all of that in, we really see that you've got to get to 126 Bcf, 125 Bcf of overall demand by 2028 and where we stand today, there's a significant delta there. And so LNG is going to play a role in this, but LNG is not going to be the only factor as you start to consider demand growth on the go forward. We think infrastructure is going to need to play a really key part to this.

As a leading producer and distributor of nitrogen, primarily for fertilizers, CF Industries operates a robust manufacturing network in North America and the United Kingdom. The company's financial health is underpinned by its strategic focus on low-cost U.S. natural gas as a feedstock, positioning it as one of the most cost-efficient nitrogen producers globally. CF Industries is also pioneering in the production of carbon-free blue and green ammonia, aligning with the growing demand for clean energy solutions. The financial tables within the filing reveal a company with solid assets and a commitment to expanding its production capabilities, as evidenced by the recent acquisition of an ammonia production facility in Louisiana and ongoing capacity expansion projects."", ""Market Position and Cost Efficiency: CF Industries Holdings Inc (NYSE:CF) stands out as one of the world's largest nitrogen producers, with a strategic advantage stemming from its use of low-cost U.S. natural gas.

Despite not experiencing significant disruptions to date, the company recognizes that future attacks could lead to operational interruptions, financial losses, and reputational damage. This vulnerability underscores the need for ongoing investment in robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard against such risks.', ""Dependence on Natural Gas Prices: CF's reliance on natural gas as a primary feedstock exposes it to the volatility of natural gas prices. Fluctuations in these prices can significantly affect the company's production costs and profit margins. While CF has historically benefited from low-cost natural gas, any upward trend in prices could pose a financial challenge, necessitating strategic hedging or alternative sourcing strategies."", ""Expansion into Clean Energy: The global shift towards clean energy presents significant growth opportunities for CF Industries. The company's expertise in producing carbon-free ammonia positions it to capitalize on the increasing demand for green hydrogen and nitrogen products. By leveraging its existing infrastructure and technological capabilities, CF can expand its customer base beyond traditional fertilizer markets into emerging sectors such as renewable energy and emissions abatement."", ""Strategic Partnerships and Offtake Agreements: CF's recent off-take agreement for its blue ammonia facility in Louisiana and ongoing discussions with other companies for clean ammonia opportunities highlight the potential for strategic partnerships. These collaborations can facilitate access to new markets, enhance CF's product offerings, and strengthen its position as a leader in sustainable nitrogen production."", ""Regulatory and Legislative Changes: CF Industries operates in a heavily regulated industry, where changes in security laws and environmental regulations can lead to increased operating costs or restrictions on product sales. The potential for more stringent regulations, particularly concerning the security of industrial facilities and the use of nitrogen products, poses a threat to CF's operational flexibility and profitability."", 'Terrorism and Infrastructure Vulnerability: As a company with significant industrial facilities, CF acknowledges the risk of being a target for terrorist activities.

This success bodes well for the company, as it seeks to compete with Amazon and Google parent Alphabet, and with the Vizio purchase, that competition will extend to the TV market.', ""Additionally, Walmart has long partnered with Roku, and the affiliation goes beyond providing the OS for Walmart's Onn TVs. In 2022, Roku previously partnered with Walmart to allow consumers to buy Walmart products via a Roku device. Also, Roku and Walmart announced last year that Roku's home monitoring system would be sold exclusively through them."", 'Furthermore, as recently as Roku\'s Q4 2023 earnings call on Feb. 15, CEO Anthony Wood said that Roku had a ""great relationship"" with Walmart. So the deal may indicate some dissatisfaction on the part of Walmart with Roku in the digital ad and e-commerce space.', ""Fortunately for Roku, the profit potential in this industry is not found in the equipment but in the advertising. Here, Roku has a clear edge. At the end of last year, Roku's active user base surged to 80 million for the first time. Vizio claimed around 18 million users, but it remains a small fraction of Roku's\xa0 active audience."", ""The one area where Vizio trends in the right direction is average revenue per user (ARPU). Its ARPU of $31.55 grew 14% yearly in the most recent quarterly report. While Roku's ARPU of $39.92 is higher, it dropped 4% year over year."", ""Still, investors should look at other companies offering TV operating systems as a guide. Despite much larger sizes, Amazon and Alphabet have not succeeded at unseating Roku as the largest provider. Even with Vizio's success, Walmart could also struggle in this area. Walmart's deep pockets and massive distribution system can make a difference, but they don't guarantee the retail titan's success."", ""Additionally, Roku and Vizio have attracted their customer base partially by serving as a neutral arbiter between content providers and ad-buying companies. Now, with Vizio and Walmart becoming one and the same, one has to question whether Vizio can maintain such neutrality. The potential for Vizio's ad platform to develop some bias toward Walmart could send advertisers to Roku and other platforms instead."", ""Admittedly, having Walmart join the ranks of streaming service stocks through Vizio probably hurts Roku to some degree at first. As a result, Vizio will become a more powerful competitor, and the state of the Roku-Walmart partnership is now in some doubt, Anthony Wood's reassuring comments notwithstanding."", ""Nonetheless, Roku has long led in market share amid other large competitors. Also, like Amazon, Walmart will become another non-neutral competitor in the space, a factor that could work in Roku's favor."", 'For these reasons, investors should consider buying the pullback in Roku stock.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Roku, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Roku wasn’t one of them.

Since its official inception on May 26, 1896, it's grown from what had been a 12-stock index that predominantly featured industrial companies to one that now showcases 30 historically profitable, time-tested, multinational businesses."", ""It's also an index that's seen its fair share of modifications since the late 1800s. Excluding company name changes and mergers of then-existing Dow Jones components with other businesses (which may have also resulted in a name change), the Dow has undergone 51 changes since 1896. On Monday, Feb. 26, the ageless index will log its 52nd such change."", 'On Tuesday, Feb. 20, the\xa0S&P Dow Jones Indices, which oversees additions and subtractions to the highly followed Dow Jones Industrial Average, announced that, as of the start of trading on Monday, Feb. 26, pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) would be getting the literal boot. Meanwhile, e-commerce kingpin Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) will be taking its place.', 'The writing had been on the wall for some time that Walgreens, which was added to the Dow on June 26, 2018, would be getting the heave-ho. Unlike most major stock indexes that are weighted by market cap -- i.e., bigger businesses exert greater influence on the point value of an index -- the Dow is a share-price-weighted index. Put simply, companies with higher share prices matter more than those with lower share prices, regardless of market cap.', ""As of the closing bell on Feb. 20, 23 of the Dow's 30 components had triple-digit share prices. Walgreens Boots Alliance had the lowest share price by a considerable amount -- $22.31. Based on the Dow's divisor (the figure used to convert share price into Dow points), Walgreens accounted for just 147 points out of the index's 38,564 points."", ""While I believe Walgreens represents an intriguing and inexpensive turnaround candidate that has a multipoint strategic plan already in place, the Dow's success hinges on not only having business diversity in the index, but also having outperforming companies represent the index. Walgreens and its poor stock performance simply didn't cut it."", ""After conducting a 20-for-1 stock split in June 2022, Amazon put itself on the map as a logical candidate to join the prestigious Dow Jones Industrial Average. While it'll help replace the retail aspect that Walgreens Boots Alliance brought to the table, Amazon will also provide clues on the health of the advertising market, as well as cloud spending."", ""The interesting thing about Amazon is that while it generates a lot of revenue from its leading e-commerce marketplace, the margins associated with online retail sales are very low. It's the company's ancillary operations -- which include advertising services, subscription services (e.g., Prime), and cloud infrastructure leader Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- that account for the lion's share of its operating cash flow and net income."", ""In particular, AWS is Amazon's workhorse. Even though AWS accounted for less than 16% of Amazon's net sales last year, it generated $24.6 billion in operating income, compared to just $12.2 billion for every other business segment combined!"", 'Despite having one of the largest market caps among publicly traded companies, Amazon will slot in as only the 17th most influential component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, based on its closing price of $167.08 on Feb. 20.', ""Amazon and Walgreens Boots Alliance switching places isn't the only change being made to the iconic Dow come Monday, Feb. 26. Following the closing bell on Jan. 30, retail behemoth Walmart (NYSE: WMT) announced that it would be enacting a 3-for-1 stock split, which would become effective at the start of trading on Feb. 26."", ""A stock split allows a publicly traded company to change its share price and outstanding share count by the same factor and has no impact on the company's market cap or operating performance. It's a purely cosmetic change designed to either make shares more nominally affordable for everyday investors, as with a forward stock split, or increase a company's share price to ensure that continued minimum listing requirements for major stock exchanges are met, as with a reverse stock split."", 'Walmart\'s press release that announced its 3-for-1 split made clear that its forward stock split was put in place to ensure that employees could more easily buy whole shares of the company\'s stock. ""Given our growth and our plans for the future, we felt it was a good time to split the stock and encourage our associates to participate in the years to come,"" said Doug McMillon, CEO and President of Walmart.', ""Although this stock split won't have any impact on Walmart's operating performance, it, along with the addition of Amazon and removal of Walgreens Boots Alliance, will cause S&P Dow Jones Indices to adjust the Dow's divisor. In other words, what $1 in share price equals in Dow points on Friday, Feb. 23 won't be the same come Monday, Feb. 26."", ""Furthermore, Walmart's stock split will cause the company to lose substantial influence within the Dow. Despite rallying to a new all-time high following the release of its fourth-quarter operating results this week, the company is on pace to be a $58 stock after its split is conducted. It'll move from the 17th most influential stock in the Dow to the 26th!"", 'A new era for the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average is right around the corner.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

And Thanks so much for taking the time. I mean, really fascinating rundown. You pointed to 10 potential upside value drivers from this deal. We won't run through all 10 right now. But one of the huge things you pointed to with Roku here, it really goes back to how they're going to be able to drive some of that advertising revenue here. Take us through part of that thesis here"", ""LAURA MARTIN: Right. So my thesis here is that when Walmart is reacting to Amazon, Amazon introduced ads to all of its 200 million Amazon Prime Video subscribers. And now it's going to take connected television ads on a big screen and connect them all the way down to the purchase on e-commerce platform."", ""Walmart has now bought Vizio because Vizio has $500 million of ad sales on connected televisions. And it's going to use Vizio to keep up with Amazon. You'll buy an ad on a Vizio TV, and then Walmart will tell you whether any consumer bought that product in the real world in one of their 4,700 stores or on their e-commerce platform called walmart.com."", ""That means who they're targeting for ads is totally different than the past-- of the vizio's past because Vizio used to be a direct competitor to Roku. And now, Walmart is going to use it to do a totally different thing, which is tie ads to purchases, which competes with Amazon more directly. So that's a positive for Roku because it sort of leaves it as a monopolist in the marketplace for advertising."", ""SEANA SMITH: So, Laura, what does that then tell us about the potential gains here for Roku within that market in terms of market share and what that could potentially do for their revenue then in the longer term, given the fact, if you're right here that Vizio won't be as strong of a competitor?"", ""LAURA MARTIN: Right. So I mean Vizio is going to do $500 million of revenue, so that's a pretty, like, let's say it all moved to Roku-- that would add about 30% to their ad revenue just the Vizio piece, not to mention what they're already growing on their own platform. So that would be a big upside driver, I would say."", ""BRAD SMITH: Additionally, here, you talk about the OTT focus and the pros and cons of single focus companies. I mean, when we think about some of the competition within this landscape, there's been significant OTT consolidation that we've seen. How does Roku kind of fit into that or how do they kind of retain their own market share within that?"", ""LAURA MARTIN: Right. So the big competitors here are like Samsung, LG, Vizio, which will now be gone. And Roku, and they're all owned by these huge conglomerates other than Roku, which is owned by a single founder-- really fast pivot times, really fast product upgrade times because there's one guy that can make a decision that used to be true of Vizio. Now being owned by Walmart, we would guess that decisions and changes and market reactions are a little bit slower because Walmart's processes are probably a little more refined than these founder-led companies like Roku and Vizio."", ""So I think that's good for Roku because it's the only one that only focuses on streaming. And it's an arms dealer, meaning it takes 20% of the revenue generated on the Roku platform, from Netflix, from Peacock, from Disney. It doesn't care who wins the streaming wars because it takes 20% of their revenue sort of no matter what, no matter who wins or loses.""]"

The market is anticipated to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.8% from 2023 to 2032, reaching a value of $8.6 trillion at the conclusion of the predicted period. The main drivers of this expansion are the growing number of tourists travelling abroad and the rising standards of living of the general public.

However, the report points out that the leisure travel market can be significantly impacted by geopolitical unrest.', 'In terms of market share by age group segment in 2022, the 22–31 years segment was in the lead with a share of almost 32%. The report also mentions that, with a 38.7% market revenue share in 2022, Asia Pacific emerged as the largest global leisure travel market. The expansion of the market is anticipated to be driven by the increasing disposable income in the region, particularly in China and India.', 'Building up on this, according to a global survey by Hilton and Ipsos of over 10,000 travelers from nine countries, the number one reason to travel in 2024 for most of the respondents was to rest and recharge with an emphasis on sleep. The survey also found that 64% of global travelers intend to prioritize leisure travel in 2024 by cutting back on other personal expenses.', 'On the other hand, travelers are focusing primarily on dining experiences while they budget for 2024, per Hilton.

The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$92.96 and falling to the lows of US$80.58. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Microchip Technology's current trading price of US$83.90 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Microchip Technology’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Microchip Technology ', 'According to our valuation model, Microchip Technology seems to be fairly priced at around 0.3% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Microchip Technology today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $84.16, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Microchip Technology’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.', 'Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of Microchip Technology, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 0.9%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.', 'Are you a shareholder? MCHP’s future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team.

While property ownership undeniably has its merits, a diverse array of wealth-building options exists beyond the realms of bricks and mortar.', 'The global wealth management market expanded from $1,681.75 billion in 2022 to $1,826.17 billion in 2023, demonstrating a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 8.6%. Furthermore, the wealth management market is expected to grow to $2465.75 billion in 2027 at a CAGR of 7.8%. The global landscape of wealth management is undergoing a transformative shift, driven by an escalating demand for alternative investments.

Intriguingly, a 2019 report by Wealth-X sheds light on a fascinating aspect of wealth creation, challenging the conventional notion that substantial riches are primarily inherited. The report, which defines the ultra-wealthy as individuals possessing $30 million or more in assets, unveils a surprising statistic—67.7% of the world\'s ultra-wealthy are self-made. This revelation not only debunks the myth that significant wealth is predominantly a product of inheritance but also underscores the potential for individuals to amass fortunes from humble beginnings.', 'What adds another layer of fascination to this narrative is the rapid ascent of the self-made ultra-wealthy. Between the 2019 and 2020 reports, the number of ultra-wealthy individuals surged from 265,490 to 290,720, marking an astonishing nearly 10% increase. This surge indicates a dynamic shift in the landscape of wealth creation, suggesting that achieving the seemingly ""impossible"" is not only possible but is becoming more commonplace. As we delve into the intricacies of building wealth without relying on real estate, these statistics serve as a compelling backdrop, emphasizing the evolving opportunities for individuals to forge their paths to financial success.', 'It is intriguing to note the varying perspectives on wealth among different generations. While only 41% of Americans believe they will ever achieve wealth, there is a notable divergence between age groups. Younger individuals, with nearly 70% of Gen Z and 54% of millennials expressing optimism about future wealth accumulation, demonstrate a more hopeful outlook. Furthermore, the younger generations exhibit a greater faith in the stock market, with 38% of Gen Z and 37% of millennials viewing it as the best route to wealth, compared to 30% of Gen X and 24% of baby boomers.', 'While real estate has maintained its status as a traditional route to prosperity, this article contends that it is by no means the only viable option. By exploring alternative methods, readers will discover that building wealth and breaking free from the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle can be achieved without necessarily investing in property. The importance of dispelling the notion that saving alone leads to wealth cannot be overstated. With inflation rates exceeding 8%, keeping money dormant in a bank account results in a significant loss of value over time. The argument here is not against savings, but rather an encouragement to embrace a more dynamic and growth-oriented financial strategy.', 'An executive in a luxury office, speaking on a conference call about wealth management investments.', 'To come up with our list of 15 Tips and Tricks To Build Wealth Without Buying Real Estate, we conducted an extensive research, relying on experts’ opinion, running around on various sources, to finalize our list.

With his, let us now look now head on to our list of 15 Tips and Tricks To Build Wealth Without Buying Real Estate.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

Whether you are a beginner investor or professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.', ""Strategic job changes can be a powerful wealth-building move. In 2022, over 22% of workers aged 20+ changed jobs in under a year. Job hoppers beat inflation in 49% of cases, compared to 42% who stayed put. As skills and experience grow, so does market value, allowing for higher salary negotiations. Beyond immediate pay bumps, job hopping fosters long-term wealth by enabling skill development and expanding professional networks. Overall, it's a way to maximize earning potential and secure financial growth."", ""Investing in education is a powerful wealth-building strategy. By focusing on personal development and continuous learning, individuals can unlock better job opportunities, promotions, and high-income careers. This doesn't always require a large financial investment; resources like reading, online courses, and mentorship offer cost-effective paths to growth. Moreover, education fosters resilience, innovation, and financial literacy, empowering individuals to navigate economic challenges and optimize wealth accumulation over time."", 'Avoiding credit card debt is crucial for wealth-building. Paying off your balances in full each month prevents high-interest charges, saving money and preserving a healthy credit score. This ensures access to better financial products and interest rates when necessary.', 'Insurance is a vital component of any budget, safeguarding you from substantial financial losses in unfortunate events. Health insurance is essential to avoid crippling expenses from medical issues. Homeowner and auto insurance protect your property and vehicles. Additionally, term life insurance provides financial security for dependents. While building wealth is important, protecting it from unforeseen circumstances is equally crucial. Proactively insuring your most valuable assets ensures financial stability. As Jack Ma, a renowned Chinese business investor, wisely stated, ""Buying insurance cannot change your life but it prevents your life from being changed.""', ""Material wealth doesn't guarantee a positive net worth; having $1 million in the stock market doesn't offset $1 million in debt, resulting in a net worth of zero. Accumulating substantial debt is a major obstacle to financial prosperity. Paying off debt not only builds wealth but also reduces stress and enhances peace of mind. While some debt can be beneficial if used wisely, minimizing debt and financial burdens is advisable. Ultimately, carrying as little debt as possible is key to financial stability and wealth accumulation, according to most financial advisors."", 'Peer-to-peer lending, or P2P lending, facilitates borrowing money from individuals or businesses via online platforms that connect borrowers with lenders. Lenders earn money through interest charged on the loans they provide. Interest rates on P2P loans vary based on borrower risk, loan term, and other factors, typically exceeding rates offered by traditional savings accounts or investments. P2P lending platforms offer annual returns ranging from 4% to 15%, contingent on the platform and specific loan.', 'An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) is a personal retirement account, whereas a 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement plan. With a 401(k), a portion of your paycheck is automatically deposited into the account, often with an employer match. Conversely, with an IRA, contributions are made by the individual, with no employer involvement. Personal finance expert, Jean Chatzky, highlighted that the automated nature of 401(k)s, simplifies contributions compared to IRA contributions, which require active decisions. Once contributions begin, the focus should be on long-term growth through strategic investments.', ""Once you've maximized contributions to your IRA and 401(k) accounts, the next step is to open a taxable investment account, also known as a brokerage account. Allocate a predetermined amount to this account annually. Experts from Business Insider recommend allocating 25% of your gross income each year to a combination of retirement and brokerage accounts for wealth management clients. This diversified approach ensures that you continue building wealth beyond retirement savings, while maximizing investment opportunities and potential returns."", ""Diversifying your income beyond your main job or business is crucial for building wealth from scratch. Passive income, which doesn't require constant labor, offers financial freedom beyond typical employment. Warren Buffett's famous advice, “If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die,” underscores the importance of earning even when you're not actively working. In today's digital economy, there are various avenues for passive income, such as affiliate marketing, drop shipping, and selling digital products."", 'Commodity trading predates stocks and bonds and now takes place on specialized stock marketplaces known as commodity exchanges. Today, millions of individuals invest in commodities daily. One of the primary benefits of commodity investments is their ability to hedge against inflation. During periods of high inflation, prices of most goods tend to rise, making commodities an attractive investment option.', 'Commodities, like gold or oil, offer diversification and can act as hedges against inflation. These investments are highly liquid, making it easier to buy and sell. Despite their sensitivity to factors like currency exchange rates, interest rates, and market changes, there is a robust global demand for investing in commodity futures due to their potential for profit.', 'Click to continue reading and find out about 5 Tips and Tricks To Build Wealth Without Buying Real Estate.', 'Suggested Articles:', '13 Best Falling Stocks To Buy Right Now', '10 Best Performing Bond ETFs in 2023', '10 Cheap REITs with Huge Upside', 'Disclosure: None. 15 Tips and Tricks To Build Wealth Without Buying Real Estate\xa0is originally published on Insider Monkey.']"

This strategy focuses on companies that not only pay dividends but also consistently increase them over time. This approach offers a unique blend of income and growth, appealing to a broad range of investors. Additionally, it can provide a sense of security in times of market uncertainty or downturns, as dividend-paying stocks can reduce the volatility of a portfolio and tend to outperform in a choppy market.Stocks with a strong history of year-over-year dividend growth form a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation, as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those that have high yields. We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Griffon Corporation GFF, ArcBest Corporation ARCB, Ralph Lauren Corp. RL, KB Home KBH and PACCAR Inc. PCAR — that could be solid choices for your portfolio.', 'Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from more than 7,700 stocks to just 13.Here are five of the 13 stocks that fit the bill:New York-based Griffon is a diversified management and holding company conducting business through wholly-owned subsidiaries.

Jonathan, over to you.', 'Jonathan P. Arnold', ""Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for PG&E's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With us today are Patti Poppe, Chief Executive Officer; and Carolyn Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have other members of the leadership team here with us in our Oakland headquarters.First, I should remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements about our outlook for future financial results. These statements are based on information currently available to management. Some of the important factors, which could affect our actual financial results are described on the second page of today's earnings presentation. The presentation also includes a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures. The slides along with other relevant information can be found online at investor.pgecorp.com. We'd also encourage you to review our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.With that, it's my pleasure to hand the call over to our CEO, Patti Poppe."", 'Patricia Kessler Poppe', ""Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported full year core earnings of $1.23, delivering at the high end of our annual guidance range. This result represents growth of 12% over our 2022 results of $1.10.In the fourth quarter, we recognized the full year benefit of our 2023 general rate case as expected. I'm also pleased to announce that we exceeded our 2% annual nonfuel O&M savings target for the second consecutive year with savings coming in at 5.5% and pushing our EPS to the high end of the range. Because these savings were predominantly generated by reducing waste and improving service, they benefit customers today and benefit investors for years to come.Looking to 2024, we're reaffirming our at least 10% growth target, which is now based on our actual 2023 result of $1.23. This results in an increase to our 2024 core earnings guidance range with a new higher midpoint of $1.35 versus our previous guidance of $1.33. We also reaffirm our commitment to at least 9% core EPS growth for both 2025 and 2026, rebased off our actual 2023 results and our new 2024 range.In addition, I'm pleased to share that we're extending our core EPS growth guidance of at least 9% for an additional 2 years through 2028. Our needed customer investment leads to strong rate base growth, which continues to be the primary driver of our future earnings growth. We are providing you with updated 5-year forecast for both rate base and CapEx in today's slides. These numbers now extend to 2028 and show a consistent compound annual growth rate of 9.5%, using the new base year of 2023.Finally, we reaffirm our commitment to no new equity in 2024 and remain committed to pursuing the most efficient forms of financing available for 2025 and beyond, which Carolyn will discuss in her remarks.On Slide 4, we've added 23 actuals, illustrating our high end of guidance results and the rebasing of forward year growth rates now through 2028. This is our simple, affordable model in action. The lift in 2023 reflects our 5.5% nonfuel O&M reduction, well above our 2% plan.Slide 5 is a reminder of the key elements of our simple affordable model, which allows us to continue growing customer capital investment at 9% or more, while containing customer bill increases at or below assumed inflation in the 2% to 4% range. Key enablers in the model are ongoing annual nonfuel O&M reductions of 2%, efficient financing and electric load growth in the 1% to 3% range. The proof is in the numbers. The simple, affordable model works.You first saw Slide 6 during our November business update call. This version has been updated for a few additional known items such as the 2024 cost of capital trigger. Our new ROE of 10.7% took effect on January 1 this year with collections beginning this month in gas rates and next month for electric. Delivering on this projected 2% to 4% bill growth trajectory is an essential element of the PG&E plan, and one which will be important for building trust with our customers over the long run.For our average gas and electric residential customer, average monthly bill increases are limited to the 2% to 4% range from 2023 through 2026. I wanted to be clear that this includes the step-up in 2024 as we implement the GRC and other deferred cost recoveries. Our plan shows average build stepping down beginning later this year and further in both 2025 and 2026, keeping the average annual increase in the lower half of the 2% to 4% range as catch-up recoveries roll off.Two of the larger items are around $1 billion of 2022 WMCE interim rate relief, which comes off builds in mid-2024 and the 24-month collection of our first year GRC revenues, which come off at the start of 2026. Let me say that again. Based on what we know today, our bills will rise at the lower half of the range, around 2.5% per year, on average, over the duration of this rate case from 2023 through 2026.Let's shift gears to the significant progress the team has made on risk mitigation. Slide 7 updates our 2023 emission data for the full year. Total CPUC reportable admissions came in at 65% for 2023, down 68% from the 2017 baseline and 29% down from 2022. On the right side of the slide, we're showing our weather-normalized ignition rate, which is a metric from our wildfire mitigation plan. This year's number of 0.93 was a reduction of 71% from 2017, and our lowest annual number since we began calculating this metric.The metric demonstrates that we continue to drive down wildfire risk in 2023, even after adjusting for fewer circuit mile days under R3 or higher conditions when the risk of catastrophic wildfire are highest. While we're extremely pleased with these results, our team certainly isn't stopping here. We see further opportunities to drive overall wildfire risk reduction beyond the 94% achieved in 2023 as we continue with additional system hardening and deployment of new technologies. In addition to the physical risk reduction, financial risks are also lower, including key protections under AB 1054, which were reaffirmed with the issuance of our annual safety certificate last month.Looking forward, here on Slide 8, we want to take a moment to highlight how we see PG&E offering investors a truly differentiated, high-quality utility growth story. This starts with premium rate base growth and industry-leading 9.5%, what sets us apart is our commitment to make this investment affordable for our customers. The key enabler is our ability to drive consistent nonfuel O&M savings as we deploy our lane operating system in a utility, which previously saw costs compound at an annual 10% rate over the prior 5 years.As a reminder, several years of doing whatever was necessary to respond to back-to-back crisis pushed our capital to expense ratio far below the industry average. This is where we have a wealth of opportunity and a long runway to drive efficiencies with sustainable savings benefiting both our customers and our investors.We expect future load growth related to California's leadership in electrification to be a further differentiator and one which will help keep customer build growth within our 2% to 4% forecast. In addition to continued adoption of electric vehicles throughout our service territory, we have seen a threefold increase in data center applications in 2023 versus the prior 4 years. We plan to speak more about these load growth trends over the course of this year, including at an investor meeting, which we are planning for June 12 in New York. So please mark your calendars for that.The fundamental differentiators of rate base growth, O&M savings and load growth, we would add our constructive state regulatory and policy environment in California. Key elements of the California regulatory model includes 4 years of revenue certainty under the GRC, returns, which are set separately from the GRC, including a formulaic adjustment mechanism, and timely recovery for pass-through of important cost categories, including fuel and pension.With our GRC results, we now have revenue certainty extended through 2026, giving us the best level of regulatory visibility we've had since I joined PG&E and something which any regulated utility would love. This brings me to our performance playbook, including our lean operating system, which is becoming a critical differentiator for PG&E as we continue building a sustainable culture based on continuous improvement and what we refer to as breakthrough thinking.And so on Slide 9 to my story of the month or in this case, the story of the year. Let me first take you back to the beginning of 2023. We had a goal to underground 350 miles of electric lines at a unit cost of $3.3 million per mile. We started 2023 with only about 5 miles of civil construction fully complete. At that point, we had hundreds of miles still to design, thousands of individual easements to negotiate, 345 miles of trenches to dig and 350 miles of cable to pull. And then the winter storm hit. This team's atmospheric rivers to be exact, which brought civil work to a near standstill through April.So how did we deliver on 2023 undergrounding plan, as scoped, on time and at better-than-targeted unit cost performance? Well, during a visit with our Board of Directors in December, I watch proudly as the undergrounding team described how they use the PG&E performance playbook every day and at every level. What they shared wasn't one silver bullet, not just a breakthrough idea or a value stream map or waste elimination, rather it was this team's commitment to living the culture, using the tools and building the capabilities that enabled our results and which will cause future success.In 2023 alone, the undergrounding team eliminated $68 million in waste for the benefit of our customers. They did this by updating our standards, deploying optimal construction methods and better managing spoils. With additional improvements, average unit costs came in below our target of $3.3 million to just under $3 million per mile and the average construction cycle time improved from 5.5 months back in February 2023 to 3.5 months today. This was a total game changer in meeting and exceeding our 350-mile goals.Thanks to our 2023 undergrounding efforts, we can avoid proactively turning off power to about 15,000 households during dangerous high wind events. These customers who live in our highest risk areas can now sleep at night knowing they do not have to trade safety for reliability or worry that a tree might land on the power line in their backyard. This is climate resilient infrastructure for all weather conditions and for generations to come.The team reminded us that before lean, we would have managed the undergrounding effort through spreadsheets and phone calls. That was the old PG&E way. Undergrounding team is showing us the new PG&E. Imagine the impact our performance playbook can have enterprise-wide. It's great that we achieved our 2023 goal. What's even better is that we've created a playbook enabling consistent premium performance year-end and year out. As I like to say, performance is power. This means delivering safe, affordable and reliable service to our hometowns, along with consistent, predictable financial results.With that, let me turn it over to Carolyn."", 'Carolyn J. Burke', ""Thank you, Patti, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm excited to cover 3 topics with you. First, a recap of our 2023 results; second, our differentiated growth opportunities; and third, how are we making this growth affordable for our customers by executing on our simple, affordable model.Starting here on Slide 10, I'm pleased to report that we met or exceeded all of our 2023 goals, both operational and financial, and we're on track for each of our longer-term commitments. Our 2023 report card is another proof point that our performance playbook is working. The culture and capabilities we are building here at PG&E are enabling our delivery of consistent, predictable results. It's a virtuous cycle, setting industry-leading targets, using our lean operating system to manage the day-to-day work and then delivering on our promises, building trust with our customers and our investors. This is how we've made our system safer, faster. It's how we delivered on our 2022 and 2023 EPS guidance and it's how we can further strengthen our balance sheet while keeping bills affordable for our customers.I'm especially proud that we reduced nonfuel operating and maintenance costs by 5.5% in 2023. That's in addition to fully absorbing inflation and on top of the 3% we achieved in 2022. Looking forward, we see no shortage of opportunities to continue delivering better outcomes for customers at a lower cost all across the business. I'd note that not all of the 2023 reduction hit the bottom line, with the majority directly benefiting customers, including our self-insurance solution and substantial efficiencies in our vegetation management work.Our mid-teens by 2024 FFO-to-debt target is on track, and there is no change to our plan to reduce parent company debt by at least $2 billion by the end of 2026. We remain firmly committed to achieving solid investment-grade ratings. In December, we were pleased to see S&P revised its rating outlook from stable to positive, indicating the potential for an upgrade in the next 12 months. And earlier this week, I'm delighted to say that Moody's upgraded our rating by one notch, also leaving us some positive outlook. This puts us one notch away from investment grade and one step closer to our goal.We value the support we received from our regulators, helping us strengthen our balance sheet while we execute our plan to affordably serve customers and investors. For example, on February 1, the commission issued a proposed decision authorizing interim rate relief in the amount of $560 million, while our wildfire and gas safety cost application is pending. The interim relief may be voted on as early as March 7 and would provide for collection to start as soon as practical over a 12-month period.Moving to Slide 11. As you can see here, and as expected, the largest discrete driver of fourth quarter and full year results was the approval of our 2023 general rate case, which added $0.15. We also saw a benefit of $0.03, partly attributed to our nonfuel O&M savings, including better resource management and improved planning and execution.Please recall that our O&M savings are part of our simple, affordable model, which allows us to complete more work for the benefit of our customers while delivering affordability. That's exactly what you see here with $0.05 of redeployment. Our savings allowed us to stand up 10 additional model yards designed to improve frontline productivity with more efficient processes, minimizing rework and eliminating waste as we deliver for our customers. We also provided additional training resources for our coworkers, and we accelerated inspections going forward work to protect 2024 and ensuring we're doing the highest priority work for our customers.We use every extra resource to better serve our customers and achieve our commitments to you, our investors. We weathered the ups and downs to deliver consistent, predictable results. As Patti highlighted, we ended 2023 at the top of our EPS guidance range. although our core philosophy remains to redeploy excess earnings back into the system, benefiting customers while derisking and extending premium growth on behalf of investors.On Slide 12. We are extending our CapEx and rate base growth projections another year to include 2028, showing a 5-year annual rate base growth of 9.5%. Our new 5-year capital plan represents an increase of over $10 billion or approximately 20% over the 2023 to 2027 plans. This also is over 45% higher than the previous 5-year period from 2019 to 2023. The amounts shown on this slide reflect our base capital plan, including how much our rate base is already approved by regulators. The vast majority or 93% of our rate base for this year is already authorized as is 90% of our 2026 forecast.In addition to our plan, there are substantial needs to do more. Specifically, we have at least an incremental $5 billion of CapEx opportunities, which we will seek to fold into our plan while still meeting our affordability commitments. These include capacity investments and transmission upgrades to support continued system-wide growth. As we work to drive affordability under our simple, affordable model and ongoing deployment of lean, we will look for opportunities to add this important work.As you know, this capital investment fuels both earnings growth and improves our operating cash flow, as illustrated on Slide 13, which we have updated and extended since we first showed it at last year's Investor Day. As shown, we're projecting substantial improvement in our operating cash flow in 2024, partly as a result of the final GRC decision. Operating cash flow grows from $5 billion in 2023 to $11 billion by 2028, providing resources to grow our capital investment for customers from $9.8 billion in 2023 to $14 billion in 2028 and substantially improving our cash flow before dividends.As Patti mentioned, our guidance includes no new equity in 2024. As we look forward, we have many good efficient financing choices, including close to $2.5 billion of annual retained earnings today and rising from there at our present low level of dividend payout, half of our funding provided from normal utility debt, substantial levels of prior cost recovery, favorable tax conditions, for working capital improvements, the sale of a minority interest in our nonnuclear generation assets and potentially reintroducing an at the market, or ATM, equity program in 2025. While we are not giving the final mix of our 2025 financing plan today, rest assured that our plan only includes choices, which are accretive to our guidance. In light of this, we are extending our core EPS growth rate of at least 9% through 2027 and 2028.Moving to Slide 14. This is our simple affordable model and a breakdown of the 5.5% O&M savings last year. Patti shared details about our undergrounding achievements in 2023, and there are many more similar stories throughout the business. I'll share just one more with you today. At our Investor Day, you heard about improvements we were making to the new customer connections process by leveraging our performance playbook. Now here's how we ended the year. The team was able to save $24 million while decreasing average end-to-end lead time by 13%. That's a 50-day reduction.We also reduced engineering design time by 33%, a 37-day reduction. As a result, customer on-time delivery improved by 25 percentage points. I shared this example to make an important point. This is not a cost-cutting program at PG&E, rather this is about good business decisions, which are sustainable for the long term and it's about using the performance playbook, including the lean operating system to improve how we do our work every day. Our actions are improving the customer experience and making capital and safety investments affordable.I'll end here on Slide 15 with regulatory catalysts on the horizon in 2024. As you can see, they are still plentiful and include resolution of our proposed Pac Gen sale, a proposed decision in Phase 2 of our GRC implementing Senate Bill 410 and unlocking our potential to meet the new customer demands here in California, filing of our 10-year undergrounding plan and bring in our $5 billion of incremental capital opportunities into the plan while still meeting our affordability goals.Finally, I'll comment on our cost of capital adjustment advice letter, which was approved by commission staff in December, raising our allowed ROE from 10% to 10.7% and truing up our cost of debt. While this adjustment is already approved and in customer rates starting this month, in January, a joint intervenor group filed a late request for a review of SaaS approval. While we recognize this creates some uncertainty for investors, we were pleased that the commission staff upheld operation of the adjustment mechanism in December as intended. Intervenors offered no new fundamental arguments in their request for review, and we look forward to this issue being resolved expeditiously.In the meantime, as we have said consistently, our EPS growth guidance is not dependent on the outcome and we value the opportunity to redeploy the revenue uplift for the benefit of customers while delivering consistent, predictable results for investors. There's a lot to look forward to in 2024 and beyond, including our 10% core EPS growth guidance and our at least 9% growth rate now extended through 2028.With that, I'll hand it back to Patti."", 'Patricia Kessler Poppe', ""Thank you, Carolyn. Before we take your questions, let me introduce our new report card here on Slide 16, against which you'll be able to track our record of differentiated performance. We're showing our results for 2022 and 2023 along with our goals for 2024 and beyond.We believe we have a differentiated plan and the right team in place to deliver on these objectives. As I said earlier, performance is power, and we have significant operational momentum with a healthy set of catalysts in front of us. The PG&E turnaround is on track. We trust you feel the momentum as we do. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming investor conferences as well as our investor meeting scheduled for June 12 in New York.With that, operator, please open the lines for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.', 'Shahriar Pourreza', 'Just Patti, on the Pac Gen process, I mean, have you received sort of any feedback after the last round of communications with the commission? Any sort of thoughts on hurdles and deliberation? And as you guys are sort of planning around the scenarios, does the delay potentially move your equity needs, especially as you return OpCo cap structure to authorized levels?', 'Patricia Kessler Poppe', ""Yes. Thanks for the question, Shar. I'd say our communications with the commission have been very constructive regarding Pac Gen. We know that Pac Gen is a good transaction for customers. California has very long-term clean energy ambitions. And this is a beautiful fleet of clean energy resources that need investment over the coming years and to be able to share that with an investment partner is good for California's clean energy ambitions and good for customers.And so our extended time with the commission on these topics have been good. That helps us truly make the case. And frankly, the commission's had a lot on its plate. And so I can understand why they want a little more time. They know this is an important transaction. They want to give it a full look and our conversations have been very constructive with them regarding that.I'll hand it over to Carolyn and let her discuss about our financing plans, both with and without Pac Gen because we know Pac Gen isn't the only thing. Carolyn referenced an important set of choices that we have. Pac Gen is one of our choices for financing, but I'll let Carolyn go ahead and take that."", 'Carolyn J. Burke', ""Yes. Thanks, Shar, for the question. Yes, if you don't mind, I covered a lot of this in the call, but I do recognize it's been a busy morning for many of you. So let me just cover a couple of points there. First, as you know, we raised and extended our core EPS guidance today. That's 12% in 2023 and at least 10% in '24 and at least 9% now through 2028.Our refreshed 5-year plan includes improvement in our operating cash flows, rising from about $5 billion in 2023 to $11 billion in 2026. And that's providing the resources to grow our capital investment and further improve our cash flow.Three, can you point here, our guidance includes no new equity in '24 with or without Pac Gen. And then as we look forward beyond 2024, as we said on the call, we have many good financing choices and they include close to $2.5 billion of annual retained earnings today, which is rising at our present load level of dividend. We have half of our funding provided from normal utility debt. We talked about substantial levers of prior cost recovery, favorable tax conditions. We are constantly working our working capital improvements. And of course, we are potentially reintroducing an aftermarket or ATM equity program in 2025. We're not giving you all the final mix of that 2025 financing plan today, but one thing that you can count on is that our plan will include choices which are accretive to our guidance."", 'Shahriar Pourreza', 'Perfect.', 'Carolyn J. Burke', ""We think it's just simply -- perfect. Okay. Well, if I -- just one thing on -- because I do know -- and I just know I'm going to get lots of questions on the ATM. And so I just want to close that. I think it's -- I just want to say very clearly to everyone that's just simply too soon to size the potential ATM. As we've said on this call, we have a number of other good financing choices available to us, and we have other things that we need to consider, which include our growing lean capability and O&M savings, the pace at which we introduce the additional $5 billion of CapEx and then our own advocacy and timely regulatory outcomes and, of course, the pace of our dividend growth. So just -- there's a lot there, and I just thought maybe because it's been a busy morning, I want to just restate all of that for you all."", 'Patricia Kessler Poppe', ""Yes. And Shar, just to close out this subject, you asked a very fulsome question. So we gave you a fulsome answer. Just to close out, we ride the roller culture. This is what we do. There are ins and outs, ups and downs. We write that so that we can deliver this consistent earnings growth profile that we've described and we've committed to. We intend and we plan and are very confident that we can stand by our EPS growth guidance through 2028, even with the range of equity assumptions."", 'Shahriar Pourreza', ""Got it. And Carolyn, this is super helpful. And just to make sure we confirm this, it sounds like your -- I don't want to say shifting, but some of your prior messaging with the stock price kind of dictating your equity timing to now being a little bit more focused around a more systematic approach to raising equity through the trajectory, like the rest of this industry is transitioning towards. Is that a fair statement?"", 'Carolyn J. Burke', ""Well, I think what's important is that we stand by our commitment to you that we will find the most efficient financing available to us. And at this point in time, as we look at our stock, it is not the most efficient financing."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.', 'Steven Isaac Fleishman', 'You picked the wrong data report with NVIDIA blowing out. But -- so...', 'Patricia Kessler Poppe', ""It's a long game, Steve. It's a long game. We know it's going to be all right."", 'Steven Isaac Fleishman', ""Yes, yes. No, you bet, you bet. So the -- just the -- on the -- in the past, when you've talked about the growth rate, you also kind of talked to total return as part of that. And I know now that you've actually reinstated the dividend. Just any kind of reason that you didn't talk to that and just -- and how are you thinking about the dividend aspect as we stand today?"", 'Patricia Kessler Poppe', ""Yes. Thanks, Steve, for that question. And we know that this -- obviously, our dividend is low today and the growth rate of our dividend is an area of interest for a lot of people. So I'm glad you asked.Our intent truly is to have a competitive payout ratio. And we intend to show meaningful progress during this 5-year period. And so I'm happy to be able to share more about this 5-year planning horizon. So as we think about it, this catch-up growth rate will be significant, dramatically different from peers, given our starting point. So how quickly we move within these 5 years is obviously driven by our differentiating and differentiated financing choices that Carolyn just described.And so, in this near term, I do think it's important for people to remember that we are prioritizing a healthy balance sheet, affordable investment for customers, our premium EPS growth and then we will feather in that dividend over time. But it will obviously, as I said, have a dramatically different growth rate from peers given our starting point."", 'Steven Isaac Fleishman', ""Okay. No, that makes sense. And I guess it's better to be starting from disposition and choices and the opposite. And then just on the commission and just on the Pac Gen again, there's nothing to -- I mean, they don't -- we saw delays in a lot of things over time. This is just kind of the normal process there on that or is something else going on with respect to the Pac Gen approvals?"", 'Patricia Kessler Poppe', ""Yes. No, I think a couple of things just in terms of context. I do believe the adjudication of our rate case provide a lot of good visibility and discussion about cash flow, its importance. So I do think we definitely have better alignment with the commission on that subject for us, which is why we would be pursuing a Pac Gen transaction. I think they value the resources. And they want to make sure, on behalf of the customers of California that it's a good transaction for customers, we believe that it is a great transaction for customers. It sets us up to have a partnership over time to invest in these clean energy resources.We see growing load growth in California. We see need for new generation. This allows us to have a partner in that journey. And we know that, that will be the lowest cost of financing then for customers. And so we stand by the transaction. We know that additional time with the commission only allows us to better communicate and align with them on that."", 'Steven Isaac Fleishman', ""Okay. Great. And then one more question, just on the cash flow slide, which -- that was a very helpful slide. The -- and thinking about the, I guess, the deficits that's there, each year. I mean it's relatively modest. I mean can a lot of that just be met with the utility debt? Because I assume utility debt is not included in that yet."", 'Patricia Kessler Poppe', ""No. I think that's the way you're thinking. I think that's right the way you're thinking about it. I'll just remind you that there is an additional $5 billion of incremental CapEx that we're looking at financing as well. And we would, again, consider that -- ensure that we are financing that so that it's accretive to earnings."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Campanella with Barclays.', 'Nicholas Joseph Campanella', ""So I apologize, it's been a little all over the place, hopefully not repeating another question. But just the positive outlook, BAA1 and then, obviously, good to see the FFO to debt moved back to green here on the report card. Just what's your milestone -- what's your understanding of the milestones and just kind of the time line to get to investment grade now?"", 'Patricia Kessler Poppe', ""Yes. Thanks for the question, Nick. We've been having good conversations with both Moody's and S&P. We remain intently focused on improving the credit quality, and we're laser-focused on achieving investment grade. We continue to make good progress on improving our credit metrics every year, and we're continuing to target mid-teens FFO to debt to 2024.Our 5-year plan shows the significant progress in '24 and '25 with sustained high levels of cash generation, as you mentioned, and the rating agencies, obviously, are looking beyond just the credit metrics and beyond just our cash flow. They're also looking at improvements in our risk mitigation as it relates to wildfires, one more season perhaps for S&P. Moody's is laser focused as well on the wildfire mitigation, governance and management and improvement in our credit metrics.I think that's the most important gauge for you to look at when you consider milestones is the rating agencies and their reports themselves. We were very happy to see the recent upgrade and that we're -- we continue to be on positive outlook with both Moody's and S&P. So we're going to continue to execute on our plan, continue to execute on our risk mitigation, continue to execute on our O&M savings and continue to execute on ensuring that we see those improvements in our credit metrics for our rating agencies."", 'Nicholas Joseph Campanella', ""All right. And then I guess just the June 12 Investor Day in New York, just given you've extended the plan out to 28, which is great to see, by the way. But just how do we kind of think about what that Investor Day would bring? Is this kind of more of a financing update, just given the moving pieces in the strategic financing right now? Is that fair? Or how would you characterize it?"", 'Patricia Kessler Poppe', ""I'd say one of the things that we want to make sure people know is the California context and the California backdrop for the clean energy transition. This, I would say, is going to be a very differentiated part of our story relative to peers. We see the transition here in full swing, and we are a key player in that transition. So we look forward to sharing more about our load growth forecast, what that means, what does electrification really hold for both PG&E, our shareholders, our investors as well as our customers and our hometowns. So we look forward to really giving a better long-term business outlook and, of course, further refinement of our financial plan."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.', 'Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith', 'Hey team, can you guys hear me okay?', 'Patricia Kessler Poppe', 'We can hear you, Julien.', 'Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith', 'Wonderful. So look, I just wanted to follow up on a couple of things that were said thus far. In terms of updates around this ATM, I know you said you\'re expecting a lot of questions, but just to frame it out really. In terms of the time line here, I mean, a, you\'ve got to know what happens with Pac Gen by middle part of the year. But b, I suspect you\'re going to continue to evaluate asset sales. You said that would be something incremental to what Pac Gen would materialize that. And then by the end of the year, if there was nothing else that would materialize, then you would kind of go back to that sort of ""last resort ATM."" I mean given the success in cost cuts, et cetera, I mean, you could kind of interpret that as effectively saying, look, there\'s a lot of other levers we\'ll probably pull in the interim and a successful outcome at least at this stage with this equity price would be not necessarily pursuing an ATM. Is that kind of a fair way to frame it?', 'Carolyn J. Burke', ""The way I would frame it is more that it's -- one, it's really, as I said, just too soon to size a potential ATM in 2025. But we have a lot of good options to consider. And so -- and we're looking, in particular, as you just mentioned, our growing lean capability and those O&M savings, you see -- you saw that we achieved 3% in 2022 and last year 5.5%. So we're very excited about the success there and think that could be a factor.We talked about the additional $5 billion in new CapEx. We're going to make sure that, that's affordable to bring in to our plan and that we can finance it with one of these -- all of these options. So what's the timing that we introduced that $5 billion of new CapEx? And as you know, we do have a number of in-flight regulatory outcomes that we've been advocating for. And so the timing of those will really depend on how we're thinking about the ATM, a potential ATM in 2025. And of course, as Patti just covered, the timing of our dividend growth, we'll have more clarity on that and as we go into 2025 as well. So all of those are what really will drive a potential size of an ATM."", 'Julien Patrick Dumoulin-Smith', 'I appreciate you entertaining another question on this. And maybe just coming back, speaking of investment and successes, right, I appreciate your story, Patti. Can you talk a little bit to -- in light of those successes, how do you think about the cadence of undergrounding as you think about this year and further years? I mean has that sort of unlocked an ability to actually accelerate what you were doing earlier and really remain on track in a more structural way? And what would be the regulatory considerations around that, b, to the extent to which that was an avenue that you now see increasingly as possible?', 'Patricia Kessler Poppe', ""Yes. I do think last year was an important proof point for everybody, ourselves included, that it can be done and we can do undergrounding at scale and in an affordable way for customers, fundamentally changing the health and well-being of the customers who live near those lines. So that's our first point.But remember, the general rate case did reduce our mileage from what we had filed. So this year, we're actually probably going to do about 250 miles of undergrounding in line with the rate case. We will be filing our 10-year undergrounding plan as required by SB 884 and that will then give us a window into -- and hopefully, an approval by the end of '25, early '26 that we can see then in 2026 and beyond a 10-year plan for undergrounding as an important part of the climate resilient infrastructure of California.And again, I'll remind you, our undergrounding plan is not a big bet. It's about 8% of our total line miles, but it's 8% in the highest risk areas. So it eliminates this choice between reliability and safety for customers. They can have both and they can have that affordably. So we'll be able to make that case very well in our filing and our 10-year filing and show the total long-term net present value benefit to customers of doing that kind of infrastructure in those places. But our capital plan is very fulsome with a variety of capital investments, and it doesn't hinge on the undergrounding plan, though we stand by that important infrastructure again as climate resilient infrastructure for the people in California of the future, not the climate of the past, but the climate that's becoming more and more real, we need to have infrastructure that is up to the challenge."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Orrill with UBS.', 'Gregg Gillander Orrill', ""Just coming back to the cash flow slide, I was wondering if you could help fill in some of the drivers between '24 and '25. '25, the dot looks to be around $10 billion in cash flow versus the $8 billion in '24, but you've got the wildfire recoveries coming down. So obviously, depreciation is a driver of growth. Just struggling to connect the dots a little bit."", 'Patricia Kessler Poppe', ""So the $5 billion to the $8 billion from '23 to '24 is your question. What's driving that? Just making sure I'm..."", 'Gregg Gillander Orrill', ""Well, really to '25 because you've got the wildfire recoveries ramping down, but you've got the cash flow going up."", 'Patricia Kessler Poppe', ""Yes. Well, primarily, that is our GRC from '24 to '24, the additional revenues from there. In addition to that, just remember, we have our 2% savings being compounded. And so we see that.The other key part of '24 versus '25 is we see a decrease in litigation as it relates to our wildfires, has been part of our puzzle. And then as we -- our outlook on commodity prices, we have lower collateral postings as well. So there's a lot of moving parts, but the primary driver of the increase really is our rate base growth recovery from our GRC. That is the main part of the story, but there's a lot of other moving parts."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi.', 'Ryan Michael Levine', 'What would be the rate payer impact of a year delay to potential Pac Gen sale as you see it?', 'Patricia Kessler Poppe', ""Just the savings from Pac Gen sale, is that in terms of the benefits from that -- I'm sorry, I'm just making sure..."", 'Ryan Michael Levine', ""Yes. I mean you've articulated publicly or it means that there is rate benefit in this transaction. So I'm just trying to get a sense of why you see a delay of a year?"", 'Carolyn J. Burke', ""Yes. We think this is a great transaction for customers, right? It provides customer affordability primarily through financing cost at Pac Gen as well as because it's improving our balance sheet, we expect to be able to -- we expect to lower financing costs for our customers at PG&E as well. But as Patti mentioned, we also see significant benefits for customers because these assets are so key to the clean energy goals. And having a partner that is bringing both the resources and the interest and expertise in supporting these future capital growth needs of this very important portfolio, we think that's where it's particularly going to benefit customers. So they are the two things I would point to."", 'Ryan Michael Levine', 'Okay. And what is the enterprise lean maturity percentages in your scorecard measuring? It seems very specific around 44% for the recent year.', 'Patricia Kessler Poppe', ""Yes. We do an assessment of all of our leaders and what their maturity is of the adoption and implementation of our 5 basic place, and it's a self-assessment. So the team reviews what's the standard and how are they performing to the standard of these 5 plays. And the point of the 44% score is that, that means that we have lots of room to grow our maturity. And so if you can imagine, delivering 5.5% nonfuel O&M savings, at a maturity level in the 40s, just think of the potential benefit for customers and our processes and our O&M savings over time when we grow that maturity enterprise-wide."", 'Ryan Michael Levine', ""Okay. And then what are the practical implications of bills going out for gas in February and in March for electric, if the cost of capital trigger doesn't hold?"", 'Patricia Kessler Poppe', ""So if the cost of capital trigger does not hold with the implications, it's very minor in terms of the monthly bill rate for the cost of capital adjustment. It was a couple of bucks."", 'Ryan Michael Levine', 'Would that get reimbursed or in future years? Or mechanically, how does that work?', 'Patricia Kessler Poppe', 'I think it would depend on the determination and how that determination is implemented.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho Securities.', 'Anthony Christopher Crowdell', ""Just I wanted to have a quick follow-up to one of Nick's questions, I guess, on the credit rating. Curious, Carolyn, on S&P, I think you had stated there waiting for one more season. Do you know what they want to see in the one season prior to an upgrade?"", 'Carolyn J. Burke', ""I think it's another season of performance by our team. I think there are some folks, and we've heard this from even in analyst calls that the last 2 winters have been not significantly in terms of a wildfire season. But we've proven with our numbers when you even adjust for the weather that we are continuing to reduce wildfire risk. And I know Patti has a..."", 'Patricia Kessler Poppe', ""Yes, and I would just say, in our conversations with S&P, they focus on 3 main things. I would say, first, it's management and governance post bankruptcy. So I do believe that's what they're looking at first, and then they want to see additional wildfire performance, which we feel very confident about. And then finally, obviously, the financial metrics. And so, we do -- we're -- we've been on positive outlook with them. They put us on positive outlook at the end of the year. So we look forward to them moving on that sometime in 2024."", 'Anthony Christopher Crowdell', ""Great. And then just one follow-up on the cost of capital challenge. Is there a date where -- I don't know if the right term is the challenge gets dismissed or I know it's already in rates. I know it's not going to impact the company's '24 guidance. But just is there a date where the commission denies the challenge?"", 'Patricia Kessler Poppe', ""There is nothing firm or definitive about that. But you're right, your thoughts are correct, though, that it isn't rates and it doesn't have a bearing on our '24 earnings other than to say that we have planned conservatively for either outcome."", 'Operator', 'Our final question comes from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.', 'David Keith Arcaro', ""Great to see you're extending the EPS growth rate here. I was just wondering kind of what gave you the confidence now to provide those EPS growth assumptions through '28 given that there's another cost of capital, proceeding another in the midst of that planning period?"", 'Patricia Kessler Poppe', ""We have a great plan, and it's anchored in our simple, affordable model. We have ample capital demand. And this is the thing that I want to just acknowledge for our customers who are feeling the catch-up in our bills right now. We know that we can deliver this capital infrastructure, which they have been demanding and requesting and asking for us to deliver in an affordable way.So as we look forward, we have a conservative plan. We ride that roller coaster so we can deliver a consistent outcome for investors and better service every single year for customers. And frankly, we look forward to a time in the not-too-distant horizon where we're going to be lowering bills for customers as we do that. The simple affordable model will work here in California.We are in the early days. But as we look forward, we see the capital demand matched by our cost savings, load growth and efficient financing, which allows for affordable bills for customers. That's a formula that can work for a long time forward. It gives us a lot of confidence as we give forecasted EPS growth guidance in the next 5-year plan."", 'Carolyn J. Burke', ""And David, I'll just remind you, we always plan conservatively. And so that's what gives us also lots of confidence."", 'David Keith Arcaro', ""Okay. Excellent. And then maybe on load growth, it's the data center backdrop seems to have changed quite a bit maybe since you've given that 1% to 3% load growth figure. And it sounds like you might address that in upcoming Analyst Day. I was just wondering if that's reflective of what you've seen in your service territory in terms of that data center demand. Is that accelerating ramping up from what your prior expectations had been?"", 'Patricia Kessler Poppe', ""Yes. Well, I can share that just in 2023, we had a 3x increase in data center applications versus the prior 4 years. So as we look at the 5-year forward load growth forecast, the back end of that forecast will reflect then the additional data center demand. And look, I think we all can agree that the only thing that's happening with data centers is they need more of them. And so part of the deal here is we need to make ourselves available and accessible and show that we can in fact serve that load here in California, which is what we're doing. And we'll look forward to sharing more about that in June."", 'Operator', 'I would now like to turn the call over to Patti Poppe for closing remarks.', 'Patricia Kessler Poppe', ""Thank you, Mandeep. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I know it was a busy one, and we appreciate your time and attention. We look forward to staying in touch with you.I just want to give a final remark and thank the entire PG&E team for delivering an outstanding 2023 for customers. They deliver for our hometowns. We're serving our planet, and we're leading with love at PG&E, and I couldn't be more proud to stand alongside with the men and women of PG&E to do just that. So we feel really great about our turnaround. We know that, that turnaround is on track. Thanks to all those great people here at the company, and we look forward to seeing all of you in the coming months and definitely in June, on June 12 in New York. Thanks so much.

66,96030989-f12f-331a-8691-ff4602a1583f,MRO,2024-02-23,Here's What Analysts Are Forecasting For Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) After Its Yearly Results,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-analysts-forecasting-marathon-oil-103550068.html,1708684550,STORY,['MRO'],"[""It's been a good week for Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) shareholders, because the company has just released its latest annual results, and the shares gained 3.2% to US$23.98. Results were roughly in line with estimates, with revenues of US$6.7b and statutory earnings per share of US$2.56. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year."", ' View our latest analysis for Marathon Oil ', ""Taking into account the latest results, Marathon Oil's 16 analysts currently expect revenues in 2024 to be US$6.64b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are expected to reduce 4.6% to US$2.53 in the same period. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$6.75b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$2.92 in 2024. So there's definitely been a decline in sentiment after the latest results, noting the substantial drop in new EPS forecasts."", ""The consensus price target held steady at US$31.01, with the analysts seemingly voting that their lower forecast earnings are not expected to lead to a lower stock price in the foreseeable future. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. There are some variant perceptions on Marathon Oil, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$39.00 and the most bearish at US$24.00 per share. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view."", ""Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. We would highlight that revenue is expected to reverse, with a forecast 0.9% annualised decline to the end of 2024. That is a notable change from historical growth of 8.5% over the last five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the same industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 1.3% annually for the foreseeable future. It's pretty clear that Marathon Oil's revenues are expected to perform substantially worse than the wider industry."", ""The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. Fortunately, the analysts also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Although our data does suggest that Marathon Oil's revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$31.01, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets."", 'Keeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider.

And in the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourselves to 1 question and a follow-up. Lee?"", 'Lee M. Tillman', ""Thank you, Guy, and good morning to everyone joining us on our call today. As I always start these calls, I want to first and foremost thank our employees and contractors for their dedication and hard work in delivering the excellent results we have the privilege of discussing today and I especially want to thank our employees and contractors for their enduring commitment to our core values. On that trend, we have a few notable accomplishments to highlight today.First, we delivered a record safety year in 2023, as measured by total recordable incident rate for both our employees and our contractors. This builds on a multiyear track record of top quartile TRIR in our industry. Providing a safe, healthy and secure workplace remains a top priority for us, with our safety performance a key element of our executive and employee compensation scorecards. Second, we continue to make progress in reducing our natural gas flaring, improving our total company gas capture to 99.5% in 2023, a new high for our company. We will continue to work hard on our journey of continuous improvement, moving toward our ultimate objective of Zero Routine Flaring. And third, we achieved our 2025 GHG intensity reduction goal of 50% relative to 2019 levels a full 2 years ahead of schedule, consistent with our objective to help meet the world's growing demand for oil and natural gas while achieving the highest standards of environmental excellence. We are a results-driven company, but how we deliver those results matters, and I couldn't be more proud of our people and what they've accomplished. Yet this type of delivery isn't new for us. It's the continuation of a well-established trend. And before I get into our 2023 results and 2024 outlook, I'd like to reflect on what I believe is our unmatched track record of delivering on our framework for success. We're now more than 3 years into our more S&P, Less E&P journey. My challenge to our company was to raise our game and compete heads up with not just the best companies in our sector, but with the best companies in the S&P 500. And to do so year in, year out through the commodity cycle on the metrics that matter most, sustainable free cash flow generation, return of capital to shareholders and capital and operating efficiencies. For the last 3 years, we've consistently held true to our framework for success. We prioritized corporate returns, sustainable free cash flow, meaningful return of capital, and we delivered differentiated execution quarter in, quarter out. We've continued to enhance our multi-basin portfolio, which has produced the best capital efficiency in the sector. And we protected our investment-grade balance sheet while prioritizing all elements of our ESG performance. I believe our commitment to our strategy and the consistency of our execution over the last 3 years have successfully differentiated Marathon Oil in the marketplace. The proof points are summarized in Slide 6 of our deck. First, sustainable free cash flow generation. Through disciplined corporate returns-focused capital allocation, we generated $8.4 billion of free cash flow over the trailing 3 years. That equates to over 60% of our current market cap, almost double that of our E&P peers and 6x that of the S&P 500. Next, a meaningful return of capital to shareholders. Over the last 3 years, we've consistently held true to our transparent cash flow-driven return of capital framework that prioritizes our investors as the first call on cash flow, not the drill bit and not inflation. In total, we've returned $5.6 billion to our shareholders, equivalent to over 40% of our current market cap. Again, that's double that of our E&P peers and well in excess of the S&P 500. [Third], capital and operating efficiency, a testament to the quality of our multi-basin portfolio and the extreme discipline inherent in both our capital allocation and cost structure. Over the trailing 3 years, we've delivered the lowest reinvestment rate in the E&P sector, below the S&P average. And our well-level capital efficiency, according to independent third-party data, has been the best in the E&Ps peer space, 35% superior to the peer average. And 2023 was emblematic of these 3 proof points. Last year, we delivered $2.2 billion of adjusted free cash flow, $1.7 billion of shareholder distributions equivalent to 41% of our CFO, providing a shareholder distribution yield of more than 12%, $1.5 billion of share repurchases that drove a 9% reduction to our outstanding share count, a 22% increase to our base dividend while maintaining our peer low free cash flow breakeven, $500 million of gross debt reduction and 28% growth in our production per share, driven by our share repurchase program and the seamless integration of the Ensign Eagle Ford acquisition. That's what comprehensive delivery on our key properties looks like. And if you liked 2023, then you will not be disappointed in our 2024 business plan, which offers more of the same as we continue to build on our multiyear track records. We have confidence in our strategy and in our capital allocation and return of capital frameworks and our focus will be on consistently executing our plan amidst all the volatility inherent in our sector. And at the end of the day, I expect our plan to again benchmark with the very best companies in our sector, outperforming the S&P 500. More specifically, this year, we expect our $2 billion capital program to deliver approximately $1.9 billion of free cash flow, assuming $75 WTI and $2.50 Henry Hub and $10 TTF. We fully recognize that we are a price taker, not a price predictor, and commodity price volatility impacts our financial outcomes. As such, we've provided cash flow sensitivities for each of the key commodities within our slide deck to help you model expectations based on your own commodity forecast. We'll stay true to our CFO return of capital framework, expecting to return at least 40% of our CFO to shareholders, again providing visibility to a double-digit shareholder distribution yield. We expect the underlying capital efficiency of our 2024 capital program to improve as we maintain our well productivity leadership and work all avenues to improve capital efficiency, including further extending lateral lengths. And perhaps most importantly, we believe our results are sustainable. That's true for our U.S. multi-basin portfolio, and that's true for our integrated gas business in EG. As you all know, our EG business now has no Henry Hub exposure, with the expiration of our legacy contract at the end of 2023. That business is now fully realizing global LNG pricing, which will drive improved financial performance this year. We believe this improvement is sustainable due to all the great work our team has done to advance the E.G. Gas Mega Hub concept. For example, over the next 5 years, we're expecting our EG business to generate cumulative EBITDAX of approximately $2.5 billion, assuming flat $10 TTF commodity pricing. With that, I'll turn it over to Dane, who will walk through our commitment to return of capital while also fortifying our investment-grade balance sheet."", 'Dane E. Whitehead', ""Thank you, Lee, and good morning, everybody. As Lee mentioned, in 2023, we continued building on our peer-leading track record of returning capital to shareholders as consistent with our differentiated cash flow driven framework that prioritizes our shareholder as the first call on capital. Importantly, we did this while continuing to make progress on our balance sheet objectives through $500 million of gross debt reduction. We've built a track record of providing a truly compelling shareholder return proposition while at the same time continuing to enhance our investment-grade balance sheet. We did both in 2023, and that's my expectation again for 2024. More specifically, on our 2023 return of capital delivery, total shareholder returns amounted to $1.7 billion, including more than $400 million during the fourth quarter. That translates to 41% of our CFO, consistent with our framework, and an annual distribution yield of over 12% on our current market cap, compelling relative to any investment opportunity in the market. The majority of shareholder returns came in the form of share repurchases, which reduced our share count by 9% last year. That's about double the share count reduction of our next closest competitor. For full year 2023, we grew our oil production per share by a peer-leading 28% due to our share repurchase program and the integration of the accretive Ensign acquisition (inaudible). Looking to 2024, we expect to prioritize free cash flow via our disciplined capital allocation framework by holding our top line oil production flat. We also remain focused on driving significant per share growth and fully expect to maintain our long-held leadership position in the peer group. While the majority of our capital returns to 2023 came in the form of share repurchases, our base dividend remains foundational, and we remain committed to paying a competitive and sustainable base dividend to our shareholders. During 2023, we raised our base dividend by 22%, one of the strongest growth rates in our sector. Importantly, we did so with laser focus on sustainability, maintaining 1 of the lowest post-dividend free cash flow breakevens in the peer group. Our consistent and committed approach to shareholder returns over the last 3 years has positively differentiated our company, and our approach in 2024 will remain the same. Priority #1 remains consistently delivering returns of at least 40% of our CFO in the form of share repurchases and base dividends. That minimum 40% level translates to about $1.6 billion of expected shareholder distributions and a reference price deck, again providing visibility to a compelling double-digit shareholder distribution yield. With our stock trading in the low $20 per share range and at a free cash flow yield in the mid-teens at strip pricing, repurchases remain highly value accretive. They are also a very efficient means to continue driving our per share growth and our highly synergistic, we're continuing to grow our per share base dividend without negatively impacting our peer-leading free cash flow breakeven. To summarize our 2024 return of capital plans, at least 40% of our CFO to shareholders, which will be near the top of our sector, driving peer-leading per share growth and competitive sustainable growth in our base dividend. We're also committed to further improving our investment-grade balance sheet, and we plan to direct excess cash flow to continue reducing gross debt. We have tremendous financial strength and flexibility in our capital structure, with net debt to EBITDA of approximately 1x at strip pricing. We have $400 million of tax-exempt bonds that mature this year. This is a really unique vehicle in our capital structure, and we'll likely remarket those at an advantaged interest rate relative to taxable debt as we've done previously. We also have plenty of flexibility to manage the [1.2] remaining outstanding on our Ensign term loan due at the end of this year. The markets are wide open for us to potentially refinance enforcement of that debt. And as a reminder, we have $2.1 billion of available capacity on our credit facility that matures in 2027. And even if we opt to refinance in total, the maturing tax-exempt bonds and the term loan, we will retain capacity to pay off at par, almost $1.5 billion of commercial paper and bonds, which would get us to our medium-term gross debt goal of $4 billion. One final comment for me on our '24 outlook before I turn it over to Mike to walk through some of the details of our capital program. Consistent with our prior messaging, our 2024 financial guidance assumes we'll transition to becoming an alternative minimum tax or AMT cash taxpayer this year. The AMT tax rate is 15% on our pretax U.S. income. Our primary exposure here is domestic, as our EG income will largely be offset by current year foreign tax credits. The new information we're providing today involves research and development or R&D tax credits. We recently completed a study of capital spent in past years on organic enhancement activities that qualified for R&D tax credits. As a result, we expect to apply approximately $150 million of these R&D tax credits this year as a direct offset to a significant portion of our 2024 AMT cash payments. A direct benefit to our free cash flow is most likely not included in any sell-side models at this point. With that, I'll hand over to Mike, who will walk us through the final points of our '24 capital program."", 'Michael A. Henderson', ""Thanks, Dane. As we highlighted earlier, we're a results-driven company, so I'll start with the expected bottom line results of our 2024 capital program. We expect our $2 billion capital program to deliver $1.9 billion of free cash flow with 1 of the lowest reinvestment rates and free cash flow breakeven in the segment. This will enable us to deliver our investors a truly compelling shareholder return profile. We fully anticipate these bottom line financial outcomes and the underlying capital efficiency of our 2024 program, again, benchmark at the very top of our high-quality E&P peer group. To deliver these outcomes, we operate approximately 9 rigs and 4 frac crews on average this year. We expect our capital program to again be first half-weighted with about 60% of our CapEx concentrated in the first half of the year, largely a function of the timing of our wells to sales. This should drive stronger production and underlying free cash flow over the second half of the year. At the midpoint of our full year guidance, we expect to deliver flat total company oil production of approximately 190,000 barrels of oil per day, consistent with what we previewed last quarter. Yet importantly, as Dane highlighted, we fully expect to continue driving significant growth in oil production on a per share basis. We're guiding to a modest year-on-year decline in our oil equivalent production this year. This BOE decline is largely a function of well mix and our focus on value over volume. Given the extreme weakness in natural gas prices relative for oil, we're allocating capital to the oil [list] and thus, high volume areas in each of our plays, consistent with our prioritization of corporate returns and free cash flow generation. We're also expecting some modest ongoing base decline in Equatorial Guinea. As is typical for our business and consistent with last year, there will be some quarter-to-quarter variability in our production. First quarter should mark a low point for the year, impacted by about 4,000 barrels of oil per day of winter weather-related outages, largely concentrated in the Bakken. We will then grow from first quarter levels as we bring more wells to sales as the year progresses. Now to the more important details of our 2024 program. We expect to deliver our flat oil production guidance with 5% to 10% fewer net wells to sales than last year. This is a function of improving underlying capital efficiency, driven by durable well productivity at peer-leading levels, an additional 5% increase to our average lateral length and modest deflationary capture that is built on conservative underlying assumptions. Approximately 70% of our total capital will be allocated to our high confidence Eagle Ford and Bakken programs where we've demonstrated track record of execution excellence. For 2023, external state data indicates we delivered 6 months per foot oil productivity, 60% better than the basin average in the Eagle Ford and 40% better than the basin average in the Bakken. With our cost structure, we believe we're leading each basin in capital efficiency. We expect another year of leading performance in 2024 as we maintain our productivity advantage and finally, to continue enhancing our capital efficiency. The bulk of our remaining resource play spend will be dedicated to the Permian, where we're increasing our activity and capital investment in a disciplined manner. Since getting back to work with a consistent D&C program in the Permian a couple of years ago, we've delivered among the best well productivity in the basin with competitive drilling and completion performance. We're transitioning to an almost exclusive 2-mile plus lateral program. This year, over 20% of our Permian wells will be 3-mile laterals. We'll get into more details in EG in a minute. But our EG CapEx will be up modestly this year, with spend limited to long lead items in preparation for potential Alba and (inaudible). Our nondevelopment capital is higher this year due largely to more environmental, regulatory and emissions related spending, as well as some nonrecurring projects such as water infrastructure and pipeline additions. For context, a couple of years ago, this bucket represented about 5% of our total capital. It's about 10% this year. Importantly, however, we expect our non-D&C capital to peak this year and to trend lower in 2025. I would also add that many of those projects designated as emissions related have the added economic benefit of enhancing our reliability and uptime performance. Now to Lee for EG and the wrap-up."", 'Lee M. Tillman', ""Thank you, Mike. Focusing on Slide 15 in our deck. With the expiration of our legacy Henry Hub-linked LNG contract at the end of last year, our EG Integrated Gas business is now fully realizing global LNG pricing. And in January, we lifted our first cargo under these new contractual terms. Consistent with our prior disclosure, the majority of our Alba LNG sales are covered by the 5-year sales contract we announced last year. That contract is TTF-linked. The balance of our 2024 LNG cargoes have now all been contracted but at a JKM price linkage. This will afford us a nice combination of both TTF and JKM price exposure this year. Although global LNG pricing has weakened somewhat on warmer winter weather, the arbitrage between global LNG and Henry Hub pricing is still significant, and therefore, should still drive improved financial performance for our international operations. We're guiding to $550 million to $600 million of EG EBITDAX this year, assuming $10 TTF. That's a significant increase from actual 2023 EBITDAX generation of $309 million. Importantly, we don't expect this to be a 1-year financial uplift. For some time, we've been focused on sustaining this improved financial performance by progressing all elements of the EG Gas Mega Hub concept supported by the HOA signed with the EG government and our partner last year. The 5-year EG EBITDAX outlook we're providing today is intended to demonstrate the sustainability of our EG cash flow generation. Over the next 5 years, we expect to deliver cumulative EG EBITDAX of approximately $2.5 billion, assuming $10 TTF and $80 Brent flat. Beyond realizing global LNG pricing, there are a few drivers of the strong performance over the duration of the 5-year period. They include ongoing methanol volume optimization to maximize higher margin, higher working interest LNG throughput and Alba infill well program, which will help mitigate Alba decline and maximize the amount of Alba equity gas through the LNG plant in the coming years, and further monetization of third party gas through the ethane gas cap as we continue to take full advantage of our unique and highly valuable gas monetization infrastructure in 1 of the most gas-prone areas of the world. And while this 5-year EBITDAX scenario reflects the life of our recent global LNG sales agreement, we fully expect to extend the life of EG LNG beyond the next 5 years well into the next decade as we continue to advance the longer-term Gas Mega Hub concept. In summary, consistent with our more S&P mandate for the last 3 years, we've been delivering financial performance highly competitive with the most attractive investment alternatives in the market as measured by corporate returns, free cash flow generation and return of capital. I fully expect 2024 to build on this track record. Our compelling investment case is simple. High-quality, multi-basin U.S. portfolio and integrated global gas business that delivers peer-leading free cash flow, a unique and differentiated return of capital framework that provides our shareholders with the first call on cash flow, the output of which is clear visibility to compelling shareholder distributions across a broad range of commodity prices, sector-leading growth and per share metrics. And a multiyear track record of consistent execution and proven discipline. And perhaps most importantly, everything we're doing is sustainable through the commodity cycle. This is due to the quality and depth of our U.S. multi-basin portfolio, where we have over a decade of high return inventory and a disciplined and multifaceted approach to portfolio renewal. It's also due to our differentiated integrated gas business that's now fully realizing global LNG pricing as we continue progressing all elements of the regional Gas Mega Hub concept. Rest assured, our commitment to our strategy is unwavering, and is built upon our core values, resilience across the commodity cycle and our long-term track record of success. With that, we can open the line for Q&A."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please proceed.', 'Arun Jayaram', 'Lee, I want to start off with -- on M&A. Obviously, a significant level of industry M&A activity, including a large transaction announced in your Bakken backyard last night. I was wondering if you could provide some perspective on how should we think about M&A for MRO post the Ensign transaction. And I did want to cite a recent example of a low-cost Permian producer as a low-cost structure such as yourself, did announce a deal to get more scale in the Permian, adding more sticks on the map and the multiple -- appears to have [re-rated] on that deal. So again, just some thoughts on where the M&A landscape and what this means for MRO.', 'Lee M. Tillman', ""Thank you, Arun. First of all, size and scale are important, but it is not obviously just about getting bigger. It's about how do we get better. So any consolidation opportunity fundamentally needs to enhance our ability to execute on the path that we've been on really for the last 3 years that I just described in my opening remarks. We have a very clear, very transparent framework for assessing M&A. That framework is unchanged. And if anything, the bar is even higher now with the successful addition of the Ensign asset that you mentioned. And just as a reminder, Arun, there are really 5 elements of that criteria. First and foremost, of course, is accretion to financial metrics. Secondly, accretion to our cash flow-driven return of capital framework. Third, accretion to our resource or inventory life with inventory that competes for capital from day 1. Clear industrial logic, which to us means going into basins where we have a well-established level of execution, excellence and credibility. And then finally, of course, doing all this without any harm to our investment-grade balance sheet. We know that's a challenging criteria. But we can be discerning, and we can be patient. As I mentioned, with over a decade-plus of high-quality inventory, we can wait for those opportunities like Ensign that ticks all the boxes. And that's what made Ensign so compelling. I mean, we integrated that asset into our operations in essentially a couple of months, Mike and his team did a fantastic job doing that. We never missed a step, and we've seen others stumble in that very critical integration step. So can we be an acquirer? Absolutely. Should you expect us to still apply our criteria and be discerning and be as disciplined as we are in our organic business? Absolutely."", 'Arun Jayaram', 'Great. My follow-up is on EG. Lee, you provided a 5-year outlook, which suggests relatively stable earnings profile or EBITDAX relative to your 2024 guide. I was wondering if you could talk about opportunities to extend these financial outcomes in EG beyond the 5-year threshold. As well as I was wondering if you could address the recent decision by a super major to exit EG? And does that open up any opportunities for you given that country exit?', 'Lee M. Tillman', ""Absolutely. Well, first of all, I want to be very clear. The 5-year view we provided was really just a scenario that matched up with the LNG sales agreement that we just inked last year. And so you should not interpret that as a life of LNG kind of model. This was just to match up with that certainty that we now had around that 5-year TTF-linked LNG sales agreement. The reality is that when we look at all of the things that we have active now, NEG, whether that's methanol volume optimization, the future potential for Alba infill drilling and even more third-party molecules like Aseng, we already see the path to extend well past 2030. So don't view that 5-year view as anything other than just matching up with, in fact, that 5-year sales agreement that we inked on TTF. In terms of exits out of EG by super majors, clearly, that's a very unique set of circumstances where you have a concession that's kind of at the end of its PSC term. It's a very mature oil play there. And again, pretty much an end of field life that likely is going to be taken over by the government and run by the government. So very different set of opportunities than we would look like. And again, I would just take you back, Arun, to the criteria that we just talked about and making sure that we look at any opportunity through that same lens when we're talking about doing something inorganically. But we do believe there's a lot of opportunity outside of that within NEG, both from an equity molecule standpoint as well as a third-party molecule standpoint. And the good news for us is when we were able to bring the Alen molecule, to EG LNG, that first kind of third party framework, we can now replicate that framework going forward and that project constructed a very significant piece of infrastructure that we can now use for the future."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities.', 'Neal David Dingmann', ""First question is likely for Mike. On your -- you mentioned, Mike, you referenced the leading operational efficiencies, which you noted. I'm just wondering, could you maybe give a little more detail? Is it largely the longer laterals? Or maybe what other key drivers would you point us to that's really driving this remarkable upside?"", 'Michael A. Henderson', ""Yes. Well, Neal, I can certainly answer that. So yes. Underlying resource play capital efficiency, as we noted, is improving in '24. And I highlighted a few things there in my prepared remarks. But I think it probably starts with that consistently strong peer-leading well productivity. When I look at our '24 productivity by basin compared to '23 and Eagle Ford, I would say '24 is looking very comparable to what we delivered in '23. When I look at the Bakken, I would actually say our productivity is up marginally in '24, really on the back of -- we are going to go back into Myrmidon and complete a few wells there. And then in the Permian, it looks pretty flat from '23 to '24. So I think that's the first thing I would point to. The second thing, as you noticed, was the longer laterals. We mentioned in the prepared remarks, they were up 5% at a company level. And Eagle Ford, they're up about 10% year-on-year. Even Bakken is up just notionally a couple of percentage points. And then you look at the Permian, they're up by 10% as well. And that is a big part of that capital efficiency driver. And then the third part is we are forecasting a little bit of deflation, albeit very modest, kind of low single-digit numbers there."", 'Neal David Dingmann', ""Makes a lot of sense. And then my second question, Lee, maybe for you or Dane, just on capital allocation. I'm just wondering, is there anything that would cause you to move towards -- more towards the variable dividends? Or do you believe your active buyback program continues to be most strategic? And maybe around that, I mean how should we continue to think about per share growth? Obviously, you keep buying the shares back, it really continues to ramp that nicely. So I'd just love to hear your comments there."", 'Dane E. Whitehead', ""Yes. Neal, this is Dane. I'll take a first cut at it. So the bottom line is, we expect our framework and sort of the mix of return vehicles to remain unchanged in 2024. We've said all along, sort of variable dividend is a third mechanism that sits on the table, but it's not front and center for us at this point.The 40% return to shareholders is a very firm commitment. That's our primary commitment for use of capital. Base dividend, I talked about, the sustainability of that base dividend is critically important to us. So dividend increases will probably be driven by the pace of share repurchases as much as anything. Because that kind of keeps the post dividend breakeven flat. And it's -- right now, we're peer leading in the low- to mid-40s. Share buybacks, again at mid-teens, free cash flow yield, super-efficient vehicle. And as you noted, they drive that per share growth on a pretty significant basis. The second use of CapEx -- available cash for us -- and you saw us do some of it this year is pay down debt. We paid down $500 million worth of debt last year. Our leverage levels are more comfortable with. They are like onetime net debt-to-EBITDA at strip pricing, but I'd like to get them down. And we've stated we've got $5.4 million of gross debt today. We'd like to drive that down to [$4 million] gross debt, which was the pre-Ensign debt level. And so we'll continue to allocate some excess free cash flow in excess of the 40% return to further improving the balance sheet."", 'Lee M. Tillman', ""Maybe I'll just add 1 thing to that, too. I think the power of a consistent and meaningful share repurchase program, you really see that showing up in the growth in the per share metrics that really matter. If you just look at 2023, we took out 9% of our outstanding shares. That was roughly double the next best in our [peer group]. And of course, that translated into tremendous value growth on a per share basis for our shareholders. So we still believe in that. I mean, again, we kind of look through the cycle. It's a program that we set in place and let it run. We dollar our average, and we think it's very powerful. If you rewind all the way back to October '21, that 9% comes 27% of our shares outstanding that we've retired. So it's been a very powerful program for us, and we remain extremely committed. We still have $2.3 billion of outstanding authorization against the repurchase program with our Board of Directors."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Matt Portillo with TPH.', 'Matthew Merrel Portillo', 'Two asset-level questions that I wanted to run by you. I guess, first in the Bakken, looking at the early time results on Ajax, looks quite encouraging from a production and productivity perspective. Just curious if you could talk about potentially your learnings on the spacing design here? And then also, as you kind of look across your acreage position, how much of your Bakken acreage might be set up for a 3-mile development moving forward?', 'Michael A. Henderson', ""Yes, I'll answer that one, Matt. In terms of the spacing pattern there, it was in a kind of [5 by 0] spacing. So 5 wells in the Middle Bakken, there's no Three Forks opportunity down there. And as you probably know, that's kind of down to the southwest of the Hector area, where we've been pretty active in the last couple of years. What I'd say in terms of maybe a read through, probably feels a little bit early. I don't have a lot of data to share.Obviously, we've just brought 3 of the wells online. We've got some early production there. What I'd probably tell you, this quarter may well change next quarter. So rest assured, though, we'll continue to work our land position there hard. And if there are any opportunities to get more extended laterals, you can expect us to be talking about those in the future."", 'Lee M. Tillman', ""I think 1 of the things I would add too, Matt, though, is that certainly, even though we're still waiting for a little bit more longitudinal production data to declare victory, when you look at the total well cost per foot and the savings that we've already captured there, it's very significant. So from an execution standpoint, we feel very good about the D&C performance. So as we said, early returns on the production side, very strong, but absolutely encouraging on the cost side on the D&C side."", 'Michael A. Henderson', ""Matt, I'll maybe provide a little bit more color there. The first of the wells that we did execute on TWC per foot base, we're looking at loosely 24 -- 25%, sorry, below comparable 2 milers. I think you couple that with the early production, a couple of thousand barrels of oil equivalent a day, 80% oil. The IPs will probably be not as stout as you might expect in Hector, but I think you'll get that volumes back over the long term. So as we pointed out, you take the well productivity with the well costs. And I would like to think that that's going to present a pretty compelling case for Ajax in the future."", 'Matthew Merrel Portillo', ""Great. And then just as a follow-up, it looks like the Texas Delaware is going to be about 1/3 of your program, give or take, in 2024. Curious, one, on the development plan here. Are you moving towards development? Or are you still working on delineating the resource? I know that 2023 was still kind of a learning year for you. And then two, just curious how well costs have progressed in this area. I think that was also kind of an initiative last year to get more reps on wells and get the cost down in the Texas Delaware play, given that there's high productivity trends, but the cost out of the ledger still needed some work."", 'Patrick J. Wagner', ""Matt, this is Pat. I'll take the development piece, and maybe I'll let Mike take up the cost piece. Yes, as you said, this -- we moved this project into our development team last year. So it's no longer an exploration project, it is in our development program. As I think you probably know, we have 13 wells that have been online for some time, 9 in the Woodford, 4 in the Meramec. They continue to perform just as we expect. Excellent productivity, high oil cut and shallow declines, low [water-oil] ratios. We will be bringing on 9 wells this year. Two of those are leasehold wells, and then there's 2 multi-well pads that we'll be bringing on. We've gone to longer laterals. We have this 57,000 acre blocky position. So that gives us the ability to drill really long laterals. The wells we're bringing on this year will average around 2 miles. Next year, the wells we'll be drilling in the future will be up to 13,000 feet. From a development standpoint, we're still looking at 4 x 4 spacing in the Woodford and the Meramec. I think I hit it all there, maybe."", 'Michael A. Henderson', ""Yes, Matt, from a cost perspective, what I'd say is we're kind of still [net] programs, so to speak. We've just completed drilling the wells, not completed them yet. So don't have all of the data to share. What I would say from a drilling perspective, costs are in line with kind of predrill expectations. What I would say maybe the encouraging thing is, as we progressed through the drilling, it seemed that the efficiencies were getting better. And therefore, when we do get all on cost spend, I would expect you would see that natural -- that improvement in the cost as we get, quite frankly, we could get more reps."", 'Lee M. Tillman', ""Yes. One other thing I'll just mention, too, this is a little bit of a subtlety. But the fact that -- we brought the 2 asset teams, Permian and Oklahoma, together. Now that's under a single leadership structure. And this is 1 of the areas where we can benefit from learning because of course, Woodford/Meramec drilling and completing in Oklahoma. That's something that we've already kind of cut our teeth in. So we're bringing a lot of those learnings and expertise now into this, if you will, joint asset team now that we have this Texas Delaware play with the Woodford/Meramec because it is challenging drilling. I mean, let's be honest, it's deeper, it's hard pressure. It's more challenging hard rock drilling. So bringing that expertise in from Oklahoma is certainly allowing us to advance up the learning curve a bit more efficiently."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.', 'Neil Singhvi Mehta', ""The first question I had was just post-2024 capital efficiency this year, another very strong year. But as you think about setting the sticks for 2025 and ensuring that you're able to sort of continue at this capital efficiency pace? Just some thoughts, post-2024. And can you hold 190 of oil at $2 billion of CapEx?"", 'Lee M. Tillman', ""Yes. Well, it feels like we're just now releasing 2024. So [definitely think] 2025 is a bit of a leap. But first of all, let me just say we're -- we feel very good about our, I'll say, underlying well productivity. I think it's actually pretty remarkable when you think about the fact that we operated 2 what the market uses very mature basins, and we're still very much holding the line on productivity that is already at the top of the peer specs. So I think you have to keep all of this in the proper context. And certainly, as we do our longer-term modeling, clearly, Permian will start competing for a bit more capital. But we believe that from a productivity as well as a capital efficiency standpoint, certainly, as we look out over the horizon, we see ways to continue to hold the line and certainly hold the line if not improve on some metrics. And again, we have a lot of tools available to us, right? I mean there's some of the things that Mike talked about, there's the fundamental well design, longer laterals, better completions. There's execution efficiency, stages per day, our rate of penetration on the drilling side. I'm just talking about the Woodford hard rock drilling. There is supply chain optimization. We continue to work on how best to integrate and manage our supply chain. And then finally, there's just the sheer commercial leverage. You can kind of put that in the deflation, inflation bucket. But all of those things give us an opportunity to continue to work on overarching capital efficiency as we move forward in time. Even though we may be moving to different parts different geology. We certainly see a path to continue to protect our peer-leading capital efficiency that we've worked very hard for..."", 'Neil Singhvi Mehta', ""And it definitely is notable. Then the follow-up question is just on the natural gas outlook in the U.S. It's obviously a tough environment, as you referenced in your comments. So how is -- your designing your plan for 2024 and you're thinking about which areas you want to prosecute. Are you trying to maximize the value of your netbacks?"", 'Lee M. Tillman', ""Yes. I think Mike was pretty clear in describing the capital program that our program for '24 already reflects the reality of where natural gas pricing sits today. So not surprisingly, we're driving capital allocation to our 3 kind of black oil basins, Eagle Ford, Bakken and the Permian. Thus, a combination play, essentially like Oklahoma is struggling, obviously, to compete for capital because of where we are in the commodity cycle, right? It doesn't mean that it won't compete in the future. But today, because of the multi-basin model, we're able to take a hard look. I mean, I think Mike said, it's value over volumes. And even though we're taking a little bit of a downtick on OEB, that's by design. We're driven by returns and value optimization, which is making our oil program very efficient in 2024 and very much our focus, given where gas pricing sits today in North America."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'This is actually [Cleo] for Doug. So I appreciate you taking the questions. My first question goes to inventory depth. You guys obviously continue to show a very consistent capital program with the emphasis on harvesting those mature assets. So hoping that you can provide a view on how you see the resource depth evolving on each 1 of your 4 U.S. plays. And when you think about that program, as you work into the future, do you ever see the Anadarko Permian carrying the load of that program? And if so, when do you see it?', 'Lee M. Tillman', ""There's a lot in there, so let me maybe try to unpack a little bit of that. First of all, maybe just let me deal with the inventory question. Our team has been very successful at replacing inventory over the last 5 years. And there are several ways that we're able to do that. One is organic enhancement, and that can include everything from cost reductions in places where we operate, extending laterals, refrac and redevelopment work like we have ongoing in places like the Eagle Ford. So that's helpful.We do small bolt-ons and even trades. One of the reasons that we're now having a primarily 2-mile-plus program in Delaware is because of all the good work around small acquisitions, small trades there to allow us to get a more contiguous kind of position there. And then we just talked about the migration of a more contiguous kind of position there. And then we just talked about the migration of the Delaware -- I'm sorry, the Texas Delaware play from kind of exploration into the development program. And then finally, there is large scale -- larger scale M&A like we did with Ensign. We've got these 4 avenues to continue to replenish. And in some cycles, you lean on 1 more than another. But -- but typically, you need to see all 4 of those to have a sustainable replenishment model. And that's really what we've been able to prosecute over the last 5 years and hold that 10-plus -- decade plus of inventory relatively constant over that period of time. So you should expect us to use that same playbook going forward. I mean, every year is not going to have a large-scale M&A. But certainly, every year, we're investing in things like organic enhancement. We are investing and still trying to progress some of our exploration plays. So those things are just part and parcel of how we address inventory replenishment. At a basin level, we -- we allocate capital at an enterprise level. So when we look at our inventory, we're looking at it from a holistic standpoint. And that's why, for instance, today, you see Permian starting to compete for more capital allocation. And so when we think through that 10-plus year inventory, we think through it with a mindset of managing it at an enterprise level with basins coming in and out and receiving capital allocation based on the highest return and the best fit for us to continue to generate sustainable free cash flow generation."", 'Unidentified Analyst', ""I appreciate those comments. My quick follow-up just goes to EG. I'm just trying to get a sense of the ratability for the perspective of the commodity sensitivity. Not to be stupid about it. But let's say, prices blew out to $30 per MMBtu in a very extreme scenario. I'm wondering if the earnings that you've shown here would exhibit the same linearity compared to the $10 to $15 scenario that you laid out?"", 'Lee M. Tillman', ""Well, first of all, it goes to $30 now, we're going to be very happy. But there is a bit of linearity there though. And 1 of the reasons that, and I think, I mentioned this in my comments. We provided some sensitivity at an enterprise level for all of the key products. So you can see how EG factors into the overall enterprise delivery. But certainly, the data that we've included in the deck, you should be able to test those sensitivities because it is a commercial framework. It's linked to global LNG pricing. So to the extent that we're delivering the same level of volumes under the same cost structure, then that should be a pretty linear relationship with commodity pricing."", 'Unidentified Analyst', 'I appreciate that. Thank you.', 'Lee M. Tillman', 'I am going to take that $30 as a prediction too, by the way.', 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.', 'Paul Cheng', ""Maybe this is for both Lee and Dane, you guys are changing a bit on the accounting in EG, shifting the transfer price. Just curious that -- was that other than, say, the shift on earnings between the equity [affiliate] and fully owned operation. Does it in any way that changed the way how you are decision-making for that operation level? That's the first question.The second question that I want to maybe go back to the consolidation. In your operating region, because of that, we are going to see some bigger players. Do you foresee that going to change the landscape in terms of the service supply, in terms of -- with that -- because of the consolidation, people become more rational, so you actually think that the pricing on the service will become better for the rest of the peers. So just curious that, I mean, what your view on the competitive landscape that may have changed, if any, due to that consolidation in the operating regions that you are in?"", 'Lee M. Tillman', ""Great. Great. Well, again, lots to unpack here, Paul. Let me maybe start off on the EG question. I'll get Dane to jump in here and help me out. But you're spot on in that under the new contractual structure that we will be shifting some element of profitability from the equity companies over to the consolidated reporting. And in fact, we've provided a very kind of detailed breakdown of that in our guidance in the deck, just to hopefully eliminate any confusion or lack of clarity around this point. I mean, we know EG still is complex, but in some ways, this will bring more transparency by migrating more of that profitability into the consolidated entity. And we'll also limit kind of this timing dislocation that we also have between when we generate the income or the earnings and when we receive, say, the dividend from an equity company. Because in the consolidated entities, obviously, that step does not occur. The only other thing you said, well, would this change anything around our decision making because of this new structure. And what I would tell you, the beauty we have in EG is that we're aligned from an equity percentage standpoint across the value chain. So there's really no impact to our decision-making or how we think about investments across that value chain because we have alignment in every aspect of it from the upstream, all the way through the LNG plant. I don't know, Dane, if I missed anything there."", 'Dane E. Whitehead', ""No, I agree completely. I would just add the guidance that we provided on Page 15 of the slide deck, is really sort of at an -- holistic EG business unit level, $550 million to $600 million of EBITDA in 2024, assuming a $10 TTF. And we gave price sensitivity, so you can tie all that how you want. But I will say that's the best way to look at the business is the aggregate EBITDA generation. That's how we think about it. So it doesn't really to echo Lee's point, I don't think it drives our decision-making, which entity, whether it's consolidated or an equity affiliate where that earning is coming from. We like it all. The other thing is that guidance is quite a bit stronger than what we previously provided for '24. And now we've actually gone out 5 years and given you a 5-year average. So this business is very strong, and it's improving with the -- the infill opportunities and bringing the same gas into the system, and there's a lot of running room here and a lot that's not fully baked into the future model yet. So we're pretty bullish on EG."", 'Lee M. Tillman', ""I think the last question you had was just around kind of the, I'll call it, the competitive landscape, certainly in some of the basins where we offer today. Consolidation is absolutely a factor in all basins. It's probably, in some ways, it becomes a bit more challenging in mature basins as the best operators tend to be aggregating the best assets, and many of them have already done so and have a material position.The other challenge, I think, you have in those assets is it's the balancing act between PDP production versus forward inventory. And I would use the example, for instance, of Ensign, where we really struck that balance. It brought cash flow and EBITDA with it, but it also brought 600-plus locations that was not only inventory life accretive to the Eagle Ford, but with inventory life accretive to the overall company. And those opportunities came in and competed immediately and continue to compete within our capital allocation today. And so there are some unique challenges as you look at the more mature basins. But ultimately, the high-quality assets will be run by the highest quality operators, and we certainly put ourselves in that category."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup.', 'Scott Andrew Gruber', ""Yes. I just have 1 question here. Lee, I think your M&A framework is certainly a very prudent approach. But obviously, there does seem to be an industry rush here to secure good rock and scale up. So the question we get from investors is, do you worry about the opportunity set for acquisitions shrinking and the quality of the opportunity set fading? And does that warrant a tweak to your M&A strategy? I guess ultimately, the question is, are you comfortable with the longer-term outlook for adding quality resource, whether that's organic or inorganic, within the construct of your M&A approach or -- and in the context of this hyper consolidation phase?"", 'Lee M. Tillman', ""Yes. Well, definitely, we're in that phase today. But we see no upside to our shareholders to compromise our criteria today. Again, no upside to our shareholders to compromise our criteria today. Again, all of these transactions are very bespoke. They reflect the attributes of the counterparties. Most of those counterparties are searching for something. They're searching for scale. They're searching for resilience. They're searching for balance sheet health. I mean, they're searching for sustainability in inventory. So they're trying to fill a void.And what that drives is this -- I won't necessarily refer to it as desperation, but it drives a different kind of behavior. For us, we're sitting with 10-plus years of inventory. So we can be patient. We can be thoughtful. We can exercise the same level of discipline that we do in our organic business and be very -- and we have demonstrated that. We've got a track side the same levers we have available for inventory replenishment. Large-scale M&A is just 1 of those levers that we can apply. And also keep in mind that even when transactions occur, the assets are still there. And so they're not going anywhere. And so there is still that aspect of, ultimately, the best assets will find their hands into being operated by the best operators."", 'Operator', 'Thank you.

Thompson?"", 'Thompson Lin', 'Thank you, Lindsay, and thank you for joining our call today. While our fourth-quarter revenue came in below our expectations, our gross margins outperformed our projections. leading to non-GAAP EPS at a high end of our expectations. We are pleased by the continued progress we have made in improving our gross margins, which combined with our expense management, allowed us to generate a smaller GAAP net income in the fourth quarter. For the first time in many years. Further, we generated positive adjusted EBITDA of $4.8 million in Q4. During the fourth quarter, we delivered revenue of $60.5 million, which was below our guidance range of $63 million to $67 million primary due to somewhat lower than expected data center revenue as we began to see some softness in demand led in the quarter, we delivered non-GAAP gross margin of 36.4%, which is the highest quarterly gross margin that we had generated in the last five years was above our guidance range of 34.5% to 36%, mainly driven by improved product mix and some contribution from nonrecurring engineering projects. We generated a small non-cash net income of $0.04 per share, which was a high end of our guidance range of a loss of $0.02 to earnings of $0.04. Palo Verde mill floor death in the production of $44.5 million, more than double year-over-year, but was down 9% sequentially. The revenue for our 100G products more than doubled year over year and revenue for our 400 g per dose increased more than eight times in the same period. Total revenue in our CATV segment was $12.6 million, which was down 67% year-over-year and up 22% sequentially, largely driven by January store sales of processed 3.1 equipment as the industry prepares for transition to 34.0. With that, I will turn the call over to Stefan to review the details of our Q4 performance and outlook for Q1. Stefan?', 'Stefan Murry', ""Thank you, Thompson. As Thompson mentioned, while our fourth quarter revenue came in below our expectations. Our gross margin outperformed our projections, leading to a non-GAAP EPS at the high end of our expectations. We were pleased by the continued progress we have made on improving our gross margin, which combined with our expense management, allowed us to generate a small non-GAAP net income in the fourth quarter for the first time in many years. Further, we generated positive adjusted EBITDA of 4.8 million in Q4. While we do see some softness in Q1 due to the combined effects of the Lunar New Year holiday in our Asian factories, along with some price reductions which are scheduled to take effect. We expect a strong recovery in Q2 and are currently anticipating a markedly improved second half of 2024. Despite the softness we are seeing in Q1, we have been experiencing significant traction with several new datacenter customers recently for both 400G and 800G products. And we expect one or more of these customers to begin to contribute meaningfully to revenue starting in Q2, which gives us a basis for the optimistic outlook despite the slow start to the year, while not likely to contribute meaningfully to revenue in 2024. We also are very optimistic about our 1.6 terabit products as we move into 2025. With the improvement we expect in the second half. We currently expect our first full year of non-GAAP profitability since 2018. Turning to the quarter, our total revenue for the fourth quarter decreased by 2% year over year to $60.5 million, which was below our guidance range of $63 million to $67 million As Thompson mentioned, this was largely due to somewhat lower than expected data center revenue as we began to see some softness in demand late in the quarter, which we attribute to timing of orders. During the fourth quarter, 74% of our revenue was from our datacenter products. 21% was from our CATV products with the remaining 5% from FTTH telecom and other in line with our expectations. CATV revenue in the fourth quarter was $12.6 million, which was down 67% year over year and up 22%, sequentially. We are encouraged by the sequential growth that we saw in our CATV business in Q4. Looking forward, we continue to expect that our near-term CATV business will be down compared to the historic highs we saw in 2021 and 2022 as the MSOs transition to next-generation architecture. We anticipate this transition will begin to take place sometime in mid 2024 and are optimistic about the second half of the year. We shipped initial test samples of our 1.8 gigahertz amplifier products to two major MSOs in Q4. Although these are early samples, the feedback we received on their performance and pricing is extremely encouraging. We currently anticipate shipping final qualification units of various amplifier products between April and June this year and expect revenue to begin shortly after the sample qualification is complete. As we stated last quarter, we continue to carefully monitor MSOs plans to upgrade to Docsis 4.0 networks, and we continue to believe AOI is a leader in technologies that will enable Docsis 4.0. Further. We are confident that our products are aptly designed for the deployment of amplifiers and other network elements required for DOCSIS 4.0. Turning to our data center business, our Q4 data center revenue came in at $44.5 million, which more than doubled year over year and was down 9% sequentially. As noted above, in the fourth quarter of 56% of our datacenter revenue was from our 100G products, 36% was from our 200 G. and 400G products, and 4% was from our 40G transceiver products. As we had anticipated revenue for our 100G products decreased 31% sequentially. Revenue for our 200 G. and 400G products increased 79% sequentially, which we believe is largely driven by a high demand for compute infrastructure. As a reminder, as we have discussed on our prior few earnings calls, we signed two agreements with Microsoft in 2023, including a development program to make next-generation lasers for its data center for 400G and beyond and for the development of its 400 G. and next-generation active optical cables. While not guaranteed, we continue to believe that the revenue opportunity for our 400 G. and 800 G. products could be greater and a longer duration than the revenue contribution we saw from this customer during the peak of the 40G product cycle, which suggests that revenue from these products may exceed $300 million over the several years of these build-outs during Q three. And as we had discussed on our prior earnings call, we received requests from Microsoft to expedite our production ramp for these products, which I'm pleased to report we were able to accommodate. We began shipments during December and expect to continue to ship in Q1, although at a slower rate than we earlier earlier expected, as the data centers work to install the optics, we shipped in Q4. We expect demand to resume later in the quarter with additional capacity coming online then for Q2 and beyond. Another item to note, we believe that the value proposition that we offer to Microsoft is just as strong with other datacenter operators, and we are working with several of them to evaluate our technology and qualify our products. This includes our 800 G. products. We shipped samples to three different data center customers in 2023 and have received initial positive feedback on our 800 G. products. We expect shipments of 800 G. to begin in Q3 this year. Now turning to our telecom segment. Revenue from our telecom products of $2.8 million was down 56% year over year and down 8% sequentially, largely driven by ongoing softness in 5G demand, particularly in China. Looking ahead, we expect telecom sales to fluctuate around current levels for the fourth quarter our top 10 customers represented 95% of revenue, up from 90%. In Q4 of last year, we had two greater than 10% customers, one in the data center market and one in the CATV market, which contributed 51% and 28% of our total revenue, respectively. In Q4, we generated non-GAAP gross margin of 36.4%, which was above our guidance range of 34.5% to 36% and was up from 32.5% in Q3 of 2023 and up from 21.4% in Q4 of 2022. The increase in gross margin was driven mainly by our favorable product mix shift. Our transition to a direct sales model in our CATV business and the impact of nonrecurring engineering sales during the quarter. We remain committed to the long-term goal of returning gross margin to around 40% and believe that this goal is achievable. As a reminder, with the direct to MSO sales model we implemented late last year, we expect margins in our CATV business to be meaningfully higher than our historical average. Total non-GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $21.6 million or 35.7% of revenue, which were in line with our expectations and compared to $21 million or 34.2% of revenue in Q4 of the prior year. Looking ahead, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to range from $22.5 million to $24 million per quarter, reflecting some acceleration of R&D expenses to improve time to market for our 800G and 1.6 terabit data center products. Non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter was $0.4 million compared to an operating loss of $7.9 million in Q4 in the prior year. GAAP net loss for Q4 was $13.9 million, or a loss of $0.38 per basic share, compared with a GAAP net loss of $20.3 million, or a loss of $0.71 per basic share, in Q4 of 2022. On a non-GAAP basis, net income for Q4 was $1.6 million or $0.04 per share, which was above our guidance range of a loss of $0.9 million to a profit of $1.2 million. And at the high end of our guidance range of a loss per share in the range of $0.02 to earnings of $0.04 per basic share. This compares to a net loss of $5.4 million, or a loss of $0.19 per basic share in Q4 of the prior year. The fully diluted shares outstanding used for computing, the earnings per share in Q4 were $44.8 million. Turning now to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with $55.1 million in total cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. This compares with $31.2 million at the end of the third quarter of this year. We ended the quarter with total debt excluding convertible debt of $38.7 million compared to $46.6 million at the end of last quarter. Notably, during the fourth quarter, we successfully issued $80.2 million of convertible senior notes due 2026. The notes will bear an interest rate of 5.25% per year. Concurrently with the offering we exchanged or repurchased approximately all of our 2024 notes as of December 31st, we had $63.9 million in inventory compared to $67.5 million at the end of Q3. We made a total of $8.7 million in capital investments in the fourth quarter, which was mainly used for production and R&D equipment. Moving now to our Q1 outlook. We expect Q1 revenue to be between $41 million $46 million and non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 21% to 23%. Non-GAAP net loss is expected to be in the range of $10.9 million to $12.6 million and non-GAAP loss per share between $0.28 per basic share and $0.33 per basic share using a weighted average basic share count of approximately 38.4 million shares. With that, I will turn it back over to the operator for the Q&A session. Operator?"", 'Operator', 'Simon Leopold, Raymond James.', 'Simon Leopold', ""Great. Thank you for taking the question. A couple of things I wanted to unpack one of which is you've given us, I think some insight as to the total value of the opportunity from Microsoft. And I understand it's spread over years. Is there some sort of element you could offer to help folks understand or level set as to how that may ramp through 2024, how to size the expected contribution from the Microsoft Project this calendar year?"", 'Stefan Murry', ""Yeah. I mean, we haven't really given out the details on that project. Obviously, a lot of it is Nino customer sensitive. But at this point, I mean, it started to ramp, as I noted in our prepared remarks, I mean, we shipped product in December, which was ahead of schedule on the data center that the individual data centers where those are getting installed are taking a little bit longer than expected to we actually deploy those transceivers in the data center. So there's a bit of a lull right now while that goes on and then we expect the ramp to resume later in this quarter and ramp throughout the year. We'll probably have more to say in terms of longer-term forecast after we start to see the results of this first tranche being adopted in the data centers."", 'Simon Leopold', ""Yes, I guess what I'm trying to get at is I have the impression that there are some folks that have envision this is sort of $100 million this year, $100 million next year and $100 million a year after that. And I think what you're describing is something that gradually ramps to that kind of run rate, but we're not getting $100 million in 2024. I want to verify that my understanding is reasonable."", 'Stefan Murry', ""When I have known that that's accurate. What I have said is that it would be I think we said this on the last earnings call, but it just seems that same thought process now that we think it will be ramping to exit the year on a run rate that would support that $100 million per year. But it's clearly not starting off the year. So it will you will not integrate out or four quarters of the year to be $100 million."", 'Simon Leopold', ""That's helpful. That's exactly what I --"", 'Stefan Murry', ""You're sort of more. Yes, which would imply of course, that in the out years, it will be more than 100 million per year in those other years."", 'Simon Leopold', ""Yeah. No, that's what I was trying to trying to pull out there. And then in terms of what's going on in the overall industry and applications, it seems as if a lot of the AI related use cases are calling for 800 gig connections. And so I'm wondering, are you seeing your 400 gig products being used in back-end AI use cases? Or are there other applications? And if so, what are that."", 'Stefan Murry', ""And yes, it's supporting a I am not quite sure what you mean by back end use cases, but it's supporting a eye and the connections between the the GPU cluster and the switch primarily. And now I mean, I think it's also likely being used in other non AI applications as well. I mean, there are other money compute applications out there it's not clear to me precisely the extent to which is being used in AI. versus non-high applications. That isn't really information that we're privy to. But certainly a I is what Microsoft and others other large data center operators are primarily building the infrastructure around AI right now. So I would I think it would be reasonable to expect that the vast majority of it is being deployed in AI infrastructure."", 'Simon Leopold', ""And then just the last maybe a little bit more color on how you see the cadence of your cable TV business in that this quarter was actually a bit better, a bit stronger than what we expected. But it seems as if you're suggesting or my interpretation of your suggestion is sort of a step function in the second half of the year. Anything you could do to give us some sort of Bowne's on what that implies."", 'Stefan Murry', ""And yes, I mean, I think you're more or less correct. And what you're seeing in terms of the step function in the middle of the year, what's going on right now is that we're continuing to sell Docsis 3.1 products which are on their way out. They're not obsolete yet. It's what's currently deployed in the networks, but those products that are being shipped now are being used in you know, new new new builds upgrades, but just new areas that need to be built out or repairs, things like that is kind of a steady-state business. What we expect to happen in the middle part of the year is that we'll layer on the new 1.8 gigahertz products which are going to be used in new network upgrades, which is which is really where the excitement is, frankly. And that's why we tried to call out some specific dates in our prepared remarks earlier that we expect to have those amplifiers in for qualification between April and June. There are several different models there, so they'll ship at various times within that timeframe. And then we do expect revenue to begin pretty quickly thereafter. Because I think the there are several MSOs that are really up. We appear to be very interested in starting those upgrades quickly as soon as the products become available."", 'Simon Leopold', 'Great. Thank you for taking my question.', 'Operator', 'Michael Genovese, Rosenblatt Securities.', 'Michael Genovese', ""Please go ahead. I'm going to Thanks a lot. And so it sounds like I mean, the narrative over the last quarter or so has been that that the cost, the bigger big customer here ask you to hurry up and expedite the development of the product and it seems like you've executed extremely well. Could do that and then sort of like a hurry up and now we situation. So could you provide I mean, is that kind of assuming a successful. Yes, but sorry to Minister up there at the end, of course, you go to I don't know that. So I mean I was I guess I was just going to also ask for more and more color on that. But also if that if that is if that's the case, why I think we reiterated a $300 million number that hasn't changed, but what else can give us confidence that this is just a timing delay and not not any other kind fundamental change here?"", 'Stefan Murry', ""Sure. So first of all, I guess you'd have some commentary on the slower start to the year that we're seeing, specifically with the data center deployment that I mentioned earlier. So you know, these things are difficult to predict. What happens is that the product is qualified and put into use and data centers order an initial quantity of it to begin putting product in there and then they start to deploy. And I'm sure you can probably understand, you know, just based on prudence that don't always deploy the new technology as fast as they will when since it at scale, right? They want to take it slow and make sure there's no issues. And I believe that's probably the most likely explanation for what's going on. And then once that once that initial phase of deployments proves that it's going well, then they'll order larger quantities to continue the deployments as far as what we expect to see throughout the rest of the year. I mean, at the same time, by the way, we're still continuing to build our manufacturing capability and capacity for the ramp that we see through the rest of the year. So far as what can give you the confidence there? I think probably the only thing that I can really point to is the fact that we continue to invest pretty heavily in CapEx. If you look at our CapEx in the fourth quarter, it's ramped significantly from what it was earlier in the year. Clearly, not all of that investment came online and produce products in Q1. And so I think that, along with our commentary about a markedly improved Q2, would hopefully give you guys some level of confidence that this is a temporary condition downfall got squeezed."", 'Thompson Lin', 'We have said we are eager to have their G central two three new hyperscale data center customer in U.S., and we believe we the body was started went up by, say, end of Q2 or early Q3 since the 19, though would be the Q2 the the may be based or.', 'Michael Genovese', ""Yes, I would like to follow up on that point? Because I mean, we hear you saying I'm delivering sample, but then also expectation of revenue in 2Q accelerating into Q3. So kind of the missing step between those two is, call it qualification customer win. But given your confidence into Q2, Q3, it sounds like you're already must already be past that is that you must have already passed that milestone is that correct understanding?"", 'Stefan Murry', ""Well, for certainly for the the opportunity that we were talking about earlier that we've been referring to on most of the questions, obviously, that has passed the qualification standpoint at a qualification point at this juncture on other opportunities, I mean, we have various opportunities that are either past qualification or qualification. We expect to finish up in time to be able to grow revenue in Q2 are great."", 'Michael Genovese', 'And then just finally for me, just to help sort of help understand that the business mix a little bit better. Yes, could you give a sense of data center right now of the revenue mix roughly between your transceivers and lasers? And then if we look ahead to say the fourth quarter this year first quarter of next year, is that going to remain constant? Or will we see I see it see some kind of change in that mix.', 'Stefan Murry', ""So right now, the revenue mix in the data centers, almost entirely transceivers and active optical cables, probably 95% of it is transceivers and optical cables. I don't expect that to change too much in fact, it will probably get closer to 100% because the new opportunities that we're talking about are all for either transceivers and active optical cables. So I think the thing that might be giving you a little bit of you know, that might be behind that question, if I can kind of read into it this question of what we had two different projects with Microsoft, one for lasers and one for active optical cables, right? And that is true. But what I think you may be not completely understanding is that most of the lasers and tech right now, all of the lasers are used in our own active optical cable. So the revenue, while we are making lasers and working on making lasers on the revenue will be for the active optical cables that ultimately utilize those lasers."", 'Michael Genovese', ""That actually was my understanding that I do get a lot of questions on that. And I wanted to make sure that I understood it correctly. So I thanks so much for the answers. I'm glad to be on the conference calls now and I'm getting in here on a good time. Thank you."", 'Stefan Murry', ""We're excited to have you. Thanks."", 'Operator', 'Tim Savageaux, Northland Capital Markets.', 'Tim Savageaux', ""Hey, good afternoon. A couple of questions. First, on, I guess, some elements of guidance that you provided for the year. Sorry, I think you're talking or expecting to be profitable on a non-GAAP basis. Some of that's net income or operating profit or both, but I just wanted to confirm that for the year."", 'Stefan Murry', 'Yes, there will be net income and non-GAAP net income profitable for the year.', 'Tim Savageaux', ""Okay. Well, I guess you've you've given us a range for OpEx. So I know you're starting the year pretty low from a gross margin perspective. But you know, saying if you're able to get that say up to 30% for the year, which may or may not be reasonable means that we can take a revenue range out of that 16 on solidly over 300 million, I mean, obviously weighted toward the back half of the year. And am I doing that math, right?"", 'Stefan Murry', 'Yes. Yes.', 'Tim Savageaux', ""Excellent. Okay. And then I'm going to follow up on some details on the 400 gig category, where you saw that increase about 10 million in the quarter. We've seen some pretty healthy declines on the 100 gig side I assume that's where the weakness is from a demand standpoint. But I mean, is it fair to attribute most or all of that increase to the active optical cable shipments and to the extent we expect it to turn back on, let's say in Q2, is that the type of order of magnitude we should be expecting as you move your way toward exiting the year. So you had a 25 million a quarter run rate."", 'Stefan Murry', ""Let's see, a couple of questions embedded in there. The first one was, is was the active optical cables responsible for most of the increase in 400G revenue? The answer to that is yes. The second part of that question was I wasn't quite clear exactly how you're asking that, as I said earlier, that we would expect that to be kind of on a run rate of 100 million a year or 25 million a quarter by the end of the year. Are you just trying to confirm that or was there another question that I kind of know?"", 'Tim Savageaux', ""There's another little question there, and that is given that you're expecting a bounce back or improved Q2, which you referenced in the release. Should we say think that most or all of that improvement is returning to that Q4 level, or above from an IOC perspective? And I'd have to have it probably close to it."", 'Stefan Murry', ""I'd have to kind of do the math to answer that question precisely. We do expect some other new 400 gig business to start ramping in Q2 as well? Some little I'm a little hesitant to say it. That's absolutely the dominant factor, but most likely would be close to that."", 'Tim Savageaux', ""Yes. Okay, great. And then last one for me. I think at least you stepped through this before, but I want to make sure I understand last quarter you talked about sampling 800 gig products to four customers, including three hyperscalers. I think I got that right is what you're saying when you expected 800 gig to be able to start to contribute midyear end of Q2 into Q three is that one of those that you have sampled has turned into was a production customer? And is there any update to the kind of customer engagement met metrics, sampling, whatnot, on either 400 or 800 G. in Q4 or Q4 and year to date 24?"", 'Stefan Murry', ""Sure. So I mean to be clear, we have not completed final qualification on any of those 800 G. products at this point. And so we did have three customers that we sampled last year at the end of the year. And in addition to that, just within the last and on a month or so, we've had some significant new interest from other new customers besides the three that we shipped last year, some so, you know, without trying to tip our hat too much here, I think it's likely that one or more of either the customers we ship to last year or one of these newer customers will be will be a customer generating revenue for us in the Q3 timeframe for 800 G. on as far, as you know, the kind of the demand, I guess you could say, you know, the kind of the feeling that we have around demand, I would say that you know the need for 800 gig right now, it seems to be particularly acute. I think there's a lot of demand for that. And that typically means the qualification and revenue generation can can go rather quickly on. It's when it's when demand may be somewhat low, that you start to see the qualification cycle stretch out and things like that. And we're definitely not in that situation in my estimation for energy at this point. Well, got it."", 'Tim Savageaux', ""Let me sneak one more in here. I'm sorry about that. But along those lines, I guess you spent a fair bit of time over the last couple, three quarters sizing the active optical cable optical cable opportunity at Microsoft. But as you look at your 800 gig pipeline in some of the customer engagements you have. I guess how would you size that opportunity relative to what we've been talking about with them and Microsoft 400 gig?"", 'Stefan Murry', ""I mean the opportunity there is several times larger, many times larger, and it remains to be seen how much of that market we can get. I don't want to create too much no irrational exuberance at this point. But the market size, the market opportunity there is huge and it's being driven by a I mean, there's nothing that should be mysterious about the demand profile, right? I mean, we've heard and video talking today or yesterday on their earnings call about the amount of our compute infrastructure that's being built. All of that needs to be interconnected and a lot of it is being interconnected at 800 G. and frankly will be probably moving to 1.6 terabits for some applications early next year. So the opportunity is huge. You know, I think we're well positioned for that. Like I mentioned earlier, we've seen a lot of new customer inbound interest just recently, and there's a lot of work to be done. And I'm not predicting we're going to get what percentage of that market will ultimately be able to get. It's a little early to say, but the market opportunity there is huge."", 'Tim Savageaux', 'Okay. Thanks very much.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Dave Kang, B. Riley Securities.', 'Dave Kang', ""Thank you. Good afternoon. And my first question is regarding your first quarter outlook. Can you just provide more color in terms of each product segments? How are they going to decline sequentially? Well, we don't really give guidance by product segment, but clearly the the cable TV business, a matter of kind of what happens there is not big enough insights are going to collapse to zero. So whatever happens, there is not likely to account for the majority of the decline. So that's going to come primarily from the data center business, as we noted in our prepared remarks earlier, that it's a combination of factors there that the on the Lunar New Year, a lot of these products are in our China facility. And so the mix of those products shifted a little bit unexpectedly on us towards the end of last year, which resulted in the are they having to make new products essentially that we hadn't necessarily planned for in advance, and that's why the Lunar New Year caught us a little bit unprepared this year."", 'Stefan Murry', 'In addition to that, we did have some pricing reductions. And again, most of that you can assume is in the data center side that kicked in towards the end of last year. And both of those three factors account for the bulk of the decline.', 'Dave Kang', 'And so that the second part of our pricing reductions was mainly 100 gig also or involve them 400 gig as well.', 'Stefan Murry', ""No it's mainly 100 gig. And I don't believe we had any price reductions on 400 gig in the quarter."", 'Dave Kang', 'Got it. And then on when you talked about when you talk about second quarter a snapback or you just talked about 400 gig or will 100 gig recover as well?', 'Stefan Murry', ""We expect it will be mostly 400 gig. There may be some recovery, 100 gig. It's a little bit unclear, but that technology is clearly in the weaning phase of its of its lifecycle, 400 gig is clearly going to be picking up more in the near future. And again, as we've talked about earlier later in the year, 800 gig will start to contribute as well."", 'Dave Kang', ""Right. And then on the Microsoft on. Do you have any kind of the like backlog to speak of that gives us confidence that you'll that they'll ramp throughout this year? Or is it still based on they're forecast."", 'Stefan Murry', ""I mean, we have small backlog. What we always do, but it's consistent with what we've seen over the years is nothing it's nothing that would guarantee a ramp throughout the year."", 'Dave Kang', 'No. Got it. And my last question is on you talked about Microsoft to add another supplier. You know what the latest on that.', 'Stefan Murry', ""I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand your question. You said Microsoft adding another supplier for the? Yes, you can say it's a clear."", 'Dave Kang', 'Yes, day IOC. Yes, IOC, not possibly adding another supplier in addition to you any latest update on that?', 'Stefan Murry', ""Right. I mean, yes, I get your question now. So I mean, I'm not aware that there's any other supplier that's shipping at this point, but I really wouldn't really be able to share that information even if I were.

All of the world's leading AI companies -- including ChatGPT's developer OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet's Google, and Amazon -- use Nvidia GPUs."", ""Nvidia's first-mover advantage and its lack of meaningful competitors made it one of the easiest ways to profit from the expansion of the AI market. But Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), Nvidia's biggest competitor in the gaming GPU market, is also turning its gaze toward the AI market. Could AMD eventually dethrone Nvidia as the leader in AI chips?"", ""AMD entered the GPU market by acquiring ATI for $5.6 billion in 2006. It subsequently expanded ATI's Radeon brand to challenge Nvidia in discrete GPUs for gaming PCs, and it leveraged that technology to create APUs -- which bundle CPUs and GPUs on a single die -- for PCs and gaming consoles."", ""AMD's main strategy against Nvidia, which mirrored its approach to challenging Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) in the CPU market, was to constantly sell chips that were cheaper than those of the market leader. AMD's GPUs could often provide gaming performance comparable to Nvidia's chips, but they usually consumed more power because they used less efficient designs."", 'Nvidia still controlled about 80% of the discrete GPU market last year, according to Jon Peddie Research, while AMD remained a distant second with a 17% share. The remaining small share belongs to Intel, which returned to the discrete GPU market in 2022.', ""Nvidia didn't make the same mistakes as Intel, which ceded a large portion of the PC CPU market to AMD through its own blunders over the past decade. Instead, Nvidia held AMD at bay with cheaper chips that targeted lower-end gamers."", ""Unlike Intel, which manufactures most of its chips at its own foundries, AMD and Nvidia are both fabless chipmakers that outsource their production to the contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). As a result, their chip designs (in terms of size and power efficiency) are ultimately constrained by TSMC's technical limitations."", ""Those constraints might make it easier for AMD to catch up to Nvidia with comparable GPUs for data centers. AMD launched its first batch of Instinct GPUs (the MI6, MI8, and MI25) in 2017, followed by more 7-nanometer and 6nm MI chips over the subsequent years. AMD rolled out its newest MI300 Instinct chips, which were built on TSMC's 5nm and 6nm nodes, in late 2023."", ""In the latest industry benchmarks, its top-tier MI300X actually beats Nvidia's H100 -- which is widely used for processing generative AI tasks -- in terms of raw processing power and memory bandwidth."", 'More importantly, data center operators can actually buy four MI300 GPUs for the price of a single H100 GPU -- which costs more than $40,000 as Nvidia struggles to deliver enough chips to meet demand.', ""Nvidia claims the H100 still outperforms the MI300X when it's running on optimized software, but the massive price gap, the narrow performance gap, and the persistent supply chain constraints could drive more of its customers toward AMD."", ""Tech giants like Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Oracle, Dell, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise have already been testing or running Instinct GPUs as cost-efficient alternatives to Nvidia's chips."", ""AMD also sells its Epyc server CPUs, which compete against Intel's Xeon CPUs, and programmable chips (through its acquisition of Xilinx). It can bundle those chips with its Instinct GPUs in cost-efficient packages for data centers."", 'During AMD\'s fourth-quarter conference call in January, CEO Lisa Su said its MI300 deployments were ""accelerating"" and on track to be the ""fastest revenue ramp of any product"" in the company\'s history. Su also pointed out that AMD\'s combined sales of data center and embedded chips (including its Epyc, Instinct, Xilinx, and gaming APUs) grew by $1.2 billion in 2023 and accounted for over 50% of its full-year revenue.', ""Those healthy growth rates suggest AMD can carve out a high-growth niche in the AI market.

Nvidia's prices should stabilize as it resolves its supply chain constraints, and many data center operators could use a mix of chips from the two rivals and their own first-party chipmaking divisions instead of dedicating themselves to a single vendor."", ""Therefore, I believe AMD will carve out a high-growth niche in the AI market in the same way it expanded into the gaming GPU and data center GPU markets.

After the briefest of dips in the stock price, Monday.com is once again close to its high-water mark after the market downturn of 2021 and 2022. Is this aspirational AI software provider a buy?', ""Monday.com is still a tiny software business, especially in the grand scheme of the software industry. When you compete against titans that haul in tens of billions of dollars in a single quarter, not to mention other providers of relationship and project-management software, what's $730 million in revenue in a year?"", 'At any rate, the company is making some small ripples in the market. Revenue grew 41% in 2023, including a 35% year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter.', ""A bunch of product launches helped.

It reflects the business' enduring growth and expectations that such growth will continue for many years. It also factors in the FCF margins falling as the company ratchets up its R&D again now that the bear market is over."", ""To put it bluntly, aggressive expansion like this means Monday.com isn't a stock for everyone. The growth trajectory is great, but any further slowdown in that rate of growth, paired with a lack of GAAP profitability, will make this a very volatile stock in the years to come.

The company’s second-quarter results gained from strong Intelligent Cloud, and Productivity and Business Processes revenues. Productivity and Business Processes rose due to a strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 78.4 million.Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses, frontline worker offerings and a gain in revenue per user drove the top line. Intelligent Cloud revenues were driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Solid adoption of Azure AI, which now has a clientele of more than 53,000 customers, holds promise.However, Office's declining commercial licensing has been a headwind due to the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Higher operating expenses and spending on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remains a concern.(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)Shares of Amazon.com have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the past year (+75.9% vs. +47.6%).

While we have owned shares of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the large-cap core growth Baron Durable Advantage Fund, we have been reluctant to add Microsoft to this Fund for many years namely since we viewed it as a better fit for a post high-growth strategy. However, Microsoft’s transformation under the helm of Satya Nadella has changed the company’s trajectory as it went from a windows-centric, on – premises technology provider to one of the top two global cloud providers. Cloud now represents over 55% of total revenues and has been growing rapidly. Over time, Microsoft was able to build a $125 billion run-rate cloud business that is still growing at a rapid pace and continues to take market share, while becoming a more important driver for the company. For example, in the last quarterly earnings release, Microsoft Cloud grew 23% year-over-year in constant currency, significantly outpacing the company’s 12% overall constant currency growth as well as the growth of its main competitors. A 23% growth rate at this scale essentially implies that Microsoft added a run rate of around $24 billion of cloud revenues year-over-year. Just to put this in perspective, $24 billion is nearly the size of Mastercard’s business, it is over 8 times Snowflake’s total revenue and is nearly 3 times ServiceNow’s total revenue. We continue to view cloud as early in its penetration opportunity – according to latest estimates from Gartner, global cloud spend is expected to be $564 billion3 which still represents only 12% of the total $4.7 trillion worldwide IT spending.', 'We also believe that Microsoft is one of the best competitively positioned large-cap companies with its vertically integrated software stack (infrastructure + applications), while the inflection in the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and GenAI represents potentially the biggest addressable market expansion for the company in recent history. We also view Microsoft’s competitive positioning in AI as advantaged thanks to both the fact that it does not face an innovators dilemma in its core business (as compared with Alphabet’s core search business, which could potentially be at risk due to GenAI). Microsoft also has a tight partnership with OpenAI, has a large proprietary data asset built over time, and has a go-to-market advantage through a vast and robust partner ecosystem and its significant installed base and product bundling opportunities.

Since its official inception on May 26, 1896, it's grown from what had been a 12-stock index that predominantly featured industrial companies to one that now showcases 30 historically profitable, time-tested, multinational businesses."", ""It's also an index that's seen its fair share of modifications since the late 1800s. Excluding company name changes and mergers of then-existing Dow Jones components with other businesses (which may have also resulted in a name change), the Dow has undergone 51 changes since 1896. On Monday, Feb. 26, the ageless index will log its 52nd such change."", 'On Tuesday, Feb. 20, the\xa0S&P Dow Jones Indices, which oversees additions and subtractions to the highly followed Dow Jones Industrial Average, announced that, as of the start of trading on Monday, Feb. 26, pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) would be getting the literal boot. Meanwhile, e-commerce kingpin Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) will be taking its place.', 'The writing had been on the wall for some time that Walgreens, which was added to the Dow on June 26, 2018, would be getting the heave-ho. Unlike most major stock indexes that are weighted by market cap -- i.e., bigger businesses exert greater influence on the point value of an index -- the Dow is a share-price-weighted index. Put simply, companies with higher share prices matter more than those with lower share prices, regardless of market cap.', ""As of the closing bell on Feb. 20, 23 of the Dow's 30 components had triple-digit share prices. Walgreens Boots Alliance had the lowest share price by a considerable amount -- $22.31. Based on the Dow's divisor (the figure used to convert share price into Dow points), Walgreens accounted for just 147 points out of the index's 38,564 points."", ""While I believe Walgreens represents an intriguing and inexpensive turnaround candidate that has a multipoint strategic plan already in place, the Dow's success hinges on not only having business diversity in the index, but also having outperforming companies represent the index. Walgreens and its poor stock performance simply didn't cut it."", ""After conducting a 20-for-1 stock split in June 2022, Amazon put itself on the map as a logical candidate to join the prestigious Dow Jones Industrial Average. While it'll help replace the retail aspect that Walgreens Boots Alliance brought to the table, Amazon will also provide clues on the health of the advertising market, as well as cloud spending."", ""The interesting thing about Amazon is that while it generates a lot of revenue from its leading e-commerce marketplace, the margins associated with online retail sales are very low. It's the company's ancillary operations -- which include advertising services, subscription services (e.g., Prime), and cloud infrastructure leader Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- that account for the lion's share of its operating cash flow and net income."", ""In particular, AWS is Amazon's workhorse. Even though AWS accounted for less than 16% of Amazon's net sales last year, it generated $24.6 billion in operating income, compared to just $12.2 billion for every other business segment combined!"", 'Despite having one of the largest market caps among publicly traded companies, Amazon will slot in as only the 17th most influential component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, based on its closing price of $167.08 on Feb. 20.', ""Amazon and Walgreens Boots Alliance switching places isn't the only change being made to the iconic Dow come Monday, Feb. 26. Following the closing bell on Jan. 30, retail behemoth Walmart (NYSE: WMT) announced that it would be enacting a 3-for-1 stock split, which would become effective at the start of trading on Feb. 26."", ""A stock split allows a publicly traded company to change its share price and outstanding share count by the same factor and has no impact on the company's market cap or operating performance. It's a purely cosmetic change designed to either make shares more nominally affordable for everyday investors, as with a forward stock split, or increase a company's share price to ensure that continued minimum listing requirements for major stock exchanges are met, as with a reverse stock split."", 'Walmart\'s press release that announced its 3-for-1 split made clear that its forward stock split was put in place to ensure that employees could more easily buy whole shares of the company\'s stock. ""Given our growth and our plans for the future, we felt it was a good time to split the stock and encourage our associates to participate in the years to come,"" said Doug McMillon, CEO and President of Walmart.', ""Although this stock split won't have any impact on Walmart's operating performance, it, along with the addition of Amazon and removal of Walgreens Boots Alliance, will cause S&P Dow Jones Indices to adjust the Dow's divisor. In other words, what $1 in share price equals in Dow points on Friday, Feb. 23 won't be the same come Monday, Feb. 26."", ""Furthermore, Walmart's stock split will cause the company to lose substantial influence within the Dow. Despite rallying to a new all-time high following the release of its fourth-quarter operating results this week, the company is on pace to be a $58 stock after its split is conducted. It'll move from the 17th most influential stock in the Dow to the 26th!"", 'A new era for the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average is right around the corner.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

But the business has had a difficult time generating any meaningful growth. It has pivoted to healthcare and the launch of primary clinics, but this move could take years to pay off.', ""As it has focused more on growth, the company took a significant step earlier this year, cutting its dividend to free up some cash. This should help with its long-term growth strategy. Now that the stock is trading at levels it hasn't seen in 15 years and possibly looks to be on a more positive trajectory, has Walgreens (finally) become a good investment to add to your portfolio?"", 'While Walgreens slashed its dividend this year, cash remains a big issue. The company needs plenty of it to fund its healthcare expansion, and it has now turned to the sale of assets and investments. Earlier this month, Walgreens announced that it had sold shares of Cencora (formerly known as AmerisourceBergen) for proceeds of $992 million. The sale will reduce its stake in the healthcare business from around 15% to 13%.', 'The company is also reportedly looking at selling its specialty pharmacy business, Shields Health Solutions. That sale could be worth close to $4 billion.', ""An even larger move might involve the possible spinoff of Boots UK, which could be worth more than $8 billion. Walgreens previously considered selling the U.K.-based drugstore but decided against it in the summer of 2022. Now, however, with the company's financial position not looking all that strong, all options appear to be on the table for Walgreens' new CEO, Tim Wentworth, who took over back in October."", ""As of Nov. 30, 2023, Walgreens reported cash and cash equivalents of just $784 million. It's particularly troubling given that over the past quarter, the business burned through $281 million just over the course of its day-to-day operating activities. It also spent another $415 million on dividend payments."", 'There is a big need for Walgreens to strengthen its cash position and by selling assets and cutting its dividend, management is showing that it is taking the situation seriously.', 'Walgreens made a big move at the start of the year when it announced it was cutting its quarterly dividend from $0.48 last year to $0.25. At $1 per share for the full year, the yield is 4.5%, which is still well above the S&P 500 average of 1.4% and higher than rival CVS Health, which yields 3.5%.', ""Walgreens' new dividend will be less of a drain on the company's financials. But that doesn't necessarily mean it will stay safe. In its most recent quarter, for instance, Walgreens reported a loss. And it also burned through cash. If those trends continue, even Walgreens' current payout may not be sustainable."", 'A business needs to generate positive cash flow to be able to sustain a dividend without having to raise money to make the payments. In the trailing 12 months, Walgreens has incurred an operating loss of more than $1 billion.', ""Investors may assume that since the dividend has been cut, the payout should be safe for the foreseeable future, but that isn't necessarily a given. Walgreens' troubles go far beyond just its dividend."", ""Walgreens is in the midst of a turnaround, and that can be a risky time to invest in a business. There's uncertainty as to where the business will go and what will or won't work for the company. Walgreens' new CEO is showing a willingness to make tough decisions, like cutting the dividend and considering selling assets, for the sake of the company's long-term future, and that's a good thing."", ""But at this stage, it may be too early in the transition phase for Walgreens to be a good stock to buy. There are safer dividend stocks out there to choose. Until Walgreens can demonstrate to investors that its financials are in much better shape, you're likely going to be better off sitting on the sidelines than taking a chance on this struggling stock."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walgreens Boots Alliance right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walgreens Boots Alliance, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walgreens Boots Alliance wasn’t one of them.

The picture on the wall is worth money because the museum owns it, it’s the original and they can prove both of those things,” Kaczynski said. “Up until recently you couldn’t do that with digital items” until NFTs came out.', 'Brands and companies having the ability to buy and sell and “truly own your loyalty is a new concept that makes it less one-way,” Kaczynski said. “While not all the community members engage in buying and selling … I think for a lot of people, having that optionality is so important.”', 'This story was inspired by an episode of TechCrunch’s podcast Chain Reaction.

The students are demanding that universities “either [stop] sales of Starbucks coffee on campus or [send] a public message of solidarity for Starbucks workers,” according to a press release emailed to Restaurant Dive.', 'The union and its allies will stage events at a wide range of universities, including major public universities like the University of Washington, University of Wisconsin-Madison, two SUNY schools, two schools in the University of California system and Rutgers. Demonstrations are also slated to take place at prestigious private universities, including Georgetown, University of Pennsylvania and the University of Chicago.', 'SBWU has increased pressure on Starbucks this week. The union’s labor allies are pushing Starbucks to disclose information on the costs of its union response. Workers at a record 21 cafes announced their intent to unionize on Tuesday, and SBWU members in Chicago and Philadelphia filed several of Fair Workweek complaints\xa0against the coffee giant this week.', 'At Georgetown specifically, students are asking the university to sell stock it holds in the company, said Ella Clark, a student who led the organizing effort at a Starbucks store in California before college. Clark said the university owned about $5 million in Starbucks stock.', 'Early efforts to enlist consumers on the side of the organizing workers\xa0didn’t seem to impact Starbucks much, but the company’s decision to sue Workers United over pro-Palestinian social media posts may have hurt the chain’s traffic in recent months\xa0and increased its reliance on ultra-loyal customers\xa0to meet its goals. In that context, activism among younger consumers could pose a greater threat to Starbucks, especially as competition heats up for snacking dollars\xa0and medium-sized competitors roll out aggressive growth plans.', 'Starbucks has used controversial tactics in its campaign, including workplace surveillance and diluting the electoral pool at unionizing locations, firing workers involved with the union in alleged retaliation, and alleged solicitation of grievances\xa0in an effort to stymie union organizing.', 'Clark said the company’s tactics eroded support for the union in her store, and she had a promotion revoked when Starbucks figured out she was leading the campaign. The National Labor Relations Board later found the company violated federal labor law in its treatment of Clark.', ""“We got over 70% of our store to sign union cards at the beginning,” Clark said. “Due to Starbucks'\xa0intense, aggressive union-busting campaign,\xa0we lost those votes throughout the period between when we filed and when we voted.” Clark said the union lost by 1 ballot."", 'Students framed the actions as a way to protect American labor law from erosion.', '“As college students, we’re the next generation of workers, so when we graduate, we want to make sure that our rights and value as workers are respected,” Valli Pendyala, a Georgetown student, said in a statement. “The first step towards ensuring that is fighting for Starbucks workers here and now.”', 'In 2023, a student occupation successfully pressured Cornell University into deciding not to renew its contract with Starbucks in 2025 after Starbucks closed all of its locations in Ithaca, New York,\xa0after they unionized.', 'In a statement emailed to Restaurant Dive, Starbucks said it was engaged in “efforts to negotiate fair contracts for partners at stores that have chosen union representation.”', 'The Strategic Organizing Center, a labor federation which includes the Service Employees International Union, of which Workers United is a part, is backing a slate of three board candidates\xa0for election at Starbucks’ shareholder meeting on March 13.', 'The SOC, in a presentation released this week, estimated that Starbucks has spent $153 million\xa0directly fighting unionization, and exposed itself to $87 million in liabilities as a result of legal proceedings and NLRB charges.', 'Starbucks claims it operates in compliance with labor law, and disagreed with Clark’s assertion that it engaged in union busting. Starbucks said it didn’t spend any money on “anti-union activities,” but did not specifically dispute the SOC’s figures, which estimate the cost of litigation, consulting, time lost due to captive-audience meeting, and liabilities stemming from NLRB general council complaints and administrative law judge decisions.', 'According to Starbucks’ 2023 global impact report, the company pays its workers an average of $17.42 an hour. If the SOC’s estimates are accurate, Starbucks’ expenditures fighting the campaign are equivalent in cost to about 13,777,267 labor hours, or 1,450 hours of work (more than $25,000 in wages)\xa0for every one of the approximately 9,500 Starbucks workers the NLRB says are represented by Workers United.', 'This story was originally published on Restaurant Dive.

Something that struck me is that all of this talk of generative AI. And, of course, you talked about AI on the call.', 'But you also talked about what you call pervasive intelligence. What is pervasive intelligence mean? And how is that driving demand for your products?', ""SASSINE GHAZI: If you look at various market segments and say automotive, industrial, et cetera, and you envision the future 5 to 10 years from now, all these segments are going to be more connected and smarter which the underpinning for that inflection point is going to happen through semiconductor chips. So when we talk about pervasive intelligence, we're talking about the AI as the mega trend, silicon proliferation everywhere. And most of these system companies, they have to have a view of their silicon in order to support that software application ambition that they have."", ""- Sassine, we look at the industry the market you operate in. It's basically-- it's a duopoly, Sassine. It's you and Cadence. I mean, you design chips, that's where you go to. What for viewers who are listening right now, Sassine? What would you say your competitive advantages are there?"", ""SASSINE GHAZI: So it's true that's our customer base has been the semiconductor customer. But if you look at Synopsys today, about 45% of our revenue are system companies, the hyperscalers, the automotive OEMs, the big mobile OEMs, et cetera. So the world is shifting towards more companies designing their own silicon in order to take advantage of an integrated stack of application."", 'One of the key competitive advantage we have is our leadership with AI for designing chips. We pioneered that in 2020. The other advantage is what we call design IP.', 'To simplify it, if you think of any chip design today, then think of it as LEGO blocks. And we provide many of these LEGO blocks semiconductor components for our chip customers to accelerate their chip design process.', ""JULIE HYMAN: And then, of course, you're hoping to maybe gain another competitive advantage with your acquisition of Ansys for $35 billion, which I know you're hoping to close in the first half of next year. What then does that sort of bolt on to the capabilities you were just discussing? And also what does that do to your client base do you see an expansion there?"", ""SASSINE GHAZI: Absolutely.

So we have strong global customer willing to lean in and support the transaction. As well as we don't believe there should be much in terms of pushback given our portfolio is very complementary. We don't have much overlap in the portfolio."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Sassine, finally, I wanted to ask you about the NVIDIA effect since we've been talking about the NVIDIA effect all day. You know, we've talked about it mostly in the context of the market. But I'm curious from your perspective, and I believe NVIDIA is a client, what the effect is on the industry? In other words, is there as much enthusiasm for clients to push money at AI and just be spending on semiconductors and semiconductor-related products more generally because of what's going on with NVIDIA?"", ""SASSINE GHAZI: Maybe let me give you a different perspective. Let me give you the silicon up perspective. So if you're in the semiconductor world, what you're seeing for sure is happening is the demand for more and more sophisticated semiconductor chips."", ""NVIDIA has done an incredible job. And, of course, NVIDIA is a very strong customer and partner. They've done a very good job to serve the AI training and data center which is exploding in terms of opportunities, as well as looking at opportunity for inferences, et cetera."", ""However, the use cases of AI are so broad that there are many, many opportunity to many other silicon and semiconductor companies. That's why you see, for example, Intel, AMD, many smaller companies are jumping into both the data center training, as well as the many opportunity for silicon and semiconductor chips for inferences for all the use cases I talked about earlier."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Interesting times indeed.

With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Gary with Wells Fargo Securities.', 'Gary Wade Mobley', ""I think when you started or you initially gave fiscal year '24 guidance you were expecting like China to, I guess, be a drag on the overall revenue growth. But in the first quarter results, it looks like sales into China were modestly accretive to the overall growth. And so my question is, do you still anticipate some headwinds specific to China? And anything specific you wanted to call out there with respect to the dilution to the overall revenue trends?"", 'Sassine Ghazi', ""Thank you, Gary, for the question. You are correct. When we guided FY '24, we called out 2 possible headwinds. One, the continued enterprise software slowness and the other one was around China, both the macro and the impact of the export control. That will continue in terms of our balanced view as we're looking at the year. And as we communicated as well, we believe that being pragmatic around the China growth as we look at FY '24 was important. Now as you saw in Q1, as you're calling out, strong Q1 that is due to some timing of our pull down of our business, be it in EDA or IP that can vary quarter-over-quarter but the remainder of the year is pretty much what we communicated when we guided the year."", 'Gary Wade Mobley', 'Okay. Just a follow-up housekeeping question. What was the RPO balance at the end of the quarter? And it looks like the other income is coming in stronger than the original projection, including some upside in the first quarter. Shelagh, can you give some clarity on the source of that?', 'Shelagh Glaser', ""Yes. The backlog is $8.2 billion for the quarter. So we had obviously a record backlog in Q4 of $8.6 billion, and that's sort of the natural lumpiness of timing of big orders. So that was a pretty normal expectation. And then some of the goodness we saw in some of our other with some improvement in some ForEx. And so obviously, that can ebb and flow, but that's what we saw in Q1."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of KeyBanc.', 'Jason Vincent Celino', 'This is Jason. Can you guys hear me?', 'Sassine Ghazi', 'Yes, Jason.', 'Jason Vincent Celino', ""Perfect. Maybe building off of Gary's question, the backlog, $8.2 billion, really nice to see in the high teens year-over-year growth again. I get it lumpy coming off a record, but it was down a little more sequentially than what we've seen typically from Q4s to Q1s. Is there any way to think about the linearity through the year, first half, second half or renewal timing? Just trying to understand the shape."", 'Shelagh Glaser', ""Yes. I wouldn't say there's anything unusual about it. I mean, year-over-year, we're up about 19%. So we kind of think about managing these things on a yearly increment because you think about timing of renewals and things like that, which usually we think about over the course of 12 months. So there's nothing really specific about the Q4 to Q1 other than I would point out that Q4 was an all-time high. So in some senses, that all-time high. We'll go through sort of the natural pull down and then replenishment of the backlog as we drive renewals and expansion."", 'Jason Vincent Celino', 'Okay. Perfect. And then on the IP side, again, really strong quarter, 50% growth. I know you mentioned a lot of new IP titles that are coming out or have come out. I guess, what was the main driver of the strength in IP? And then how should we think about that trend through the rest of the year on IP?', 'Sassine Ghazi', ""Yes. Thanks, Jason. As far as IP goes, the beauty of what we have in our IP business, given it's an interface IP, more silicon proliferation, more chip starts, they need IP to connect the chip, inside the chip, the different blocks to each other and connect the chip to the outside world, and this is where we lead with our IP business. Now that being said, there are constant new standards that are being delivered in order to support the complexity and the performance requirements for be it an AI chip or any chip that goes into data center, et cetera. Multi-die is another factor. The moment you start stacking dies together in a package, you need more and more interface IP to connect that multi-die package together. So those were the factors that were driving the IP opportunity, and we are very confident that this secular trend with IP demand will continue as long as there is more demand for silicon and more sophisticated silicon."", 'Shelagh Glaser', ""Yes. And Jason, I would just add the shape of the year is a bit opposite from last year. Last year, we were very back-end loaded, as you recall. And this year, we're a little bit more towards the front of the year. And that's really driven, as we always talk about lumpy in IP because we're building those new standards that Sassine talked about every day. But then when the customers need it to ingest into their design, that's when we get those big pull downs."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Jay with Griffin Securities.', 'Jay Vleeschhouwer', ""So I'm seeing with the Ansys acquisition, you are, of course, pursuing the largest convergence event in the industry. But the question is, in the meantime, could you talk about the kind of internal resources or investments you were making anyway as you await the transaction in terms of new technologies, new methodologies to effectuate conversions even before the Ansys transaction closes, particularly for the target markets that is motivating the acquisition, such as aero, auto and industrial."", 'Sassine Ghazi', ""Yes. Excellent question, Jay. So I want to break it into 2 areas of investment. One in the core EDA, not only with multi-die 3DIC but even if you have a single die in a package, a homogeneous chip, when we started the collaboration with Ansys in 2017, the intention of that collaboration was to bring an industry leader sign-off technology to our design implementation portfolio. That did not mean we stopped investing in our own organic implementation portfolio because you need to integrate some key engines in order to correlate with the industry sign-off. As the complexity since 2017 grew, our investments organically expanded in order to have engines sitting inside our Fusion Design Platform to correlate with the broadened touch points we created with Ansys from a simulation and sign-off standpoint. So that will continue in order to serve our customers deliver to a solution that they are looking in order to design and develop their products. So that's one bucket of investment. The second one, as we started expanding into new markets, automotive, driving our systems aspiration, the investment there was not only from the product side, was go-to-market investment as well in order to expand and call into a new set of customers like the automotive OEMs and other. And this is where we called out a month or so ago when we announced the Ansys acquisition that Ansys will bring in an acceleration of knowledge into that new market segments that they have an experience and brand selling into those markets. So those are the investments, both on the R&D side and the go-to-market side that we will continue on making until we closed the agreement and we start talking integration at the time."", 'Jay Vleeschhouwer', ""Okay. For the follow-up, one of the things that distinguishes your current business is the customer concentration. That is at least with one customer, Shelagh's former company. Over time, as AI becomes increasingly pervasive and all the other phenomena that you've talked about and that Aart talked about this morning at the IFS event call. How do you foresee your customer concentration perhaps evolving in core EDA, IP and/or hardware over the next number of years. When you think about all the various trends, technology trends that you've been speaking about for some time, do you think the concentration gets more? Or do you think that you will have less customer concentration over time and set aside Ansys for the moment?"", 'Sassine Ghazi', ""So Jay, just a correction, both Shelagh and I were alumni of Intel. I felt left out, so I had to correct you here. So I believe the market will go through phases of both verticalization and horizontalization. And the reason for that is when there's a new opportunity, you see many customers either are trying to build a complete stack of the platform. And you hear many of our traditional semiconductor chip companies talking about building a -- or delivering a system to their customers, delivering a platform to their customers. And when you see system companies are trying to go deeper into silicon to drive their own differentiation for their specific workload, specific application, et cetera. Regardless which direction it goes, for us, we benefit both ways because if the silicon customers are delivering more silicon and specialized silicon for these different market verticals, we sell them IP and EDA to deliver to those products. Same thing with the system companies, you know our concentration correct, that is focused on the chip companies that are working on the most complex SoCs because those are the guys that they spend, at the end, most money to absorb the latest technology that we offer in order to deliver on these complicated chips. So I don't see it changing in the near term. Now if you fast forward 5-plus years from now and many system companies have a very solid, broad semiconductor ARM inside them will be an expanded opportunity for us to serve."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Lee Simpson with Morgan Stanley.', 'Lee John Simpson', ""Just really rolling back to a couple of things you mentioned on the product summary. I think you mentioned a gate all around work with a mobile SoC player and then went on to talk about 2-nanometer products with leading semis companies out of Asia. Great progress clearly there. And I guess I'm just trying to understand, how does this come through as we get closer to things like 18A, 2-nanometers or N2 more generally at TSMC, all of which seem to be standing up in the 2025 time frame. So that feels to me as though that could and should be a pretty decent secular driver into the back half of the year. Is that the right way to be looking at this? Or does this come further into '25?"", 'Sassine Ghazi', ""So any time there is a new technology, in this case, the GAA, the N2, the 18A and maybe you heard Intel earlier today talking about 14A, that's a fantastic opportunity for 2 reasons. In order for the customer to be able to explore that process technology innovation, even if they want to get a feel, do they want to move in the direction or not? Does it add value in terms of performance, power, et cetera? That technology, that process technology needs to be enabled. In order to be enabled, it means Synopsys needs to design its IP on that process technology and make sure that our EDA products are comprehending that new technology in order to deliver to the target performance power area of this process technology. So our work starts at least 2 years before we start talking about the GAA tape-out that I mentioned in the script in order to deliver the IP, design the IP and making sure that our EDA products are available and ready. So you can think of it in the time frame that whenever you hear a new technology being introduced, process technology, there is an early, early effort to provide what is called the entitlement of that technology from a design point of view, and then you start seeing IP coming in, design start coming in around 24 months from announcement of technology from the leading foundries."", 'Lee John Simpson', ""Great. That's pretty clear, actually. And maybe just as a follow-up, when going back to the Ansys announcement that you made and some of the verticals that they play into, clearly, one of the main drivers that are happening around the automotive industry is this transition or migration to software-defined vehicles. And it does feel as software and hardware decouples, there's a scope here for someone to drive standards, particularly in automotive testing -- sorry, particularly in software, having that fully tested before sent over-the-air. Could that be one of the ambitions for a deal like this? And does that behoove scale to drive standards through? I'm just trying to get my head around what the opportunity might be there in new standards."", 'Sassine Ghazi', ""Yes. Lee, good question. We're actually at -- if you think at the software over-the-air update that is being pushed out to, say, a car, what is needed in order for that software to be implemented is for the hardware to be adaptable to the software changes that got pushed down. How do you know? Now let's assume you're an automotive OEM? How do you know the response or the reaction of that software update to the function of that system, the cost. And this is where we come in. where you look at the entire electronic system of a car, we can model every chip. We can test every chip. So as the software is adaptable and changing, the automotive OEM will get a feel and validation to every change they make without having to change, of course, the chips and the actual silicon that is in the car. So that's really where we come in, is that's what we're referring to electronics digital twin, where we have the ability to model every aspect of the electronics, the chips and the car. So those automotive OEMs can do exactly what you described."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Joe with Baird.', 'Joseph D. Vruwink', ""Great. I wanted to go back to IP performance. Sassine, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned how AI is starting to lift growth around some of the core EDA software lines. I'm wondering if you can maybe do that but for IP and how AI development that customers are maybe starting to lift growth in your IP portfolio. And then related to that, I would imagine these are a lot of advanced IP applications. Is this starting to show up? And what could maybe be favorable price mix, I think it's interesting, if you look at margins over the last 4 quarters now is actually higher than the Design Automation segment. So there seems to be something going on there that's quite impressive."", 'Sassine Ghazi', ""Yes. So maybe first, a comment because we did not get to that point where we are in IP overnight. We have built that business 25 years ago. Actually, if I'm not mistaken, this month, is our 25th year anniversary for that business with a scale that is truly serving our customers in an amazing way. And the reason I'm emphasizing on scale, the number of these standards that are required in order to keep up with the complexity of a chip, let's say, when you're talking about an AI chip, the bandwidth requirement to connect the chip to the memory to the networking part of it to the compute aspect of it is changing at a rapid, rapid pace. For us, that's a great opportunity because what it means any time you're going to the next version of that interface IP is a new opportunity to monetize because it's a new IP with an uplift in our pricing in order for our customer to get access to the latest and the greatest. So that's from our ability to execute and deliver high-quality IP to the customer when the customer needs it. Now the other part of your question, please look at the trailing 12 months. The IP, by its nature, it's pulled down where the customer consumes the IP out of typically what we call an FSA, a committed multiyear agreement that we have with the customer that they pull it down when they pulled the IP down when they need it. So naturally, you're going to see very, very strong quarter from either an operating margin or a revenue with a lumpiness where the next quarter may be significantly lower. But as you measure over trailing 12 months, you will absolutely see it up and to the right consistently."", 'Joseph D. Vruwink', ""Okay. That's great. And then second question, just looking at your inventory balances, a pretty nice jump there, which I imagine relates just to your expectations on the hardware business looking forward. Any changes in those expectations here at the start of the year? And then I guess related to this, how do you think about the concept of hardware cycles at this point? In the past, there was an all-new platform generation and then upgrading along the way. So you would kind of get ebbs and flows, but we're now several years into a strong hardware environment. How do you see that progressing going forward?"", 'Shelagh Glaser', ""Sure. So let me start, and then I'll have Sassine fill in, so we did grow inventory about 17% quarter-on-quarter, and that's to align with -- we had a record hardware year last year, we're anticipating another record hardware -- hardware year and so we're building to ensure that we have proper supply to support our customers. And the reason that it's so important in our customer design is they're designing more and more complex chips, this allows them to help infuse into their design environment, the ability to model the software before they actually have the chips, so they can find issues and improve their essentially time to market. So it's an incredibly valuable capability for our customers. We want to make sure that we have sufficient hardware available to be able to support this next record year. And I would say the capability that we're delivering to our customers through hardware is something they value greatly which is why we've been able to have record year after record year. In terms of the cycles, maybe, Sassine, do you want to comment on that?"", 'Sassine Ghazi', ""Yes, sure. Joe, if you go back 8, 10 years ago, selling hardware to customers. The customers viewed it at the time as an option. They could have gotten the job done without it, but they used it because it accelerated their efforts. You fast forward to now, there is no way a chip can go to tape-out, meaning to manufacturing without having many, many cycles of emulation and prototyping to make sure that you cover as much as possible in terms of verifying the chip before you committed to manufacturing. So it's no longer a ebbs and flows of demands around hardware. There's a constant need by our customers to expand their investment and support the latest and greatest systems in order to take advantage of ensuring that the silicon they get back from manufacturing is going to be functioning and working."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Harlan with JPMorgan.', 'Harlan L. Sur', ""Great start to the fiscal year. On the AI front, much of the focus has been on data center lake, data center GPU, networking, custom ASICs, focus there continue strong, but now we're seeing sort of this broadening of AI moving into edges and endpoints, right? So now many of your semiconductor customers focused on smartphones, automotive, PCs, home assistance appliances like they're all scrambling to add AI capabilities to their future chip road maps. I think it's resulting in more complex chip designs, more demand for higher performance IP, more systems-level analysis. Like is the team already seeing this in terms of design activity momentum, IP licensing engagements, maybe more potential opportunities for Ansys? I mean any color here would be helpful."", 'Sassine Ghazi', ""Thank you, Harlan, for the question. Actually, that's exactly what we refer to as pervasive intelligence. Exactly what we -- when we talk about, we're entering and we are in the era of pervasive intelligence, it's more and more devices are interconnected and smart devices. So that exactly means the reference you made AI on the edge, et cetera, which requires more sophisticated silicon and a broader silicon proliferation of those advanced chips. And for our industry, for us, when you think about EDA and IP, that's a fantastic opportunity. And this is where when we make commentary that despite the ebbs and flows of the semiconductor market, the cyclical market, we don't see it because the design starts is tied to those R&D investments that customers are expanding for all these different applications. So absolutely, we're seeing it. We're engaged with those customers and when we start describing our company as silicon to systems in that era of pervasive intelligence is exactly the opportunity that we're talking about here."", 'Harlan L. Sur', ""Great insights there. And then on Ansys, looks like your -- looks like your customers' feedback has been, quite positive. We cover 20-something-odd semiconductor companies, and we've asked them about this, and they also seem to be positively inclined on the deal as well. And maybe you can tell me, as a further endorsement on the strategy, I mean, you did see, I think it was last week, right, Renesas, which is a major semiconductor company, they announced that they're going to acquire Altium, this PCB design and analysis company for $6 billion, right? Looks like the systems opportunity is so important that they decided to bring the design and analysis capability directly in-house. But maybe more importantly, I just wanted to know like what you're hearing from Ansys' large customers about the potential combination?"", 'Sassine Ghazi', ""So the customer feedback has been truly overwhelmingly positive around 2 points they make. One, the challenges they're dealing with, they're looking for a deeper collaboration in order to solve the problems they're running into today. And as importantly, they're going to face into the future. So from a -- anticipated solution the way the customers are looking at their current product and future products, they are looking forward to this combination. Now the second feedback that is consistent is what where you were touching on, which is the system-level perspective which is, if you look at the various market verticals, you can argue each one of them is going to go through an inflection point at various points in time. If you fast forward 7, 8, 10 years from now and you pick an industry, let's say, industrial health, et cetera, they will go through that inflection point of transforming and digitizing their applications in order to be connected in order to be smarter devices in their application, et cetera. And this, again, where Ansys has a very strong presence. Because Synopsys for -- since its existence, we serve the chip design customer base. And of course, we extended into our system companies where today, about 45% of our business is with system companies, but those are system companies around hyperscalers and mobile primarily, with many, many opportunities to expand with other system companies. And that's where Ansys will bring in more than just the silicon aspect that is needed for 3DIC, but that whole silicon-to-system modernization for the rest of the market verticals."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Joshua of Wolfe Research.', 'Joshua Alexander Tilton', 'Guys, can you hear me?', 'Sassine Ghazi', 'Yes.', 'Joshua Alexander Tilton', ""Great. Actually, I really want to follow up on that last question about the customer feedback on the Ansys acquisition. Is the positive feedback that you're hearing from customers that currently don't leverage the benefits of the existing Ansys-Synopsys partnership? Or are these existing customers of both Synopsys and Ansys?"", 'Sassine Ghazi', ""They're both Synopsys and Ansys customers. Actually, I want to go back to give you the journey of the customer feedback. In 2017, when we announced the partnership, there was a lot of customer excitement because the way we structured the platform is an open platform, meaning you can use the Ansys sign-off product that can plug then into the Fusion Design Platform from Synopsys. And that same Ansys product can plug into other industry available platforms. Then as you move from 2017 to where we are today, that deeper, tighter integration is required not only for 1 or 2 products that Ansys is offering is for the broader portfolio. If you look at a multi-die package, the electronics aspect of it to design that multi-die package, you have a solution today that you can use from Synopsys plus Ansys, and you're good. As it's going through manufacturing, what they're facing is mechanical stress issues, and those are issues where as you squeeze in those dies inside the package and you're running the software workload, it's overheating. Some of these dies are cracking or warping, et cetera. So it's very mechanical intense challenge. We have that deeper integration will be required and needed, and that's what the customer is excited about. And when I say but deeper integration, this is where you need to move in actual algorithms and engines during the design phase, not only when you go into the later stage of the design for sign-off."", 'Joshua Alexander Tilton', ""Makes total sense. I guess my follow-up to that then is just are you seeing any signs from your existing Synopsys customers of excitement around customers who didn't leverage this partnership previously and now because of these integrations to come are like reaching out to you asking about the potential, the opportunities? And basically, is there any early signs that you're going to see incremental Synopsys plus Ansys users and payers because of this partnership or this acquisition that will close in the first half of '25."", 'Sassine Ghazi', ""Yes. So Josh, what today, any advanced chip. And when I'm talking about advanced chip, I'm talking about 5-nanometer and below, AI, chip, et cetera, is already using Synopsys and Ansys. I cannot think of customers that are designing most advanced chip with the complexity I described that they are not leveraging Synopsys Fusion platform and Ansys. So they're already there. But given the complexity is going to be further increasing that deeper integration and addressing the challenges beyond the electronics is going to provide the opportunity where 1 plus 1 is more than 2. That's from the core current chip semiconductor business perspective. Now the other part of your question, are there Ansys customers that today, they're not a Synopsys customer? The answer is yes. There are many, many Ansys customers that we don't see them, by the way, becoming a Synopsys customer in the next 1 or 2 years, but there are going to be many other that they will be a Synopsys customer regardless if they are designing a chip or not. I'll give you an example. If you are an industrial OEM and today, you are an Ansys customer because you're using Ansys to design the mechanical aspect, et cetera, of your product. And you want to move to the next level of product delivery where you have more chip content in order to support connected robot, let's say, and a connected and smarter device. Even if you're not developing the chip, you're going to need an ability to model that chip to verify that chip back to the example of automotive and over-the-air software updates. Those industries are going to move in that direction. And this is where Ansys has a very broad presence, that presence, that market knowledge, that brand that they have will absolutely expand the Synopsys market in the future, where it's an Ansys customer, but not a Synopsys customer."", 'Joshua Alexander Tilton', ""So just to be clear, the opportunity is more about making Ansys customers that aren't Synopsys customers, Ansys plus Synopsys customers and less about making Synopsys customers, Synopsys plus Ansys customers."", 'Sassine Ghazi', ""It's both. And there are Synopsys customers that today, they're using part of the Ansys portfolio, the more you integrate the Ansys portfolio into a current Synopsys platform, you're going to expand it. For example, the fluid dynamics inside the chip or a mechanical stress challenge that you need to deeper integrate into a Synopsys platform that will expand the 1 plus 1 will be greater than 2."", 'Shelagh Glaser', ""Yes. And Josh, what we shared in the announced that by year 4, we'll have a run rate of $400 million in synergies. It was cross-sell both ways is a big part of that. And then as Sassine's talking about that multi-die that is further monetization inside an existing customer because that's a more integrated solution than they're currently able to buy from either one of us individually."", 'Trey Campbell', ""Thanks, Josh. I just want to thank everybody for coming on the call today. And again, remind you that we're less than a month from our investor meeting, and we look forward to seeing a bunch of you here in the Bay Area or if you can, at least join our webcast. So we look forward to talking with you then. So thanks for coming to the call, and we'll talk to you soon."", 'Sassine Ghazi', 'Yes. Thank you, everyone.', 'Shelagh Glaser', 'Thank you.', 'Operator', ""Ladies and gentlemen, that ends today's conference. You may now disconnect.""]"

MNST continued to implement price hikes in the third quarter of 2023, with additional price hikes planned in several other markets through the remainder of the year. These are expected to have bolstered margins and top lines in the to-be-reported quarter.Monster Beverage’s fourth-quarter margins are expected to have witnessed gains from the easing of the supply-chain headwinds, particularly reduced freight costs.However, the beverage industry presents substantial challenges for Monster Beverage, primarily related to the dynamic retail and consumer landscape.

Today's conference is being recorded.At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Jaime Marcus, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations."", 'Jaime N.

As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel level results.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim."", 'James F. Risoleo', ""Thank you, Jaime, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. 2023 was a terrific year for Host on several fronts. First, we delivered strong operational improvements, driven largely by occupancy increases and continued rate growth. Second, we completed the work on the 3 strategic objectives we established in 2021 and we will continue to realize the benefits of our ongoing efforts well into the future. Third, we returned significant capital to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, continue to successfully allocate capital through reinvestment in our portfolio and announced an agreement with Hyatt to complete transformational renovations at 6 properties in our portfolio.Lastly, we maintained an investment grade balance sheet and continue to position Host to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities we see in the lodging space including potential acquisition opportunities.Turning to our results. We finished 2023 above the midpoint of our full year guidance range. We delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $1.629 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.92. Comparable hotel total RevPAR grew 8.3% and comparable hotel RevPAR grew 8.1% compared to 2022. Notably, comparable hotel EBITDA margin was 60 basis points ahead of 2019 due in large part to our efforts to redefine the hotel operating model with our managers.During the fourth quarter, we delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $378 million and adjusted FFO per share of $0.44, which includes $26 million of business interruption proceeds from Hurricane Ian. Comparable hotel RevPAR improved 1.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Our RevPAR performance for the quarter was driven by an increase in both occupancy and rate.Despite an estimated 30 basis point impact from the wildfires in Maui, our fourth quarter comparable hotel EBITDA margin of 28.1% was flat to 2019. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter since the onset of the pandemic that we have achieved total RevPAR, RevPAR comparable hotel EBITDA and margins at or above 2019 levels. I will say that one more time. We have delivered operating metrics at or above 2019 levels for nearly 2 years.As a reminder, the operational results discussed today refer to our comparable hotel portfolio in 2023, which excludes Hyatt Coconut Point and Ritz-Carlton, Naples. In 2024, our comparable hotel portfolio only excludes Ritz-Carlton Naples. During the fourth quarter, our portfolio results were once again impacted by the evolving nature of demand at our 3 resorts on Maui. We estimate that the Maui wildfires impacted fourth quarter comparable hotel RevPAR by 130 basis points, comparable hotel total RevPAR by 150 basis points, comparable hotel EBITDA by $9 million and comparable hotel EBITDA margin by 30 basis points.For the full year, we estimate that Maui impacted our comparable hotel RevPAR by 50 basis points, comparable hotel total RevPAR by 70 basis points, comparable hotel EBITDA by $13 million and comparable hotel EBITDA margin by 10 basis points. Including our joint venture timeshare, we estimate that Maui impacted adjusted EBITDAre by $15 million in the fourth quarter and $22 million for the full year.Our risk management team is continuing to engage with our insurers about potential business interruption coverage at Maui and the timing and amounts of any potential proceeds are not yet known.Shifting to another market that remains top of mind. San Francisco results showed meaningful year-over-year improvement in the fourth quarter. RevPAR was up 10%, driven by both rate and occupancy and F&B revenue was up 15%. Group business is driving the strong results with group room revenue up 36% for the fourth quarter compared to last year as our properties have shifted their focus to in-house groups until the citywide calendar improves in 2025.We have seen positive trends from 2023 continuing in the first quarter of 2024 with conventions driving weekday demand. In fact, January was the best month in the history of the San Francisco Marriott Marquis with total revenue and EBITDA setting all-time records.Briefly, looking at out-of-room spend in the fourth quarter. Comparable hotel food and beverage and other revenues were down slightly due to impacts from Maui. We estimate that Maui impacted fourth quarter F&B and other revenues by 60 basis points and 540 basis points, respectively. Encouragingly, the out-of-room revenue trends we have seen post-pandemic remain elevated for the rest of our portfolio.In addition to driving strong RevPAR growth and operating improvements across the business, we continue to be recognized as a global leader in corporate responsibility over the course of 2023. We introduced new 2030 environmental and social targets, which are aligned with our vision of becoming a net positive company by 2050, incorporate the progress made toward our prior goals and are more reflective of our current portfolio by updating our baseline to 2019. These environmental and social targets will enable our team to focus on and measure our progress over the long term.Our 2030 environmental targets are in their third generation and put hosts on a linear path to net zero operations by 2040, leaving 10 years to get to net positive by 2050. We now have 14 properties with lead certification and projects in the pipeline at 19 properties. In addition, we are the only lodging REIT to have green building certifications linked to our sustainable financings.In this year's corporate responsibility report, we highlighted our asset level climate risk assessment across 3 near-term climate perils, including flood, wind and wildfire and 3 long-term perils, including heat, cold and water stress. Based on the results, we have identified assets with elevated climate risk and their corresponding EBITDA contributions, which allows us to prioritize capital investments and resilience and better underwrite potential acquisitions.Our 2030 social targets are in their second generation and now include 2 responsible supply chain targets around supplier diversity and responsible sourcing and one new community impact target. As an employer of choice, we aim to lead our industry by integrating diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging best practices into all aspects of our culture.Turning to capital allocation. We repurchased 1.9 million shares at an average price of $16.50 per share in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we repurchased 11.4 million shares at an average price of $15.93 per share for a total of $181 million. We have approximately $792 million of remaining capacity under the repurchase program.In the fourth quarter, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share, an 11% increase over the prior quarter. We also announced a special dividend of $0.25 per share bringing the total dividends declared for the year to $0.90 per share.In total, we returned over $700 million of capital to shareholders in 2023. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, the buyer of the Sheraton New York repaid the $250 million seller financing loan we provided to effectuate the disposition. Our size, scale and balance sheet have allowed us to provide seller financing on 3 recent dispositions at a time when debt capital was scarce, further demonstrating that our fortress balance sheet and unparalleled access to capital creates unique opportunities and substantial value for shareholders. Turning back to fourth quarter operations. Our overall business mix results were skewed by Maui as leisure transient demand decreased and group demand increased driven by recovery and relief groups. Outside of this temporary demand shift, business mix results were as expected. Group led to growth with nearly 1 million group room nights sold in the fourth quarter, bringing our total group nights sold for 2023 to 4.1 million or 112% of comparable 2022 actual group room nights.Business transient continued its gradual improvement with 7% revenue growth for the quarter and leisure remaining strong with transient rates at our resorts up 58% to 2019, including our 3 Maui resorts. As we look at the current backdrop for our business, we are optimistic about 2024 for several reasons. First, macroeconomic sentiment is incrementally more positive with consensus expectations of a soft landing. Second, supply levels and anticipated growth in supply is at historically low levels in our markets and chain skills. Third, we expect tailwinds from increased airline capacity and continued improvement in the international inbound demand imbalance.And lastly, the transactions market is expected to pick up as improved macroeconomic sentiment allows for more visibility on operating performance and the market is expecting that we will see rate cuts later this year. As we consider these factors, we believe Host is best positioned to capitalize on acquisition opportunities with $2.9 billion of total available liquidity and net leverage of 1.9x. In addition, we have completed 24 transformational renovations in 4 development ROI projects, which we believe, provide meaningful tailwinds for our portfolio.Looking at results to date of the 10 hotels that have stabilized post-renovation operations, the average RevPAR index share gain is 8.2 points, which is well in excess of our targeted gain of 3 to 5 points. We are also continuing to reinvest in our portfolio with additional comprehensive renovations and resiliency investments underway and we do not expect meaningful disruption this year.And most importantly, we believe the diverse demand drivers in our portfolio leave us well positioned for top line growth. Sourav will discuss more operational detail and our 2024 outlook in a few minutes.Turning to portfolio reinvestment. In 2023, we invested nearly $650 million in capital expenditures at our properties, completing renovations to approximately 3,500 guest rooms, 111,000 square feet of meeting space and approximately 110,000 square feet of public space. In addition, we substantially completed property restorations following Hurricane Ian.In 2024, our capital expenditure guidance range is $500 million to $605 million, which reflects approximately $225 million to $280 million of investment for redevelopment, repositioning and ROI projects. Within the Hyatt transformational capital program, we have already started renovations at the Grand Hyatt Atlanta and the Grand Hyatt Washington, which we expect to complete in the first half of 2025. We will also start transformational renovations at the Hyatt Regency Reston in the fourth quarter of this year.Other major ROI projects include the completion of renovations at the Hilton Singer Island Resort and the construction of the Phoenician Canyon Suites Villas expansion. In addition to our capital expenditure investment, we expect to spend $50 million to $70 million on the luxury condominium development at Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World Resorts this year. We expect to benefit from approximately $9 million of operating profit guarantees related to the Hyatt transformational capital program, which will offset the expected revenue disruption at those properties for 2024.We are extremely proud of our operational and financial performance in 2023 and the iconic portfolio and balance sheet we have built and maintained. Our people, our platform and our portfolio have allowed us to create meaningful shareholder value, and we are confident in the significant opportunities ahead for continued growth and value creation in 2024. With that, I will now turn the call over to Sourav."", 'Sourav Ghosh', ""Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, I will go into detail on our fourth quarter operations, full year 2024 guidance and our balance sheet. Starting with business mix. Overall transient revenue was down 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by the evolving nature of demand in Maui. We estimate that Maui had a 590 basis point impact to transient revenue, which was evenly split between demand and rate. We were encouraged that transient rate at our resorts grew 2% above last year's tough comparisons despite the demand impact from Maui and renovation disruption.Looking ahead to spring break. Transient revenue pace is up for our portfolio compared to the same time last year, driven by occupancy and rate growth at our resorts. Outside of Maui, resort transient revenue pace for spring break is up 20%. Business transient revenue was up over 7% to the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by both rate and demand growth at our downtown properties. Business transient demand continued its slow and steady recovery. Room nights at our downtown properties were down 15% in the fourth quarter compared to 2019, which is the smallest gap to 2019 post-pandemic. For the full year, business transient demand grew 12% over 2022. In 2024, we expect further demand growth driven by large corporates alongside rate growth in the mid-single digits.Turning to group. 2023 was the year of group and convention hotel recovery. For the full year, group room revenues increased 21% over last year and room night volume recovered to 95% of 2019 levels. It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui. Excluding Maui, group room night volume recovered to 94% of 2019 levels.Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter, driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui. Outside of Maui, hotels in San Francisco, Boston, D.C. and Seattle contributed to the group room night increase. Notably, November's APAC conference in San Francisco drove results with an estimated 41,000 citywide group room nights.Looking ahead to 2024, we have 3.1 million definite group room nights on the books, representing a 16% increase since the third quarter, putting us ahead of where we were this time last year. Total group revenue pace is up 10% over the same time last year, driven by rate, room nights and banquets. We continue to be encouraged by the ongoing strength of group business as evidenced by strong pace, lengthening booking windows and double-digit citywide room night pace in key markets such as New Orleans, San Diego, Seattle and D.C.Shifting gears to margins. As expected, margin declines year-over-year were driven by increases in wages and benefits, fixed expenses as well as moderating attrition and cancellation revenues and impacts from Maui. Despite these headwinds, full year 2023 comparable hotel EBITDA margin was 30.1%, representing a 60 basis point increase over 2019. Our ability to achieve this margin expansion is a result of our efforts to redefine the operating model and is indicative of our strong execution, particularly when considering the total comparable hotel expenses have only grown 7% in the last 4 years and occupancy is still 8 points below 2019. Turning to our outlook for 2024. The midpoint of our guidance contemplates a stable operating environment with continued improvement in group business, a continued gradual recovery in business transient, steady leisure trends in demand and the continued evolution of demand on Maui as the island recovers from the recent wildfires. At the low end, we have assumed slower group pickup and softer leisure transient and at the high end, we have assumed a faster recovery at our Maui Resorts and increased group pickup. For full year 2024, we anticipate comparable hotel RevPAR growth of between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. We expect comparable hotel EBITDA margins to be down 120 basis points year-over-year at the low end of our guidance to down 40 basis points at the high end. Notably, we expect margins to be down only 20 basis points at the midpoint versus 2019 despite a 50 basis point margin impact from Maui.In terms of RevPAR growth cadence for the year, we expect comparable hotel RevPAR growth to be in the low single digits in the first half of the year due to tough comparisons to 2023, which saw a surge in recovery of downtown markets driven by improving group business and elevated leisure demand. We expect mid-single-digit comparable hotel RevPAR growth in the second half of the year as a result of strong group booking pace, less renovation disruption compared to the second half of 2023 and the diminishing impact of the Maui wildfires.For January, we expect comparable hotel RevPAR to be approximately $187, a 1.4% improvement over 2023. At the midpoint of our guidance range, we anticipate comparable hotel RevPAR growth of 4% compared to 2023 and a comparable hotel EBITDA margin of 29.3%, which is 80 basis points below 2023.As we think about bridging our 2023 results to 2024, we estimate that Maui is impacting comparable hotel RevPAR by 100 basis points and comparable hotel EBITDA margin by 50 basis points. We also expect a 15 basis point impact to margins from moderating attrition and cancellation revenues and a 45 basis point impact from property taxes and insurance. In 2024, we expect wage rates to increase approximately 5%. For context, in 2023, wages and benefits comprise approximately 50% of our total comparable hotel expenses and attrition and cancellation revenues were $75 million, which is approximately 50% higher than 2019. Our 2024 full year adjusted EBITDAre midpoint is $1.635 billion. This includes an expected additional $10 million from business interruption proceeds related to Hurricane Ian and an estimated $60 million contribution from operations at the Ritz-Carlton, Naples, which is excluded from our comparable hotel set in 2024. It is important to note that we have not included any assumption for business interruption proceeds from the Maui wildfires in our 2024 guidance.Turning to our balance sheet and liquidity position. Our weighted average maturity is 4.2 years at a weighted average interest rate of 4.5%. We have a balanced maturity schedule with our next maturity of $400 million coming due in April 2024. We are closely monitoring the debt capital markets, and we believe our balance sheet provides us with optionality and flexibility.As Jim noted, we have $2.9 billion in total available liquidity, which includes $217 million of FF&E reserves and full availability of our $1.5 billion credit facility. We ended 2023 at 1.9x net leverage. And since our last call, Fitch upgraded the company's issuer rating from BBB- to BBB with a stable outlook, returning Host to its pre-pandemic rating level. Wrapping up, in January, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share and a special dividend of $0.25 returning to our pre-pandemic quarterly payout level. The Board of Directors authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 on our common stock to be paid on April 15, 2024, to stockholders of record on March 28, 2024. As always, future dividends are subject to approval by the company's Board of Directors.To conclude, we are proud of our achievements in 2023, and we believe our best-in-class portfolio and balance sheet leave us uniquely positioned to capitalize on opportunities for growth in the future. With that, we would be happy to take your questions. To ensure we have time to address as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Your first question is coming from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America.', 'Shaun Clisby Kelley', 'Jim or Sourav, maybe we could just start off with a little color on the M&A environment. You alluded to it in your prepared remarks a little bit. And obviously, we know the strength of the balance sheet. But coming out of the ALIS Conference, how are conversations going? And maybe you could just lead us a little bit on how you can really tap in using your balance sheet strength to unlock some opportunities that others may not have in front of them at this point in the market?', 'James F. Risoleo', ""Sure, Shaun. This is Jim. I'm happy to take that question. I think our fortress balance sheet really differentiates Host in the space. Sitting here today at 1.9x leverage with $2.9 billion of liquidity is a testament to the fact that we can do it all as we have shown, and that's how we intend to approach 2024. We want to be net acquirers, we want to continue to elevate the EBITDA growth profile of the portfolio in 2024 through acquisitions but also through continued reinvestment in the portfolio as we've done over the past few years.You may recall that we acquired $1.6 billion of assets at the beginning of the recovery in 2021 and another $315 million in 2022 and over that time frame, we've invested from '22 through '23, we've invested over $2.1 billion in our assets. So our 16 properties under the MTCP, as we noted in our prepared remarks, are significantly outperforming our underwriting expectations of 3 to 5 points in yield index, the properties that have stabilized post operations are up to 8 points -- or up to 10 points, I'm sorry, 8 to 10 points, and we continue to do the same with the HTCP program in 2024 as a start. Now with respect to the acquisition market, frankly, there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale, certainly not assets that would interest Host. But that's really not slowing us down at all. We are talking to our competitors in the industry, our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets. We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation, on our ability to close deals all cash that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to get the balance sheet to work.So we're working very hard to find the right source of assets to add to the portfolio. The assets that we like are those that have diverse demand drivers with a combination of group, business transient and leisure and we want to continue the same. But at the end of the day, it really is everything that we do is to elevate the EBITDA growth profile of the portfolio.Now I said that there aren't a lot of assets on the market today. But I believe and we believe as a team here at Host that under the assumption that the Fed is going to start loosening interest rates in the second half of this year that will spark sellers to bring properties to market, and it's going to also for competition for those assets. So our point of view is, we have the balance sheet. We can do it all. We want to get out there, we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been an acquirer early in 2024."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from Smedes Rose from Citi.', 'Smedes Rose', ""I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about -- on the group bookings side. It sounds like part of your improvements you're seeing are driven by kind of large citywide conventions and the return is maybe sort of association business. But could you talk about maybe just what you're seeing just more on the corporate side larger meeting, smaller meetings, more frequent meetings. Just any kind of detail around that would be interesting."", 'Sourav Ghosh', ""Sure Smedes. We're doing really well on the corporate group business, and that remains strong. So while association is certainly coming back in one of your markets, particularly with citywide coming back toward 2024 in a meaningful way. The 2024 citywide room night pace is around 90% of 2019 actuals and quite a few cities are pacing ahead. But corporate group continues to be strong. And what's also important to note is their spend on banquet and catering continues to be strong.So the catering contribution at our hotels has not declined year-over-year and we are keeping pace both from a demand perspective, but as well as from a rate perspective. Right now, our group pace from an ADR standpoint, is around 4%, and we are pacing ahead to last year by 3.4% in terms of room nights. And on a total revenue basis, it's 10% that we are pacing ahead year-over-year. So pretty meaningful. The markets, which are driving this for our portfolio specifically, the 3.1 million group room nights that we have on the book for 2024. They include San Diego, Orlando, D.C., San Francisco and San Antonio, those markets make up just over 50% of the 3.1 million that's already on the books. And in terms of citywide pace, what's pacing well is also San Diego, D.C., but also Seattle, New Orleans and Miami."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from Robin Farley from UBS.', 'Robin Margaret Farley', ""Just circling back to your comments on potential acquisitions. I guess I'm surprised just given the maturities, CMBS maturities, some of which were pushed back in 2023 into 2024 that maybe there's not more kind of for sale in the first half of '24. So I guess what is your sense of kind of what's happening with those maturities? And then also, just curious what your current thoughts are on the type of assets location if there's been any change in terms of what Host would be looking for?"", 'James F. Risoleo', ""Sure, Robin. We track all the CMBS maturities, the CMBS loans outstanding and the maturities. This year, there's about $26 billion of full service loans that will be maturing. And I know that earlier in the pandemic, there was a lot of talk of distress. Frankly, we haven't seen it materialize, certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. We'll continue to track it. There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.And as you know, as I mentioned earlier in my response, we have invested significant capital in our portfolio. So we're in a really great place to continue to gain yield index and continue to outperform going forward. So I think it's still TBD on distressed but we're certainly not counting on that. We're making it happen on our own by trying to capitalize on our relationships, our reputation and our balance sheet to be net acquirers this year.The types of assets and the types of markets, it's really -- it's -- there is nothing that's perspective per se, that's off the list. But we are always going to be thoughtful about maintaining geographic diversification, which has served us well. I think notwithstanding the tragedy in Maui, the geographic diversification of our portfolio still allowed us to achieve 8.1% RevPAR growth in 2023, notwithstanding a 50 basis point impact from the Maui wildfires.So we'll continue to look at assets where we can add value through our strong asset management and enterprise analytics capabilities, assets where we see ROI opportunities that haven't been completed by the current owner and new markets, we'll continue to look for resorts. We'll also continue to start looking at urban markets today because we've seen some good solid performance out of the urban market. So I think recovery is on the way. We feel good about the macro picture. There is visibility from an underwriting perspective. And let's all keep our fingers crossed at the soft landing that seems to be the consensus to say does come through."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from Bill Crow from Raymond James.', 'William Andrew Crow', 'Maybe for Sourav, a question about the kind of the tail of 2 halfs of the year and RevPAR growth in the low single digits in the first half and then accelerating up to I guess, what, 5%, 6%, 7% in the second half of the year to hit your numbers. Can you kind of compartmentalize how much tailwind you get from Maui? How much you get from renovation disruption? Perhaps Coconut Point is providing a lift given the challenges in that market last year. What can you tell us to give us kind of confidence in that outsized growth in the second half of the year?', 'Sourav Ghosh', ""Sure. So the first piece, I'll talk about the first half, the reason that is low single digits is because of the tough comps that we have, particularly given the Q1 performance in 2023. And remember, 2022 Q1 was impacted by Omicron. So we had a meaningful amount of growth in the first quarter of '23. And the first half, leisure did extremely well, as you might recall. So just tougher comps in the first half, that's why the low single digits.On the second half, what's really giving us confidence are 2 things: One, specifically is the group booking pace for the second half, both particularly for Q3 as well as Q4, when you look at overall second half, our pace is really strong. We have confidence in that pace number and the second piece is really the tailwind from 4 hotels that had a meaningful impact last year from renovation in the second half, second half of 2023. Those 4 hotels really being the one hotel South Beach, Fairmont Kea Lani, the Biscayne Bay Marriott and the Hilton Singer Island, which is a complete redevelopment project.So that's really what's going to help drive that tailwind into the second half at group booking pace and the tailwind from those 4 renovation properties. There are other factors as well, but those are probably the 2 largest most impactful factors driving the mid-single digits in the second half."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from Michael Bellisario from Baird.', 'Michael Joseph Bellisario', ""You want to stick to your outlook. Do you have an industry RevPAR forecast that you're thinking about? And then specific to your outlook, what are you assuming for the mix of rate and occupancy in 2024? And how does that affect your expense outlook and how you're thinking about cost per occupied room?"", 'Sourav Ghosh', ""Sure. So the way we think of the industry forecast is -- and if you look at [SCR] it's effectively at around 4%. But remember, our midpoint number is getting impacted 100 basis points as a result of the impact from Maui. So in other words, that would be 100 basis points more if it wasn't for Maui. That also, keep in mind, the weighting of our portfolio is different when you look at sort of the different markets that we have waiting in. So it's not on to apples-to-apples comparison when you are looking at our comparable RevPAR growth versus what the third parties put out there. So that's one thing to keep in mind as well.So overall, please, particularly given the capital investments that we have made, which Jim talked about and the lift that we are getting from the MTCP projects as well as the 8 other projects that we invested in and the RevPAR index gain translating into EBITDA growth as well. In terms of total expense growth for this year at the midpoint, we are effectively at 5.8% total expense growth on that midpoint of 4% for the total portfolio. And sorry, the other question you asked was just split between occ rates on that 2% and that's pretty evenly split between the two."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI.', 'Duane Thomas Pfennigwerth', 'So on the group pace, I think you said up 13%. How are you thinking about closing group bookings in the quarter for the quarter over the balance of the year? Assume closing group would moderate as the booking curve continues to normalize. And then relatedly, are you leaning on group any differently than you did pre-pandemic given changes in underlying seasonality? So for example, given changes in business trends, is there more of an effort to lean on group to fill in off-peak periods?', 'Sourav Ghosh', ""I'll start with the second part of your question. First, it's really an asset-by-asset revenue management decision in terms of what is available and where we can maximize yield. And we're looking always at the total revenue piece of it. It's not just the room night piece because obviously, the banquet and catering that groups provide makes a meaningful difference. So I wouldn't necessarily say there is a different way that we are -- or the managers are approaching revenue management. Obviously, the goal is to fill the hotels with the highest not only rated business, but the highest business that's going to provide you the highest total revenue and ultimately, total EBITDA for the hotel.When you think about sort of the cadence of group for the balance of the year, we already have 3.1 million group room nights on the books. We expect for the year based on the midpoint to be above in terms of total group room nights for the year relative to 2023. And we do not just given how well we've been pacing, obviously, in the year for the year, pickup is going to be lower.And in the month for the month and in the quarter for the quarter is going to be lower than what we have seen previously just because the lead times have expanded not only for just in the year for the year but also into future years. But we feel very confident with the ongoing sort of the short-term pickup to make that gap up, particularly given sort of the need dates that have been filled for the year, both in the first half as well as the second half."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from Chris Woronka from Deutsche Bank.', 'Chris Jon Woronka', ""Appreciate all the details so far. Just had a question as to how you're thinking about cadence of transient through the year, especially as we get into summer Q3. Remember last year, we had a little, I guess, surprise where more International outbound and we didn't get the corresponding numbers inbound. How are you kind of internally modeling summer transient this year?"", 'Sourav Ghosh', ""Sure. So the way we're thinking of transient, I mean, we obviously expect is to be moderating for the summer. We just had an extremely strong summer last year. And to your point, I mean, U.S. outbound for the year was 117% above '19 level and inbound was effectively at 90% of '19. For what it's worth right now is the U.S. travel is projecting that inbound number is going to be more at 98% for 2024 relative to '19, which is a good stat. We do expect an impact on a year-over-year basis, therefore, the low single-digit guidance for the first half of the year. But what I will say is our fourth quarter ended with our transient ADR for our resorts, still up 58% to 2019.And what we are seeing in terms of spring break, and I think that's like most visibility we have because you won't really get into summer visibility until you get to the end of Q1. Spring break is pacing up 20% in revenue and rate is pacing above 7%, and that's specifically for our resorts, excluding Maui. So we feel very good, which effectively is saying that none of these, particularly the transient resort ADR is still going to be above 50% of 2019 level. So that's really encouraging. Not in a visibility into the summer yet, but spring break is very encouraging."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from Stephen Grambling from Morgan Stanley.', 'Stephen White Grambling', ""(technical difficulty) Obviously, we can kind of look at the total dollar amounts but there's been some changes in construction costs and otherwise. I'm just curious how you're thinking about the ROI on those projects? And if you can give any other color comparing and contrasting the 2?"", 'James F. Risoleo', ""Stephen, it's Jim. The first part of your question, we didn't hear it cut off. So would you mind repeating it?"", 'Stephen White Grambling', 'Just asking to compare and contrast the Hyatt transformation versus the Marriott transformation programs.', 'James F. Risoleo', 'And from what perspective?', 'Stephen White Grambling', ""How you're thinking about the return on investment? How these -- how the hotels might compare and contrast as to the reason why we should be assuming that these should be kind of the same uplift? Or could there be a difference when we think about looking at the 2?"", 'James F. Risoleo', ""No, I think as you're looking at the HTCP program, it's modeled after the Marriott program. We have received enhanced priorities on all of our dollars that we're investing, which is meaningful because in many of the hotels, we didn't have owner's priority for one reason or another, either burned off over time or it just didn't exist. So that's -- it's a big plus. Hyatt is also providing $40 million in operating profit guarantees to cover off the anticipated disruption. And as we noted in our comments, we expect to collect $9 million in operating profit guarantees this year that will cover the anticipated disruption associated with the Hyatt renovations. And I think the cadence is that the assumptions are the same. The assumptions are the same, let's hope the results are the same because the results out of the MTCP blew away our assumptions. But we're looking at low teens cash-on-cash returns, say, low double-digit to low teens cash-on-cash returns, which is the same way we underwrote the MTCP program. And frankly, the other 8 assets that have received transformational renovations."", 'Stephen White Grambling', 'And just one follow-up on that. Was that primarily through RevPAR index premium? Or was there also a component? Any way to break that down with F&B uplift or other revenue uplift.', 'James F. Risoleo', ""It's both. And I think we can talk -- I'm going to let Sourav talk a little bit about the F&B uplift because we have seen a meaningful uplift in F&B revenues throughout the portfolio.I think we have little audio problem here. Hang on."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from Aryeh Klein from BMO.', 'Aryeh Klein', ""So I guess within the 4% RevPAR growth outlook, what are your expectations for leisure performance? Are you seeing any kind of noticeable difference in the consumer behavior at the ultra high-end resorts versus leisure at your other properties? And then maybe if you could just talk to what you're seeing in Maui from a future bookings perspective?"", 'James F. Risoleo', 'Sourav, are you back on audio? No, you are not.', 'Sourav Ghosh', 'I am back on. I am back on.', 'James F. Risoleo', 'There you go. Okay.', 'Sourav Ghosh', 'I am back on. Sorry, could you repeat the question?', 'James F. Risoleo', ""I'll start that Aryeh with respect to what are we seeing from the leisure consumer. Our leisure transient traveler is generally, the affluent consumer in the country. We are seeing no slowdown in spend. We're really not seeing a backing off in a meaningful way in ADR. And out of room spend in banquet in outlets is still strong. This goes back to Stephen's question, the investment that we made in a lot of our properties and the transformational properties has resulted in a significant pickup in outlet spend throughout the portfolio.So the leisure is, from our perspective, it's still trending very strong. And I think that goes back to the commentary around spring break where our revenue pace is up 20% year-over-year for spring break, and we're very pleased with that."", 'Aryeh Klein', ""And then just on Maui, what you're seeing from a future booking standpoint that gives you kind of confidence in the recovery in the second half of the year?"", 'James F. Risoleo', ""Well, I'm not certain that we said that there was going to be a recovery in the second half of the year. So we hope that there is a recovery in the second half of the year, but there are a number of things that have to happen on Maui particularly on the west side, which is where the wildfires were. And the gating issue really is finding shelter for the displaced residents. And March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind. The Governor of the State of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents, then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals because I think on the island of Maui in total, there's about 30,000 short-term rentals. So it's quite significant, and we're tracking it very closely. Additionally, cleanup and the plans to rebuild Lahaina town are still in process.So the west side, I think, is going to take some time to come back. In the interim, we have been working with relief agencies, in particular, now the Red Cross. And we have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May. And we're hopeful that, that will be extended while the recovery moves forward.The story on Wailea, where we own the Andaz Wailea and the Fairmont Kea Lani is different. Those properties have been -- in the case of the Fairmont Kea Lani, just completed a transformational renovation. So the asset is in incredible shape as is the Andaz Wailea where we complete the soft goods rooms redo as well as the significant bathroom work. So both of those assets are in great shape. And we're confident that over time, as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea, which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali, that will be the cadence of business pick up. And I would just say that as we think about the midpoint of our guidance this year, we've assumed pretty much a 100 basis point impact on Maui, and that will result in about the same diminution in EBITDA as we experienced last year, but if Maui is better than our anticipation, and it's too soon to really know that, then we think there is some upside. And that takes us to the higher end of the EBITDA guide."", 'Sourav Ghosh', ""Yes. I just want to make sure I explained the EBITDA piece for Maui, to be clear. Obviously, when you look at sort of the first half, it's going to be impacted by the wildfire. That's about it, $25 million to $30 million incremental impact for 2024. So when you think about the total impact for the year, it close to $50 million that the wildfire impact is actually having as a result of Maui. So just keep that in mind, it's a $25 million incremental impact year-over-year, $25 million to $30 million."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from David Katz from Jefferies.', 'David Brian Katz', ""You covered a lot of ground already. And I really wanted to just maybe triple click on how we think about the boundaries for deals, more or fixer uppers in or out of bounds versus things that just need a little more strategic direction? And any thoughts on sort of size would be helpful there as well and that's it for me."", 'James F. Risoleo', ""Yes. Well, David, let me take the second part of your question first because that's an easy one. Bigger is better for us. And we don't turn any attractive opportunity away. But obviously, given our scale and our ability to deploy capital, we focus on larger transactions, we focus on complicated transactions, complicated boxes with diverse demand generators being group, business transient and leisure as well as hotels that have multiple outlets and look for opportunities to not only improve the top line, but to improve the middle part of that P&L through our asset management and enterprise analytics capabilities. We are perfectly open-minded to buying an asset that needs to be repositioned from a CapEx perspective. It doesn't concern us at all. We certainly have the ability with our design and construction group in-house to do that. But what we really look at is how is this asset going to perform after it is renovated and repositioned and how is it going to perform relative to the existing portfolio because our bottom line goal is to put money to work whether it's within our existing assets or new acquisitions to elevate the EBITDA growth profile of the company. So it's across the board."", 'Operator', 'Your next question is coming from Dori Kesten from Wells Fargo.', 'Dori Lynn Kesten', 'How is the spread between your group and transient ADR shifted from 2019 to today? And I guess how much do your transient rates drive your end year for the year group booking pricing?', 'Sourav Ghosh', 'Sorry Dori, can you repeat the question for me?', 'Dori Lynn Kesten', ""So the spread between your group rates and your transient rates, I'm wondering how that's changed from 2019 to today? And then the second piece of it was how much do your transient rates inform your end year for the year group pricing?"", 'Sourav Ghosh', ""Yes. So it's typically -- so I will answer the second half first, I'll have to get back to you on the specific delta to '19 on group and transient. I don't have that in front of me. But in terms of the way we think about the yielding, it really is group comes first. So you're developing that group base and you're seeing where the group rate is and then you're yielding the transient business. And depending on where group is coming in, and it's not just a rate piece, you have to remember, it's also -- we get a meaningful amount of ancillary business with food and beverage and golf and spine and all that, that makes up a pretty meaningful amount for our portfolio. It is looking at total revenue and what that contribution is to total EBITDA. So once the group base is built, then we figure out when the properties are looking at, okay, what makes most sense to layer in transient and at what rate. So you're going to yield out the lower-rated business and obviously move towards the higher rated business. So it's more the group base that drives it versus just where transient is coming in? I mean, so you're looking at transient pickup certainly and in the short term and filling that up, but it also -- the pricing is all determined where group set for majority of our portfolio."", 'Operator', ""Certainly. There are no further questions in the queue. I'll now hand the conference back to Jim for closing remarks. Please go ahead."", 'James F. Risoleo', 'Thank you, and thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our quarterly results and our guidance for 2024, and we look forward to seeing many of you at conferences in the coming months. Have a great day.', 'Operator', ""Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.""]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of the global leisure travel market, and go directly to see the Top 5 Most Valuable Travel Companies in the World.', 'After being severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, global travel and tourism continued its recovery in 2023. The United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) most recent statistics show that between January and September 2023, approximately 975 million international tourists traveled. Compared to the same period in 2022, this is a noteworthy 38% growth. Additionally, during this time, worldwide tourism recovered to 87% of pre-pandemic levels.', 'Meanwhile, according to a report by the Brainy Insights the global leisure travel market was valued at $1.2 trillion in 2022. The market is anticipated to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.8% from 2023 to 2032, reaching a value of $8.6 trillion at the conclusion of the predicted period. The main drivers of this expansion are the growing number of tourists travelling abroad and the rising standards of living of the general public. The rapid integration of big data analytics, the Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence in travel and tourism is another factor driving the sector. However, the report points out that the leisure travel market can be significantly impacted by geopolitical unrest.', 'In terms of market share by age group segment in 2022, the 22–31 years segment was in the lead with a share of almost 32%. The report also mentions that, with a 38.7% market revenue share in 2022, Asia Pacific emerged as the largest global leisure travel market. The expansion of the market is anticipated to be driven by the increasing disposable income in the region, particularly in China and India.', 'Building up on this, according to a global survey by Hilton and Ipsos of over 10,000 travelers from nine countries, the number one reason to travel in 2024 for most of the respondents was to rest and recharge with an emphasis on sleep. The survey also found that 64% of global travelers intend to prioritize leisure travel in 2024 by cutting back on other personal expenses.', 'On the other hand, travelers are focusing primarily on dining experiences while they budget for 2024, per Hilton. Exploration and adventure ranked second in importance among travelers (47%) after dining experiences, with Millennials and Gen Zers devoting a bigger percentage of their budget than other generations for these experiences.', 'Don’t Miss: Top 15 Luxury Travel Agencies in the World and 12 Best Travel Stocks to Buy Right Now', ""The survey further revealed that an astounding 80% of global travelers think it's essential to be able to plan their entire trip online, with 76% appreciating travel apps that reduce the friction and stress of travel. Additionally, it also highlighted that there has been a significant shift in the way individuals do business since the pandemic. Consequently, new trends like blended leisure have emerged, and over one-third of Gen Z and Millennial business travelers plan to extend their trips in order to take advantage of free time before or after work."", 'Having said that, today we will be taking at a look the top most valuable travel companies in the world which include Booking Holdings Inc.

They have felt a pinch recently from high inflation and high interest rates, but wages and job creation remain strong – and the positive mid-term outlook bodes well for consumer discretionary spending.', 'Airline carriers are likely to see gains in such a scenario. The airline industry has faced some idiosyncratic headwinds lately, in the form of airliners being grounded (think Boeing’s 737 MAX series, or Airbus’s A320/A321neo planes), but is rethinking its capacity for 2024 – and finding that a moderate outlook may still support profitable operations.', 'A note from Deutsche Bank analyst Michael Linenberg, focused on the airline industry’s US domestic outlook, lays out the case clearly. Linenberg says, “We believe more moderate domestic ASM (available seat mile) growth for 2024 will have positive implications for domestic unit revenue performance, and by extension, should translate into solid top-line performance for the domestic-focused names.”', 'Getting to specifics, Linenberg is willing to tell investors that its ‘time to hit buy,’ and he points out two airline stocks that investors should keep in mind for solid upside potentials. Let’s take a closer look.', 'Southwest Airlines (LUV)', 'We’ll start with Southwest Airlines, the leading low-cost carrier in the US domestic air travel market. Along with its reputation for low ticket prices, Southwest has maintained a wide network of routes, across the US and into several nearby international regions. The company operates a fleet of 817 aircraft, and these are exclusively Boeing 737 models – but not the MAX versions that have recently been grounded.', 'From an investor’s standpoint, Southwest has always been a return-oriented company. The airline has a long-standing policy of sending capital back to shareholders, through both regular dividends and share buybacks. The aggregate capital return since 2010 has totaled over $13.3 billion. The company suspended dividend payments during the COVID pandemic, but restarted the payments last year – and in 2023, paid out a total of $428 million in dividends. The current common share dividend payment, of 18 cents, annualizes to 72 cents per share and gives a modest forward yield of 2.08%.', 'Southwest finished its last quarter – 4Q23 – with a set of solid results. The company’s top line came to $6.8 billion, a company quarterly record – and a figure that was up more than 10% year-over-year and beat the forecast by $80 million. The company’s bottom line non-GAAP EPS was reported at 37 cents per share, 24 cents better than had been anticipated.', 'In another metric, showing the company’s strength going forward, Southwest reported total liquidity at the end of Q4 of $12.5 billion – balanced against a total debt of $8 billion, giving the company a stable base to work from.', 'Turning to the Deutsche Bank view, we find analyst Linenberg basing his upbeat view of Southwest on several factors, including the company’s large market share in the low-fare category, and its lack of exposure to the recent safety-related aircraft groundings.', 'Linenberg says of the stock, “Our confidence stems from the fact that Southwest is the largest low-fare carrier domestically, and in a very good position to benefit from both its own network restructuring as well as that of its competitors. Furthermore, Southwest has not been impacted by any of the issues that have led to grounded aircraft among its competitors (e.g., MAX 9 and GTF powered A320.321neos). Lastly, Southwest has run a very good operation of late following numerous investments and initiatives to improve reliability. We note that our target multiple is still very much below the low end of the stock’s mid-cycle historical trading range of 6x – 8x forward EV/EBITDAR as investors question whether LUV deserves to trade at a premium multiple (our target multiple is low enough that we can refrain from that debate for the time being).”', 'Summing up, the DB analyst upgrades LUV shares from Hold to Buy, and raises the price target from $28 to $42, implying a 22% gain in the next 12 months. (To watch Linenberg’s track record, click here)', 'Overall, it’s clear that Wall Street is not yet ready to jump on this airline. The stock has a Hold consensus rating, based on 11 recent reviews, including 1 Buy, 9 Holds, and 1 Sell. The stock is trading for $34.54 and its $30.09 average price target suggests a one-year downside of 13%. (See Southwest’s stock forecast)', 'JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU)', 'Next up, JetBlue, is another well-known name in the low-fare air carrier niche. The company, which began operating in February of 2000, now boasts over 1,000 daily flights to more than 100 destinations and employs over 22,000 people. JetBlue is consistently counted among the top ten largest US domestic carriers, by total passenger numbers, and has hubs at Boston, Fort Lauderdale, LA, NYC, Orlando, and San Juan.', 'Where Southwest, above, flies Boeing aircraft, JetBlue works mainly with Airbus. The company operates a varied fleet of aircraft, including A321 and A321neo models, A320 and A220 planes, and Embraer E190 aircraft. As noted above, Airbus has been dealing with engine issues that have grounded many of the A320 and A321 aircraft; JetBlue has been impacted by those groundings, with at least 6 aircraft already out of operation.', 'In another item that has impacted JetBlue, the company in 2022 entered a $3.8 billion agreement to acquire Spirit Airlines – but that agreement has been blocked in US courts since late last year, on anti-trust grounds. The case is still moving through the court system.', 'In other news, this month, JetBlue entered into an agreement with Icahn Enterprises, which is one of the airline’s major shareholders, under which two of Icahn’s top-level officers will join JetBlue’s Board of Directors.', 'Turning to the financials, the company brought in $2.3 billion in revenue for 4Q23, a total that was down 3.7% year-over-year – although it beat the forecast by $40 million. The company’s Q4 earnings came to a net loss, of 19 cents per share by non-GAAP measures. However, this loss was 8 cents narrower than had been expected.', 'Deutsche Bank’s Linenberg sees reason for optimism here, particularly in the company’s valuation and the accession of the new Board members. He writes of JetBlue, “We view the change in senior management and the involvement of an activist (who recently secured two Board seats) as a positive development for the stock. Furthermore, JetBlue’s $2.3 billion of equity value pales in comparison with its unencumbered asset base which we estimate is approximately $11 billion. We note that our target multiple is still very much below the low end of the stock’s mid-cycle historical trading range of ~6x – 8x forward EV/EBITDAR as JetBlue still faces uncertainty with its appeal of the court’s ruling blocking its merger with Spirit and the fact that approximately 11 aircraft, on average, will be grounded during 2024 due to GTF engine issues.”', 'Quantifying his stance on JetBlue, Linenberg gives the shares an upgrade from Hold to Buy, and raises his price target from $4 to $9, which points toward a 34% share appreciation for the coming year.', 'Again, this is a stock that Wall Street is showing caution on. The shares have 6 recent analyst reviews, breaking down to 2 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell, for a Hold consensus rating. The stock’s $6.08 average target price and $6.71 current trading price together imply a 9% downside for the next 12 months.

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with ROP.', ""Roper Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:ROP), a diversified technology company, filed its 10-K report on February 22, 2024, revealing a strategic pivot towards software and technology-enabled products in niche markets. The company's culture of acquiring cash-generative, asset-light businesses and reinvesting for higher returns is evident in its recent acquisitions, including Syntellis Performance Solutions and Frontline. Roper's decentralized management approach, coupled with a focus on empowering decision-makers, has facilitated a rotation of its business portfolio from industrial products to technology software. Financially, Roper has demonstrated a strong commitment to growth, deploying approximately $6,550 million in capital towards acquisitions over the past three years, including $1,380 million in 2023 alone. This strategic direction has positioned Roper favorably in the market, with a reduced cyclicality and asset intensity, increased recurring revenue, and a higher margin profile."", ""Market Leadership in Niche Segments: Roper Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:ROP) has successfully positioned itself as a market leader or competitive alternative in many of its niche markets. The company's expertise in creating high-value products and solutions has been a key differentiator, allowing it to maintain a strong brand presence and customer intimacy. Roper's strategic acquisitions have further strengthened its market positions, enabling the company to offer a diverse range of software, services, and technology-enabled products that are critical to its customers' operations."", ""Strong Financial Performance and Capital Deployment: Roper's financial strategy has been characterized by consistent and sustainable growth in revenue, earnings, and cash flow. The company's disciplined approach to capital deployment, as evidenced by its significant investments in high-margin acquisitions, has contributed to its robust financial health. Roper's ability to generate and compound cash flow has been a cornerstone of its success, allowing for reinvestment in businesses with high growth potential and incremental returns."", ""Integration Risks Associated with Acquisitions: While Roper's acquisition-driven growth strategy has been a strength, it also presents potential weaknesses. The integration of acquired businesses poses risks, including operational disruptions, technology assimilation challenges, and cultural alignment issues. These risks could impact Roper's ability to achieve anticipated levels of revenue and profitability from its acquisitions, potentially affecting its financial condition and results of operations."", ""Exposure to Economic and Regulatory Risks: Roper operates in a complex regulatory environment, with its products and services subject to various laws and regulations. Compliance with these regulations, including environmental, healthcare, and anti-corruption laws, is critical to its operations. Any failure to comply could result in significant liabilities, fines, or reputational damage. Additionally, Roper's business is susceptible to general economic conditions, including inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints, which could impact its cost structure and profitability."", ""Strategic Acquisitions for Market Expansion: Roper's recent acquisitions, such as Syntellis Performance Solutions and Frontline, demonstrate its commitment to expanding its presence in the SaaS market. The planned acquisition of Procare Solutions, a leading provider of cloud-based software for the childcare market, represents another strategic opportunity to penetrate new markets and enhance its product offerings. These acquisitions provide Roper with access to new customer segments and the potential for cross-selling opportunities."", ""Increased Recurring Revenue and Margin Profile: The divestiture of its industrial businesses and the focus on software and technology-enabled products have increased Roper's mix of recurring revenue and improved its margin profile. This shift towards less cyclical and asset-light operations presents opportunities for more predictable cash flows and enhanced profitability, positioning Roper favorably for long-term growth."", 'Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Risks: As a technology company, Roper faces significant cybersecurity threats that could compromise its operations and customer data. The failure to effectively mitigate these threats could result in litigation, financial losses, and damage to its reputation. Additionally, compliance with evolving data privacy laws and regulations is an ongoing challenge that requires continuous investment in security measures and risk management practices.', ""Geopolitical and Economic Disruptions: Roper's global operations expose it to risks associated with geopolitical events, such as armed conflicts and health crises. These events can disrupt supply chains, affect market conditions, and lead to economic instability. The ongoing war in Ukraine and other regional conflicts, coupled with the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, highlight the potential threats to Roper's international sales and operations."", ""In conclusion, Roper Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:ROP) exhibits a strong strategic focus on technology software and niche market leadership, backed by a robust financial performance and a disciplined capital deployment strategy. However, the company must navigate integration risks associated with its aggressive acquisition approach and remain vigilant against regulatory and economic challenges. Opportunities for growth through strategic acquisitions and an increased recurring revenue stream are promising, but Roper must also contend with cybersecurity threats and geopolitical uncertainties. Overall, Roper's SWOT analysis underscores its potential for sustained growth while highlighting areas that require careful management and strategic foresight."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

The report, which defines the ultra-wealthy as individuals possessing $30 million or more in assets, unveils a surprising statistic—67.7% of the world\'s ultra-wealthy are self-made.

The importance of dispelling the notion that saving alone leads to wealth cannot be overstated. With inflation rates exceeding 8%, keeping money dormant in a bank account results in a significant loss of value over time.

As skills and experience grow, so does market value, allowing for higher salary negotiations. Beyond immediate pay bumps, job hopping fosters long-term wealth by enabling skill development and expanding professional networks. Overall, it's a way to maximize earning potential and secure financial growth."", ""Investing in education is a powerful wealth-building strategy. By focusing on personal development and continuous learning, individuals can unlock better job opportunities, promotions, and high-income careers. This doesn't always require a large financial investment; resources like reading, online courses, and mentorship offer cost-effective paths to growth. Moreover, education fosters resilience, innovation, and financial literacy, empowering individuals to navigate economic challenges and optimize wealth accumulation over time."", 'Avoiding credit card debt is crucial for wealth-building. Paying off your balances in full each month prevents high-interest charges, saving money and preserving a healthy credit score. This ensures access to better financial products and interest rates when necessary.', 'Insurance is a vital component of any budget, safeguarding you from substantial financial losses in unfortunate events. Health insurance is essential to avoid crippling expenses from medical issues. Homeowner and auto insurance protect your property and vehicles. Additionally, term life insurance provides financial security for dependents. While building wealth is important, protecting it from unforeseen circumstances is equally crucial. Proactively insuring your most valuable assets ensures financial stability. As Jack Ma, a renowned Chinese business investor, wisely stated, ""Buying insurance cannot change your life but it prevents your life from being changed.""', ""Material wealth doesn't guarantee a positive net worth; having $1 million in the stock market doesn't offset $1 million in debt, resulting in a net worth of zero. Accumulating substantial debt is a major obstacle to financial prosperity. Paying off debt not only builds wealth but also reduces stress and enhances peace of mind. While some debt can be beneficial if used wisely, minimizing debt and financial burdens is advisable. Ultimately, carrying as little debt as possible is key to financial stability and wealth accumulation, according to most financial advisors."", 'Peer-to-peer lending, or P2P lending, facilitates borrowing money from individuals or businesses via online platforms that connect borrowers with lenders. Lenders earn money through interest charged on the loans they provide. Interest rates on P2P loans vary based on borrower risk, loan term, and other factors, typically exceeding rates offered by traditional savings accounts or investments. P2P lending platforms offer annual returns ranging from 4% to 15%, contingent on the platform and specific loan.', 'An Individual Retirement Account (IRA) is a personal retirement account, whereas a 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement plan. With a 401(k), a portion of your paycheck is automatically deposited into the account, often with an employer match. Conversely, with an IRA, contributions are made by the individual, with no employer involvement. Personal finance expert, Jean Chatzky, highlighted that the automated nature of 401(k)s, simplifies contributions compared to IRA contributions, which require active decisions. Once contributions begin, the focus should be on long-term growth through strategic investments.', ""Once you've maximized contributions to your IRA and 401(k) accounts, the next step is to open a taxable investment account, also known as a brokerage account. Allocate a predetermined amount to this account annually. Experts from Business Insider recommend allocating 25% of your gross income each year to a combination of retirement and brokerage accounts for wealth management clients. This diversified approach ensures that you continue building wealth beyond retirement savings, while maximizing investment opportunities and potential returns."", ""Diversifying your income beyond your main job or business is crucial for building wealth from scratch. Passive income, which doesn't require constant labor, offers financial freedom beyond typical employment. Warren Buffett's famous advice, “If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die,” underscores the importance of earning even when you're not actively working. In today's digital economy, there are various avenues for passive income, such as affiliate marketing, drop shipping, and selling digital products."", 'Commodity trading predates stocks and bonds and now takes place on specialized stock marketplaces known as commodity exchanges. Today, millions of individuals invest in commodities daily. One of the primary benefits of commodity investments is their ability to hedge against inflation.

Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$948.9m', 'US$1.05b', 'US$1.10b', 'US$1.14b', 'US$1.14b', 'US$1.14b', 'US$1.16b', 'US$1.17b', 'US$1.19b', 'US$1.21b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x4', 'Analyst x4', 'Analyst x3', 'Analyst x2', 'Analyst x1', 'Est @ 0.40%', 'Est @ 0.96%', 'Est @ 1.36%', 'Est @ 1.64%', 'Est @ 1.84%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% ', 'US$888', 'US$916', 'US$904', 'US$880', 'US$820', 'US$770', 'US$728', 'US$691', 'US$658', 'US$627', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$7.9b', ""After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.3%) to estimate future growth.

Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Hologic as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks in the Dow and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dow Jones Dividend Stocks According to Analysts.\xa0', ""Investors have employed various dividend strategies over time to enhance their returns. Looking back at history, it's evident that dividend-paying stocks have often outperformed other types of investments. Opting for dividend stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) can be particularly advantageous. This index comprises numerous dividend-paying stocks, notably blue-chip companies renowned for their consistent dividend increases. In 2023, the DJIA saw a significant increase of 14%, with 19 component stocks experiencing gains while 11 component stocks faced declines over the course of the year. Towards the end of the year, in December, the index reached a record-breaking high, surpassing the $37,000 mark."", 'Apart from delivering robust returns over the years, dividends have also maintained their significance as a growing component of personal income. As per a report from S&P Dow Jones Indices, the proportion of personal income attributed to dividend earnings has consistently risen over time, underscoring their importance as a source of income. In 2012, dividend income accounted for 5.64% of per capita personal income in the U.S., compared to 4.39% in the previous decade and 3.51% two decades prior. Conversely, during this same period, interest income from capital markets has steadily declined, dropping to 7.39% in 2012 from 13.51% in 1992. According to the report, the total dividend income, adjusted for inflation to $2000, experienced a substantial rise from $187.6 billion in 1992 to $757 billion in 2012, marking an impressive growth of over 300%. In contrast, interest income grew by less than 100% over the same period.', ""When investors consider dividend stocks for their portfolios, they often prioritize dividend yields. However, it's important to note that companies offering high yields but lacking solid financial stability could face the risk of reducing dividends, especially amidst global economic uncertainties and increasing interest rates. Therefore, investment strategies aimed at high yields should also prioritize the quality and stability of the companies in question. The Dow Jones Dividend 100 Index Series tracks the performance of 100 high-dividend-yielding stocks within each covered market, chosen for their consistent dividend payments and strong fundamental strength. When utilizing any income strategy, market participants typically prioritize both yield and capital gain. The Dow Jones Dividend 100 Indices have demonstrated superior yields and comparable capital gains over the long term when compared to their respective benchmarks. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, for the period spanning from June 30, 2001, to June 30, 2023, the total return of the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index, which assumes theoretical reinvestment of dividends, averaged 11.7% annually.

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead."", 'Thomas Ronald Palmer', ""Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. I'll please ask you to note our cautionary statement and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website. Today, I'm joined by my executive leadership team, including Natascha Viljoen and Karyn Ovelmen and will all be available to answer your questions at the end of the call. I'd also like to take a moment to acknowledge our friend and colleague, Rob Atkinson. Our Chief Operating Officer for the past 5 years. Rob will leave Newmont in early May, although his legacy will endure. Through his visible (inaudible) leadership, Rob has driven our fatality risk management program, achieving 5-year fatality-free performance. Throughout the pandemic, Rob navigated our operations through challenges, including periods of care and maintenance, border closures and vaccine implementation. Rob also represented the very best of our values when he guided Peñasquito through 2 major challenges. Resolving our community blockade in 2019 and an unjustified strike last year. In both situations, Rob found sustainable solutions that protected the long-term value of Newmont. Over the last 5 months, Rob and Natascha has conducted a thorough handover of accountabilities, and Rob will remain with us to support Natascha and me before finishing up. Before we get started, it is with great sadness that I share the tragic news regarding a fatal incident at our recently acquired Brucejack operation on December 20 last year. I'd like to take a moment to remember our colleague, Adam Kennedy. Adam was only 44 years old. He was a partner, a son, brother and uncle, a best friend and a valued colleague. Our condolences go out to Adam's loved ones during this difficult time, and we are again reminded how important it is to maintain a sense of chronic unease when it comes to the safety of everyone who works at Newmont.Any fatality is totally unacceptable. We fully understand the fatality risks in our industry and the critical controls that need to be in place at all times to manage them. So we have been taking the time to conduct a safety reset across all Newmont sites, not just the 5 new Newmont operations. With a laser focus on the implementation of our fatality risk management system, this reset work includes training delivered by our line leaders, our managing directors, our general managers and our senior health and safety leaders. The training is on our fatality risk management standards, and our critical control verification process. We are also concluding our thorough investigation into this tragic incident, which is being led by David Thornton, the Managing Director of our Africa business unit. We are applying the lessons learned from this investigation and all of our managed operations globally and we will share them widely with our mining industry peers. Nothing is more important than our commitment to the health and safety of our workforce, and we are determined to create an environment with every person working at Newmont across all locations, returns home safe and well, to their families and loved ones at the end of every shift. Turning to our performance in 2023. Newmont finished the year with a solid fourth quarter, putting us in line with the revised stand-alone outlook that we issued following the resolution of the strike at Peñasquito. In summary, we produced 5.5 million ounces of gold at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,444 an ounce. In addition to gold, we produced nearly 900,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead and zinc over the course of the year. This performance enabled us to deliver $4.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA, return more than $1.4 billion to shareholders and end the year with liquidity above $6 billion. In a few minutes, Natascha and I will expand on how we expect to improve upon this performance in 2024 and beyond, with a focus on delivering meaningful value to our shareholders. But before we do that, I would like to describe how we are transforming our business into a unique collection of the world's best gold copper operations and projects following last year's transaction.When we announced our binding agreement to acquire Newcrest in May last year, we outlined a powerful value proposition built around 4 key commitments. First, to set the new sustainability standard and strengthen Newmont's position as the gold sector's recognized sustainability leader. Second, to create the industry's strongest portfolio of world-class gold and copper assets in the most favorable mining jurisdictions. Third, to deliver $500 million of annual synergies and realize over $2 billion in cash from portfolio optimization; and finally, to continue driving a disciplined, balanced approach to capital allocation. After closing the transaction on November 6 last year, the integration of the 5 new operations into our Newmont operating model has been progressing very well. And as we enter this critically important year of integration and transformation, I'll be holding myself and my executive leadership team accountable for delivering on these commitments. And this will be our key focus for 2024. To support this work, earlier today, we announced 4 key actions that together will enhance our ability to deliver on our clear and consistent strategy.First, we plan to divest 6 high-quality, but noncore assets this year. From this point forward, our world-class portfolio will consist entirely of Tier 1 and emerging Tier 1 operations and districts. And it will have a significant exposure to growth in copper and gold from our industry-leading organic project pipeline. Second, we provided today our 2024 and 5-year outlook, giving a clear picture of the work we are doing to expand margins and appropriately sequence our projects to deliver sustainable value.Third, with the clarity, simplicity and focus that our Tier 1 portfolio provides we have committed to deliver a further $500 million in cost and productivity improvements across the entire portfolio. And these improvements are over and above our synergy commitment from the Newcrest acquisition.We expect to hit this $500 million annual run rate of improvement by the end of 2025. And finally, we announced a balanced shareholder return framework, consisting of a $1 per share annualized base dividend and a new $1 billion share repurchase program. Our go-forward Newmont portfolio is focused on Tier 1 gold and copper operations and projects located in the world's most favorable mining jurisdictions. It has 4 key features. First, it contains 10 Tier 1 operations, representing more than half of the world's Tier 1 gold mines. Second, it has 3 emerging Tier 1 operations with a clear path for growth, along with the opportunity to create a Tier 1 district in British Columbia, a district in which Newmont will be operating for at least the next century. Third, it has an unmatched organic development pipeline with 6 large-scale copper gold projects. And fourth, underpinning our Tier 1 portfolio is the industry's most robust foundation of reserves and resources.Going forward, Newmont has the industry's largest gold resource base, and we also have the largest base of copper resource in the gold industry. And to put that into perspective, Newmont has an almost 30% larger gold reserve resource base than our nearest peer. And a 40% larger copper reserve resource base than our nearest gold peer. No other gold producer in the world can offer the depth and quality that Newmont's Tier 1 portfolio can today. Later on, I'll provide a bit more color about Newmont's longer-term outlook and the exciting gold and copper opportunities that are ahead of us. But I'd first like to give some insight into how we are framing the year ahead. 2023 brought with it a number of unique challenges, which are now firmly behind us. The 120-day labor dispute at Peñasquito, asset integrity issues that were inherent in the original design of equipment at Ahafo and Canadian wildfires impacting our Eleonore operation, all meant that our final production did not reflect the full capability of our assets. As we emerge on the other side of these events, I am proud of the decisions that we took to protect the long-term interest of the company rather than seeking short-term experience solutions. However, I'm also not happy with the underlying level of our operating performance. We have the opportunity to improve our compliance to mine plans, our fixed and mobile equipment reliability and our mill throughput and recoveries. So our focus in 2024 will be on safely integrating new teams and operations into our Newmont operating model and culture. On transforming our portfolio and are laying the groundwork for sustainable operating performance, margin expansion and strong returns. Finally, this morning, we also announced that we have extended the completion date and increased the protective capital cost for our Tanami 2 Expansion project. In the second half of last year, we completed the concrete lighting of the top half or 700 meters of this 1.5 kilometer deep production shaft. This milestone gave us the opportunity to assess the condition of the node overbreak and ground conditions at the very bottom of the shaft. As well as incorporate the lessons learned from line in the top half of the shaft into the cost and schedule for the [run home]. We have critically assessed a number of options to safely address the known overbreak and line the lower section of the shaft. This work has included key third-party reviews before we landed on a method. And it was this methodology and the subsequent decisions that we took that have informed the cost and schedule update we provided today. Although I'm not happy with the extension of time and cost, I am confident that we have chosen a method that is safe and will ensure shaft construction is of the quality necessary to rely with service, Tanami's profilic ore body for many, many years to come. So with that, I'll hand over to Natascha to walk you through our operational priorities in 2024 and what we are doing to ensure we deliver on our commitments this year. Over to you, Natascha."", 'Natascha Viljoen', ""Thank you, Tom, and good morning. Since joining Newmont in October, I have visited 14 of Newmont's 17 managed operations. And I've been really impressed by the quality of the assets, the dedication of our people and the commitment from our operational leaders to drive safe and profitable production.Before I begin, I'd like to provide a brief introduction to the operational team focused on integration and value delivery in 2024. As mentioned last quarter, within our global operating model, we have 6 regional business units, each headed up by a world-class experienced Newmont leader who you can see on this slide. This scalable integrated operating model enables alignment across our operating leadership team while also empowering our managing directors to apply the extensive local and technical knowledge and draw on the global functional expertise to lead each unique operation.To support our operations from the project execution side, we have a dedicated restructured project delivery team. This team of subject matter experts is working across the full spectrum of our organic pipeline, including studies, project development, construction and commissioning of projects. By strengthen our operating model with block driving capability and an understanding of industry-leading practices in project development.This year, we will have a laser focus on the performance of our 11 managed operations in our go-forward portfolio, while also guiding our 6 noncore assets through a safe and productive process for divestment. As we work to deliver efficiency and reliability from our global portfolio, we are committed to progressing our 4 key projects in execution and keeping them on track in 2024.As a result, we are entering the year with a strong focus on integration and the safe delivery of our targets. Our success in 2024 will be largely determined by the performance of our 6 managed Tier 1 operations, Boddington, Tanami, Peñasquito, Ahafo, Lihir and Cadia, not underestimating the impact of the delivery from the full portfolio of operating assets.I will also separately touch on Telfer and how we are ensuring tailings dam integrity at this new to Newmont operation. We're very clear on the key priorities to integrate and deliver 2024 and how this set up operations for the next 5 years. I will touch on some of these in each of the Tier 1 managed operations. At Boddington, we are progressing the stripping of the current laybacks in the North and South pits as planned, with improved productivity from our fully autonomous (inaudible) fleet. And our poly metallic mine Peñasquito, our focus is on delivering strong silver, lead and zinc from the Chile Colorado pit, and continuing waste stripping in the Peñasco pit to deliver higher gold grade in 2025. At Ahafo, we remain on track to replace defective girth gear in the second quarter to maximize processing rates. At Tanami, we are improving material movement through the decline as we progress deeper underground. The Lihir's team is focused on simplifying the mine plan and improving asset reliability. And at our other new to Newmont operation, Cadia, we are commissioning the next block cave and progressing some important tailings rectification and expansion to set up for the next decade of all feed. We have a full potential team on the ground at Lihir and Cadia, actively working through our diagnosis phase and designing the initiatives to extract value and deliver the opportunities identified. So taking these key priorities into account, we anticipate that production will be around 53% weighted towards the second half of the year as we return to full processing rates at Ahafo to reach higher grades from the liberator ore body at Tanami and safely integrate the new to Newmont sites into the Newmont operating model. Now just touching briefly on Telfer and noncore operation in Australia. We are focused on remediating sink holes and fracs detected at the timing storage facility in December. When we stopped the mill to complete the first phase of remediation work. In early February, we temporarily restarted plant whilst evaluating options for further remediation of an adjacent tailing facility, and we'll provide an update on that work on our first quarter earnings call. And with a focus on fatality risk management, respected work and full potential in place, we remain firmly on track to deliver on our commitments this year. On top of delivering in 2024 operationally, we are working to bring forward new low-cost ounces from the 4 key projects we have in execution. These projects include the second expansion at Tanami, as Tom just covered, where our focus is on safely lining the lower section of the shaft and continuing to construct to the crushing and conveying infrastructure underground. 2 block cave projects at Cadia to recover both gold and copper, where we have just delivered first ore as we ramp up the first of these caves. At our new mine, Ahafo North, where we are making good progress on the construction of the mill and other supporting infrastructure, along with waste stripping to allow us to start accessing the ore for stockpiling. When this exciting new mine is combined with the underground potential at Subika, Apensu and Awonsu. We have a Tier 1 Ahafo districts that will be capable of producing around 850,000 ounces of gold per year out to and beyond 2050, which would make it one of the world's top gold mining district by any measure. Now bringing it all together, as we focus on integration and safe delivery this year, we expect our Tier 1 portfolio to produce around 5.6 million ounces of gold at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,300 per ounce, combined with a very significant 1.9 million gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead, zinc and molybdenum. Our unit cost are expected to improve compared to 2023 due to steady production volumes and the delivery of synergies and full potential improvements with the lowest unit cost coming from Newmont's managed Tier 1 portfolio. Our capital reinvestment remains in line with pre-acquisition spending levels as we continue to focus on disciplined delivery and a balanced approach to capital allocation. And with this stable production and structured reinvestment we are strongly positioned to integrate and deliver on our commitments in 2024, setting the stage to future-proof these world-class assets with benchmark performance and meaningful growth in 2025 and beyond. And with that, I will turn it back to Tom."", 'Thomas Ronald Palmer', ""Thanks, Natascha. Building of the foundation we're establishing in 2024 that Natascha just covered. I'd like to now provide a little bit more color around the opportunities that we are seeing from our go-forward portfolio. We will continue to optimize the performance of our mature Tier 1 operations and our new to Newmont assets. At Boddington, the stripping we are doing today will bring forward strong gold and copper grades starting in 2026, all supported by the gold industry's only fully autonomous (inaudible). At Tanami, the completion of the second expansion will provide efficient access to ore at depth and open up this prolific underground ore body in 2027 and beyond. At Peñasquito, the stripping we are currently doing will bring forward a higher proportion of gold ounces for the Penasco pit, balancing the strong production of silver, lead and zinc from the Chile Colorado pit. At Ahafo, we are building district potential with new low-cost ounces from both underground and open pit at Ahafo South and our new mine, Ahafo North coming online in 2025. At Cadia, we will commission our second block cave in this time frame, bringing forward higher gold and copper grades whilst in parallel leveraging our full potential program to improve their reliability and throughput. And finally, simplifying Lihir's mine plan is expected to deliver a strong improvement in gold production as we reach high grades from Phase 14a. As I mentioned earlier, with a clear line of sight into our, into the Tier 1 managed operations in our portfolio, we have identified $500 million of additional cost and productivity improvements over and above our synergy commitments. So taking everything into account, over the next 5 years, we expect to deliver growing gold production driven by the completion of laybacks at both Boddington and Penasquito, the new ounces from Ahafo North, the completion of the second expansion at Tanami at both block caves at Cadia, and mining improvements combined with higher grades at Lihir. And on top of this improving gold production, Newmont will produce a significant amount of copper along with silver, lead, zinc and molybdenum. From a global, diversified Tier 1 portfolio. Driven by this higher metal production and with a focus on improving costs, we expect to deliver lower all-in sustaining costs. bringing our go-forward portfolio down to around $1,150 per ounce by 2027. For development capital we are applying a pragmatic and methodical approach to our project work to ensure that we are efficiently bringing forward opportunities that are aligned with our strategy. whilst also remaining disciplined with our capital allocation priorities. We expect to spend an average of $1.3 billion per year on development capital. Driving healthy competition for investment as we close out the 4 projects in execution and bring forward the next way of profitable production from our organic project pipeline. Newmont is supported by the deepest and best project pipeline in the gold industry, and we will manage it with discipline and rigor to ensure that the most value-accretive opportunities are advanced at the right time and in the right order. We have 3 world-class copper gold projects in our pipeline ramped up behind the 4 projects we currently have in execution, building underground with the block cave at Red Chris, developing the Wafi-Golpu block cave and processing the sulfide ore at Yanacocha. And then when we look beyond these projects, we have 3 exciting long-term opportunities to further diversify the copper, Galore Creek, Nueva Unión and Norte Abierto. Over the next 10 years, demand for copper is expected to increase significantly. And based on current copper production trends, the world can expect to experience around 10 million tonne shortfall in this critical metal by 2035. Bridging this gap will require significantly more copper mines as well as copper recycling and enhanced copper leaching processes, creating an exciting opportunity for Newmont to help meet this demand with the organic copper exposure we have in our portfolio, whilst continuing to provide unparalleled exposure to gold and its enduring value. And with that, I'll hand it over to Karyn to talk through our balanced capital allocation strategy."", 'Karyn F. Ovelmen', ""Thank you, Tom. Our capital allocation strategy is underpinned by 3 priorities: working in (inaudible) these priorities maintain the financial flexibility necessary to reinvest in our business with the goal of generating long-term sustainable free cash flow, in turn, positioning us to return capital to shareholders through our balanced shareholder return framework. Beginning with financial flexibility, the first of our 3 priorities, we intend to maintain an investment-grade balance sheet with gross debt of up to $8 billion and liquidity of $7 billion, including approximately $3 billion of cash. And by maintaining a strong balance sheet, we can ensure we have the ability to steadily fund cash-generative capital projects all while returning capital to shareholders. As announced this morning, we have 6 assets currently classified as noncore. The anticipated proceeds from these divestments along with free cash flow from operations will cycle through our capital allocation priorities, beginning with enhancing our financial strength and flexibility. Divestiture proceeds will first be allocated to maintaining our minimum cash balance of approximately $3 billion and will then be applied to reducing debt to $8 billion or below. Once our initial debt target of $8 billion is achieved, we intend to return both free cash flow from operations and divestiture proceeds to our shareholders, which I will touch on in more detail in a minute. Moving to Sustainable investments. As Tom and Natascha mentioned, over the next 5 years, we expect meaningful production growth from our long-life, low-cost operations as we invest an average of $1.3 billion of development capital into projects that will generate the highest returns. The third priority of our capital allocation approach is a balanced shareholder return framework designed to return capital to shareholders through our base dividend and share repurchases. To be clear, we are not yet where we want to be in terms of generating free cash flow to return to our shareholders, but believe we have the right framework in place to return an increasing amount of capital as our operational and financial performance improves.Our balanced shareholder return framework begins with an annualized base dividend of $1 per share, an amount that will remain fixed and currently equates to a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share. We expect to be able to pay the base dividend from free cash flow over time. Our dividend is subject to approval from our Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. Historically, our free cash flow generation has been weighted towards the back end of the year, and we expect that will be the case in 2024 as our production profile and synergy realization is expected to be higher in the second half of the year than in the first half. In addition, free cash flow generation in the first quarter of 2024 will be impacted by the payment of a stamp duty tax related to the acquisition of Newcrest. The same duty was accrued in the fourth quarter and paid in February. As necessary, we will use the flexibility of our balance sheet to fund the base dividend through the quarters with the annualized $1 per share dividend expected to be ultimately funded with free cash flow. Additionally, our Board has authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program. As the liquidity and debt parameters I defined earlier are satisfied, we intend to repurchase shares in line with our free cash flow and asset sale proceeds. To reiterate, our free cash flow and proceeds investments will be prioritized as follows: The first dollar will be allocated to maintaining our management cash balance; the second will be applied to reducing debt to $8 billion; and the third will go towards share repurchases. Our go-forward portfolio positions us to improve margins and performance over time, funding our capital allocation priorities and allowing us to reward our shareholders directly with returns of capital. And we believe reducing debt and returning capital to shareholders creates an attractive value proposition for new and existing investors, while also improving the company's financial position over the long term. I'll now turn it back to Tom for closing remarks."", 'Thomas Ronald Palmer', ""Thanks, Karyn. Newmont's go-forward portfolio sets the new standard for gold and copper mining and provides our shareholders with exposure to the highest concentration of Tier 1 assets in the sector located in the most favorable mining jurisdictions and with an improving cost profile to maximize margins and generate strong free cash flow. We provide industry-leading growth optionality in copper and gold through disciplined reinvestment and project execution and provides a balanced shareholder return framework. As we look forward to this very important year of integration and transformation I am very confident in the quality of our assets and the capability of our team to deliver on our commitments and justify our position as the benchmark gold equity. This year, we will also be continuing to work on transforming our go-forward portfolio and importantly, building out the strategic and life of mine plans for each of our managed operations. And I look forward to updating you on the longer-term potential of this world-class portfolio at our Capital Market Days in the second half of this year. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is from the line of Daniel Morgan of Barrenjoey.', 'Daniel Morgan', ""Tom and Tim. First question is just, obviously, there's a lot of operational issues short term in nature in 2024. How many of these are resolved by the end of this year in your mind? And then does anything carry on into 2025?"", 'Thomas Ronald Palmer', ""I very much see the operational issues as 2023 events that are largely behind us. So I look into this year with our, particularly with our go-forward portfolio, the one matter that carries over '23 and to '24 is the defected girth gear at Ahafo. And we'll work through a process of replacing that girth throughout the first half of this year. So very much got firm line of sight on that work and that impact of that girth gear reflects in the guidance we provide for the Ahafo operation.I think, Daniel, the other factor that flows from '23 into '24 is our life cycle of our mines. We have 2 of our biggest operations in Boddington and Peñasquito, both in a stripping campaign in 2024. If we hadn't had the strike in '23, we would have been back into the Peñasco pit and high-grade gold. We look to have a balanced portfolio in terms of those tripping campaigns. So we have a situation now in '24 where both Penasquito and Boddington are into lower grades because they're doing a bunch of waste stripping.We'll work through that in Peñasquito this year. Boddington stripping campaign is through '24 and '25 before we see the higher grades come back again at Boddington in '26. But operationally in that go-forward portfolio, no carryover issues, Daniel, and we're very much getting after those. And then we'll see the ounces come through because we hit higher grades. Well, the ounces come through because some of the investments we've been making start to deliver lower cost ounces in '25 and beyond."", 'Daniel Morgan', ""And just a follow-up, I guess, on that, is there any key downside risks that you might call out in achieving your guidance? Like any key assumptions or key assets or anything that you've baked into your thinking, which you'd be thinking could carry a risk during the year?"", 'Thomas Ronald Palmer', ""Thanks, Daniel. I'll start. I'm just looking across to Natascha who might want to build on this. Nothing out of the ordinary, Daniel. It's, when we build our plans, we've certainly built them. We're using our methodologies, which we used for many years at Newmont, where we, we build it from bottom up based on our previous demonstrated performance, and we built some stretch into those plans. So there's nothing unusual about that in terms of what we're looking to do from a mining, [appraising] perspective and then the various reliabilities that sit around by fixed and mobile equipment. So nothing particularly extraordinary. And I think we've had 3 months with our new to Newmont operations. And I think we've been able to go through a period of time, as you can imagine, when you go through an acquisition, to shake out the unknown and knowns and ensure that we build those into our plan and budget for '24. Natascha anything you can build off in terms of that?"", 'Natascha Viljoen', 'I think when I can probably build this is the clear focus that we have. We know exactly what we need to do in each of these operations to deliver on 2024 and set up for beyond 2024. So other than just being clear on any potential risk that would have been considered. It is being very clear on our deliverables.', 'Operator', 'Our next question today is from the line of David Radcliffe of Global Mining Research.', 'Unidentified Analyst', ""My first question is in relation to the 6 assets you've identified for divestment. Are you able to provide some more color on how far along this process is? Is it just starting? Or are we above or maybe we received a few indicative offers? And then is this process to do all 6 or 1 (inaudible) at stage."", 'Thomas Ronald Palmer', ""Very much at the start of the process. So what we've been looking to do is we closed the transaction is work through an understanding portfolio and then realize that transformational nature of the Tier 1 go-forward portfolio. We made the decision then that we wanted to provide that clarity and transparency around the 6 very high-quality assets that are in great locations in Canada, Ghana and Australia. But they're not Tier 1. We can't ever see a pathway to Tier 1. Therefore, they won't get the management time, attention or access to capital in a Newmont portfolio. So we made the decision to be clear about that, and to provide that transparency so we can focus on our go-forward Tier 1 portfolio and safely manage those assets through our divestment process this year.So that we're at the starting point in terms of having made and communicating that decision. So we'll start the process from today. And obviously, because we're transparent about it, we expect inbounds will come from today as well. Probably, David, into 3 categories when you think about a process this year, I think there'll be a process that will follow for Telfer in Australia. It's quite unique in terms of its circumstance. Similarly, (inaudible) Ghana will have a suite of different types of buyers and a separate process. And then we think about the North American assets probably being in a process themselves. So imagine 3 processes and some stagger around that process over the course of this year with the more complex one being how we think about the 4 North American assets and they copy project (inaudible)."", 'Unidentified Analyst', ""Great. That's very clear. Then maybe just follow up on that. Could you maybe clarify how the divestments fit into the capital allocation framework? So the first $1 billion would be obviously for a debt reduction, then the next $1 billion, I guess, and just maybe a simplistic way to think about it, towards the buyback. And in the event the proceeds exceed this level, would they likely flow to debt reduction because I'm sure that $8 billion target is made an initial target or potentially to shareholders?"", 'Thomas Ronald Palmer', ""Thanks, David. So net free cash flow, we generate over and above those commitments plus the proceeds from divestments. The very first dollar will be maintaining that $3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. And building that cash to get ready to pay down debt to get to that target of around $8 billion of debt. And then beyond that, that third dollar would go to share repurchases through that program. You move through the other side of that, we've got, we've got our $3 billion of cash a little bit more on the balance sheet. We've got $8 billion in debt, and we've fulfilled the $1 billion share repurchase program. Likely the discussion and debate we would have is do we authorize another share repurchase program to, for those proceeds really net free cash would be the likely -- likely in pathway assuming all of those other capital allocation parameters are met."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our next question today is from the line of Levi Spry of UBS.', 'Levi Spry', ""I just had a question around the 5-year guidance. Just trying to understand what was in there, what wasn't? And I guess, what could change, specifically thinking about some of the projects that you called out on one of the other slides. Can you sort of just walk us through what is in the, I guess, development capital in 2027, '28 versus the studies?"", 'Thomas Ronald Palmer', ""What you're seeing from the -- if we just step through that to make sure we're tracking. What you're seeing in the production and cost profile is just that go forward Tier 1 portfolio. So it does not include the 6 asset sales for divestment. It does include the ounces to start to come through from the investments that we're making in those 4 projects that we talked about. So it's seeing ounces come through in that time frame from the 2 block caves at Cadia, shaft at Tanami and Ahafo North. And a significant proportion of that $1.3 billion of development capital in that time frame is about funding those 4 projects in execution. As we think towards the end of that 5 years, we certainly started to see the spend on those projects drop off.It's going to be around about that time frame that we're starting to think about what's that next cab off the rank in terms of projects that would maintain that average of $1.3 billion. But the vast majority of what you see in that 5-year profile, particularly the cost profile, the all-in sustaining cost profile and the gold production profile is the existing operations moving through different stages of the mine cycle. We're getting to higher grades and that investment paying off in terms of additional ounces and better grains."", 'Levi Spry', 'Just so as I got that, is the does it -- does it cater for capital on Red Chris and Wafi-Golpu, for instance?', 'Thomas Ronald Palmer', ""No, no. When we guide, we guide only to projects in execution. So if you go to the detail of our development catalyst projects in execution. Once a project is approved by our Board for full funding, then we guide to that number. But what we give in terms of being able to model something, we'd say you can expect Newmont to spend on average $1.3 billion of development capital every year. But those 4 projects are the only ones that are in guidance because they're the only 4 that have full funding approval."", 'Operator', 'Our next question today is from the line of Andrew Bowler of Macquarie.', 'Andrew Bowler', ""I think most of my questions have been answered. I guess, from me, I think the early notations from Newmont were that we'd get a 5-year outlook more towards the middle of this calendar year. Can you just talk about why we've received something (inaudible) and obviously, it's positive to have more clarity, but what sort of changed to bring forward this announcement and whether or not that's what you're seeing in the Newcrest assets generally? Is there an enhanced level of confidence now compared to when you took the keys late last year?"", 'Thomas Ronald Palmer', ""Yes. Thanks, Andrew. Good question. When we were -- provided that indication that we've come out with some nearer-term numbers in February and June-ish or middle of the year for some longer term or that 5-year. We're doing that in the context of not having information about Newcrest. So it was before we closed the transaction and what would we learned is we got the keys to the car. The integration has gone very, very well. We've very much approached it as a bolt-on of 5 operations into the Newmont operating model.From day 1. We put Newmont general managers at each of those sites, that's made a significant difference in terms of setting our expectations and being able to influence those operations in terms of a Newmont approach and Newmont culture access to Newmont resources to build plans and understand the work. We also had a huge number of lessons that we're able to bring forward from similar experience with Goldcorp 5 years ago when we bolted 5 operations into our portfolio. So as all of that came together, and we started to build our plan, we started to get the confidence that we could not only provide numbers for 2024, but give you a view for those 5 years within the February time frame.So we went for it. And we went through that process of building those plans, getting those approved by our Board and guiding the market with them today. Our focus now is that on the strategic and life of mine plants to really start to work those 11 managed operations that we have in that go-forward portfolio and start to build out that portfolio view over the 5- to 10- to 15- to 20-year time frame. And we'll look to spend some time with our Board at our annual strategy session in June to work through that. And look to come to -- back to you in the second half of this year with a longer-term outlook for Newmont.We're debating the timing at the moment, but we're contemplating returning to what's been our traditional slot, which has been around the November time frame and also debating that we'll hold a Capital Markets Day in New York. And hold one in Sydney or Melbourne as well as in that time frame. So that's how we're thinking about it at the moment, but rolling up the sleeves and getting stuck into the strategic life of mine plans now that we've got a solid foundation of the 2024 and the 5 year (inaudible)"", 'Operator', 'This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Palmer for closing remarks..', 'Thomas Ronald Palmer', 'Thanks, operator, and thank you all for making some time to -- on the call today and look forward to catching up with you in not too distant future.

Revenues are projected to climb 19.9% to $394.8 million.', 'TW shares have advanced more than 42% over the last year. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio – one that is trending well and receiving positive earnings estimate revisions.', 'Notice how both the 50-day (blue line) and 200-day (red line) moving averages are sloping up. The stock has been making a series of 52-week highs and recently surpassed its former all-time high. With both strong fundamental and technical indicators, TW is poised to continue its outperformance.', 'Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. As we know, Tradeweb Markets has recently witnessed positive revisions. As long as this trend remains intact (and TW continues to deliver earnings beats), the stock will likely continue its bullish run this year.', 'The future looks bright for this highly-ranked, leading stock. The company has shown an ability to adapt to the ever-changing technological landscape, which puts it in a strong position moving forward.', 'Backed by a leading industry group and impressive history of earnings beats, it’s not difficult to see why TW stock is a compelling investment. An appealing technical trend along with robust fundamentals paint a bullish picture for Tradeweb Markets.', 'Newmont Corporation is engaged in the exploration and production of gold, copper, silver, zinc and lead.

While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when they are part of a lackluster industry group, the inclusion in a weaker group serves as a headwind for any potential rallies and the journey forward is that much more difficult.', 'Despite a rebound in stocks with the Dow and S&P 500 hitting new all-time highs, NEM shares have not been participating lately. The stock has experienced considerable volatility over the past year.', 'Heading into today’s quarterly release, NEM had fallen short of earnings estimates in three of the prior four quarters.

Notice how both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages are sloping down signaled by the blue and red lines, respectively. The stock has made a series of lower lows over the past year.', 'NEM stock has also experienced what is known as a ‘death cross’, wherein the stock’s 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average. Newmont would have to make a surprising move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions. Shares have fallen more than 23% in the past year alone.', 'A deteriorating fundamental and technical backdrop show that this stock is not set to hit new highs anytime soon. The fact that NEM stock is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups provides yet another headwind to a long list of concerns. A history of earnings misses and falling future earnings estimates will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock’s downtrend.', 'Highlighted underperformance bodes well for the bears. Potential investors may want to consider including this stock as part of a short or hedge strategy. Bulls will want to steer clear of NEM shares until the situation shows major signs of improvement.', 'Artificial intelligence (AI) has led to numerous technological progressions, making 2023 a breakout year for tech companies providing AI-related products and services.

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Therefore, if you purchase QUALCOMM's shares on or after the 28th of February, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 21st of March."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.80 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$3.20 per share. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that QUALCOMM has a trailing yield of 2.1% on the current share price of US$154.75. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing."", ' Check out our latest analysis for QUALCOMM ', 'Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. QUALCOMM paid out a comfortable 45% of its profit last year. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It distributed 36% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.', ""It's positive to see that QUALCOMM's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. That's why it's comforting to see QUALCOMM's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 26% per annum for the past five years. QUALCOMM is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow, while simultaneously growing earnings per share at a rapid clip. Companies with growing earnings and low payout ratios are often the best long-term dividend stocks, as the company can both grow its earnings and increase the percentage of earnings that it pays out, essentially multiplying the dividend."", ""Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. QUALCOMM has delivered an average of 8.6% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 10 years of dividend payments. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders."", ""Has QUALCOMM got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? We love that QUALCOMM is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention."", 'Ever wonder what the future holds for QUALCOMM?

Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.', 'In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.', 'There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.', 'Is QCOM Worth Investing In?', 'In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Qualcomm, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 5.8% over the past month to $9.57.', ""Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Qualcomm.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Legit Reasons to Back Out of a Home Purchase. ', 'The home-buying process can be overwhelming for many. Although this process is expected to be mutually beneficial for all parties involved such as the buyer, the seller, and the real estate agent, there are many potential problems that can make the buyer call off the deal.', 'A bright side to the probable problems is the presence of several contingencies that can help the buyer exit the deal without incurring a loss. A basic contingency in this regard is the inspection contingency which gives the buyer an opportunity to undertake an inspection of the property within a specified time period. In case the inspection reveals major problems, the buyer can back out of the contract. Based on the terms of the inspection contingency, the buyer can either leave the purchase and get the earnest money back or request the repair required. The final outcome will finally depend on whether the seller agrees to make the repairs or not.', 'Financial burden and affordability issues tend to be a core limiting factor for homebuyers since many of them rely on some sort of financing. You can take a look at the cities where you can buy a home for under 300k. Addressing the financial constraints, the mortgage contingency gives the buyer some time to secure financing for the home purchase. This serves as a sense of relief since the buyer can simply back out if the lender refuses to give the money due to any circumstances. These circumstances will be discussed later as reasons to back out of a home purchase on our list. Some of the biggest mortgage companies in the US have also been covered.', ""The buyer can escape any legal consequences in case of a home sale contingency as well. This is when the buyer is dependent on the sale of an existing house to proceed with the purchase of the new one. Apart from protecting the buyer's interests, contingency clauses also support the seller. For instance, the kick-out clause gives the seller the right to keep marketing the house to other buyers and to sell the house to a better buyer if the current buyer doesn't remove the aforementioned house sale contingency within a specific time."", 'Despite the risks associated with the purchase of a house which can make the buyer call it off, homebuilders across the US tend to facilitate a smooth home-buying process. Some of these include \xa0Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), KB Home (NYSE:KBH), and PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM). Other large homebuilders in the US have also been previously covered.', 'Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN) is an American home construction company that constructs affordable, move-up, and active adult homes primarily under the Lennar brand name. It also engages in the development of high-quality multifamily rental properties. On February 16, Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN) reported that home sales in its new single-family community ‘Stonehill Manor’ will commence in March.

We sifted through more than 10 sources to gather all the valid reasons that make home buyers walk away from the home-buying process.

Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.', 'Disputed boundary lines are one of the reasons to back out of a home purchase. If the land survey reveals that the boundary measurements are different than what was originally disclosed, the buyer can choose to walk away from the deal. This is because buyers expect the property details to be legit in the first place.', 'In contracts where an option period is included, the buyer can back out within this period without any penalty or reason. Hence, this temporary time period can allow the buyer to leave the home-buying process.', 'If the buyer feels like the real estate agent is unnecessarily placing pressure to make an offer, the decision to back out of the home purchase can be taken. This is a precaution that helps the buyer avoid any problems that can potentially arise in the future from a purchase made under pressure and in a hurry.', 'During the due diligence period agreed upon by the parties, the buyer can carry out an appraisal or inspection of the property. If the seller doesn’t extend the due diligence period and the buyer is not yet satisfied with the evaluation of the property, he can back out of the purchase. This is because the buyer demands more time to make an informed decision regarding the home purchase in this case.', 'The mortgage rate can even fluctuate after the pre-approval. In case the rate goes up, the monthly mortgage payments also increase which can raise affordability concerns for the buyer.

Looking back at history, it's evident that dividend-paying stocks have often outperformed other types of investments. Opting for dividend stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) can be particularly advantageous. This index comprises numerous dividend-paying stocks, notably blue-chip companies renowned for their consistent dividend increases. In 2023, the DJIA saw a significant increase of 14%, with 19 component stocks experiencing gains while 11 component stocks faced declines over the course of the year. Towards the end of the year, in December, the index reached a record-breaking high, surpassing the $37,000 mark."", 'Apart from delivering robust returns over the years, dividends have also maintained their significance as a growing component of personal income. As per a report from S&P Dow Jones Indices, the proportion of personal income attributed to dividend earnings has consistently risen over time, underscoring their importance as a source of income. In 2012, dividend income accounted for 5.64% of per capita personal income in the U.S., compared to 4.39% in the previous decade and 3.51% two decades prior. Conversely, during this same period, interest income from capital markets has steadily declined, dropping to 7.39% in 2012 from 13.51% in 1992. According to the report, the total dividend income, adjusted for inflation to $2000, experienced a substantial rise from $187.6 billion in 1992 to $757 billion in 2012, marking an impressive growth of over 300%. In contrast, interest income grew by less than 100% over the same period.', ""When investors consider dividend stocks for their portfolios, they often prioritize dividend yields. However, it's important to note that companies offering high yields but lacking solid financial stability could face the risk of reducing dividends, especially amidst global economic uncertainties and increasing interest rates. Therefore, investment strategies aimed at high yields should also prioritize the quality and stability of the companies in question. The Dow Jones Dividend 100 Index Series tracks the performance of 100 high-dividend-yielding stocks within each covered market, chosen for their consistent dividend payments and strong fundamental strength. When utilizing any income strategy, market participants typically prioritize both yield and capital gain. The Dow Jones Dividend 100 Indices have demonstrated superior yields and comparable capital gains over the long term when compared to their respective benchmarks. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, for the period spanning from June 30, 2001, to June 30, 2023, the total return of the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index, which assumes theoretical reinvestment of dividends, averaged 11.7% annually.

This global village is now filled with diverse and innovative possibilities, ranging from self-employed work to jobs in almost all industries. The developed nations of the world have attracted expatriates for various reasons, with one of the strongest being better career prospects. Their economic growth has spurred the need for a larger workforce, especially one that is more qualified. However, it must also be kept in mind that extensive industrialization and mass production in developed countries have prompted them to explore alternative avenues for labor, including the international labor market. It is, then also not surprising that a great number of countries in the world exist that provide easy work visa.', 'Whether low-skilled or high-skilled, labor migration has far-reaching impacts on both receiving and sending countries. Developed and emerging economies alike are in constant need of low-skilled workers, a demand expected to increase, while their countries of origin lack job opportunities. In 2021, there was a 26% increase in permanent migration in OECD countries, primarily attributed to the rise in labor migration due to labor and skill shortages. According to the Migration Data Portal, the year 2019 saw an estimated 169 million international migrant workers worldwide, accounting for 4.9% of the global labor force in destination countries. They also constituted 69% of the world’s international migrant working-age population (15 years of age and above).', 'It is also noteworthy that high-income countries were the major recipients of this migration, hosting about two-thirds of all migrant workers. Other regions, including Northern, Southern, and Western Europe, accounted for a 24.2% share, Northern America received 22.1%, and 14.3% landed in the Arab States. While men constituted 58.5% of all labor migration, European areas saw a 50% share of women migrants. The report also highlighted a greater flow of migrants in the service sector (66.2%), followed by industry (26.7%) and agriculture (7.1%).', ""With growing economies, the need for labor is bound to rise and therefore, there will be a lot of countries where work visa can be easily obtained. The 'land of opportunity,' the United States, has attracted foreign workers in large quantities over the years and continues to do so. As the largest economy in the world, the country offers many work visas.

Growth investors seek companies that offer strong earnings growth, while value investors seek stocks that appear to be undervalued and which they expect will return to fair value over time. Because the two styles complement each other, they can help add diversity to a portfolio when used together. When used together, some call the amalgamation ""growth at a reasonable price,"" or GARP. Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) has said the difference between value and growth investing is a false dichotomy. He wrote in Berkshire Hathaway\'s (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) 1993 annual letter:', '""Most analysts feel they must choose between two approaches customarily thought to be in opposition: \'value\' and \'growth.\' Indeed, many investment professionals see any mixing of the two terms as a form of intellectual cross-dressing. We view that as fuzzy thinking (in which, it must be confessed, I myself engaged some years ago). In our opinion, the two approaches are joined at the hip: Growth is always a component in the calculation of value, constituting a variable whose importance can range from negligible to enormous and whose impact can be negative as well as positive.', 'Buffet\'s business partner, the late Charlie Munger, further summed this up when he said,""Basically, all investment is value investment in the sense that you\'re always trying to get better prospects that you\'re paying for.""', 'Thus, a primary goal for investors is to not to overpay for stocks, whether you are going for growth or going for value (or conversely, not to sell too cheaply if you are selling). This is a particularly acute problem for growth investors as they have a tendency to overpay for growth. On the other hand, the major problem for value investors is a tendency to buy value traps, which they think are cheap, but actually expensive because they do not account for a declining business. For every security, there is a ""stupid price zone"" and a ""smart price zone"" and a range of values in between. The idea is to buy at the ""smart"" zone and sell at the ""stupid"" zone. Another trap for investors is timing, meaning either buying or selling too early or too late. This is easier said than done, of course. That is why Munger calls investing simple, but not easy.', 'Let us start this meditation on price with granddaddy of valuation techniques, the venerable price-earnings ratio.', 'The price-earnings ratio is, of course, a simplistic measure as it merely the ratio of stock price to earnings per share. It itself gives no guidance as to what is an acceptable ratio. Many investors have developed rules of thumb to judge whether a price-earnings ratio is expensive or cheap. For example, they would use a multiple of 15, which they consider the long-term price-eanings ratio of the S&P 500 as the bright line separating cheap from expensive. The lower the ratio, the cheaper the stock is. The higher the ratio, the more expensive it is.', 'The practical problem is that often the price-earnings ratio is wrong. For cyclical stocks, often the best time to buy is when the ratio is very high or is zero (because earnings have evaporated). Look at the chart of price and price-earnings ratio for Goodyear (NASDAQ:GT) (a classic cyclical stock) below.', 'GT Data by GuruFocus', 'Another big problem with the ratio is the earnings are based on GAAP earnings, which can fluctuate widely and may not reflect the true state of affairs of the earning power of the company. Take a look at Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) below. A great time to buy the stock would have been is 2019 when the price-earnings ratio was actually very high (the company had taken some non-cash write-offs at that time, which crashed the stock temporarily). Expected and unexpected events are contantly rocking the price-earnings line, making it a very unreliable measure.', 'PG Data by GuruFocus', 'Some problems can be avoided by looking at the median price-earnings ratio over a period of time (say 10 years) and then deriving a ""fair price"" from this median. This technique would have got us into P&G in 2018-19, but we would have sold too soon in 2000 as the stock rebounded above the median price line.', 'PG Data by GuruFocus', 'GuruFocus also provides the Shiller PE on its stock summary page, which is derived from the 10-year average of the inflation-adjusted earnings. Think of Shiller PE as a normalized price-earnings ratio that removes year-to-year distortions from the price-earnings line. In the chart below, the Shiller PE and price-earnings ratios are charted together with price. When the PE line is below the Shiller PE line, then chances are the stock may be undervalued (and vice versa).', 'However, this signal is not very clear in the case of Goodyear as the company is very cyclical. Both the regular and Shiller PEs fluctuate widely. We could argue that it is a good time to go long when the regular price-earnings ratio hits an extreme level or goes to zero and then sell when it comes back to normal.', 'GT Data by GuruFocus', 'For Goodyear, the median price-earnings technique does not work as the line is too fickle. Further, the median price-sales line, while better, is too slow to have much predictive value.', 'GT Data by GuruFocus', 'The main point I want to make is that while price-earnngs may be a quick and useful metric with most stocks, it has to be used carefully. Many times it is absolutely misleading. Charting the ratio with its derivatives is helpful to discern if there is a valid valuation signal. Overall, I feel the price-earnings ratio is more often misleading and do not rely on it much.', 'Then there is the PEG ratio, an old warhorse that incorporates growth. It was popularized by famous former fund manager Peter Lynch, who argued that a PEG ratio of 1 was a fair price, as he thought the earnings growth of a stock should ideally equal or exceed its price-earnings ratio.', ""The price-earnings to growth ratio, or PEG ratio, is a valuation measure that investors use to get a broad assessment of a company's performance and evaluate investment risk."", 'PEG ratio is calculated as follows: PEG = PE ratio/Earnings growth over five years.', ""In theory, a PEG ratio of 1 represents a perfect correlation between the company's market value and its projected earnings growth. PEG ratios higher than 1 are generally considered unfavorable, suggesting a stock is overvalued. Conversely, ratios lower than 1 are considered better, indicating a stock is undervalued."", 'There are two problems with the PEG ratio, however. One is price-earnings (the numerator) itself is problematic, which I have gone over already. The second problem is the denominator, or growth. Lynch used projected earnings growth, which requires judgement and is frequently wrong. Thus, the PEG is reduced to a judgement call.', 'A popular, ""more objective"" number is to use past actual Ebitda growth. The problem, of course, is that this is backward-looking and assumes the past growth trajectory will continue in the future. I still lean toward the latter as there is no getting away from it, unless you want to get into the judgement game and plug in an estimated forward growth. For cyclical stocks like Goodyear, I would prefer to substitute one-year trailing 12-month Ebitda growth for the five-year growth as used for stocks like P&G.', 'The PEG ratio is more often wrong than right. Below is an annual chart showing price and PEG. As you can see, it is pretty much useless as a predictor of value or growth. (Note: chart below is annual numbers.)', ""The GF Value chart is a proprietary measure which compares a company's current stock price to its GF Value Line. The GF Value Line is an intrinsic value estimate developed by GuruFocus that is calculated based on the following factors:"", 'Historical multiples (price-earnings ratio, price-sales ratio, price-book ratio and price-to-free cash flow) that the stock has traded at.', ""A GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth."", 'Future estimates of business performance from Morningstar analysts.', 'Exactly how the GF Value is calculated is not disclosed. While in my short experience it is a fine measure with good predictability, the lack of transparency of the calculation methodology prevents it from being used outside of GuruFocus.', 'Earning power value, or EPV, is based on the concept first popularized by Columbia University professor Bruce Greenblatt that one should value a stock based on the current operating profits of company and not on future projections, which may or may not come true. Some argue it is a better though conservative way to analyze stocks than discounted cash flow analysis, which relies on highly speculative growth assumptions projected many years into the future. The main assumption for EPV is that the current profitability is sustainable. I find this method useful for assessing value stocks with little or no growth, but for stocks which rely on growth, it is pretty much useless.', 'Applying the EPV method to Procter & Gamble and Goodyear, we find little if any predictive power for this method in valuing the two companies. This method would have prevented us from buying P&G over the last 25 years and given false results on Goodyear by indicating a buy in years when it would not have been prudent and a sell when the stock was undervalued.', 'PG Data by GuruFocus', 'Probably the most popular method of valuation used by more sophisticated investors who have graduated from using price-earnings and PEG ratios, the discounted cash flow (DCF) method is a technique used to estimate the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows. It involves discounting the projected cash flows (or earnings) back to their present value using a chosen discount rate, such as the weighted average cost of capital. The DCF method helps investors assess the potential profitability of an investment while accounting for the time value of money.', ""DCF models can become quite complex, but this does not make them better. GuruFocus, for example offers a two-stage valuation model in its DCF calculator, which can use GAAP earnings or free cash flow as a starting point . The major input in GuruFocus' calculator is the choice of starting value, growth rates and discount rates. We will notice that small changes in assumption of these variables can have a big impact on the final valuation. Thus, investors get the results they want by playing around with the variables, which limits the usefulness of this technique. Too much skepticism and conservatism will make us miss opportunity and too much optimism will cause us to make mistakes. Errors are inevitable as we are projecting decades into the future. In the end, DCF, like other valuation techniques, is a tool and the utility of a tool depends on the skill we use it with. Just because we give an amateur a power saw does not make him into a carpenter. He can easily hurt himself."", 'Below is a valuation of Procter & Gamble using the default inputs. The model says the stock is very overvalued. I can, of course, play around with the model and get whatever value I want. Frankly, this becomes an exercise in self-justification.', ""Another model which is available as part of GuruFocus' valuation panel is the projected free cash flow methodology. According to GuruFocus, since the DCF intrinsic value calculations are based on free cash flow or earnings, it cannot be applied to companies without consistent revenue and earnings. GuruFocus developed the projected FCF valuation model based on the normalized free cash flow and book value of the company. How it calculates the intrinsic value of stocks is described in detail here. Essentially, the method takes 80% of the book value and adds it to the present value of free cash flow averaged over six years. So in essence, it's another variation of the DCF model. Looking at Procter & Gamble's valuation using this method, we see it appears to undervalue the stock."", ""The same thing can be said for Goodyear's projected value."", ""I find the projected free cash flow is more useful in cases where company's business is capital intensive and cyclical and book value is a crucial component."", 'In thinking about growth and value and my aversion to over-paying, I have been pondering on how to come up with a single measure which can incorporate both. How do you balance the two attributes and reconcile with the price of the stock?', 'I devised a technique that I am sharing below. The technique involves reducing the value and growth attributes of the stock into a common scale which I call ""factors.""', 'The technique has three steps. First, calculate the value factor. Second, calculate the growth factor. Third, add the value and growth factors together. The higher the total, the better. I will break these steps down further.', 'First, derive the value factor by calculating the value of a stock with respect to a risk-free 10-year U.S. government bond. For instance:', 'Value factor = Operating profits/ (enterprise value 10-year U.S. treasury bond rate)', 'The logic of the formula is as follows:', 'Numerator: Operating profits are the pre-tax profits a company generates (for this exercise we ignore taxes).', 'Denominator: The enterprise value is the logical value an external buyer would pay for the entire company on the open market. This includes market capitalization minus debt plus cash. Multiplying enterprise value by the 10-year treasury rate gives us the risk-free return an investor would get if was to invest the entire amount in 10-year U.S. treasury bonds.', 'Basically, you want the operating profit of the company to be higher than the amount you would get if you were to invest the same amount in Treasuries, which are risk free. You obviously want to be paid more than the risk-free rate. The higher the factor, the better. Note this does not take into account growth of operating profit and enterprise value. Therefore, it is a conservative estimate. Here are some examples.', 'Looking at Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), at present you can get 13% better risk-free income from 10-year U.S. T-bills, while with Verizon (NYSE:VZ), you can get 116% more income as compared to the same bonds. This income is not the same as a dividend as a portion of this is retained earnings and also does not include taxes. Hot stock Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is, of course, growing very fast and you may well decide the low factor of safety does not matter in the long run. But you are making this decision with eyes wide open. Same with Exxon (NYSE:XOM); while the factor of value is very high at present, it may be temporary given the high price of oil and it may well evaporate in the years to come.', 'For step two, the growth factor is calculated as the five-year Ebitda growth rate per share divided by the growth divider.', 'Breaking it down further:', ""Numerator: Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, is a measure of a company's profitability and efficiency. Growing Ebitda is important for business owners and investors because it indicates an improvement in the company's performance and earnings per share. It also demonstrates the company's worth and attractiveness to potential investors. It also allows for a fair comparison of different companies with different capital structure, debt and tax profiles. Further, it separates revenue from other expenses and shows the core profitability of a business. It forms a middle ground between revenue growth and net income growth, so I find it more consistent and useful than either. The five-year period for Ebitda growth allows us sufficient time to get a consistent or secular growth number, though a shorter period might be more appropriate for cyclical businesses. For the purpose of this excercise, I will stick to five years."", 'Denominator: Here this technique gets a little judgmental and arbitrary. I had to come up with a divisor which would give me a ""weight"" for each point of Ebitda growth. By trial and error, I found that a divider of 5 gives me decent results. Therefore, in this system, each five percentage points of Ebitda growth ( i.e., one growth factor) is equivalent to one value factor. Therefore, a company with a five-year Ebitda growth profile of 10% will give us a growth factor of 2 and so on.', 'For step three, we simply add the growth and value factors together to get a single number. The higher the number, the better.', ""Let us start with the Nvidia, which is the stock du jour. The company's operating income for the trailing 12 months is $20.61 billion, while the current enterprise value is $1.34 trillion, the five-year Ebitda growth rate is 19.4%, 10-year Treasury yield is 3.94% and the growth divider is 5. Putting all this together, we get the following:"", 'Value factor = 20613/(1343984.2*3.94/100) = 0.3893', 'Growth factor = 19.4/5=3.88', 'Sum = 0.38+3.88=4.26', ""Therefore, I find that Nvidia's growth factor is very high and more than makes up for the low value factor, making for a very good combined value and growth factor. This makes Nvidia a strong buy by this technique."", ""The following chart show Nvidia's value (blue bar), growth (red bar) and sum (combined, yellow line) factors over the last 10 years. The stock price is shown as a green line and plotted on the right vertical axis. Nvidia was showing signs of being a great buy as early as 2015, which became pretty clear by 2017 and the sum reached a peak in 2019, when the stock price was still quite low. Interestingly enough, the stock still looks like a buy with a combined factor value over 4, obviously because of its extraordinary growth."", 'Here is a similar chart for Microsoft, which also shows that it is still a buy (with a combined value and growth factor score of over 4) even after an epic run-up.', 'Here is a similar chart for Dominion (NYSE:D), a beaten down utility. While the combined factor is now over 1, it had very low growth factor.

So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. Importantly, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) does carry debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?"", ""Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together."", ' See our latest analysis for Merck ', 'The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at September 2023 Merck had debt of US$34.9b, up from US$30.7b in one year. However, it does have US$8.77b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$26.1b.', 'We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Merck had liabilities of US$23.1b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$42.3b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$8.77b and US$11.7b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$45.0b.', ""Given Merck has a humongous market capitalization of US$324.7b, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse."", ""We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses."", ""Merck's net debt is 2.6 times its EBITDA, which is a significant but still reasonable amount of leverage. But its EBIT was about 11.9 times its interest expense, implying the company isn't really paying a high cost to maintain that level of debt. Even were the low cost to prove unsustainable, that is a good sign. Importantly, Merck's EBIT fell a jaw-dropping 70% in the last twelve months. If that decline continues then paying off debt will be harder than selling foie gras at a vegan convention. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Merck's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts."", ""Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. Over the last three years, Merck recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 92% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so."", ""Based on what we've seen Merck is not finding it easy, given its EBIT growth rate, but the other factors we considered give us cause to be optimistic. In particular, we are dazzled with its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow. When we consider all the elements mentioned above, it seems to us that Merck is managing its debt quite well. Having said that, the load is sufficiently heavy that we would recommend any shareholders keep a close eye on it. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For instance, we've identified   5 warning signs for Merck  that you should be aware of."", ""When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bruce."", 'Bruce M. Bodine', ""Good morning. Thank you for joining our call today. This is my first earnings call as Mosaic's CEO, and I'd like to begin by acknowledging Joc O'Rourke for his many contributions to the company. Joc held this role for nearly a decade, and the company is much stronger today, thanks to his leadership. Under Joc, Mosaic expanded its footprint in Brazil with the successful Vale Fertilizantes acquisition. We completed development of the world's largest potash mine. We transformed our cost structures, and we deleveraged and optimized our balance sheet. We have opportunities to improve returns and drive shareholder value by building on the current position of strength that Joc helped create. I look forward to evolving Mosaic's strategy and to helping all of you understand just how we will do that. So for today, there are a few key messages that we would like you to take away from this call. First, phosphate markets are very strong. We expect dynamics to remain constructive for the foreseeable future, and we are working to optimize our production so we can benefit fully. Second, we expect demand recovery in potash. In fact, we are seeing early signs of demand emerging in Brazil. That said, given current potash economics, we will be curtailing production from our Colonsay mine. Third, we are taking these actions as well as reducing costs and capital expenditures to improve through-cycle returns. Finally, with our strong financial foundation in place, we remain committed to prudent capital allocation selectively investing when risk-adjusted returns are compelling and returning excess cash through share repurchases and dividends. For full year 2023, Mosaic generated revenue of $13.7 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $2.8 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $3.57. We invested $1.4 billion in the business, refinanced $900 million in long-term debt and returned $1.1 billion to shareholders, including over $750 million in share repurchases. Let's start by looking at the market. 2022 brought extreme volatility to fertilizer markets. High prices driven by supply disruption eventually reduced demand. In 2023, as prices retreated, customers returned in many key markets. The long-term global grain and oilseed supply and demand picture remains encouraging with secular demand growth outpacing supply. In addition to population and income growth, demand for agricultural commodities is being driven by renewable fuel adoption, which we expect will continue to ramp over the next several years. Recent policy mandates have been announced in California, the European Union and in Singapore, and additional mandates are expected in the future. This emerging source of demand has the potential to require tens of millions of additional acres of production. Short-term fundamentals also look positive. We believe that ongoing weather challenges in key growing regions, including Brazil, will result in grain production lower than what the market is anticipating. This suggests that already low stock-to-use ratios will remain under pressure and support a healthy grain price environment. On this point, there tends to be a lot of focus on the stock-to-use ratios for corn and soybeans. As you can see in the presentation materials we posted, these two commodities represent approximately 30% of the global potash and phosphate consumption. This means that 70% of consumption is tied to other crops, many of which are experiencing continued tightening in their ratios. We believe the result is that growers around the world continue to be incentivized to maximize yield and crop production through strong fertilizer applications. In North America, a long fall application season drove strong demand well into the fourth quarter. Solid winter fill activity tells us bins are near empty and channel inventories are low. We are seeing demand strength continue into the spring planting season and sales volumes are mostly committed through March. In Brazil, barter ratios for both soybeans and corn are favorable. And while weather impacts have delayed fertilizer purchases, our outlook for full year 2024 is very positive, with expectations of fertilizer shipments at or near an all-time record as growers need to replenish soil nutrients. Favorable ag commodity and fertilizer demand drivers are especially promising for phosphate markets. We expect global supply will remain tight due in part to China's fertilizer export restrictions as the government prioritizes domestic food security. Tighter environmental oversight has also had an impact with the reduction of domestic DAP production. China also continues to direct more asset to industrial markets. Lithium iron phosphate production has more than tripled in the last 2 years, and we expect growth to continue at a rapid pace. The competition for phosphate molecules is intensifying. And it will continue to do so for quite some time. This, together with limited capacity additions in the near future, suggests phosphate market fundamentals will remain constructive. For potash, supply is adequate to meet demand in the near term and economics have not yet improved, which is why we intend to curtail production at Colonsay. We will continue to monitor market developments and customer demand. And when needed, Colonsay will be prepared to return to service in short order. Overall, ag and fertilizer market dynamics remain solid. At Mosaic, we continue to focus on meeting customer needs, executing on our business strategy, optimizing our operations and delivering value to shareholders. Turning now to fourth quarter results and our first quarter outlook. For the fourth quarter of 2023, Mosaic delivered revenue of $3.1 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $646 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.71. Our potash business generated $322 million of adjusted EBITDA on sales volumes of roughly 2.6 million tonnes. With the port at Portland, Oregon back up and running, the team at Canpotex had a strong finish to the year, enabling us to deliver sales volumes well within the range of our initial guidance. We expect sales volumes for the first quarter of 2024 in the range of 2 million to 2.2 million tonnes and potash prices at the mine in the range of $225 to $250 per tonne. In phosphates, we generated $259 million in adjusted EBITDA on sales volumes of 1.6 million tonnes. Realized stripping margins remained strong for the quarter but were offset by lower cost absorption from lower production levels. For the first quarter, we expect phosphate sales volume in the range of 1.6 million to 1.8 million tonnes and DAP-realized prices at the mine in the range of $580 to $605 per tonne. Moving to our business in South America. Despite the weather-driven fertilizer demand headwind in the fourth quarter, we delivered strong operating results with adjusted EBITDA of $111 million. Distribution business margins came in well above the historical normal annual range of $30 to $40 per tonne. In the first quarter this year, we expect margins to recede from the fourth quarter as part of the normal seasonality of the business. The first quarter of each year typically has a higher amount of fertilizer volume going to Brazil's corn crop, which demands a higher percentage of nitrogen products, which historically generate lower and less consistent margins and lower volumes of MicroEssentials, which generates higher margins. As a result, margins are generally lower during the quarter but improved from there, resulting in annual margins in line with our historic norm of $30 to $40 per tonne. We executed well against our capital allocation strategy in 2023 and our balance sheet remains optimized. We spent $1.4 billion in CapEx and made significant progress on our investment projects. We refinanced $900 million in debt and returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through an increased dividend and share repurchases. Our returns included not only free cash flow but also proceeds from asset sales such as the sale of Streamsong Resort. Finally, I want to discuss our top strategic initiatives for 2024. First, we're focused on driving down costs. Over time, we expect to achieve at least $150 million in annual run rate savings off of a 2023 baseline, driven in part by savings from our global digital acceleration program, which will go live later this year. Next, we'll continue to transform our operations to increase resilience and flexibility. Our top priority in phosphate is to improve our production volumes. We are working toward an annual run rate of 8 million tonnes over the next few quarters by enhancing the overall reliability and efficiency of our operations. To this end, we have a busy turnaround schedule at our Florida facilities in the first half of this year as we target areas that have caused us the most significant maintenance issues. Next, we'll further expand our presence in Brazil, one of the most dynamic agricultural regions in the world by completing a 1 million tonne distribution facility at Palmeirante to serve the fast-growing northern region of the country. We'll also further strengthen our product portfolio by growing non-commodity products. We are expanding MicroEssentials capacity at our Riverview plant here in Florida, and we expect those additional tonnes later this spring. We anticipate that more than half of our phosphate sales will be value-added products, which clearly is a differentiator for us. In addition, we are planning for the next-generation MicroEssentials Pro, which is delivering significant yield improvements in field testing. MicroEssentials Pro will also extend our patent protection until 2038. Finally, we'll remain true to our disciplined capital allocation strategy. In 2024, we expect to reduce total capital spending by about $200 million, and we'll continue to return excess cash to shareholders. To summarize, our outlook for agriculture and fertilizer markets remains positive. At Mosaic, we have a strategic road map to optimize returns through the business cycle to grow and to decommoditize our product offerings, and we have a very strong financial foundation from which to operate. I'm looking forward to updating you on our progress as the year proceeds. Now let's move to Q&A."", 'Jason Tremblay', 'Before we move on to the live Q&A, as we have done in the past quarters, we would like to address some of the most common questions that we received after we published our earnings materials last night. For our first question, Bruce, a number of analysts have asked questions about potash and phosphates. Market dynamics of these 2 crop nutrients seem to be diverging. With phosphates being strong, while potash is finding its way. Can you tell us how you see these markets developing as the year progresses?', 'Bruce M. Bodine', ""I think this is a good way to characterize current market conditions. Phosphate markets are very positive due to strong demand, low inventories and a tight supply situation globally, leading to some of the strongest stripping margins in the last decade. We believe stripping margins will remain elevated for the remainder of the year. Looking at the key regions, in North America, channel inventories are low, and we are seeing strong demand for spring planting. For Mosaic specifically, we continue to operate at minimum inventory levels and our first quarter sales are almost fully committed. In Brazil, inventories are well below the 5-year range, and our outlook for the year remains positive as growers need to replenish soil nutrients. India's proposed subsidy rates announced earlier this month showed an increase for phosphate fertilizers from the prevailing rates in the fourth quarter of last year, but importer margins remain negative. With very strong grower demand and low inventories, which are at the low end of the 5-year range, subsidies should move higher. In China, we are seeing an increased focus on food security. The government is limiting exports to ensure adequate domestic supply while also meeting rising industrial demand. We expect these dynamics to continue to limit exports for the foreseeable future. Industrial demand, particularly China's lithium iron phosphate market has been very strong, with production more than tripled in the last 2 years to 1.7 million tonnes of finished fertilizer product equivalent in 2023. We expect additional production growth in the future as demand continues to sort. Overall, this leads us to conclude that phosphate markets will remain constructive for the rest of the year. In potash, the supply constraints from Belarus and Russia, seen in the past few years will continue to abate in 2024. On the demand side, we see stability in North America. In fact, our winter fill program was fully sold. And similar to phosphates, we are almost fully committed for Q1. In Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, high-priced inventories were worked down in 2023. Two years of under application in those markets will put further strain on crop yields if nutrients are not replenished. We are seeing significant pent-up demand in that region. In China, while potash inventories are higher than historical periods, the fertilizer stock-to-use ratio is normal due to increasing on-farm demand as a result of favorable pricing. It's been reported that China intends to increase its strategic reserves meaning that inventories will have to remain higher than historical periods to meet this objective. We also expect lower Chinese domestic production as a result of the recent news capping production in its key potash basin due to environmental concerns. The combination of these factors should drive a need for continued high import volumes to meet the demand. The weather in Brazil has slowed demand in the near term but we are seeing early signs of demand emerging in potash prices moving up slightly. In fact, when you look at the entire fertilizer market, we expect shipments to be at or near peak levels in 2024. Putting these factors together, we expect the pace of global potash shipments to improve as 2024 progresses."", 'Jason Tremblay', 'Thanks, Bruce. As a follow-up question, given the market backdrop you just described, what actions are you planning to take?', 'Bruce M. Bodine', 'Well, given the strength of phosphate markets, Mosaic focuses on increasing our phosphate production volumes and further improving our margins by increasing our MicroEssentials volumes. Getting our production to an annual run rate of 8 million tonnes, not only increases revenue, but also significantly reduces our unit costs. MicroEssentials generates significant yield improvements. And as a result, generate superior margins for farmers, retailers and Mosaic. For Mosaic, not only do we earn a premium margin in our phosphate segment but we also command a premium margin in Brazil as we capture the retail premium for these products. In potash, Mosaic is focusing on flexibility and cost management. The curtailment of production at our Colonsay site demonstrates our commitment to flexibly managing our network to ensure our low-cost sites at Belle Plaine and Esterhazy operate at capacity, while Colonsay is only used when market conditions dictate. We have a couple of projects that will increase our product mix flexibility before the end of the year. This will enhance our ability to adjust our end product mix to respond to changes in the market conditions more effectively in order to optimize our cost structure and margins. In addition to cost reductions in our operations, we are focused on driving SG&A reductions and optimizing our investments in CapEx and working capital. These initiatives will ensure our customer demand is met. Our through-cycle financial performance will continue to advance and shareholder value is maximized.', 'Jason Tremblay', 'Our next question is related to Mosaic Fertilizantes. Brazil remains a problem-like region for many ag input companies. What is your outlook for 2024?', 'Bruce M. Bodine', 'This is a fair observation. A lot of these companies are still in the process of destocking excess high-cost inventories or writing off their assets given the challenging market conditions. At Mosaic, we took early action to complete the destocking of high-priced inventory in the first half of 2023 without any significant write-offs. As a result, we entered the second half of the year in a great position and it shows in our margins. The margin per tonne in our distribution business returned to the $30 to $40 range in the third quarter and came in above that range in the fourth quarter. In 2024, we expect record or near record fertilizer shipments despite lower fertilizer demand in quarter 1 due to weather conditions as growers continue to be incentivized by constructive barter ratios and the need to replenish soil nutrients. From a distribution margin perspective, we expect normal seasonality on a per tonne basis, lower than the normalized annual range in the first quarter, but within the range for the full year.', 'Jason Tremblay', ""Changing topics. There's a question about CapEx. You're indicating that spending will decline by approximately $200 million this year. How do you see that CapEx evolving longer term?"", 'Bruce M. Bodine', ""We're coming out of a period of elevated CapEx due to an unusual number of high-returning opportunity projects from across the business. We are coming to the end of these projects, and as a result, our spending is declining. In addition to the $200 million reduction in 2024, we anticipate a further reduction in 2025 with a longer-term run rate to be at or below $1 billion."", 'Jason Tremblay', 'Thanks, Bruce. And with that, we will now move to the open question-and-answer session. Operator, please open the line for follow-up questions.', 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions) Today's first question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America."", 'Stephen V. Byrne', ""Bruce, you mentioned a couple of times about the crop land needing to replenish soil nutrients. When I look at your forecast for global shipments of phosphate and potash, this is Slide 8, it doesn't really support that thesis. There's this -- what looks like potentially a massive deficit of consumption in the last 2 years of both nutrients close to 10 million tonnes on each and yet your forecast for '24 on both is just kind of like where it was in 2021. Is that a conservative view? Or was that -- is that based on a view that those nutrient levels were maybe above normal in the world, and therefore, it's not needed to be replenished?"", 'Bruce M. Bodine', ""Steve, good talking to you. Thanks. We share your view that there's been under application of fertilizer for the last couple of years for sure, and nutrients have been depleted from the soil. I think that's why we're pretty bullish on where things return from a supply standpoint or demand standpoint on both P&K at or near record shipments in those markets. And maybe I'll turn it over to Jenny a little bit to talk maybe a little bit about the specifics in each individual market to better answer, I think what you're getting at."", 'Yijun Wang', ""Steve, I think we definitely don't believe that there was sufficient P&K in the soil, where would allow farmers to mine without replenish the fertilizers. We have seen the evidence over the last 2 years. And as you may recall, we shared one slide last call that would show the yield impact due to under applications, especially on potash. So why we're projecting a higher demand for 2024, partially, it is related to the supply situation. We believe that the global shipment this year and beyond is that we will continue to see a very strong demand tailwind as the growers need to replenish these nutrients in order to pursue their yield aspiration. And in particular, this year, as we forecast the demand growth or recovery on potash, we are going to see some broad recovery in the market where we usually don't talk about the smaller market in Asia, the smaller market in Latin America. After 2 years under application, the farmers have realized that they need to put down, fertilizers -- P&K into the field. And that just actually has been built into our demand forecast in this year."", 'Operator', 'And our next question today comes from Richard Garchitorena with Wells Fargo.', 'Richard Garchitorena', 'Just wanted to ask, now that you have decided to curtail Colonsay, what are you expecting in terms of operational capacity for Mosaic in 2024? What levels of demand or price would you need to see to make the decision to start Colonsay? And then maybe some color in terms of the cash cost differences this year versus last year with Esterhazy up and running and Colonsay down?', 'Bruce M. Bodine', ""For sure, in the short term here, potash supply is adequate to meet demand. And we made the decision to curtail Colonsay's production not based on one factor. So as we continue to evaluate the flexibility within our network, we're looking at not only the market and customer demands, but also really how do we consider shareholder value as well. And I think that's getting to your point. And we'll continue to do that. And at the current time, the economics just didn't make sense. But if you look at the broader 2024 for the whole year, we're very optimistic about demand recovery, particularly on potash. And I'll let Jenny talk about some areas in a minute. But in the meantime, we're going to shut Colonsay down. We've done this before. We've demonstrated our resolve to flexibly moving that mine up and down. We can do that very quickly and we can restore things very quickly as well. And as we expect, when market demand returns will, in short order, return production at Colonsay. Again, if the market demand is there and if we determine shareholder value is there as well, and some of the complexities are what's going on with the rest of our network and turnaround schedules and things like that. Those things have to come into the analysis as well. But all of this is designed, as we've said earlier, to really let Belle Plaine and Esterhazy, our 2 low-cost production facilities run at full rate and continue to extract maximum value out of those 2 facilities. So Jenny, maybe you want to talk about a little bit of the market dynamics and why we expect pricing to be pretty good for the rest of the year."", 'Yijun Wang', ""Sure, Bruce. I think I probably just want to build on the earlier comment on the potash demand recovery. In 2023, last year, the recovery of the demand was over 13% and added 8 billion tonnes, the biggest recovery in the market was North America. We saw 27% of the demand increases over the previous year, and we are seeing very strong consumption increases in growth in China. And apart from these 2 major markets, in India and Brazil, we have all seen over 18% of the demand interests last year on potash. So as we get into 2024, we continue to expect the growth of potash demand in Brazil, in India. And we are going to see a much broader demand recovery from the other market, as I mentioned earlier, a small market in Asia, smaller market in Latin America. And all this demand projection will need to have the supply to meet the demand.When we look at the supply side of the equation, in late 2023, we've seen some recovery of the shipment out of Belarus and Russia and also some incremental tonnes from Laos. As we get into 2024, the season itself, we are in the typical low season time, and we are watching the market dynamics. And we believe we are at or close to the price bottom in the market. In fact, we have seen some major price recovery over the last 2 weeks in Brazil. So as Bruce mentioned earlier, we run our business, our potash operation to meet our customers' demand. And in the meantime, we want to maximize value creation for the shareholders as well. So that's the economic decision."", 'Operator', 'And our next question today comes from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets.', 'Joel Jackson', 'You said that phosphate margins should have been elevated. You talk about how strong phosphate is. Can you comment on that a bit more? Do you expect in Q1 that phosphate margins would be better, the same or lower than Q4 margins? And would that be an EBITDA or gross margin basis on other basis?', 'Bruce M. Bodine', ""Joel, thanks for your kind words. On phosphates, listen, the bottom line is supply is extremely tight. And we've talked about that balance. And even as much as demand, if you theoretically could go higher, it is going to be tough to reach supply with the restrictions out of China and the things that we talked about in one of the fireside chat questions. So that is driving pretty good stripping margins in this business. Some of the best we've seen over the last decade. And we do expect that to continue. We may see pricing bubble a little bit just due to seasonality throughout the year but we do believe our realized stripping margins, given raw material pricing on sulfur and ammonia and what we have projected for the year will continue to stay relatively flat and strong for the remainder of the year."", 'Operator', 'And our next question today comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.', 'Vincent Stephen Andrews', ""Can I just ask about on the phosphate production side, what you're anticipating coming out of Morocco this year? It seemed like they ran at lower rates last year. Are you expecting that to continue into this year? And what are you expecting in terms of imports into the U.S. market year-over-year, given, I guess, there's still some uncertainty over countervailing duties, but an update on those issues would be helpful."", 'Bruce M. Bodine', ""Yes, Vincent, thanks and good talking to you today. It's something we watch pretty closely is what's going on in that part of the world, as you can imagine. Jenny and her team and our market analysis team and economic team are really looking at that. So I'm going to turn it over to her to provide a little more detail on the commentary."", 'Yijun Wang', ""Yes, I think we've been watching very closely on OCP's shipment. Last year, we've seen some major recovery of their phosphate fertilizer export especially in the second half of the year. This is basically bring their export towards to their record level over the last few years. In the meantime, we are seeing some major reduction on their phosphate rock export last year. And that was actually less than half of the tonnes they exported in the record year back in 2021. And therefore, asset exports were basically very flat. So to think about OCP supply into 2024, our forecast is that they're going to continue to keep the normal way of operation and they might add a little bit into their new granulation capacity, but not really in the big deal. So even with this recovered OCP supply and the -- increased a small amount of fertilizer production, we believe 2024 phosphate supply will stay as tight."", 'Operator', 'And our next question today comes from Edlain Rodriguez with Mizuho.', 'Edlain S. Rodriguez', ""I mean, Bruce, you've talked about like the strength of phosphate prices which is clearly the case. But any concerns that if prices stay way above the other nutrients, like this could incentivize farmers to cut back in phosphate if they start thinking about their expenses and so forth given the decline in crop prices?"", 'Bruce M. Bodine', ""The economic on the farm topic is a great one and something, again, we're paying a lot of attention to. With soy and corn being -- I'm sorry, soybeans and corn prices are right now, we do see still pretty affordable economics overall, when you look at the portfolio of nutrients, right? And that's -- NP&K. And even though phosphate because of the tight supply that Jenny has outlined before, and we talked about one of the fireside questions, prices are elevated, but we have seen potash come down significantly and nitrogen at a more moderate level as well. So combined, I think fertilizer affordability from a percentage of on-farm revenue is actually pretty reasonable compared to the last 2 years. So we're not anticipating any demand destruction and due to pricing of the total nutrient package for farmers depending on their crops. And the other one that we talked about it in some of our materials is we've made a lot about corn and soybean prices, but corn and soybean demand is really only 30% of the global fertilizer demand. The rest, 70% is in other grain and oilseeds and non-grain and oilseeds markets. And we're seeing a lot of tightness in some of those markets and actually quite favorable economics when it comes to nutrient affordability. So overall, I think the competitiveness of nutrients and demand is there. The incentive is there. Again, driven by lack of fertilization in the last couple of years, good affordability, the tailwinds that are being provided on some of the biofuel stuff as well. I think it's very constructive that hopefully, ag commodity prices continue to moderate up and then continue to drive good demand to maximize yields on the farm. Jenny has got one more point she wants to make."", 'Yijun Wang', 'Yes. I just want to -- Bruce, I just want to provide one more data point. As we are watching corn soybean prices and all the cases were on corn, soybean. And if you look at other major ag commodities like rice, the price is very, very supportive. And today, actually, in fact, today, India export price for rice is setting a new record. So that tells you, actually, if you go beyond corn, soybeans, the other commodities are very constructive in terms of the prices and also the farm economics.', 'Operator', 'And our next question today comes from Andrew Wong with RBC Capital Markets.', 'Andrew D. Wong', ""So on the phosphate production, what's your expectation on when you could return to an 8 million-tonne annual run rate? And when that happens, what's your expectation on phosphate rock cost and conversion cost?"", 'Bruce M. Bodine', ""Andrew, thanks. We've been talking about this for a few quarters, and it's a big focus area for us strategically, particularly given the strong margins that are in the market today, given the high demand, limited supply. We have stated and continue to state that we're on our path over the next few quarters to get to an 8 million-tonne annual run rate. We're confident in that. Last year, second half of the year, we had some impacts with two of our large sulfur plants in Louisiana went down. Both of those have now returned to service. We had a major turnaround at the end of last year and another sulfur plant down at Bartow. Again, both of those are done and back to service. So we are starting to see gradually a return to that. But as mentioned in some of the fireside chat comments, we do have a heavy turnaround schedule baked into the first half of this year. So getting to that 2 million tonne level more towards the end of the year, part of that is with this turnaround schedule to continue to focus on some of those actors that have caused us some maintenance -- unplanned maintenance issues over the last couple of years. So again, confident we're going to get there by the end of the year. It's needed. And that's what we're going to continue to do is focus on our asset health. And we've been infusing a lot of our sustaining CapEx, by the way, to actually do that over the last 2 years as well. So look forward to that near the end of the year. And Clint has something to add, I think, on the economics piece."", 'Clint C. Freeland', ""Yes. No, thanks, Bruce. Andrew, when we look at the impact of moving our production back up to that target level, I think on a cost-per-tonne basis, and I think that was part of your question, you would likely see something on the order of magnitude of, call it, $20 to $25 a tonne improvement in that per unit cost. So it's material as we begin to ramp up to those target levels."", 'Bruce M. Bodine', ""Thanks, Clint. And even on top of that, Andrew, we've talked about our cost reduction initiatives just in addition to that, but we expect to layer in $150 million of cost reductions through the enterprise. Looking at G&A spending, some of the operations benefits of getting back to full production, working capital management and then just overall CapEx reduction. So adding to the absorption benefits that Clint talked about, plus some of these other initiatives to really wring out cost from the enterprise, through-cycle economics should be much more favorable."", 'Operator', 'And our next question today comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.', 'Jeffrey John Zekauskas', ""I was wondering if you can clarify some issues around your relationship with Ma'aden. Is that a joint venture that you wish to invest in over time further through capacity expansion? It's also the case that historically, the cash that's to come from the equity income has been much lower. Is there a cash benefit that you get in the future that catches you up from the equity income that you've made? Or does it turn out that you don't catch up?"", 'Bruce M. Bodine', ""Jeff, no, thanks. As you point out, that joint venture for us is an important part of our portfolio of assets for sure, not only do we gain market access in the markets like India with some of the tonnes that we have there. We get a lot of market intelligence through that joint venture as well. As far as do we have interest in future investment, I don't think that's in the top of our priority list. I never want to say never, depending on what the return on economics could be in such an investment. But I think we've got better focus areas for any of our cash and liquidity that we may put to something else. But at the end of the day, the Ma'aden joint venture at Saudi Arabia has been a great partnership, and we've seen that really mature over the course of this relationship. And it got to continue to earn a spot in our portfolio for sure, on a long-term basis, but right now, we're fairly happy with the results and where that is running. They just came off a record year at MWSPC on a production standpoint as well. So we're really starting to extract value out of that in the way that we hadn't previously. But I'm going to turn it over to Clint to talk about a little bit more on the economic questions that you had."", 'Clint C. Freeland', ""I think you noted the differential between the equity earnings over time and cash. I think our first cash dividend was actually paid out last year. I think total equity income last year for us was roughly $57 million. So we did get part of that in the form of a dividend. But one of the things that has been the focus of Ma'aden over the past, say, 2 to 3 years, has been on debt reduction. So a lot of the earnings and the cash generation of the joint venture has actually gone to paying down some of the debt load. And I think overall, order of magnitude, debt has been paid down by about $1.5 billion, so firming up the capital structure of the project. And so I think that's one of the main reasons why you see that differential between equity earnings and actually cash being paid out to us and the partners. One thing to also note, and again, it's relatively modest, but we also do get marketing fees and earn some level of income on some of the tonnes that we do sell. But again, that's one of the reasons why you've seen that differential between equity earnings and cash because a lot of the cash has actually been going to managing the balance sheet and paying down debt."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Rikin Patel with BNP Paribas.', 'Rikin Patel', 'You covered the guidance CapEx quite well earlier, but I was wondering if you could provide some outlook on the working capital requirement for 2024. I suppose, just given the context of the significant release you had last year, would you expect to see working capital investment next year?', 'Bruce M. Bodine', ""Working capital has been, if I understood your question right, broke up a little bit in the beginning for me. It has been a focus for us across all of our major markets. I think we've done a pretty good job of managing that risk compared to others in the space. But I'm going to turn it over to Clint to maybe talk a little bit more about how we think about working capital."", 'Clint C. Freeland', ""Yes. Thanks, Bruce, and thanks for the question, Rikin. As you noted, over the last couple of years, we've seen pretty significant changes in working capital. And a lot of that has been driven by the price environment. So you saw a significant increase in working capital and use of cash in 2022. And then you've seen a pretty material release of cash in '23 as a pricing environment changed. A lot of times, one of the things that is also a significant contributor to that is our distribution business in Brazil as they manage inventory levels and so forth around some of those price changes. But as we look out, I think it's going to be driven by the price environment. I think we are putting some renewed focus on things like inventory turns. And days of payables and receivables and really trying to work even harder to manage those to, again, manage the level of working capital that's needed. The other thing that I would note is, over the last couple of years, we've tried to set up some funding alternatives to assist us in managing through some of those seasonal, particularly seasonal elements of working capital needs. So we've had a number of things like an inventory lines and receivable securitization facilities put in place when we got our rating -- debt rating upgrade to BBB flat, BAA2. We also set up a commercial paper facility. And what we try to do is to maintain a certain level of funding to, again, take away some of those seasonal moves and to reduce some of the cash drag on the company throughout the year. So again, focusing on those 2 areas. One is just the absolute level of working capital. And again, that will be dictated by price environment, but then also being -- trying to be pretty thoughtful on how we fund that through the year and not just be using cash for that purpose."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Josh Spector with UBS.', 'Joshua David Spector', ""So I wanted to follow up on phosphate margins specifically. I think versus most models out there, pricing came in higher, but gross margins were lower in the fourth quarter. So I'm just trying to square the sequential gross margin move, if we think about in gross margin per tonne in the fourth quarter -- or sorry, first quarter here because you're saying the stripping margin stays high, but pricing, you're guiding up $40. We talked about more volume leverage in the first quarter. So is there a way to square all these moving parts between what you did in the fourth quarter versus what you're expecting from a gross margin per tonne perspective in the first quarter?"", 'Bruce M. Bodine', ""Yes, Josh, thanks. I think we are seeing a little bit of expansion there. For sure, the other part is our costs aren't going to necessarily come down as fast, given the turnaround schedule I talked about earlier. So that's still going to be a little bit of a drag. But overall, we still see those healthy realized stripping margins. You got to think about -- and I'm going to turn it over to Clint in a minute, maybe talk a little bit more about it, but our advantaged position on ammonia and our access to low-cost sulfur really kind of differentiates us a little bit from the industry stripping margin, what we get on a realized stripping margin, given that a good portion of our ammonia consumption comes from our Faustina facility in-house. And of course, our advantage contract with CF. So we do still think stripping margins are going to be good. Gross margins realized will be good but maybe given the cost pressures, we're still going to see a little bit of a slowness in full recovery of that. And Clint, maybe you can talk a little bit more about that."", 'Clint C. Freeland', ""Yes. The only thing that I would add on that around our in-house ammonia is we made -- we had, I guess, a turnaround about 18 months ago in Louisiana around -- made some investments in our converter at the facility. And it's -- as a result, it's had much higher reliability. And again, as we've seen the level of production that we've had, we've been able to lean on that a little bit more as a proportion of our ammonia sourcing as well as the CF contract. So we've been less dependent on some of the market purchases. And as a result, as an example, in the fourth quarter, about 35% of our ammonia was actually sourced in-house. And again, so that's helpful from a comparative cost standpoint. So as we go forward, as production ramps back up, overall finished product production ramps back up, we'll need to access a little bit more on the market. But again, in this environment at this point in time, we're getting more benefit maybe than we naturally historically have from our in-house production of ammonia."", 'Operator', ""This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Bruce Bodine for any closing remarks."", 'Bruce M. Bodine', ""Well, thank you, operator. To conclude our call, I'd like to reiterate our key messages for today. First, the global phosphate market, as we've discussed, is very strong, and we expect favorable dynamics to continue throughout the remainder of the year. And second, potash demand is emerging and we've talked about that, and we expect a strong rebound in global demand this year. And third, we are executing plans to optimize our operations so that we can benefit fully from strong markets while improving Mosaic's resilience. And finally, our capital allocation strategy is not changing. We will invest in pursuit of compelling returns and return excess cash to shareholders. So thanks, everyone, for joining our call today, and I hope that you have a great and safe day."", 'Operator', ""Thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.""]"

This is my first earnings call as Mosaic's CEO and I'd like to begin by acknowledging Joc O'Rourke for his many contributions to the company. Joc held this role for nearly a decade and the company is much stronger today thanks to his leadership."", ""Under Joc, Mosaic expanded its footprint in Brazil with the successful Vale Fertilizantes acquisition. We completed development of the world's largest potash mine. We transformed our cost structures and we deleveraged and optimized our balance sheet. We have opportunities to improve returns and drive shareholder value by building on the current position of strength that Joc helped create."", ""I look forward to evolving Mosaic's strategy and to helping all of you understand just how we will do that. So, for today, there are a few key messages that we would like you to take away from this call. First, phosphate markets are very strong. We expect dynamics to remain constructive for the foreseeable future and we are working to optimize our production so we can benefit fully."", 'Second, we expect demand recovery in potash. In fact we are seeing early signs of demand emerging in Brazil. That said given current potash economics we will be curtailing production from our Colonsay mine. Third, we are taking these actions, as well as reducing costs and capital expenditures to improve through cycle returns.', ""Finally, with our strong financial foundation in place, we remain committed to prudent capital allocation, selectively investing when risk-adjusted returns are compelling, and returning excess cash through share repurchases and dividends. For full year 2023, Mosaic generated revenue of $13.7 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $2.8 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $3.57. We invested $1.4 billion in the business, refinanced $900 million in long-term debt, and returned $1.1 billion to shareholders, including over $750 million in share repurchases. Let's start by looking at the market."", '2022 brought extreme volatility to fertilizer markets. High prices driven by supply disruption eventually reduced demand. In 2023, as prices retreated customers returned in many key markets. The long-term global grain and oilseed supply and demand picture remains encouraging with secular demand growth outpacing supply.', 'In addition to population and income growth, demand for agricultural commodities is being driven by renewable fuel adoption, which we expect will continue to ramp over the next several years. Recent policy mandates have been announced in California, the European Union and in Singapore, and additional mandates are expected in the future. This emerging source of demand has the potential to require tens of millions of additional acres of production. Short-term fundamentals also look positive.', 'We believe that ongoing weather challenges in key growing regions, including Brazil, will result in grain production lower than what the market is anticipating. This suggests that already low stock-to-use ratios will remain under pressure and support a healthy grain price environment. On this point, there tends to be a lot of focus on the stock to use ratios for corn and soybeans. As you can see in the presentation materials we posted, these two commodities represent approximately 30% of the global potash and phosphate consumption.', 'This means that 70% of consumption is tied to other crops, many of which are experiencing continued tightening in their ratios. We believe the result is that growers around the world continue to be incentivized, to maximize yield and crop production through strong fertilizer applications. In North America, a long fall application season drove strong demand well into the fourth quarter. Solid winter fill activity tells us bins are near empty and channel inventories are low.', 'We are seeing demand strength continue into the spring planting season and sales volumes are mostly committed through March. In Brazil, barter ratios for both soybeans and corn are favorable. And while weather impacts have delayed fertilizer purchases, our outlook for full year 2024 is very positive, with expectations of fertilizer shipments at or near an all-time record as growers need to replenish soil nutrients. Favorable ag commodity and fertilizer demand drivers are especially promising for phosphate markets.', ""We expect global supply will remain tight due in part to China's fertilizer export restrictions as the government prioritizes domestic food security. Tighter environmental oversight has also had an impact with the reduction of domestic DAP production. China also continues to direct more asset to industrial markets. Lithium iron phosphate production has more than tripled in the last two years, and we expect growth to continue at a rapid pace."", 'The competition for phosphate molecules is intensifying. And it will continue to do so for quite some time. This, together with limited capacity additions in the near future, suggests phosphate market fundamentals will remain constructive. For potash, Supply is adequate to meet demand in the near term and economics have not yet improved, which is why we intend to curtail production at Colonsay.', 'We will continue to monitor market developments and customer demand. And when needed, Colonsay will be prepared to return to service in short order. Overall, Ag and fertilizer market dynamics remain solid. At Mosaic, we continue to focus on meeting customer needs executing on our business strategy, optimizing our operations and delivering value to shareholders.', 'Turning now to fourth quarter results and our first quarter outlook. For the fourth quarter of 2023, Mosaic delivered revenue of $3.1 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $646 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.71. Our potash business generated $322 million of adjusted EBITDA on sales volumes of roughly 2.6 million tonnes. With the port at Portland Oregon back up and running, the team at Canpotex had a strong finish to the year, enabling us to deliver sales volumes well within the range of our initial guidance.', 'We expect sales volumes for the first quarter of 2024 in the range of two million to 2.2 million tonnes and potash prices at the mine in the range of $225 to $250 per tonne. In phosphates, we generated $259 million in adjusted EBITDA on sales volumes of 1.6 million tonnes. Realized stripping margins remained strong for the quarter but were offset by lower cost absorption from lower production levels. For the first quarter, we expect phosphate sales volume in the range of 1.6 million to 1.8 million tonnes and DAP realized prices at the mine in the range of $580 to $605 per tonne.', ""Moving to our business in South America. Despite the weather-driven fertilizer demand headwind in the fourth quarter, we delivered strong operating results with adjusted EBITDA of $111 million, distribution business margins came in well above the historical normal annual range of $30 to $40 per tonne. In the first quarter this year, we expect margins to recede from the fourth quarter as part of the normal seasonality of the business. The first quarter of each year typically has a higher amount of fertilizer volume going to Brazil's corn crop, which demands a higher percentage of nitrogen products, which historically generate lower and less consistent margins."", 'And lower volumes of MicroEssentials, which generates higher margins. As a result, margins are generally lower during the quarter but improved from there resulting in annual margins in line with our historic norm of $30 to $40 per tonne. We executed well against our capital allocation strategy in 2023 and our balance sheet remains optimized. We spent $1.4 billion in capex and made significant progress on our investment projects.', ""We refinanced $900 million in debt and returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through an increased dividend and share repurchases. Our returns included not only free cash flow but also proceeds from asset sales such as the sale of Streamsong Resort. Finally, I want to discuss, our top strategic initiatives for 2024. First, we're focused on driving down costs."", ""Over time, we expect to achieve at least $150 million in annual run rate savings off of a 2023 baseline, driven in part by savings from our global digital acceleration program, which will go live later this year. Next, we'll continue to transform our operations to increase resilience and flexibility. Our top priority in phosphate is to improve our production volumes. We are working toward an annual run rate of eight million tonnes over the next few quarters by enhancing the overall reliability and efficiency of our operations."", ""To this end, we have a busy turnaround schedule at our Florida facilities in the first half of this year as we target areas that have caused us the most significant maintenance issues. Next, we'll further expand our presence in Brazil, one of the most dynamic agricultural regions in the world by completing a 1 million tonnes distribution facility at Palmeirante to serve the fast-growing northern region of the country. We'll also further strengthen our product portfolio by growing non-commodity products. We are expanding MicroEssentials capacity at our Riverview plant here in Florida, and we expect those additional tonnes later this spring."", ""We anticipate that more than half of our phosphate sales will be value-added products, which clearly is a differentiator for us. In addition, we are planning for the next-generation MicroEssentials Pro, which is delivering significant yield improvements in field testing. MicroEssentials Pro will also extend our patent protection until 2038. Finally, we'll remain true to our disciplined capital allocation strategy."", ""In 2024, we expect to reduce total capital spending by about $200 million, and we'll continue to return excess cash to shareholders. To summarize, our outlook for agriculture and fertilizer markets remains positive. At Mosaic, we have a strategic road map to optimize returns through the business cycle, to grow and to decommoditize our product offerings, and we have a very strong financial foundation from which to operate. I'm looking forward to updating you on our progress as the year proceeds."", ""Now, let's move to Q&A."", 'Jason Tremblay -- Vice President, Enterprise Strategy and Business Support', 'Before we move on to the live Q&A, as we have done in the past quarters, we would like to address some of the most common questions that we received after we published our earnings materials last night. For our first question, Bruce, a number of analysts have asked questions about potash and phosphates. Market dynamics of these two crop nutrients seem to be diverging, with phosphates being strong, while potash is finding its way. Can you tell us how you see these markets developing as the year progresses?', 'Bruce Bodine -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'I think this is a good way to characterize current market conditions. Phosphate markets are very positive due to strong demand, low inventories and a tight supply situation globally leading to some of the strongest stripping margins in the last decade. We believe stripping margins will remain elevated for the remainder of the year. Looking at the key regions.', ""In North America, channel inventories are low, and we are seeing strong demand for spring planting. For Mosaic specifically, we continue to operate at minimum inventory levels, and our first quarter sales are almost fully committed. In Brazil, inventories are well below the five-year range, and our outlook for the year remains positive as growers need to replenish soil nutrients. India's proposed subsidy rates announced earlier this month, showed an increase for phosphate fertilizers from the prevailing rates in the fourth quarter of last year, but importer margins remain negative."", 'With very strong grower demand and low inventories, which are at the low end of the five-year range, subsidies should move higher. In China, we are seeing an increased focus on food security. The government is limiting exports to ensure adequate domestic supply, while also meeting rising industrial demand. We expect these dynamics to continue to limit exports for the foreseeable future.', ""Industrial demand, particularly China's lithium iron phosphate market has been very strong, with production more than tripled in the last two years to 1.7 million tonnes of finished fertilizer product equivalent in 2023. We expect additional production growth in the future as demand continues to sort. Overall, this leads us to conclude that phosphate markets will remain constructive for the rest of the year. In potash, the supply constraints from Belarus and Russia seen in the past few years will continue to abate in 2024."", 'On the demand side, we see stability in North America. In fact, our winter fill program was fully sold. And similar to phosphates, we are almost fully committed for Q1. In Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, high-priced inventories were worked down in 2023.', ""Two years of under application in those markets will put further strain on crop yields if nutrients are not replenished. We are seeing significant pent-up demand in that region. In China, while potash inventories are higher than historical periods, the fertilizer stock-to-use ratio is normal due to increasing on-farm demand as a result of favorable pricing. It's been reported that China intends to increase its strategic reserves meaning that inventories will have to remain higher than historical periods to meet this objective."", 'We also expect lower Chinese domestic production as a result of the recent news capping production in its key potash basin due to environmental concerns. The combination of these factors should drive a need for continued high import volumes to meet the demand. The weather in Brazil has slowed demand in the near-term but we are seeing early signs of demand emerging in potash prices moving up slightly. In fact when you look at the entire fertilizer market, we expect shipments to be at or near peak levels in 2024.', 'Putting these factors together, we expect the pace of global potash shipments to improve as 2024 progresses.', 'Jason Tremblay -- Vice President, Enterprise Strategy and Business Support', 'Thanks, Bruce. As a follow-up question, given the market backdrop you just described what actions are you planning to take?', 'Bruce Bodine -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, given the strength of phosphate markets, Mosaic's focuses on increasing our phosphate production volumes and further improving our margins by increasing our MicroEssentials volumes. Getting our production to an annual run rate of 8 million tonnes, not only increases revenue but also significantly reduces our unit costs. MicroEssentials generates significant yield improvements. And as a result, generate superior margins for farmers, retailers and Mosaic."", 'For Mosaic, not only do we earn a premium margin in our phosphate segment but we also command a premium margin in Brazil, as we capture the retail premium for these products. In Potash, Mosaic is focusing on flexibility and cost management. The curtailment of production at our Colonsay site demonstrates our commitment to flexibly managing our network to ensure our low-cost sites at Belle Plaine and Esterhazy, operate at capacity while Colonsay is only used when market conditions dictate. We have a couple of projects that will increase our product mix flexibility before the end of the year.', 'This will enhance our ability to adjust our end product mix to respond to changes in the market conditions more effectively in order to optimize our cost structure and margins. In addition to cost reductions in our operations, we are focused on driving SG&A reductions and optimizing our investments in capex and working capital. These initiatives will ensure our customer demand is met. Our through-cycle financial performance will continue to advance and shareholder value is maximized.', 'Jason Tremblay -- Vice President, Enterprise Strategy and Business Support', 'OK. Our next question is related to Mosaic Fertilizantes. Brazil remains a problem a region for many ag input companies. What is your outlook for 2024?', 'Bruce Bodine -- President and Chief Executive Officer', 'This is a fair observation. A lot of these companies are still in the process of destocking excess high-cost inventories or writing off their assets, given the challenging market conditions. At Mosaic, we took early action to complete the destocking of high-priced inventory in the first half of 2023, without any significant write-offs. As a result, we entered the second half of the year in a great position and it shows in our margins.', 'The margin per tonne in our distribution business returned to the $30 to $40 range in the third quarter and came in above that range in the fourth quarter. In 2024, we expect record or near record fertilizer shipments despite lower fertilizer demand in quarter one due to weather conditions, as growers continue to be incentivized by constructive BARDA ratios and the need to replenish soil nutrients. From a distribution margin perspective, we expect normal seasonality on a per tonne basis, lower than the normalized annual range in the first quarter, but within the range for the full year.', 'Jason Tremblay -- Vice President, Enterprise Strategy and Business Support', ""Changing topics. There's a question about capex. You're indicating that spending will decline by approximately $200 million this year. How do you see that capex evolving longer term?"", 'Bruce Bodine -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""We're coming out of a period of elevated capex due to an unusual number of high-returning opportunity projects from across the business. We are coming to the end of these projects, and as a result, our spending is declining. In addition to the $200 million reduction in 2024, we anticipate a further reduction in 2025 with a longer-term run rate to be at or below $1 billion."", 'Jason Tremblay -- Vice President, Enterprise Strategy and Business Support', 'Thanks, Bruce. And with that, we will now move to the open question-and-answer session. Operator, please open the line for follow-up questions.', '', 'Operator', ""Absolutely. [Operator instructions] Today's first question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please go ahead."", 'Steve Byrne -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst', ""Bruce, you mentioned a couple of times about the crop land meeting to replenish sole nutrients. When I look at your forecast for global shipments of phosphate and potash. This is slide 8. It doesn't really support that thesis."", ""There's this -- what looks like potentially a massive deficit of consumption in the last two years of both nutrients close to 10 million tonnes on each and yet your forecast for 2024 on both is just kind of like where it was in 2021. Is that a conservative view? Or was that -- is that based on a view that those nutrient levels were maybe above normal in the world, and therefore, it's not needed to be replenished."", 'Bruce Bodine -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Hey, Steve, good talking to you. Thanks. We share your view that there's been under application of fertilizer for the last couple of years for sure, and nutrients have been depleted from the soil. I think that's why we're pretty bullish on where things return from a supply standpoint or demand standpoint on both P&K at or near record shipments in those markets."", ""And maybe I'll turn it over to Jenny a little bit -- to talk maybe a little bit about the specifics in each individual market to better answer, I think what you're getting at."", 'Jenny Wang -- Executive Vice President, Commercial', ""Steve, I think we definitely don't believe that there was sufficient P&K in the soil, where would allow farmers to mine without replenish the fertilizers. We have seen the evidence over the last two years. And as you may recall, we shared one slide last call that would show the yield impact due to under applications, especially on potash. So why we're projecting a higher demand for 2024, partially it is related to the supply situation."", ""We believe that the global shipment this year and beyond is that we will continue to see a very strong demand tailwind as the growers need to replenish these nutrients in order to pursue their yield aspiration, and in particular this year as we forecast, the demand growth or recovery on potash. We are going to see some broad recovery in the market where we usually don't talk about the smaller market in Asia, the smaller market in Latin America. After two years under application, the farmers have realized that they need to put down fertilizers P&K into the field. And that just actually has been built into our demand forecast in this year."", 'Thanks.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question today comes from Richard Garchitorena with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.', 'Richard Garchitorena -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask, now that you have decided to curtail Colonsay, what are you expecting in terms of operational capacity for Mosaic in 2024. What levels of demand or price would you need to see to make the decision to restart Colonsay? And then, maybe some color in terms of the cash cost differences this year versus last year with Esterhazy up and running and Colonsay down? Thanks.', 'Bruce Bodine -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Thanks, Richard. For sure in the short-term here, potash supply is adequate to meet demand. And we made the decision to curtail Colonsay's production not based on one factor. So as we continue to evaluate the flexibility within our network, we're looking at not only the market and customer demands but also really how do we consider shareholder value as well."", ""And I think that's getting to your point. And we'll continue to do that. And at the current time, the economics just didn't make sense. But if you look at the broader 2024, for the whole year, we're very optimistic about demand recovery particularly on potash."", ""And I'll let Jenny talk about some areas in a minute. But in the meantime, we're going to shut Colonsay down. We've done this before. We've demonstrated our resolve to flexibly moving that mine up and down."", ""We can do that very quickly, and we can restore things very quickly as well. And as we expect when market demand returns will in short order return production at Colonsay. Again if the market demand is there and if we determine shareholder value is there as well. And some of the complexities are what's going on with the rest of our network and turnaround schedules and things like that."", ""Those things have to come into the analysis as well. But all of this is designed as we've said earlier to really let Belle Plaine and Esterhazy, our two low-cost production facilities run at full rate and continue to extract maximum value out of those two facilities. So Jenny maybe you want to talk about a little bit of the market dynamics and why we expect pricing to be pretty good for the rest of the year."", 'Jenny Wang -- Executive Vice President, Commercial', 'Sure, Bruce. I think I probably just want to build on the earlier comment on the potash demand recovery. In 2023, last year, the recovery of the demand was over 13% and added 8 billion tonnes the biggest recovery in the market was North America. We saw 27% of the demand increases over the previous year, and we are seeing very strong consumption increases in growth in China.', 'And apart from these two major markets in India and Brazil, we have all seen over 18% of the demand interests last year on potash. So as we get into 2024, we continue to expect the growth of potash demand in Brazil in India. And we are going to see a much broader demand recovery, the other market as I mentioned earlier, a small market in Asia, smaller market in Latin America. And all this demand projection will need to have the supply to meet the demand.', ""When we look at the supply side of the equation, in late 2023, we've seen some recovery of the shipment out of Belarus and Russia and also some incremental tonnes from Laos. As we get into 2024, the season itself we are in the typical low season time and we are watching the market dynamics. And we believe we are at or close to the price bottom in the market. In fact, we have seen some major price recovery over the last two weeks in Brazil."", ""So as Bruce mentioned earlier, we run our business, our potash operation to meet our customers' demand. And in the meantime, we want to maximize value creation for the shareholders as well. So that's the economic decision."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question today comes from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.', 'Joel Jackson -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst', 'Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the call, taking the questions. Bruce, congrats on the promotion here at first call.', 'You said that phosphate margins should be been elevated. You talk about how strong phosphate is. Can you comment on that a bit more? Do you expect in Q1 that phosphate margins would be better the same or lower than Q4 margins? And would that be an EBITDA or gross margin basis or some other basis? Thanks.', 'Bruce Bodine -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Hey, Joel thanks for your kind words. On phosphates, listen the bottom line is supply is extremely tight. And we've talked about that balance. And even as much as demand, if you theoretically could go higher, it is going to be tough to reach supply with the restrictions out of China and the things that we talked about in one of the fireside chat questions."", ""So that is driving pretty good stripping margins in this business. Some of the best we've seen over the last decade. And we do expect that to continue. We may see pricing bubble a little bit just due to seasonality throughout the year, but we do believe our realized stripping margins given raw material pricing on sulfur and ammonia and what we have projected for the year will continue to stay relatively flat and strong for the remainder of the year."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question today comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.', 'Vincent Andrews -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst', ""Thank you and good morning, everyone. Can I just ask about on the phosphate production side, what you're anticipating coming out of Morocco this year. It seemed like they ran at lower rates last year. Are you expecting that to continue into this year? And what are you expecting in terms of imports into the US market, year over year given, I guess there's still some uncertainty over countervailing duties but an update on those issues would be helpful."", 'Thank you.', 'Bruce Bodine -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes Vincent, thanks and good talking to you today. It's something we watch pretty closely is what's going on in that part of the world as you can imagine. Jenny and her team and our market analysis team and economic team are really looking at that. So I'm going to turn it over to her to provide a little more detail on the commentary."", 'Jenny Wang -- Executive Vice President, Commercial', ""Hi, Vincent. Yes, I think we've been watching very closely on OCP's shipment. Last year we've seen some major recovery of their phosphate fertilizer export, especially in the second half of the year. This is basically bringing their export toward to their record level over the last few years."", 'In the meantime, we are seeing some major reduction on their phosphate rock export last year. And that was actually less than half of the tonnes they exported in the record year back in 2021. And therefore asset exports were basically very flat. So to think about OCPs supply into 2024.', ""Our forecast is that they're going to continue to keep the normal way of operation and they might add a little bit into their new granulation capacity but not really in the big deal. So even with this recovered OCP supply and the increased a small amount of fertilizer production, we believe 2024 phosphate supply will stay as tight."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question today comes from Helen Rodriguez with Mizuho. Please go ahead.', 'Helen Rodriguez -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst', ""Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I mean, Bruce you've talked about like the strength of faster prices, which is clearly the case. But any concerns that if prices stay way above the other nutrients like this could incentivize farmers to cut back in phosphate if they start thinking about their expenses and so forth given the decline in crop prices."", 'Bruce Bodine -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Hi, Helen. The economic on the farm topic is a great one and something again we're paying a lot of attention to. We were soy and corn being – I'm sorry soybeans and corn prices are right now, we do see still pretty affordable economics overall, when you look at the portfolio of nutrients, right? And that's NPNK. And even though phosphate because of the tight supply that Jenny has outlined before and we talked about one of the fireside questions, prices are elevated but we have seen potash come down significantly and nitrogen at a more moderate level as well."", ""So combined, I think fertilizer affordability from a percentage of on-farm revenue is actually pretty reasonable compared to the last two years. So we're not anticipating any demand destruction and due to pricing of the total nutrient package for farmers depending on their crops. And the other one that we talked about it in some of our materials is we've made a lot about corn and soybean prices but corn and soybean demand is really only 30% of the global fertilizer demand. The rest 70% is in other grain and oilseeds and non-grain and oilseeds markets."", ""And we're seeing a lot of tightness in some of those markets and actually quite favorable economics when it comes to nutrient affordability. So, overall, I think the competitiveness of nutrients and demand is there. The incentive is there. again driven by lack of fertilization in the last couple of years, good affordability."", ""The tailwinds that are being provided on some of the biofuel stuff as well. I think it's very constructive that hopefully ag commodity prices continue to moderate up and then continue to drive good demand to maximize yields on the farm. Jenny has got one more point she wants to make."", 'Jenny Wang -- Executive Vice President, Commercial', 'Yes. just want to -- Bruce just want to provide one more data point. As we are watching corn soybean prices and all the cases were on corn soybean. And if you look at other major ag commodities like rice the price is very, very supportive.', 'And today actually in fact today India export price for rice is setting a new record. So, that tells you actually if you go beyond corn soybeans the other commodities are very constructive in terms of the prices and also the farm economics.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question today comes from Andrew Wong with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.', 'Andrew Wong -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst', ""Thank you for taking my questions. So, on the phosphate production, what's your expectation on when you could return to an 8 million tonne annual run rate. And when that happens what's your expectation on phosphate rock cost and conversion cost? Thanks."", 'Bruce Bodine -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Andrew thanks. We've been talking about this for a few quarters and it's a big focus area for us strategically, particularly given the strong margins that are in the market today given the high demand/limited supply. We have stated and continue to state that we're on our path over the next few quarters to get to an eight million-ton annual run rate. We're confident in that."", 'Last year second half of the year we had some impacts with two of our large sulfur plants in Louisiana went down. Both of those have now returned to service. We had a major turnaround at the end of last year and another sulfur plant down at Bartow. Again both of those are done and back to service.', ""So, we are starting to see gradually a return to that. But as mentioned in some of the fireside chat comments, we do have a heavy turnaround schedule baked into the first half of this year. So, getting to that 2 million tonnes level more toward the end of the year, part of that is with this turnaround schedule to continue to focus on some of those actors that have caused us some maintenance -- unplanned maintenance issues over the last couple of years. So, again, confident we're going to get there by the end of the year."", ""It's needed. And that's what we're going to continue to do is focus on our asset health. And we've been infusing a lot of our sustaining capex by the way to actually do that over the last two years as well. So, look forward to that near the end of the year."", 'And Clint has something to add I think on the economics piece.', 'Clint Freeland -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. Thanks Bruce. Andrew when we look at the impact of moving our production back up to that target level, I think on a cost per ton basis -- and I think that was part of your question, you would likely see something on the order of magnitude of call it, $20 to $25 a tonne improvement in that per unit cost. So it's material as we begin to ramp-up to those target levels."", 'Bruce Bodine -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yeah. Thanks, Clint. And even on top of that, Andrew, we've talked about our cost reduction initiatives just in addition to that, but we expect to layer in $150 million of cost reductions through the enterprise. Looking at G&A spending, some of the operations benefits of getting back to full production working capital management and then just overall capex reduction."", 'So adding to the absorption benefits that Clint talked about, plus some of these other initiatives to really wring out cost from the enterprise through cycle economics should be much more favorable.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question today comes from Jeff Zekauskas with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.', 'Jeff Zekauskas -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""Thanks very much. I was wondering if you can clarify some issues around your relationship with Ma'aden. Is that a joint venture that you wish to invest in over time further through capacity expansion? It's also the case that historically, the cash that's to come from the equity income has been much lower. Is there a cash benefit that you get in the future? That catches you up from the equity income that you've made? Or does it turn out that you don't catch up?"", 'Bruce Bodine -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Jeff, no, thanks. As you point out, that joint venture for us is an important part of our portfolio of assets for sure, not only do we gain market access in the markets like India with some of the tons that we have there. We get a lot of market intelligence through that joint venture as well. As far as, do we have interest in future investment, I don't think that's in the top of our priority list."", ""I never want to say never, depending on what the return on economics could be in such an investment. But I think we've got better focus areas for any of our cash and liquidity that we may put to something else. But at the end of the day, the Ma'aden joint venture at Saudi Arabia has been a great partnership, and we've seen that really mature over the course of this relationship. And it's got to continue to earn a spot in our portfolio for sure, on a long-term basis, but right now, we're fairly happy with the results and where that is running."", ""They just came off a record year at MWSPC on a production standpoint as well. So we're really starting to extract value out of that in the way that we hadn't previously. But I'm going to turn it over to Clint to talk about a little bit more of the economic questions that you had."", 'Clint Freeland -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', 'Hi, Jeff. I think you noted the differential between the equity earnings over time and cash. I think our first cash dividend was actually paid out last year. I think total equity income last year for us was roughly $57 million.', ""So we did get part of that in the form of a dividend. But one of the things that has been the focus of Ma'aden over the past, say, two to three years, has been on debt reduction. So a lot of the earnings and the cash generation of the joint venture has actually gone to paying down some of the debt load. And I think overall, order of magnitude, debt has been paid down by about $1.5 billion, so firming up the capital structure of the project."", ""And so, I think that's one of the main reasons why you see that differential between equity earnings and actually cash being paid out to us and the partners. One thing to also note, and again, it's relatively modest, but we also do get marketing fees and earn some level of income on some of the tons that we do sell. But again, that's one of the reasons, why you've seen that differential between equity earnings and cash, because a lot of the cash has actually been going to managing the balance sheet and paying down debt."", 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from Rikin Patel with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.', 'Rikin Patel -- Exane BNP Paribas -- Analyst', 'Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You covered the guidance capex quite well earlier, but I was wondering if you could provide some outlook on the working capital requirement for 2024.', 'I suppose just given the context of the significant release you had last year, would you expect to see working capital investment next year? Thank you.', 'Bruce Bodine -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Hey, Rikin thanks for joining us and appreciate the question. Working capital has been. If I understood your question right, broke up a little bit in the beginning for me, has been a focus for us across all of our major markets. I think we've done a pretty good job of managing that risk compared to others in the space."", ""But I'm going to turn it over to Clint to maybe talk a little bit more about how we think about working capital."", 'Clint Freeland -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. Thanks Bruce, and thanks for the question Rikin. As you noted, over the last couple of years, we've seen pretty significant changes in working capital. And a lot of that has been driven by the price environment."", ""So you saw a significant increase in working capital and use of cash in 2022. And then, you've seen a pretty material release of cash in 2023, as a pricing environment changed. A lot of times one of the things that is also a significant contributor to that is our distribution business in Brazil, as they manage inventory levels and so forth around some of those price changes. But as we look out, I think, it's going to be driven by the price environment."", ""I think, we are putting some renewed focus on things like inventory turns. And days of payables and receivables and really trying to work even harder to manage those to, again, manage the level of working capital that's needed. The other thing that I would note is over the last couple of years, we've tried to set up some funding alternatives to assist us in managing through some of those seasonal, particularly seasonal elements of working capital needs. So we've had a number of things like an inventory lines and receivable securitization facilities put in place, when we got our rating -- debt rating upgrade to BBB flat BAA2."", 'We also set up a commercial paper facility. And what we try to do is to maintain a certain level of funding to again take away some of those seasonal moves and to reduce some of the cash drag on the company throughout the year. So, again, focusing on those two areas. One is just the absolute level of working capital.', 'And again, that will be dictated by price environment, but then also being -- trying to be pretty thoughtful on how we fund that through the year and not just be using cash for that purpose.', 'Operator', 'Thank you. And our next question comes from Josh Spector with UBS. Please go ahead.', 'Josh Spector -- UBS -- Analyst', 'Yes. Hi. Good morning. So I wanted to follow-up on phosphate margins, specifically.', ""I think versus most models out there pricing came in higher but gross margins were lower in the fourth quarter. So I'm just trying to square the sequential gross margin move, if we think about in gross margin per ton in the fourth quarter – or sorry, first quarter here because you're saying the stripping margin stays high but pricing you're guiding up $40. We talked about more volume leverage in the first quarter. So is there a way to square all these moving parts between what you did in the fourth quarter versus what you're expecting from a gross margin per ton perspective in the first quarter? Thanks."", 'Bruce Bodine -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Yes, Josh, thanks. I think we are seeing a little bit of expansion there. For sure, the other part is our costs aren't going to necessarily come down as fast given the turnaround schedule I talked about earlier. So that's still going to be a little bit of a drag."", ""But overall, we still see those healthy realized stripping margins. You got to think about – and I'm going to turn it over to Clint in a minute maybe talk a little bit more about it but our advantaged position on ammonia and our access to low-cost sulfur really kind of differentiates us a little bit from the industry stripping margin what we get on a realized stripping margin, given that a good portion of our ammonia consumption comes from our Faustina facility in-house. And of course, our advantage contract with CF. So we do still think stripping margins are going to be good."", ""Gross margins realized will be good. But maybe, given the cost pressures we're still going to see a little bit of a slowness in full recovery of that. And Clint maybe you can talk a little bit more about that."", 'Clint Freeland -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer', ""Yes. The only thing that I would add on that around our in-house ammonia is we made – we had I guess a turnaround about 18 months ago in Louisiana around and made some investments in our converter at the facility. And it's – as a result it's had much higher reliability. And again, as we've seen the level of production that we've had, we've been able to lean on that a little bit more as a proportion of our ammonia sourcing, as well as the CF contract."", ""So we've been less dependent on some of the market purchases. And as a result, as an example in the fourth quarter, about 35% of our ammonia was actually sourced in-house. And again, so that's helpful from a comparative cost standpoint. So as we go forward, as production ramps back up, overall finished product production ramps back up, we'll need to access a little bit more on the market."", ""But again in this environment at this point in time, we're getting more benefit maybe than we naturally, historically have from our in-house production of ammonia."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Bruce Bodine for any closing remarks."", 'Bruce Bodine -- President and Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, thank you, operator. To conclude our call, I'd like to reiterate our key messages for today. First, the global phosphate market as we've discussed is very strong and we expect favorable dynamics to continue throughout the remainder of the year. And second, potash demand is emerging and we've talked about that and we expect a strong rebound in global demand this year."", ""And third, we are executing plans to optimize our operations so that we can benefit fully from strong markets, while improving Mosaic's resilience.

Boeing deserves credit for these promising first steps but it still suffers from glaring vulnerabilities. Passengers–and shareholders like us–may want to fasten their seat belts because, despite some early wins, there is possibly worse turbulence on the horizon and far tougher challenges still ahead.', 'Already, since Boeing MAX planes were first grounded in 2019, a vast majority of the Boeing board has turned over, with the formation of a new Board Safety Committee consisting of almost entirely new members, as well as the creation of a new Chief Aerospace Safety Officer position.', 'However, as we previously warned, despite the sterling credentials of the company’s board and top officers, the safety mandate was not percolating down through the ranks.', 'Perhaps it was not a coincidence that Stan Deal, the head of the division in question, Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA), relieved the general manager of the problem-plagued 737 MAX factory of his duties merely days after Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Chief Mike Whitaker visited that same factory, in Renton, Washington.', 'But what is truly impressive is the elevation of several women leaders to the senior operational ranks. In a staff memo, Deal announced Katie Ringgold as the new general manager of the Renton plant and appointed Elizabeth Lund to the new position of senior VP for BCA Quality. Deal himself, of course, reports to newly-appointed Chief Operating Officer Stephanie Pope, rumored to be a top internal candidate to succeed Calhoun.', 'If there ever was a complacent good ole boys culture, there is no better way to shake things up from top to bottom. The successful tenures of trailblazing women leaders in aerospace and aviation such as Kathy Warden of Northrop Grumman, Phoebe Novakovic of General Dynamics, and Marillyn Hewson of Lockheed Martin is proof that merit always wins over machismo.', 'So far, Boeing deserves credit for getting grounded 737 MAX 9s back in the sky by following the FAA’s instructions, implementing “quality stand-downs” at every factory for front-line factory employees to focus completely on improvements to safety processes, appointing an external expert advisor for an independent review of Boeing’s safety processes (though that expert, a Navy admiral, does not have much aviation expertise), and opening Boeing factories to all airline customers for inspection, oversight, and increased transparency', 'Boeing has also been working more closely with key suppliers to fix its broken supply chain, especially the long-troubled Spirit AeroSystems, which manufactures virtually every Boeing MAX fuselage. Under new CEO Pat Shanahan, Spirit, which is based in Wichita, Kansas, appears to be improving, having already identified weak spots in the labor-intensive work on the forward and rear sections of the airplane and pledging to automate more rote assembly tasks (i.e. drilling holes, door plugs, etc.) so that engineers can focus on higher-value tasks and safety control.', 'This is making the best out of a terrible situation. There is no operational reason for Boeing to outsource so much of its supply chain other than pure financial engineering and runs contrary to Boeing’s history prior to the McDonnell Douglas merger. Under founder William Boeing, the company originally assembled storied aviation brands Pratt & Whitney, United Technologies, and Boeing all under the same corporate umbrella in the 1920s. And although Boeing sold Spirit to a private equity firm in 2005 for $1.2 billion, the market cap of Spirit today represents less than 3% of Boeing’s market cap.', 'Boeing’s key production challenge is how it will revitalize its engineering workforce, which may take years to solve. The pandemic saw an exodus of experienced engineering talent which has still not been fully replaced. According to aerospace analyst Ronald Epstein at Bank of America, before COVID-19, more than half of the Boeing MAX factory employees had 6+ years of experience. That percentage has now dwindled to less than 25% of the workforce, based on IAM/International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers District 751/Washington State membership rolls.', 'Although Calhoun has avoided angering regulators so far, several key regulatory hurdles are on the horizon as Calhoun and FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker prepare to meet next week.', 'First, the FAA is finishing its official six-week-long audit of production lines in the days ahead and is expected to publish its reports and findings shortly thereafter.', 'Second, and relatedly, the FAA does not appear to be close to providing the long-delayed MAX 7 or MAX 10 certifications. While Boeing is pleased to have gotten its 180 grounded MAX 9s back in the sky, the financial impact is dwarfed by the fact Boeing has an order backlog of 1,000+ MAX 7s and MAX 10s, equivalent to ~$100 billion in future sales, which is held up until the FAA finally provides certification.', 'Boeing is rightly prioritizing safety above all else, even if it means pushing out financial and production timelines. Yet, with only 27 planes delivered in January, down from 38 in December, and with Boeing rapidly drawing down inventory with the FAA prohibiting any production increases, the company will start to feel the financial heat and will likely not meet its 2024/2025 cash flow targets with management commentary around outlook becoming more bearish by the week.', 'Boeing is making the right moves so far–but it is not out of turbulence just yet with impending storm clouds threatening to prolong this bumpy stretch.', 'Jeffrey Sonnenfeld is the Lester Crown Professor in Management Practice and Senior Associate Dean at Yale School of Management. He was named “Management Professor of the Year” by Poets & Quants magazine.', 'Steven Tian is the director of research at the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute and a former quantitative investment analyst with the Rockefeller Family Office.', 'Here’s\xa0how the U.S., Europe, and China are faring\xa0in the post-pandemic race for economic growth', 'Working fathers are the new target of microaggressions–and they are worried they could be getting\xa0‘daddy tracked’', 'Travis Kelce’s Super Bowl behavior is emblematic of\xa0the ‘rise of the jerk’', 'The anti-DEI movement has gone\xa0from fringe to mainstream.

GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Sign with PWR.', ""On February 22, 2024, Quanta Services Inc (NYSE:PWR), a leading provider of specialty contracting services, disclosed its annual financial results in the 10-K filing for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The company continues to demonstrate a strong financial position, with strategic acquisitions contributing to its comprehensive service offerings. Quanta Services Inc reported significant investments in businesses that align with its core operations, including those providing high-voltage transmission, solar tracking, and power transformer manufacturing services. These acquisitions, valued at approximately $782.4 million in cash and 1.24 million shares of common stock, underscore the company's commitment to expanding its capabilities and market reach. With a diverse customer base and a reputation for safety and performance, Quanta Services Inc is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for infrastructure solutions across various industries."", ""Strategic Acquisitions and Diversified Services: Quanta Services Inc's strength lies in its strategic acquisitions, which have broadened its service offerings and customer base. In 2023, the company made significant investments in businesses that complement its existing operations, such as those specializing in high-voltage transmission and solar tracking equipment. These acquisitions not only enhance Quanta's capabilities but also contribute to a more diversified revenue stream, reducing dependency on any single market segment."", ""Robust Customer Relationships: Another key strength is Quanta's solid customer relationships, with its largest customer accounting for 6% of consolidated revenues and the top ten customers representing 31%. The company's ability to maintain strategic alliances and preferred provider status with its clients speaks to its reliability and quality of service, which are critical factors in securing repeat business and long-term contracts."", ""Market Volatility and Competition: Despite its strong market position, Quanta Services Inc faces challenges from market volatility and increased competition. The industries Quanta operates in are highly competitive, with several large companies possessing significant resources. Furthermore, market volatility, influenced by economic and political conditions, can impact demand for Quanta's services and lead to pricing pressures."", ""Dependence on Skilled Labor: Quanta's operations are labor-intensive, relying heavily on skilled craft labor personnel. The availability and cost of such labor are potential weaknesses, as shortages could impact the company's ability to deliver services effectively and on time. This reliance on a skilled workforce also exposes Quanta to the risks associated with labor market fluctuations."", ""Growth in Renewable Energy: Quanta Services Inc is well-positioned to benefit from the growing renewable energy sector. The company's Renewable Energy segment offers comprehensive infrastructure solutions, including engineering, procurement, and construction services for renewable generation facilities. With the global shift towards sustainable energy, Quanta's expertise in this area presents significant growth opportunities."", ""Infrastructure Development Initiatives: The company's involvement in infrastructure development projects, such as electrical grid modernization and pipeline projects, aligns with national and global initiatives to upgrade critical infrastructure. Quanta's capabilities in these areas could lead to increased demand for its services as governments and private entities invest in infrastructure improvements."", ""Economic and Regulatory Uncertainties: Quanta Services Inc's operations can be affected by economic downturns, interest rate fluctuations, and commodity price changes. Additionally, regulatory changes, particularly those related to the energy sector and environmental policies, could pose threats to the company's project pipeline and profitability."", 'Technological Disruptions: The rapid pace of technological change presents a threat to Quanta Services Inc, as it must continuously adapt its service offerings to remain competitive. Failure to keep up with technological advancements could lead to a loss of market share and reduced relevance in the industry.', ""In conclusion, Quanta Services Inc (NYSE:PWR) exhibits a strong financial foundation and strategic positioning within the infrastructure solutions sector. The company's recent acquisitions and diversified service offerings have strengthened its competitive edge, while its established customer relationships underscore its reliability and expertise. However, Quanta must navigate the challenges posed by market volatility, competition, and labor dependency. Opportunities in renewable energy and infrastructure development present promising avenues for growth, but economic uncertainties and technological disruptions remain significant threats. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses, Quanta Services Inc can capitalize on emerging opportunities and mitigate potential threats, positioning itself for continued success in the evolving infrastructure landscape."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Duke?"", 'Earl C. Austin', ""Thanks, Kip. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Quanta Services Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. This morning, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, which included double-digit growth in revenues and earnings and included a number of record financial metrics, which we believe reflect robust demand for our services and solid execution. Total backlog at year-end was $30.1 billion, which we believe reflects the value of our collaborative client relationships, and evidences the momentum we see for 2024. Of note, Quanta has delivered record revenue 6 of the last 7 years. Six consecutive years of record-adjusted EBITDA and 7 consecutive years of record-adjusted diluted earnings per share. These results were built off an industry-leading operational and financial platform, and made possible by our more than 50,000 dedicated Quanta employees, whom we believe are the very best in our industry. As outlined in our operational and financial commentary, 2023 was a significant year for Quanta strategically, operationally and financially. And though we are proud of our many accomplishments during the year, we continue to look forward with excitement towards the multiyear strategic initiatives, we are working on and the goals we expect to achieve in this and the coming years. We are positioning Quanta for decades of expected necessary infrastructure investment and believe our service line diversity creates platforms for growth that expand our total addressable market. Our portfolio approach and focus on craft skill labor is a strategic advantage that provides us the ability to manage risk and ship resources across service lines and geographies. Which we believe will become increasingly important, as the energy transition accelerates. We believe our portfolio approach positions us well to allocate resources to the opportunities we find the most economically attractive and to achieve operating efficiencies and consistent financial results. I will now turn the call over to Jayshree Desai, Quanta's CFO, to provide a few remarks about our results and 2024 guidance, and then we will take your questions. Jayshree?"", 'Jayshree S. Desai', 'Thanks, Duke, and good morning, everyone. Quanta completed the year with fourth quarter revenues of $5.8 billion, net income attributable to common stock of $210.9 million or $1.42 per diluted share and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.04. Adjusted EBITDA was $550.2 million or 9.5% of revenue. Of note, our cash flow in the fourth quarter and for the full year was very strong with both setting period records. For the fourth quarter and full year of 2023, we had free cash flow of $915.5 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, which exceeded the upper end of our free cash flow guidance expectations. We ended the year with liquidity and a balance sheet that will position us to support our organic growth expectations in 2024, annually increase our dividend and opportunistically invest capital. To that end, in January, we acquired 2 companies for aggregate consideration of approximately $425 million. This morning, we also provided our full year 2024 financial expectations, which calls for another year of profitable growth with record revenues, improved margins and opportunity for double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. We believe our expectations demonstrate the strength of our portfolio approach to the business, our commitment to our long-term strategy, our favorable end-market trends and our competitive position in the marketplace. Additional details and commentary about our 2024 financial guidance can be found in our operational and financial commentary and outlook expectation summary, both of which are posted on our IR website. With that, we are happy to answer your questions. Operator?', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein.', 'Charles Albert Edward Dillard', 'So I want to spend some time on margins, particularly in Electric Power. So I think in some of the prepared remarks or it sounds like there is some pressure happening in Canada. So I just wanted to know whether you plan to rightsize the business. Or is there enough future work out there to continue at the current footprint? Just trying to think through how you think about the trade-off there.', 'Earl C. Austin', ""Yes. Thanks, Chad. When looking at margins, I think we've always discussed around 10% at the Electric segment, 10.5% with the impact of Puerto Rico is how you should guide it. We continue to believe that's the case. Is there opportunity for upside on the Electric side? Yes. We do believe there is. It depends on storms. It depends on utilizations. We need to get through some things. As we start our larger projects in the Renewable segment and in the Electric segment, we're in early stages of the larger dynamics such as SunZia, other big programs that we're starting. So as we get good cadence and as we continue to win these larger projects in the future, the cadence will be -- we're always running through contingency philosophically. We need to operate in the field. We need to execute as we do, we'll release contingencies, as we see it. And normally, there's upside opportunities in both segments. We've historically operated in both segments in double-digit type margins, and we believe we can operate there in the future. Certainly, we've been through some things where the business has been with the panels and some other things on the renewable side. That's starting to -- kind of starting to get good cadence there. It's early, we'll see where we get to by the end of the year, but we feel confident over time in our historical numbers that we'll be able to operate in double digits if you -- especially if you take both segments as one. If the crews do move from one to the other. So for me, the Renewable segment and Electric segment, as I see it, put them together and we should be able to operate in double digits."", 'Charles Albert Edward Dillard', ""Okay. That's helpful. And so in your prepared commentary, you mentioned that visibility of high-voltage transmission projects is improving. Can you say little more on this, what's changed? And how much more visibility do you have?"", 'Earl C. Austin', ""Look, we've said all along, and we think that the nation's grid is underinvested in transmission. I don't think that's news to anyone that we said, if you go to Europe and you look at the way the things happen in the corridor is it 3x bigger than anything we have here. We've barely invested in the transmission system of this nation. And in order to do the things that we want to do with this transition, whether it be EV, whether it be batteries, your fuel switching, the cheapest form to get the generation to the customer is transmission. So I think that's the key to this and the whole key of the securitization of the country as well as for us to get to a carbon-free environment, we'll have to build tons and tons of transmission. So I think you're -- we're just getting started in these bigger projects. We're seeing more and more come in our way. There is some push on clean affordable energy. But I believe that the transmission is the cheapest way as well. So I -- we're seeing more on the books. We're continuing to be around the edges on all those projects. So Chad starting, and we're confident in our ability to execute and win."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Eddie Modak with Goldman Sachs.', 'Unidentified Analyst', ""I just wanted to touch on the acquisitions. You previously talked about your thought process there. I think it was mostly trying to internally source your capabilities. But maybe if you can touch about -- touch on the 2 acquisitions you've made and the thought process around the Industrial Solutions side, in particular, as you go forward from here?"", 'Earl C. Austin', ""Yes. The acquisitions, as we look at them, truthfully, I think we've always said that the industrial business, as far as in the UUI segment, we like it, it's resilient. The nature of it is much like our MSAs on other businesses. The Environmental Solutions that we can provide on the industrial base, we believe that the base of the business will stay for decades, you're going to continue to refine, continue to have plastics and things of that nature done on the Gulf Coast. So the assets that keep the plants running and things of that nature will certainly be here for a long time and be more valuable over time. We're in the [Coles] business as well, where we have high voltage and now, our Environmental Solutions business. We like them all through. There are synergies along. There was very little overlap in the business. So it gives us really a good customer base. We don't imply synergies in our model. So there is synergies for sure. As we move forward, we'll identify them and I think you'll see them show up on our numbers. So we like the management team on our Industrial side. We're fully behind that for the long run. Great opportunity to get an environmental piece of the business here and really see our service line grow and expand in that area. So again, we're -- the portfolio is something that we value, as things move around, but the Industrial base and the Industrial side of our business is great, coming off a near record or record year, very close to it. So we're confident long term and the second piece of it was an internal supply chain that we feel like necessary to, from a cost standpoint as well as to make sure that we can -- we self-perform about 85% of the work, between 85% and 90%, and the tooling and all the equipment and things that we can do from this platform really allow us to make sure that we can man the work, man the people, any kind of bottlenecks for us, they're not acceptable. So we'll make sure the supply chains are steady and that we can continue to grow."", 'Unidentified Analyst', ""And then I think there has been a lot of market concerns around how your customers are thinking of projects. And I know you've mentioned the requirement around transmission and guide came in a lot better than what I think a lot of the Street was expecting. But maybe you can touch on how your customers are thinking of this year and the sensitivity around this potential regulatory changes, anything that's latest in your conversations?"", 'Earl C. Austin', ""Yes. I'm not seeing that. I'm not hearing that, I'm not hearing our customers back off anything. I've heard some switching from distribution and transmission, but their capital continues to grow. You have data centers, you have load growth, that's pushing in every jurisdiction we're in. The data centers are not going away, that load is not going away. The onboarding of manufacturing is not going away. EV penetration may stall a bit. We've always said we think that this is a longer build, not shorter. So they were saying 2030, maybe it's 2040, maybe it's 2050 for all EV penetration. But that's something on the distribution system that is not impacting as bad yet. We do need to plan as an industry. We do need to get in front of that, but we also have to be cognizant of the state regulators and as well as affordability at the customer level, ultimate customers. So yes, we're concerned with that as an industry. So distribution is something that you may see slip a little. The demand and what needs to be done to the system in order to electrify it, securitize it, is there, and it has -- it remains. Datacenter push is now, and generation switching is now, so you'll see probably some switch into transmission. It does not affect our portfolio whatsoever. The numbers you can see them. We stand by them. We've given good guidance. We've taken all this into account when we give out the 12-month guidance. And look, it's a prudent number in my mind. It's right where we need to be."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore.', 'Durgesh Chopra', ""Duke, I'm actually going to flip the last question. So we've seen your utility customers kind of raise CapEx in high teens. Even Illinois companies came out with their latest CapEx guidance, double-digit increases. What is factored into your '24 guidance? Should we assume that the forward-looking capital plan increases are factored in? Or are you still learning them? And I guess what I'm asking is what kind of conservatism are you baking into 2024 guidance, as you've seen a pretty significant step up, quite frankly, a step change in utility CapEx plans?"", 'Earl C. Austin', ""I think we're in a good spot for the start of the year, where we're at. And when we look at it, we look at our historicals, and we're going to talk about EPS growth. If you look at EPS growth, what we've said is we grow double digits in the CAGR basis, have the opportunity to grow 15%, the transition, everything that's ongoing that can allow that 15% growth.If you go back and you look at our historicals, it's 15% growth. So do I think there's opportunity? Yes. It depends on storms. It depends on other things that are out of our control at times. So we'll take a prudent nature to it, election year, things like that. We've taken all that into account when we give guidance. I do think there's opportunities for us to grow 15%. I do. We've said it. And I don't think it's changed. I think -- when I look at it, when I look at our opportunities, given the fact that the tech push on AI, on all the things that you can do from a data center, it's backing up everything plus. So your fuel switching is one thing, but when you think through it and you see the load growth in data centers, it really pushes the Transmission system and Generation system because at tech, they want clean power, and they want it now. So I think that push on the industry is something that is why you're seeing such confidence in the capital spend in the transmission systems. It does affect our distribution a bit. I said it, but, we've taken all that into account, I expect later half of the year, Distribution to grow as well in a meaningful way. So it's something that we've taken into account."", 'Durgesh Chopra', ""Got it. That is very clear. And then maybe could you just address risks related to the SunZia project, and I'm not sure if you can, but can you quantify what are you modeling is, is EBITDA for those projects?"", 'Earl C. Austin', ""We don't look at it project by project like that. I'm confident in the numbers we've given. At SunZia, the whole thing was about 50 miles. I think the job is 1,000 miles. We have plenty of room to move and work with our client on stretch, as a right away here or there, but that is not meaningful. It will alleviate as we move through. We're not concerned. The project starts now, ramps throughout the year, part of why you see some guidance move into the second half as the ramp on these larger projects in the back half. But they're known projects, they're contracted projects. So that's the difference is, we know we're moving on and now and we know what the ramp looks like, in the back half. And I do expect us to get more awards in the back half. And so we'll continue to ramp. It's just -- it's some seasonality that you see early that ramps in the back. But SunZia, I'm not concerned at this point."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS.', 'Steven Fisher', ""Congrats on a nice '23. Just curious how we should think about that 20% growth in the Renewables segment in 2024? Clearly, there's SunZia, I think there's maybe a piece of PTT, that you are allocating into that segment. So how should we think about the growth rate of the Renewables business separately from those couple of pieces and really just trying to think about the big picture here about Renewables? I mean SunZia is kind of a unique project. But at a higher level, to what extent do we think like this is the year where Renewables kind of break out from a more restrained '22 and '23 from some of the various uncertainties that have been going on in the marketplace?"", 'Earl C. Austin', ""I don't know what our growth was last year, but it was significant. So -- and then '22 it was significant. So I think from our standpoint, we've had phenomenal growth in the Renewables side, both in '22 and '23. Off those big growth on balance of plant, solar land. And when you go into '24, we've got good growth, double digits plus, on both sides of that, whether it be our legacy business or balance of plant going forward. We continue to see '25, '26 and beyond. There is some pressure with -- when you think about wind. Wind starting to come in for us with SunZia and other repower opportunities there, Steve. So we're starting to see some assets like cranes, things like that, that we were sitting on, some indirect costs on the wind side of the business, that will help the overall margins in the back half, as we see wind come in with the solar as that mix starts to change a bit more you'll continue to see margins move up due to some of the overheads and indirect costs that move through, as well as our Canadian operations are looking better from the Renewable side. So all those things will come into impact, you'll continue to see margins move up. And I do believe the top line in the Renewables segment will move up."", 'Steven Fisher', ""Great. That's very helpful. And then when you think Duke, about the portfolio approach that you've been implementing, where do you think that's going to have the biggest benefit impact in 2024? Curious where the kind of the directional flow is mostly going to be? Is it still sort of underground work moving to Electric segment, Canada to the U.S.? Anything else to note about how to think about the portfolio approach in '24?"", 'Earl C. Austin', ""From a service line standpoint, I think our Distribution business will start to ramp in the back half more than it is today. Canada geographically is down. We know it's down. We're seeing later half of this year, '24 with awards and how we're starting projects in the latter half of '24 and also what we're seeing from government to the West in BC, as well as the East. So we're seeing the amount of capital getting put into the same kind of fuel switching you're seeing here in the States. So I do believe Canada starts to move back into good markets, call it, late '24 and beyond, as far as we can see. So it does help us there. But we've rightsized that business. And yes, it's pulling margins down a bit in the States, but the assets there. We're utilizing here, in Lower 48 as well as across the company. So that's where the portfolio comes into play. The front side of our business, things like that, that we have there, that gives us some abilities, here in the Lower 48. Look, we're not hitting on all cylinders. So I would say, as the portfolio as that moves forward, both geographic and service lines, as they mature, you'll see some undergrounding move from gas to electric. But look, we're taking advantage of those leverage -- things we can leverage at the local levels and making sure that we're in the right place. I'm not too concerned with if we're pulling electric pipe or gas or whatever it is, we're just trying to optimize our resources. So that's the big thing. It should increase margins. We're not where we want to be from a company in the portfolio, a double-digit type EBITDA margins, across the board. We do believe we can operate there. So as we look at the portfolio and everything that we're doing, it should be the optimization of our margins. But I will say that if you look at the way of adjusted returns, our returns are going up substantially. You can see it with cash, you can see a return on invested capital."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research Partners.', 'Michael Stephan Dudas', ""Duke, it seemed like the lifeline went off with your utility clients and everybody because of AI, as you discussed earlier, data center, demand that people want to just get out and spend and do stuff. How do you -- how you guys allocate your very dear and tight resources relative to your client base or where the opportunities are? And is the demand for contracting and your type of services very tight right now relative to supply? And how is that relative to your current ability to bring folks on and under graduation rates at the colleges? And are the utilities maybe pushing off some of those retirements because they're just going to be so busy?"", 'Earl C. Austin', ""I think on the transition side of the business, we're seeing a significant amount of ramp there in areas. It's spotty. No, we're not anywhere near capacity from my standpoint. I think we've got a lot of room. We've not seen anything that would back us off, to say that we're concerned with labor at this point. We're in good shape. Look, we have a good look at it, a good 5-year look at what we see, very close to the business, very close to our clients. We work with them quite a bit on long-term natures and programs and what's going on, when you go from West to East and the coverage that we have, you're able to see the things that we know are going to happen, they start in the West like when you start to see vehicle penetration in the West, you know it's going to move across the country. And we're starting to see those impacts. I think Edison had a good report on kind of how their grid is changing. And I think it gets -- it gets worse, not better. I think capital goes up even from what they're seeing. And I think you'll continue to see that, as you see the total cost impacts of energy really require the grid to be robust to create the environment that you want, which is the customer builds going down, you have to build this infrastructure out to get the total cost of energy down. It's happened in Europe, you'll start to see more and more of that giving said, which is really important for us to get in front of the necessary capital at the local level, at the state levels, so they understand in order to get the cost down, you've got to get the infrastructure. And it's also security for the country, is to get the grid where we need it to be. And you're going to see that, with loads going up in places, no one expected load to go up like this.The areas that you're seeing a load, they did not expect data cities to come in and take, call it, 3 gigs, 5 gigs and they don't want -- they want secure power. So sometimes that requires multiple lines. And when you look at all this and you look at what's coming at you, you're backed up by this. The technology that's coming into the world that requires our services, across the board, in the utilities rooting growth business, they're growing. And it's necessary for them to spend capital, it's just a matter of getting it through from a federal push into the state regulators. And we kind of said that all along that this is necessary, it's going to come to a head, and you're seeing it. This transition will be noisy. It will be things that you'll see, it's not straight up every day. It's going to have CAGR look to it at times, in parts of the business. That's why I like the portfolio so much, as we can move around and kind of get through this transition here and continue to what I believe perform at a high level and deliver the results we have."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Gus Richard with Northland Capital.', 'Auguste Philip Richard', ""The AI data center, not only needs a lot of power, but it needs a lot of bandwidth. And I'm just wondering if you guys are seeing along with the AI boom, an increased demand for your comm services? And is there any synergies between those 2 pieces, the power and the comp?"", 'Earl C. Austin', ""I think so. When you look at our Communications business, I mean, we've done nicely, we're growing double digits. It's not something that we're investing a lot of capital in. But I do see it. I do see technology itself needing -- you're going to strip some of the fiber capacity, are stripping some of the fiber capacity out there. And especially when you start putting big data in different parts of the country, it's much easier to build a telecom line and get telecom service, than it is transmission. So sometimes in my mind, you'll see data centers start to locate, where the power is, almost. And right now, if you can't get power to the East and you can't get it to the West, you start to see the Midwest build. And then if you can't get it there, you start to see the South build. So everywhere that you can get affordable power today or in the next 24 months, you'll start to see data centers go up. Even if there's not fiber, so you're going to get fiber going to them, at some point, nodes. Certainly, some of it is getting alleviated with satellites, things like that, but still you need the fiber on the ground. So I do believe they'll push it, and yes, there's an opportunity.."", 'Auguste Philip Richard', ""Got it. And then just on the underground side. There's -- there was a pause in 3 years out on build-out of LNG export capacity. And I'm just wondering what you're seeing in that business are projects still moving forward? And just the state of natural gas and that business for you?"", 'Earl C. Austin', ""It's $500 million to $600 million in the guidance, it will be $500 million to $600 million, next year, in the next year and the next year. We don't -- we're not going to -- that's why we moved off long-haul pipe and big pipe. We just can't -- we can't build the business around it. It's certainly something, we'll take every bit of opportunity we can. We did $1 billion-plus in big pipe last year. So you're seeing some offset in the top line because of that because we guided $500 million to $600 million. Is there opportunities for $1 billion-plus? Sure. But the government regulations and difficulty in building a large diameter pipe, anywhere in the country, but Canada is a little better, opportunities in Canada. But we're just -- we can't take that and build it in guidance and give you any kind of firmness to our numbers. So I -- look, I think there's opportunities. But it doesn't -- LNG, if everything goes and it doesn't go, it doesn't matter to the guide we've given you. It doesn't matter."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Brian Brophy with Stifel.', 'Brian Daniel Brophy', 'I wanted to ask about free cash flow guidance. Was quite a bit higher than we were expecting. Your free cash flow conversion is above long-term targets this year. How much of this is more of the onetime collections that you called out, in the commentary versus potentially a more permanent improvement in free cash flow conversion here as renewable energy mix has grown?', 'Jayshree S. Desai', ""Yes. As we've talked about in the Investor Day, and as you've seen in the fourth quarter last year, the Renewable business with the way those contracts are set up, has a very favorable cash flow profile and the working capital profile is very good. And so, as revenue on the renewable side pushes up, you will see better conversion just as we saw in 2023.Going into 2024, we did take that into consideration, but we did range it. There's a range for a reason. As I just said, Renewables can push us in the higher end of that range of 45% to 55% that we talked about at Investor Day. But if you've got -- if it's more growth coming from our Electric and Underground segments, it can push the other way, right? And so we've given you what we think is a good prudent look at where free cash flow will be. But having said that, if the mix of work between Renewal and Electric and Utility Underground changes, you will see outside of that range or either a high end of that range or the low end of the range. The onetime cash flow impact of the large Canadian Renewable project, we do believe we will collect next year. We -- excuse me, in 2024. We -- as we talked about the last several quarters, as construction winds down, which we expect in the next several months, a couple of months. Conversations with the customer continue to go very well. So we're optimistic, we'll be able to collect all of that as well this year. But on an ongoing basis, I think you would be good to look at a range of between 45% to 55% conversion."", 'Brian Daniel Brophy', ""Okay. And then just wanted to touch on how you're thinking about capital allocation more broadly this year given that you're in line with some of your longer-term leverage targets now. Should we be expecting more buybacks this year? How are you thinking about M&A? Any thoughts there would be helpful."", 'Earl C. Austin', ""Sure. We'll be opportunistic in how we look at it like we have in the past, no different. We are below some of our targets. It allows us flexibility, which I like a lot. Certainly, there's things that we can be opportunistic in. But the strategies won't change. We've laid out a good strategy plan. Can we get -- can we go faster, as we delever, things like that, sure. So I think ultimately, we're moving faster across the 5-year plan. As we said last quarter and continue to say, we're moving faster through it. We'll be opportunistic with the balance sheet.

I do not believe that will be the case going forward. That's something that gives to the industry. So I continue to believe that -- how you get them and our customers have been able to get in front of this. And I think our customer base is solid and they got these things kind of figured out. The IRA has some different thing, you can get more, not less. So I actually think we're in early stages of the IRA, which should give us more opportunity going forward, not less. So I see it as more opportunities. We should check the box on from a standpoint of U.S.-type apprenticeship programs, U.S.-type materials, things of that nature, even internally. So we really set ourselves up to take advantage of that for the customer. So I feel good about it. I'm not seeing it slow down from that standpoint. I mean, everyone's watching from our customer viewpoint, they got it figured out and tax credit figured out and feel good about it."", 'Martin Whittier Malloy', ""I'm sorry, I appreciate your comments. I wasn't clear, I was actually asking about energy storage attach rates, at utility-scale solar and wind projects with adding energy storage in conjunction with those projects and what that means for your scope of work and profit margin soon?"", 'Earl C. Austin', ""I think -- I mean, I think I understand what you're saying. But from an attach rate standpoint, I don't know if it does much, but from a combination, it actually expands many of the projects that we've built in the past are adding storage to it. Our Storage business is growing nicely, and our Battery business is growing nicely. So I like that. We continue to add that capability and get more refined there, as we move forward across geographies. So, when you ask that, I think it's just more opportunity to increase the size and scope of these projects."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis & Company.', 'Adam Robert Thalhimer', 'Congrats on the solid result, Quick question on the project funnel for Blattner, is that still dominated by solar? Or are you seeing wind pick up?', 'Earl C. Austin', ""I mean, (inaudible) nice project that's on the wind side. We're seeing more opportunities to repower. I think you'll see a lot of repower work going forward. You're in early stages of the cycle -- cycle coming back from wind. So we're starting to see more and more in the outer years of wind coming into the portfolio. I don't think it's going to be any like large windfall in '24 by any means, but I do think '25, '26, it starts to move up significantly as we move out in the outer years, the curves get, where wind makes a lot more sense in areas. So you'll start -- transmission needs to be built, too. Like we've got to get the transmission built before you can get wind out. And that's the other piece of this is you need long-haul transmission to move wind out of those sources into load centers. So it's very chicken or the eggs sometimes, and I do think both are coming into play. And the Wind business gets better from, call it, '24 on."", 'Adam Robert Thalhimer', ""That's great. And then I also wanted to get your early thoughts on PTT and the timing of the capacity expansion there?"", 'Earl C. Austin', ""We continue to expand capacity there. There's a lot of things that we can do internally to expand. We're expanding like the business ever more so today than we did -- today looked at it. So it gets better the opportunities and synergies, the things that we can do for the clients with PTT, U.S.-based, Union in Pennsylvania, a great place to invest and we're lacking that business a lot."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Sangita Jain with KeyBanc Capital Markets.', 'Sangita Jain', 'So you gave earnings cadence of -- which is kind of back-end loaded, which is generally normal for you. And I was wondering if it was just weather and seasonality or if there is something more to read into how the projects ramp as the year progresses?', 'Jayshree S. Desai', ""No, I think it's mostly seasonality typical of what we run. We did -- as Duke talked about, there's a little bit of Canadian pressure in the first half of the year. But it's just normal seasonality. And we do expect with the additional SunZia work and some other projects, more back half weighted, but again, nothing more unusual than that."", 'Sangita Jain', ""Great. And I just have one follow-up. And this on the Renewables side, the Biden moratorium on the tariffs comes to an end in June. So I was wondering if you're seeing any kind of pull forward on the part of developers, who want to install within that 180-day timeline between purchase and installation?"", 'Jayshree S. Desai', ""The customers we work with, have been planning for the tariff situation for a while now. So I think we're -- our customers have been planning this moratorium being lifted in June. So it's -- I don't know -- I can't answer directly, if we're seeing some pull forward, I just know that the customers we've been working with for years now planned for this very well. They know how to work this.

Despite a decrease in total revenues to $58.5 billion, a 42% drop from the previous year, largely due to the operational wind-down of COVID-19 product sales, Pfizer's financial tables reflect the company's enduring strength in its core offerings. The company's strategic acquisitions, such as the transformative purchase of Seagen, and its commitment to R&D, signal a focused drive towards future growth and innovation."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with PFE.', ""As we delve into the SWOT analysis of Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE), we will explore the company's internal strengths and weaknesses, as well as the external opportunities and threats that could influence its trajectory in the pharmaceutical industry."", ""Robust Product Portfolio and R&D Focus: Pfizer Inc's strength lies in its diverse and strong product portfolio, which includes high-performing drugs like the pneumococcal vaccine Prevnar 13, cancer drug Ibrance, and cardiovascular treatment Eliquis. The company's commitment to R&D is evident from its strategic acquisition of Seagen, enhancing its oncology offerings.

Pfizer's strategic restructuring, such as the creation of the Pfizer Oncology Division and the Pfizer International Commercial Division, demonstrates its agility in responding to market dynamics and optimizing its international operations for better focus and execution."", ""Revenue Volatility Post-COVID-19: Pfizer Inc faced a significant operational decrease in revenue, primarily due to the reduction in COVID-19 product sales. This volatility highlights a weakness in the company's dependence on pandemic-related products for a substantial portion of its revenue. As the demand for these products normalizes, Pfizer must navigate the transition and focus on its broader product portfolio to maintain financial stability."", ""Operational Risks and Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: The company's operations are subject to transitional and physical risks, including climate change impacts and geopolitical tensions.

Pfizer's focus on drug discovery and development positions it to capitalize on these trends. By continuing to invest in cutting-edge R&D and fostering external innovation through collaborations, Pfizer can maintain its leadership in delivering breakthrough medicines and vaccines."", ""Intellectual Property and Cybersecurity Risks: Pfizer Inc operates in an industry where intellectual property is crucial. The company faces risks related to patent claims, infringement, and the potential loss of exclusivity. Additionally, cybersecurity threats pose a significant risk to Pfizer's IT systems and infrastructure, which could lead to business disruptions and theft of confidential information. These threats could have material adverse effects on the company's operations and reputation."", ""Regulatory and Market Pressures: Pfizer must navigate an increasingly complex regulatory environment and market pressures, including expectations for equitable access to medicines and sustainable products. Failure to meet these expectations could result in negative stakeholder reactions and impact the company's competitive position. Moreover, changes in government regulations or laws could lead to increased compliance costs and affect Pfizer's ability to operate effectively."", ""In conclusion, Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) demonstrates strong market positioning through its robust product portfolio, global presence, and commitment to R&D. However, the company must address weaknesses such as revenue volatility and operational risks to maintain its financial health. Opportunities for growth in emerging markets and advancements in biotechnology present promising avenues for expansion. Nevertheless, threats from intellectual property challenges and regulatory pressures require strategic management. Pfizer's forward-looking strategies, including its focus on oncology leadership and pipeline innovation, are poised to leverage its strengths and opportunities while mitigating its weaknesses and threats, ensuring its continued success in the pharmaceutical industry."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Also at the end of 2023, Moderna revealed new trial data that showed that combining its cancer vaccine with a standard treatment for melanoma significantly reduces the risk of death and recurrence of the most-deadly type of skin cancer. Along with another\xa0pharma giant Merck\xa0& Co Inc (NYSE: MRK), Moderna not only developed the\xa0mRNA-based cancer vaccine for melanoma, but also tested it in combination with Keytruda, an FDA-approved cancer treatment that Merck developed. Back in 2022, the trial showed that two years after the treatment, the combo lowered the high-risk patients’ risk of recurrence or death by 44% compared to treatment of Keytruda alone. Before 2023 ended, Merck and Moderna proudly confirmed these results, with the newest trial data showing even greater durability of their combined therapy. Three years after the treatment, patients who received the Moderna and Merck vaccine and immunotherapy drug were\xa049% less likely to experience recurrence or death compared to patients who were only treated with Keytruda. Moreover, the combo group was also 62% less likely to experience distant metastasis or death. Now, Moderna and Merck are also going beyond melanoma as they entered phase 3 trial to test their cancer vaccine in patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer.', 'As optimistic as these findings are, they refer to late-stages of the world’s deadliest disease.

Warner Brothers Discovery ESPN and Fox reaching an agreement for that joint sports streaming venture that we've been talking about leaving investors questioning the fate of pay TV. But there's a new report out from S&P Global saying that fears may be overblown."", ""Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal has the details for us. Ali, a little overblown, I guess, at this point?"", 'ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah--', '- From their perspective.', ""ALEXANDRA CANAL: From their perspective. And there's been a lot talk about what this skinny bundle means for the future of linear TV, especially because all of these companies, Warner Brothers, Discovery, Disney, Fox, they have a lot of exposure to linear networks. And that bundle does help fund a lot of those streaming initiatives."", ""So the fear here is that are we going to pull customers away from that pay TV bundle and could that impact profitability? Which is one of the reasons why we sometimes see the shares move lower on the heels of these streaming centric announcements. But S&P is arguing that these fears are overblown and that the joint venture, if it's priced correctly, could actually add pay TV customers. So it all comes down to pricing. If it's priced too high, it's not going to appeal to the cord cutters. If it's priced too low, that could potentially cannibalize existing pay TV users."", ""So S&P is anticipating a price point between 40 to 50 bucks. But it's important to remember that this is a skinny package of linear TV networks, and consumers will only have access to games and packages that these companies have the rights to."", ""So if you're a pay TV subscriber, you're likely a pay TV subscriber because of sports. You see the value in having access to the full slate of content. You probably aren't going to opt in for this skinny bundle because you want as much content as possible. If you're a cord cutter, you probably either don't care about sports or you just don't want to pay that high price point."", ""So I think there's an interesting argument here that it all comes down to what ultimately this is going to be priced at when you think about who this is going to attract the most. And there's a lot of unanswered questions here, not only with pricing but also with FTC, antitrust. Obviously, we have that Fubo lawsuit. So a lot of question marks and answers that these companies are going to have to ultimately come up with."", ""- Well, I have another question mark for you. What does this skinny bundle mean for Disney's flagship ESPN service as well? I mean, that's set to launch in 2025."", ""ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, I think it could potentially give Disney some really interesting insights into who the customer is, who wants to pay for an over-the-top sports streaming bundle? What the price point could potentially be, which is another reason why if it's priced too low, that could be a net negative for Disney because it potentially puts a ceiling, a cap on what that pricing could be."", 'But Disney could also see some interesting insights when it comes to marketing, when it comes to consumer demand. So this could be a pretty good test, I think, for Disney as it plans to launch that ESPN flagship service in 2025.', ""- And so Ali, it's going to be a test here for Disney. But also do you think it's a test, right? For the broader industry as well just in terms of how successful this is going to be, what it's going to do for future bundling, and really giving us a better idea of what the consumer at the end of the day is interested and willing to pay up for?"", 'ALEXANDRA CANAL: Absolutely. It all comes down to demand, right? Are customers going to be interested in something like this? And if they are, who is that target audience?', ""Then you think about the companies that are left out of the bundle. You have Paramount, you have NBC Universal. This could potentially hurt them in the long run because the assumption is that the ABC and Fox affiliates, they're going to get paid for being a part of this skinny bundle. So I think that's why we heard that one rumor, that one report that Peacock and Paramount Plus are potentially thinking about joining forces."", 'So this is going to lead to a lot of interesting moves among all of these companies and potentially more consolidation.']"

Many of these services are aimed at better monetizing some of PayPal's acquired properties, such as Venmo, and using artificial intelligence (AI) to make it a more complete platform."", ""During the earnings call, Chriss told investors that PayPal's new services are still nascent, and so management is not expecting them to make major contributions in their first year of availability."", ""Another way that transaction margin can improve is by accelerating branded checkout functionality. PayPal's presence in e-commerce is huge -- but the company has admitted to under investing in certain areas, which has come back to haunt them. By creating a more streamlined online experience that also offers in-demand features such as buy now, pay later (BNPL) or earning cash back, PayPal has a greenfield opportunity to reinvent itself."", ""Although offering merchants and consumers a more prolific payment platform is important to return to growth, the fact of the matter is that PayPal's competition is likely here to stay. This means that the company is going to need to do more as it plays catch-up. Like many of its tech cohorts, PayPal recently announced that it will be reducing headcount as the company right-sizes its expense profile."", ""In theory, the combination of higher transaction revenue and lower expenses should help the company dramatically improve its margin and profitability. The way I see PayPal, management has outlined a clear roadmap to get the company back on track. Now, it's all about execution. For this reason, I understand why management isn't calling for significant growth this year. 2024 represents the beginning of potentially longer-term growth across the top and bottom lines."", ""At a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 15.4, PayPal stock is clearly trading at a steep discount compared to its long-term average. I think a lot of investors have abandoned PayPal -- understandably so. The company's operating performance for the last year has been quite muted, and management's near-term outlook isn't exciting."", ""But long-term investors may see the potential here. The global e-commerce market will continue to grow thanks to online shopping, peer-to-peer payment apps, and more. PayPal is operating in a high-growth market, but as management pointed out, it's time to execute. The company has put down the foundation for the next phase of growth for PayPal. Only time will tell if these investments will pay off."", 'In the interim, investors interested in fintech have an opportunity to scoop up shares in PayPal stock at a historically cheap valuation. Now could be a unique opportunity to lower your cost basis or initiate a position before the long-term benefits fueled by AI and a growing digital payments market begin to take effect.', 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(NASDAQ:PYPL) remains in the shadow of its former glory. After peaking at record highs of $310 a share at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021, the stock has come tumbling down.', ""The company has seen its market value fall by 80% over the past three years, compared to a 16% gain for the S&P 500. The payment technology company's stock fell 22% last year, underperforming the overall financial services sector, which benefited from an uptick in interest rates."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with PYPL.', 'The underperformance can be attributed, among other things, to investors reacting to underwhelming margins in recent quarters. Eroding market share in the high-value core branded checkout business has also significantly dragged margins and stock sentiments into the market.', 'PayPal was one of the beneficiaries as millions of people locked down at the height of the pandemic rushed online to do shopping. The coronavirus-driven shift to online shopping and digital transactions drove record payment volumes, adding about 50 million active users in 2021.', ""Likewise, the company registered its strongest-ever annual performance in 2020 as it processed over 900 billion in payments. That is no longer the case, as an end to pandemic restrictions has seen a significant shift in consumer shopping patterns. Traffic to brick-and-mortar stores has rebounded, translating to reduced payments that people make on e-commerce platforms through the company's offerings."", ""Additionally, the company's unbranded businesses, led by payment processing, have remained resilient. However, the same cannot be said about branded businesses led by Venmo that face intense competition from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), among others. A shift in the company's payment volume into lower-margin channels is also a serious concern."", ""While PayPal remains a leader in digital payments, its long-term outlook remains threatened as tech juggernauts look to encroach on its niche market. Apple and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) are the two tech heavyweights that threaten to disrupt the company's fortunes on mobile payments, which continues to send jitters throughout the investment community."", ""Following the past year's underperformance, CEO Alex Chriss has set outlined a strategic plan to make the company leaner as one of the ways to fuel profitable growth. Nevertheless, he has warned that it could take some time before some of the initiatives bear fruit and move the needle, as depicted by the company's flat growth forecast on adjusted profit for the current year."", 'Even though the company delivered solid fourth-quarter results, the stock fell by almost 10% as the market reacted to 2024 guidance. The full-year outlook further underlined the problems the fintech giant faces even as it strives to chart a new path.', 'Revenue increased 9% to $8 billion for the quarter, beating consensus estimates of $7.33 billion. The increase came as the company recorded a 15% increase in total payment volume, which peaked at $409.80 billion.', 'Source: PayPal', 'The bottom line came in better than expected at $1.48 a share, representing a 19% year-over-year increase and was better than consensus estimates of $1.27. Even though the company delivered earnings growth in the fourth quarter, it is no longer growing at the high rates it did at the height of the pandemic.', 'Nevertheless, a 2% decline in active accounts to 426 million underlines weakness in the underlying business as PayPal faces stiff competition on digital payments. It marked the fourth consecutive quarter of account losses for the company, signaling the impact of other digital payment services.', 'Growth is mainly fueled by the unbranded business units that handle transactions with merchants that come with low profit margins. While the total payment volume in unbranded business units grew by 30% year over year, the company generated less earnings.', 'The branded segment is the bread and butter of the entire business, as fees range between 2.49% and 3.49%. The low payment costs at stake also translate to high margins. The higher rates generated by the branded business units are reasonable as they generate additional revenue for the same business. According to Craig Maurer of Financial Technology Partners, PayPal needs to generate about $10 of unbranded checkout volume to generate the same margin dollar as $1 volume with branded payments.', 'Source: PayPal', 'Additionally, Venmo boasts a robust network of more than 35 million merchants. The platform, which allows people to send and receive money through peer-to-peer technology, has started allowing users to hold money in their accounts. The decision is expected to positively impact the total payment volume that the service handles, which has been increasing since 2017.', 'The increase can be attributed to Venmo allowing people to send money online for free. The service has since become a hit with people who do not carry cash, like students and teens. The service makes money through a 2.90% transaction fee for businesses and a 1% fee for users who want to withdraw money installed into a linked card.', 'Source: Statista', ""Nevertheless, a shift in growth drivers to less lucrative operations could put more pressure on the company's operating margin. During the earnings call, PayPal told analysts it expects flat transaction margin dollars in 2024 relative to last year."", 'If profit margins are to improve, PayPal will have to earn more whenever customers click on its branded services, such as the Venmo button, to make payments. The branded checkout payment volume was up by 6.50% in the fourth quarter. Compared to the unbranded business unit, the much-subdued growth can be attributed to stiff competition from offerings by Apple Pay, Google Pay, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).', ""Further indication that a decline in business accounts is a concern is the company's disappointing full-year guidance. The guidance has overshadowed the market-beating earnings, signaling the company might have to tweak its operations to bounce to high growth levels."", 'Like any innovative fintech company, PayPal is already looking to address the issues that have triggered a significant contraction in its operating margins. It is also trying to address its competitive threat as tech giants push for market share in the lucrative digital payments landscape.', 'The new management seeks to turn the company into a leaner entity pursuing profitable growth. The plan is already underway, with the company announcing plans to cut about 2,500 jobs, or 9% of its global workforce, as part of a plan that targets up to $900 million in cost savings that should significantly impact its operating margin.', 'The results of the restructuring are already visible, with the operating income margin in the fourth quarter improving to 23.30%. If inflation continues to drop, consumer spending is expected to improve, increasing the total payment volume it handles and boosting income margins.', 'The layoffs come as the company seeks to focus more on efficiency and deploy automation. The digital technology company is also consolidating its technology as it looks to reduce complexity and duplication, which should reduce its labor force costs and strengthen profit margins. Amidst the cut, the company will continue to invest in areas likely to create and accelerate growth.', 'Consequently, the digital payment company has affirmed its push into artificial intelligence as it looks to unveil new products and solutions capable of enhancing efficiency and competitive edge. One of the new AI-powered features the company is launching will help ensure a faster checkout experience. It is also making it possible for customers to enjoy AI-powered merchant recommendations.', 'In addition to the AI push, regulatory winds are blowing in favor of PayPal. Amid regulatory pressure, Apple has agreed to open the tap-to-pay functionality to third parties. The move opens the door for PayPal to be one of the tap-to-pay applications on iOS devices.', 'Consequently, the company is working on a new consumer app to exploit the new EU regulation. Integrating PayPal services into Apple Wallet should translate into big business for the company in terms of payments and transactions through iOS devices.', 'PayPal is also aggressively offloading its credit risk as it looks to free up more cash that can be used to return cash to shareholders. The signing of a deal with private equity firm KKR (NYSE:KKR) to purchase up to $43 billion of the buy-now-pay-later loans (BNPL) in Europe is part of the strategic plan to bolster cash reserves.', ""BNPL was a hit at the height of the pandemic as it allowed the payment giant to attract millennial and gen Z consumers to its platform. Nevertheless, their fortunes have turned sour in recent years, especially with rising interest rates and runaway inflation dampening customers' purchasing power."", 'The closing of the BNPL deal with KKR is expected to free up close to $1 billion, which PayPal will redirect to share buybacks. In addition, given the uncertainty about whether customers will clear the loans, the KKR deal removes an element of risk from its books.', ""While PayPal has underperformed over the past year, going by the 22% slide, it is not necessarily on the wrong track. Total payment volume, a key metric in the payment sector, is growing at an impressive double-digit rate, which underlines the company's core business that is growing at a solid pace. In addition, the company continues to deliver operating income margin improvements, signaling its cost-cutting initiatives are bearing fruit."", 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is a leader in both of them.', ""The company's recent launch of its Gemini AI model proves that it won't be left behind in the AI race. Gemini Ultra beat the top AI models available (including GPT-4) on 30 of 32 key benchmarks. It's also the first AI system to outperform human experts on the MMLU (massive multitask language understanding) test, which includes 57 subjects."", ""I fully expect future versions of Gemini will be even more powerful. That's great news for Google Cloud, as more customers move their apps and data to the cloud to harness the power of AI."", 'Quantum computing still has a long way to go. However, Alphabet has achieved two key milestones. The company thinks it could realistically develop a functional commercial quantum computer within the next decade.', ""In the meantime, Alphabet is highly profitable with a huge cash stockpile. The company dominates multiple markets, including search. Its valuation also isn't as ridiculously high as many other top AI stocks. Alphabet's shares are trading at less than 21x forward earnings."", 'You might be surprised to see PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) on this list. The fintech stock has been a big loser in recent years and is down more than 20% over the last 12 months.', ""But this steep sell-off has caused PayPal's shares to become dirt cheap. The stock trades at a forward earnings multiple of less than 11.6x. Is PayPal a value trap? I don't think so."", ""The company's business continues to perform relatively well, even though growth isn't as impressive as in the past. PayPal's revenue jumped 9% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023 and adjusted earnings per share soared 19%."", ""PayPal's Braintree payments platform, which processes credit cards, debit cards, and more, is an especially important growth driver. The company also has solid growth opportunities with its Venmo peer-to-peer payment offering."", ""Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) is arguably one of the most resilient stocks on the market. The big-biotech's shares jumped in 2022 when the overall market plunged and last year, when the market was booming. Over the last 12 months, Vertex's share price has more than doubled."", 'I expect those winning ways to continue. Vertex recently won U.S. and U.K. approvals for Casgevy in treating sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. The gene-editing therapy is effectively a cure for the two rare genetic diseases. Casgevy looks like a sure-fire megablockbuster.', ""Vertex expects to file for regulatory approvals for two other drugs this summer. VX-548 has significant potential as a non-opioid treatment for acute pain. The company's vanzacaftor triple-drug combo could be its most powerful and most profitable cystic fibrosis (CF) therapy yet."", 'Speaking of CF, Vertex still has plenty of growth opportunities in this market. The company continues to push for label expansions of its already-approved therapies to treat younger children and secure additional reimbursements.', 'More game-changing therapies could be on the way. Vertex is advancing inaxaplin into late-stage testing as a treatment for APOL1-mediated kidney disease (AMKS). There are currently no approved drugs that treat the underlying cause of AMKD, and the disease affects more patients than CF does worldwide.

The stock recently eclipsed its former all-time high and has been benefitting from a resurgence in the financial sector.

TW stock is displaying relative strength as buying pressure accumulates in this market leader.', 'The company is part of the Zacks Financial – Investment Bank industry group, which currently ranks in the top 12% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months.', 'Historical research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock’s price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. In fact, the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

The fact that NEM stock is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups provides yet another headwind to a long list of concerns. A history of earnings misses and falling future earnings estimates will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock’s downtrend.', 'Highlighted underperformance bodes well for the bears.

220,528a1b40-0f71-334d-a442-16c6d582dc21,MPC,2024-02-23,Is Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) Using Too Much Debt?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marathon-petroleum-nyse-mpc-using-120020254.html,1708689620,STORY,['MPC'],"[""Legendary fund manager Li Lu (who Charlie Munger backed) once said, 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. As with many other companies Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) makes use of debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?"", ""Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together."", ' View our latest analysis for Marathon Petroleum ', 'As you can see below, at the end of September 2023, Marathon Petroleum had US$28.6b of debt, up from US$26.2b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. However, it also had US$13.1b in cash, and so its net debt is US$15.5b.', 'According to the last reported balance sheet, Marathon Petroleum had liabilities of US$21.7b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$35.4b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$13.1b in cash and US$12.5b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$31.6b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.', ""Marathon Petroleum has a very large market capitalization of US$61.1b, so it could very likely raise cash to ameliorate its balance sheet, if the need arose. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution."", 'We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.', ""Marathon Petroleum's net debt is only 0.92 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 25.8 times over. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. It is just as well that Marathon Petroleum's load is not too heavy, because its EBIT was down 31% over the last year. When it comes to paying off debt, falling earnings are no more useful than sugary sodas are for your health. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Marathon Petroleum can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting."", ""But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Marathon Petroleum generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 87% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt."", ""Based on what we've seen Marathon Petroleum is not finding it easy, given its EBIT growth rate, but the other factors we considered give us cause to be optimistic. There's no doubt that its ability to to cover its interest expense with its EBIT is pretty flash. When we consider all the factors mentioned above, we do feel a bit cautious about Marathon Petroleum's use of debt. While we appreciate debt can enhance returns on equity, we'd suggest that shareholders keep close watch on its debt levels, lest they increase. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Marathon Petroleum (1 is significant!) that you should be aware of before investing here."", ""Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today."", 'Have feedback on this article?

Encouragingly, first quarter bookings improved sequentially, growing our confidence that inventory related headwinds will largely subside this quarter. That said, the macro situation remains challenging, and the shape and timing of a second half recovery will be governed by underlying demand. Importantly, the strength of our balance sheet, operational agility, and prudent capital management are serving as well during this downturn. We've invested heavily in R&D, customer engagement, activity and manufacturing resiliency, fueling our future growth, even as we maintain the industry leading profitability that supports our practice of robust capital returns."", ""To that end, I'm pleased to highlight that we announced the 7% dividend increase yesterday, making 2024 the 20th consecutive year of higher dividends for shareholders. Now, digging a little deeper into our investment philosophy, we continue to focus on anticipating our customers’ future needs. And what's becoming a software-defined AI-driven world leveraging pervasive sensing, Edge computing and ubiquitous connectivity. The technological complexity facing our customers is compounded by their need to deliver solutions that are both secure and extremely power efficient. So let me share a little more now about how we are strategically allocating our capital to deliver more solutions value to our customers, and further support their confidence in the long-term supply assurance?"", ""Since our acquisition of Maxim, we've increased our engineering population by around 10% complementing our world class Analog talent, with increasing levels of digital software, AI, and systems expertise. This breadth of engineering gives ADI the capabilities to tackle more of our customers' challenges, and grow our sell-in across markets. In addition, as our engineers increasingly work shoulder to shoulder with our customers to co-architect their solutions, we further deepen our understanding of their technological and market complexities. This strengthens our ability to deliver increasingly stronger innovation from components to physical Edge systems. And I'd like to share now a few examples of what I mean. For example, in the industrial sector, digital transformation is driving investment in Edge-based connectivity and control platforms that enable secure power efficient monitoring and control of automation systems."", ""Last month, Honeywell announced it will use ADI's Deterministic Ethernet and software-configurable IO solutions across their factory automation and building management offerings. Our portfolio enables customers to securely deliver end-to-end signal integrity between the Edge and the cloud in a power efficient and highly flexible platform configuration. This system approach enables us to capture three times more value, and we expect additional design wins due to high customer interest globally. In the automotive sector, we've aligned our business to the second are trends of electrification, advanced safety systems, and immersive digital in-cabin experience. For example, our Gigabit Multimedia Serial Link or GMSL Solution continues to gain broader adoption, as customers seek to extend high performance data and video capabilities across their fleets."", 'We’ve recently increased our share at a top three global auto manufacturer extending our position across all their brands and quintupling our GMSL opportunity at that customer. In datacenters, AI and machine learning computing systems require orders of magnitude more processing and thus energy, compared to traditional workloads. Our portfolio of high-performance power and protection solutions, specifically designed for vertical power delivery is helping customers re-architect their datacenter systems to improve power delivery and system performance. Last quarter, we secured a significant design win from a large hyperscale customer for our multiphase vertical power solution that reduces power losses by 35% when compared to conventional ones.', ""In Healthcare, this market continues to digitalize to enable more predictive and preventative treatment regimens. ADI has been on the forefront of this transition, and I'm pleased to let you know that we've recently received FDA clearance for a non-invasive remote monitoring platform, that enables home-based management of chronic diseases such as congestive heart failure. This solution leverages our deep domain expertise, leading-edge capabilities across signal processing and sensor modalities, and unique algorithms that enable medical providers to act early, precisely and effectively. As a platform, this also allows us in the future to use our data-driven AI algorithms to make this even more personalized. This advance unlocks a new growth vector for ADI, adding more than $5 billion of new sell-in."", ""Switching now to the evolution of our supply chain, I'd like to share some of our progress in manufacturing resilience, which is a growing priority for our customers. Over the last two years, we've invested record levels of CapEx to expand our capacity and to enhance resiliency. Now with line of sight to achieving our goal of doubling front and back-end internal capacity in 2025 and will begin to significantly reduce our capital spend. Notably, approximately 10% of our investments have been focused on implementing more efficient systems that will deliver sustainability benefits, including greatly reducing input resources and emissions, which, overtime, will also lower our operating costs. These investments enable a more flexible hybrid manufacturing model and will increase our swing capacity to around 70% of revenue in the coming years."", ""This unique ability helps to capture the upside in strong demand backdrops and better protect our gross margins during more challenging times. Complementing these organic investments, we also extended our foundry partnership with TSMC to secure additional 300-millimeter fine-pitch technology capacity at their Japan subsidiary. Our investments, combined with the support of our foundry partners will enable us to manufacture our products in multiple geographic locations, enhancing our resiliency and giving our customers greater optionality and assurance over their supply chains. So in closing, as always, we're keeping one eye on the present and one eye on the future. I have confidence in the steps that we're taking to preserve our capital and navigate the near term challenges while ensuring that we make the necessary investments to increase our competitiveness and accelerate our business in the future."", ""And so with that, I'd like to pass the microphone over to Rich."", ""Richard Puccio : Thank you, Vince. And let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. I'm excited to have joined ADI and look forward to helping the company navigate the near term while ensuring we are well positioned to capitalize on the tremendous opportunities ahead of us. Despite continued challenging business conditions, we achieved first quarter revenue, which was slightly above the midpoint of our outlook or down 8% sequentially and 23% year-over-year. Industrial represented 48% of revenue in the quarter, down 12% sequentially and 31% year-over-year. As expected, we experienced broad-based weakness as customers continue to work down their inventory levels. Automotive, which represented 29% of revenue, was up 2% sequentially and 9% versus the year ago period, representing 14 consecutive quarters of growth."", 'Notably our leading connectivity and functionally safe power solutions collectively increased double digits year-over-year. Communications, which represented 12% of revenue, declined 10% sequentially and 37% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, wireline fared relatively well driven by AI-related demand, while wireless decreased as global investments in 5G remain depressed. And lastly, consumer represented 11% of revenue, down 7% sequentially and 22% year-over-year driven by continued sluggish end demand across applications. Now on to the rest of the P&L. First quarter gross margin was 69%, down sequentially and year-over-year, driven by unfavorable mix lower revenue and lower utilization. OpEx in the quarter was $679 million, down 2% sequentially despite the extra week, driven by lower variable comp, disciplined discretionary spend and structural cost improvement.', 'As a result, operating margin of 42% finished near the high end of our outlook. Non-operating expenses finished at $75 million, and the tax rate for the quarter was 11.8%. All told, EPS was $1.73, slightly above the guided midpoint. Now on to the balance sheet. Cash and equivalents increased more than $340 million sequentially and ended the quarter at $1.3 billion. Our net leverage ratio remained below 1. Inventory decreased nearly $90 million sequentially, driven primarily by finished goods, while days increased to 201 due to lower revenue. Channel inventory dollars declined again in 1Q with weeks of inventory finishing slightly above our target range of seven to eight weeks. Moving on to cash flow items. Over the trailing 12 months, operating cash flow and CapEx were $4.6 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.', 'We continue to expect fiscal 2024 CapEx to be approximately $700 million. As a reminder, these are gross CapEx figures, not including any of the anticipated benefits from both the U.S. and European Chips Act. Over the last 12 months, we generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow or 28% of revenue. During the same time period, we have returned more than $4.2 billion through dividends and share repurchases. And since our Maxim acquisition, we have returned nearly $12 billion or more than 130% of free cash flow to shareholders, reducing share count by 8% while also increasing our dividend per share by 33%, including our most recently announced 7% increase. As a reminder, we target 100% free cash flow return over the long term. We aim to use 40% to 60% to grow our dividend annually with the remaining free cash flow used for share count reduction.', ""Now moving on to guidance. Second quarter revenue is expected to be $2.1 billion, plus or minus $100 million, once again, we expect sell through to be higher than sell-in. At the midpoint, we expect all end markets to decline sequentially with the largest decline in industrial as we continue to meaningfully reduce channel inventory. Operating margin is expected to be 37%, plus or minus 100 basis points. This includes the impact of unfavorable mix and lower utilization as we further reduce balance sheet inventory. Our tax rate is expected to be 11% to 13%. And based on these inputs, EPS is expected to be $1.26 plus or minus $0.10. In closing, the actions we've taken to protect profitability in the near term as well as the natural shock absorbers embedded in ADI have enabled us to maintain strong profitability even as our quarterly revenue has fallen significantly from its peak."", 'Importantly, with the strength of our financial profile and the growing importance of our technology, we will continue to invest confidently in our future, regardless of where we are in the cycle. I will now give it back to Mike for Q&A.', 'Michael Lucarelli : Thanks, Rich, and welcome to the call. Let’s get into our Q&A session.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because SBA Communications is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for SBAC in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $3.33 per share for SBAC, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.32 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for SBAC, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.26% heading into earnings season.', 'SBA Communications Corporation price-eps-surprise | SBA Communications Corporation Quote', 'A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.', 'Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Visa (NYSE:V). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Visa ', ""If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Shareholders will be happy to know that Visa's EPS has grown 22% each year, compound, over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming."", ""Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Visa maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 10% to US$33b. That's a real positive."", ""You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart."", ""You don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Visa's future profits."", ""Since Visa has a market capitalisation of US$556b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$262m. We note that this amounts to 0.05% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Visa but it's still worth mentioning. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors."", ""For growth investors, Visa's raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Visa's continuing strength. The growth and insider confidence is looked upon well and so it's worthwhile to investigate further with a view to discern the stock's true value. Of course, identifying quality businesses is only half the battle; investors need to know whether the stock is undervalued.

Americans spending money essentially makes the world's economy go round."", 'All that money must flow on networks connecting consumers, merchants, and banks, which many call the payments industry. Just a tiny trio dominates this space. Approximately 96% of U.S. debit and credit card payments ran on just three networks in 2022, according to research by The Motley Fool.', 'As you might imagine, the companies behind the networks have been stellar investments for years.', 'The best part? They are poised for more success; you can buy and hold stock in all three for under $1,000.', ""Visa (NYSE: V) is the largest payment network in the United States and the world (excluding China). Approximately 71% of America's debit and prepaid card purchase volume ran on Visa's payment network in 2022, and just over half of credit card volume. Visa is like a toll booth charging a fee, a percentage of each transaction, to access its network."", ""When you swipe your Visa card, data runs back and forth between the point of sale and whatever financial institution is holding your money. The network authenticates and approves the transaction, which is why you see your card was approved at the payment terminal. Visa's network is established, so it doesn't need much constant investment. As people ditch cash over time, growing payment volume creates enormous profits for Visa."", 'The company generates $19 billion in free cash flow on $33 billion in revenue, an impressive 57% conversion rate. Management is using its billions in cash to repurchase shares and grow its dividend. Analysts believe Visa will continue growing earnings at an annual average of 15%, making the stock a no-brainer buy and forever hold for as long as it maintains its dominance in the industry.', ""Despite Visa's dominance, the payments industry is so large that Mastercard (NYSE: MA) has done remarkably well as the industry's runner-up. Mastercard powers roughly 29% and 24% of U.S. debit and credit transactions. It's also a global payments network with an estimated 28% market share, second to Visa's 47%."", ""Frankly, Mastercard and Visa are nearly identical businesses. Of course, they partner with different card issuers, but Mastercard has a solid footing in payments, and its business is similarly lucrative. Mastercard generates nearly $11 billion in cash flow on $25 billion in revenue. One key difference between Visa, Mastercard, and the next company is that the first two are dedicated payment networks. They don't directly issue cards or lend money."", ""Mastercard follows the same formula with its vast cash flow streams -- share repurchases steadily lower outstanding shares and support earnings growth. Analysts believe Mastercard's earnings could grow by an annual average of 18% moving forward. That should translate to more robust dividend growth. Mastercard's dividend has grown by an average of 20% annually, increasing five-fold over the past decade. And yet the payout still only uses up about a fifth of Mastercard's cash flow today."", ""The story changes a bit with American Express (NYSE: AXP). It's both a payment network and a bank, meaning it's issuing payment cards and lending the money when consumers rack up debt on their credit cards. It's a smaller network but still owns about 13% of America's credit card market and has a single-digit percentage of the global market. Famous investor Warren Buffett has owned the stock as a top holding for decades within his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway."", ""American Express carries credit risk in its business as a lender, which investors should consider when buying the stock. However, American Express has been in business since the mid-1800s, navigating various economic storms throughout American history, so investors can feel good about the company's durability."", ""Importantly, management has noted in recent earnings calls that millennial and Generation Z consumers are its fastest-growing customer demographics, which bodes well for American Express' long-term future as a fixture in the consumer-spending landscape. Analysts believe earnings will compound at 14%."", 'These companies dominate U.S. payments, which establishes powerful network effects. In other words, merchants have little reason to use different networks because these three are accepted virtually everywhere.', 'Market share dynamics between them could always change, but investors could easily buy and hold all three and ride the years-long shift away from cash payments. In 2015, roughly 24% of U.S. consumers stated they no longer use cash, according to a study by Pew Research Center. By 2022, that percentage had grown to 41%.', 'The long-term trend is clear: These three companies will likely continue performing well as consumers move away from paying with paper currency.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

Looking back at history, it's evident that dividend-paying stocks have often outperformed other types of investments. Opting for dividend stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) can be particularly advantageous. This index comprises numerous dividend-paying stocks, notably blue-chip companies renowned for their consistent dividend increases. In 2023, the DJIA saw a significant increase of 14%, with 19 component stocks experiencing gains while 11 component stocks faced declines over the course of the year. Towards the end of the year, in December, the index reached a record-breaking high, surpassing the $37,000 mark."", 'Apart from delivering robust returns over the years, dividends have also maintained their significance as a growing component of personal income. As per a report from S&P Dow Jones Indices, the proportion of personal income attributed to dividend earnings has consistently risen over time, underscoring their importance as a source of income. In 2012, dividend income accounted for 5.64% of per capita personal income in the U.S., compared to 4.39% in the previous decade and 3.51% two decades prior. Conversely, during this same period, interest income from capital markets has steadily declined, dropping to 7.39% in 2012 from 13.51% in 1992. According to the report, the total dividend income, adjusted for inflation to $2000, experienced a substantial rise from $187.6 billion in 1992 to $757 billion in 2012, marking an impressive growth of over 300%. In contrast, interest income grew by less than 100% over the same period.', ""When investors consider dividend stocks for their portfolios, they often prioritize dividend yields. However, it's important to note that companies offering high yields but lacking solid financial stability could face the risk of reducing dividends, especially amidst global economic uncertainties and increasing interest rates. Therefore, investment strategies aimed at high yields should also prioritize the quality and stability of the companies in question. The Dow Jones Dividend 100 Index Series tracks the performance of 100 high-dividend-yielding stocks within each covered market, chosen for their consistent dividend payments and strong fundamental strength. When utilizing any income strategy, market participants typically prioritize both yield and capital gain. The Dow Jones Dividend 100 Indices have demonstrated superior yields and comparable capital gains over the long term when compared to their respective benchmarks. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, for the period spanning from June 30, 2001, to June 30, 2023, the total return of the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index, which assumes theoretical reinvestment of dividends, averaged 11.7% annually.

(NYSE:VZ) Looks Like A Quality Company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-verizon-communications-inc-nyse-130012948.html,1708693212,STORY,['VZ'],"[""While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)."", ""ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits."", ' See our latest analysis for Verizon Communications ', 'ROE can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Verizon Communications is:', '13% = US$12b ÷ US$94b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.13."", 'One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Verizon Communications has a superior ROE than the average (7.2%) in the Telecom industry.', ""That's what we like to see. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 4 risks we have identified for Verizon Communications."", ""Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking."", 'Verizon Communications clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.62. While its ROE is pretty respectable, the amount of debt the company is carrying currently is not ideal. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.', 'Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.', ""Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company."", 'Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

With that said, I'll turn the call over to Bill. Bill?"", 'William Smith', ""Thanks, Charlie. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for our 2023 fourth quarter and year end conference call. We appreciate your interest reflecting on last year. We certainly face challenges, which initiated several decisive changes to build a new path forward for the Company. And I have I believe we have found that path the termination of a large customer contract earlier in the year came as a surprise, causing us to quickly pivot and implement necessary changes to better align our resources. It was a large undertaking and difficult task, but I am proud how our team worked collectively to rise to the occasion and accomplish several critical objectives that we absolutely needed to achieve. Despite this challenge, the most impactful of those achievements was the successful launch of AT&T's secure family on the SafePath platform, while there were some challenges along the way, we got it across the finish line and now have a fantastic opportunity to still significantly expand subscriber growth in fiscal 2024. With the migration efforts finished, we now have the flexibility to further develop and expand our roadmap delivering meaningful innovative enhancements to the SafePath platform that will launch this year, which way which I expect to broaden our market reach and enable us to add new revenue streams. I will cover several of these enhancements in more detail later in the call. But one innovation where I do want to add a bit of color now is safety as well as you may have seen in our earlier press release announcing SAFE NFOS. It will bring yet another new market opportunity to Smith Micro by delivering a unique solution to our M&O partners that build on their strong relationships with handset manufacturers. Safepath OS. is a pure software solution that will allow our partners to promote a safe and secure CHARLES phone or tablet. This product will be fully functional and up right out-of-the-box with preloaded software, preconfigured for Android devices to control the functionality of the phone itself to set digital parameters for safe use by the child. This new initiative for kids devices will deliver substantial flexibility to our partners for new go-to-market strategies. In addition, SafePath OS. will provide enhanced capability for parents and guardians to adjust features and functionality as their children enter new age groups, allowing them to grow through their digital journey. This is just one of the new initiatives underway for Smith Micro as we enter 2020 for full speed ahead, our core vision continues to be the creation of safe and healthy digital experiences for families, all allowing operators around the world to add new lines to family accounts, enabling them to build closer and more valuable relationships with their subscribers over time. Now let's turn the call over to Jim for more detail on the financial results. Jim?"", 'James Kempton', ""Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll now be covering the financial details of the fourth quarter and full year 2023. For the fourth quarter, we posted revenue of $8.6 million compared to $11.4 million for the same quarter of 2022, a decrease of approximately 25%, primarily attributable to a decline in Family Safety revenues period over period. As anticipated when compared to the third quarter of 2023, revenue decreased by $2.4 million or 22%, primarily as a result of the conclusion of the Verizon Family Safety post termination transition period with no revenue recognized in December 2023 related to this contract. Revenues for 2023 were approximately $40.9 million versus $48.5 million produced last year. The approximate $7.6 million decrease was primarily due to a decline in legacy Safe & Found Family Safety revenue related to the continued attrition of legacy Sprint subscribers driven by T-Mobile's acquisition of Sprint and the conclusion of the Verizon contract, coupled with the decline in CommSuite revenues. During the fourth quarter of 2023, Family Safety revenue decreased by approximately $2.1 million or 22% compared to the fourth quarter of prior year, primarily due to the decline in Verizon Family Safety revenues in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the post-termination transition period for that contract concluded and the continued decline in legacy Sprint Safe & Found revenues. Family Safety revenues decreased by approximately $1.7 million or 18% compared to the third quarter of 2023. During the fourth quarter of 2023, CommSuite revenue was $500,000, which decreased by approximately $400,000 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. This decrease is attributable to a decline in DISH revenue, coupled with a period-over-period decline in revenue generated from the legacy Sprint deployment, which generated no CommSuite revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023. Revenue from comps will decrease by approximately $200,000 compared to the third quarter of 2023. I want to note that in December, we were able to expand our premium Visual Voicemail offering more broadly across the Dish Network and did see an increase in subscribers in that offering post expansion. We are expecting a further expansion of the PVVM offering across the DISH Network in the first half of 2024, which we anticipate will yield additional growth in subscribers. ViewSpot revenue was approximately $600,000 for the fourth quarter of 2023, which declined by approximately $300,000 compared to the fourth quarter of prior year and decreased by approximately $0.5 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. The decline in ViewSpot revenues was in line with our expectations. In the first quarter of 2024, we are expecting consolidated revenues to decrease by 32% to 36% or $2.7 million to $3.1 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, driven primarily by no further Verizon Family Safety revenues being recognized in the first quarter as the post termination transition period for that contract concluded in the fourth quarter of 2023. For the fourth quarter of 2023, gross profit was $6.4 million compared to $8.1 million during the same period of the prior year, a decrease of approximately $1.7 million. While gross profit declined for the fourth quarter of '23 versus the same period of 2022, gross margin was higher at 74.9% for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to 70.8% realized in the fourth quarter of 2022. Gross profit of $6.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased sequentially by approximately $2 million compared to the gross profit produced in the third quarter of 2023, driven primarily by the sequential decline in revenues quarter over quarter. In the first quarter of 2024 we expect gross margins to be in the range of 64% to 68%. For the year-to-date period ended December 31, 2023, gross profit was $30.3 million compared to $34.3 million during 2022. Gross margin was 74.2% for the year ended December 31, 2023 versus a gross margin of 70.7% produced in 2022, an improvement of approximately 350 basis points. GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $12.1 million, a decrease of $3.1 million or 20% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. GAAP operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $48.4 million, a decrease of $16.9 million or 26% compared to the prior year. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $8 million compared to $11.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, a decrease of approximately $3.8 million or 32%. Sequentially, non-gaap operating expenses increased by approximately $200,000 or 3% from the third quarter of 2023 we expect first quarter 4 non-GAAP operating expenses to increase by 1% to 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, partially attributable to an increase in marketing and event activities, including Mobile World Congress, our largest tradeshow event of the year. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $35.3 million, a decrease of $16.2 million or 31% compared to last year. Gaap net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $6.7 million or $0.09 loss per share compared to a GAAP net loss of $8 million or $0.14 loss per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Gaap net loss for 2023 was $24.4 million or $0.38 loss per share compared to a GAAP net loss of $29.3 million or $0.53 loss per share in 2022. Non-gaap net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1.7 million or $0.02 loss per share compared to a non-GAAP net loss of approximately $4 million or $0.07 loss per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. The non-GAAP net loss for 2023 was $5.3 million or an $0.08 loss per share compared to a non-GAAP net loss of approximately $17.6 million or a $0.32 loss per share in 2022. Within today's press release, we have provided a reconciliation of our non-GAAP metrics to the most comparable GAAP metric. For the fourth quarter of 2023, the reconciliation includes adjustments for intangible asset amortization of $2.4 million, stock compensation expense of $1.5 million noted stock offering amortization of $600,000, changes to derivatives and warrants of $300,000 costs related to severance and reorganization activities of approximately $100,000 and depreciation of approximately $100,000. For the year to date period, the non GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation include adjustments for intangible asset amortization of $6.8 million, stock compensation expense of $4.8 million note and stop offering amortization of $6 million, changes to derivatives awards of approximately $200,000. Depreciation of approximately $600,000 and costs related to severance and reorganization activities of approximately $1.1 million. Due to our cumulative net losses over the past few years, our GAAP tax expense is primarily due to certain state and foreign income taxes. For non-GAAP purposes, we utilize a 0% tax rate for 2023 and 2022. The resulting non-GAAP tax expense reflects the actual income taxes expense during each period. From a balance sheet perspective, we reported $7.1 million of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023. During the fourth quarter, use of cash and operating activities amounted to $1 million. I would also note that at the end of 2023, our senior secured convertible notes were retired at maturity. This concludes my financial review. Now back to Bill."", 'William Smith', ""Thanks, Jim. Okay. I want to get back to the first quarter guidance that Jim provided. But first, let me start out by addressing the preliminary proxy statement that we filed earlier today. It relates to a special shareholder meeting to give our Board the discretion to effectuate a reverse stock split as we described in the preliminary proxy statement. There are several reasons why we feel that this is the prudent approach for the Company at this point, but our primary goal with the reverse stock split is to increase the per share market price of our common stock to the NASDAQ's minimum bid price requirement. Given the current price of the stock, as we have been trading under $1 since last earnings call, we expect this action would sufficiently increase our share price to help us regain compliance. Additionally, we believe it will create increased flexibility, which we believe positions the Company to be opportunistic on any strategic opportunities that we identify, including M&A. We feel strongly that this approach is the appropriate go-forward strategy for the Company and our shareholders to ensure the long-term success of the Company. Now let me circle back to our guidance for the first quarter. We indicated for some time now that the first quarter will be challenging as the Verizon Family Safety revenue will no longer be contributing to our revenue during 2024. Wickes reacted quickly to the termination of the contract last year, and significantly adjusted our cost structure. In anticipation of this decline in revenues, we are focused on efforts to grow our revenues to fill the gap, including through the expansion of our SafePath product portfolio to drive growth, selling our solutions to additional MNOs and MVNOs and working to grow subscriber bases with our existing customers. I'll cover the expansion of both our customer and product portfolio shortly, providing a bit more color on our contract win with a major Tier one carrier in Europe that we announced in December. But first, I wanted to address our efforts with our current customers in a little bit more detail with regard to AT&T, as we previously announced, we have successfully launched AT & T's first family on the SafePath platform and are winding down the legacy of us type four since launch. We have released new updates to continue to improve the product and expanded our addressable market with the launch of AT & T's secure family to subscribers of cricket owned by AT&T. We are currently partnering with AT&T for the next phase of marketing activities, including the launch of new initiatives that build on awareness programs, digital campaigns and maximizing the unique sales channels that AT&T has today. Experience has shown us that it sometimes takes longer to get things rolling with large carrier customers, but we believe we've turned the corner on the marketing front, a big step in the progress progress of the continued rollout of AT & T's secure family. We see the excitement building at AT&T and believe there is a significant opportunity to drive new subscriber growth as we look to the remainder of the year. On the T-Mobile front, since the last call, we've released updates to fairly move to continue to enhance subscriber satisfaction. In addition, we're collaborating with the T-Mobile team exploring new ways to expand our overall reach. I would characterize our relationship as solid and we continue working to identify areas where we can expand the subscriber base at DISH, we have continued to enhance CommSuite and meet the needs for Android-based Visual Voicemail service. We enjoy a very strong relationship with DISH, and we believe that our business case with DISH wireless will continue to expand throughout 2024 as they grow their business and we expand our reach. Turning to the European market, we were pleased to announce the new contract in Europe in the fourth quarter, in line with the expectations that we had outlined on prior calls. Activity under the new contract is well underway, and we are very excited about the upcoming launch of SafePath with this Tier one carrier, which is slated to be in the early second half of the year. Our development efforts related to this project remain on track, which brings a truly unique and interesting go-to-market approach and I will be excited to share more about after the launch. As you can tell from my comments, our customer relationships are very positive, but now let's focus on something that really gets me excited. I'm very energized by the growth of our sales pipeline and the impact of this activity on the forward booking success of our business in 2024, we see great momentum in the pipeline in both of our targeted geographies of North America and Europe. As a result, I believe we will deliver new business from both current and new carrier customers in 2024 and that there will be multiple announcements to be made our efforts over the last three years to establish Smith Micro as the premier provider of family safety software appears to have positioned us well with all the turmoil around the world today, we see both governmental and societal pressures coming to bear to provide for both the digital and physical safety of our loved ones. And as a result, we are seeing strong interest in our SafePath platform. We will be attending the upcoming 2024 at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, one of the largest wireless tradeshows in the world and has lined up a great scheduled meetings. Our participation in Mobile World Congress is aligned with our goal of growing the awareness of Smith Micro as a provider of solutions that are sorely needed in the region. I am pleased to share the announcement from earlier this week. Smith Micro winning the goal their award in the Tech for Good category for telecom and wireless at Mobile World con Congress for our industry-leading SafePath Family Safety platform. This award further solidifies our position as the premier provider of Family Safety Solutions. From a product perspective, we have expanded our portfolio to drive opportunities for revenue growth. On the last call we spoke about if you do offerings coming to the market this year. Let me touch on those products again briefly, SafePath three premium broadens our SafePath portfolio, adding new unique functionality that we believe is responsive to current market demand. It is well known that significant risks are not just prevalent, but are expanding in frequency and sophistication in both digital and physical worlds. Safepath premium will bring AI driven experiences that will enable users to manage risks associated with cyber bullying and inappropriate content on existing social media platforms and other digital communications channels. Additionally, this solution brings improved physical location, intelligence and safety features to the application. We see great potential with this upgrade and expect this product to be available for launch in the second half of the fiscal year. We're already receiving great feedback from both existing customers and new prospects in the field regarding SafePath premium, which has been very positive, creating a new value proposition while expanding our market opportunity. We also announced SafePath global, a new streamlined deployment model, which we have targeted to be available for launch in the next few months. Safepath global delivers a quick-to-market sales test solution with very low dependency on IT resources and other integration efforts from our carrier partners. This product provides an expedited path to revenues the safe path for both our customers and Smith Micro while quickly delivering a family safety solution to that operator's subscribers. We believe this offering will expand our brand while providing significant flexibility and launching new instances of SafePath. This SafePath deployment model will also reach a much larger untapped market, including the only Tier one MNOs, but also Tier two and Tier three carriers as well as the ever-expanding market of MVNOs around the world. I'm pleased to say that we already have a good idea as to where the first deployments of both premium and global will be a great start in 2024 for Smith Micro base and will and safe Aphria, coupled with our newly announced SafePath OS. solution, will provide our Company with a significant opportunity to expand our relationships with our existing customers and to develop new customers with this broader suite of digital family lifestyle offerings. We will continue the expansion of our product portfolio with innovative functionality as we align with our M&O and MVNO partners, creating new distribution methods for a broader reach around the world, all based on the SafePath platform. In closing, I'm as excited as ever with our path forward as we continue expanding our vision for family safety as we move into 2024, I remain both excited and confident about the new chapter, we are ready for our company, our partners and our shareholders. With that, operator, let's open the call for questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Josh Nichols, B. Riley. Please go ahead.', 'Josh Nichols', ""Yes, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to touch on the new European customer. I realize you weren't able to put too much out, obviously in the press release. But just curious, anything you could say does this customer have an existing solution or is this going to be the first family safety solution and are there many deliverables on the Company's part, the Micro has to do before this launch in the second half? Or is it most of it on the carrier side of it why?"", 'William Smith', ""Okay, Josh, it is less less the purchase of first by St. Most opportunities in the European market are going to be greenfield. They typically will not have existing Family Safety field base bases built up. So we're going to have to build them up with the launch. I really can't say a whole lot about this. That know exactly how this is going to work. It is a unique and a very innovative approach that we are jointly taking with this carrier, I think, is going to be exciting and I'm really looking forward to being able to talk about it in more detail once the launch has actually happened. But we are building it some additional capabilities on SafePath for this, and they will all be part of the I launched it and I spoke about."", 'Josh Nichols', ""Thanks, Bill, and great to hear you mention that you think that you've kind of turned the corner in terms of marketing efforts at AT&T. Just to dive into that a little bit, like what gives you the confidence that you expect those efforts to kind of ramp up in the near term, is it the upcoming implementation of like spiffs to in-store salespeople? Or are there marketing efforts that give you confidence that that business is likely to see a more material ramp this year?"", 'Charles Messman', ""Hey, Josh, it's Charlie on. Yes, I think that now that the migration efforts are done, there's been an enormous amount of things that we've had to get in place. Prior to really starting to turn the channels on. And yes, it is going to be a multifaceted approach. And I think we're doing some unique things with AT&T as well that I think will be quite visible, which is something that we're very excited about. And I think that you can sense the excitement around it now that the launch is behind us and we'll all stay safe and secure family going forward. So, I think that that gives me a lot of confidence in AT&T and us because I can see it happening."", 'Josh Nichols', 'Appreciate the detail. Thanks.', 'Charles Messman', 'Thanks, Josh.', 'Operator', 'Jim McIlree, Dawson James.', 'Jim McIlree', ""Yes, thanks. Just a follow up on Josh's question about the European customer. And then when you say that a launch is going to be early second half and obviously the the carriers have a habit of pushing things to the right, but is it are there are there significant technological issues that need to be addressed at this point? Or is it more of a it's just you just need time to get things done?"", 'William Smith', ""Okay. I think the the best way to answer this is the a beginning launch at a new tier, a Tier one carrier in Europe that has never had a family safety app before. So there are a number of steps it has to be completed in order to set this up for a very successful business opportunity. In addition, they have created a concept that is new. This is a little different approach than what has traditionally been done here in North America. And so that does require some technology to be developed and tested and implemented. And so it's a mixed bag is really a little bit above, but the carrier is very energized today are really putting a lot of effort into this and I think they have high expectations. We like the discipline that we always look look for. So I'm just going to have to stand standby. It's not that much longer anyway. And we'll be able to talk about it."", 'Jim McIlree', ""Okay. Thank you for that. And can you characterize the attrition of the legacy Sprint customers, its impact on your your on your revenue? Is it kind of at a steady quarter to quarter decline or is it accelerating or diminishing in? It's in this decline?"", 'William Smith', ""Okay. I think we talked about this some time ago on of our earlier conference calls, you can no longer sign up for these. The old Sprint Safe & Found services a capped out product offering. So it just slowly declines quarter over quarter, and that's what you should expect. There will be a point in time. We're just ceases, but and that's this part of the process, all the interest and all the efforts at it to T-Mobile will be focused on the family boot product, and we're starting to see some very strong interest there. So I feel passed."", 'James Kempton', ""(multiple speakers) Charlie knows that Jim, just real quick in Tulsa note, the comps week revenues that have been affecting some of that they're completely gone at this point to this is really just on the family safety with what Bill talked about, the CommSuite is now fully out of the numbers. And you note you won't hear from that in terms of the comparisons going forward."", 'Jim McIlree', ""Understood. Thank you and just to speak, just to make sure I understand your answer, Bill, but the quarter-to-quarter decline of those legacy customers is stable right now. At some point, it won't be at some point, they'll just it will just drop to zero, but I don't know why I would because of steady decline."", 'William Smith', ""It is a quarter-over-quarter decline as users get new T-Mobile phones and move them offers safe and sound. They have the great opportunity to move the family, but that's that's part of the process."", 'Jim McIlree', ""Got it. And then on gross margin in Q2 excuse me, gross margin in Q1. Is the quarter to quarter decline solely a function of scale or are there costs that you're going to incur incur in Q1 that will be eliminated in subsequent quarters, it costs associated with the Verizon termination and or the other and the vast platform?"", 'William Smith', ""Well, I guess the best way EDS' first up one always is the quarter that has the marketing costs from Mobile World Congress, and that is a eight something that happens each year. So of that, that cost is in there, but and I'll kick it to Jim, you might want to take us there."", 'James Kempton', ""Yes. From a from a gross margin perspective, Jim, it's really driven by scale in terms of like in the revenues coming down to where we have certain fixed costs embedded in the cost of sales that are impacting that. Now the second part of your question in terms of like cost coming out relates to the platform, that is correct. And in future periods, we are we are driving out some of those legacy rig costs and they will not fully be out in Q1 and that will that will be coming out over over the course of Q1 and some will even tail into Q2. And then we would expect to have them completely out of the cost structure by the end of second quarter."", 'Jim McIlree', ""Okay. That's it for me right now. Thanks a lot."", 'William Smith', 'Thanks, Jim.', 'Operator', 'Scott Searle, ROTH MKM.', 'Scott Searle', ""Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe to dive in on Europe, I just wanted a quick clarification in terms of the Tier one customer that has already been one is s SafePath global or is that more of a traditional SafePath solution? And then I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more in the pipeline, Bill, it sounds like you're optimistic about some of the opportunities there. I was wondering if you could give us an idea about where you're seeing the strength? Because at other Tier ones you've called out that SafePath Global's really targeted to Tier twos, Tier threes is that's where you're seeing the strength? And do you expect to have announceable deals and or other launches in the 2024 timeframe?"", 'William Smith', ""Okay. That was the I start with your last question. Absolutely. Yes, would I expect that we will be making additional announcements and at existing and do new new carrier customers about many of the products that we've talked about on this call as far as the SafePath global part, though, the European customer is not the is not washing safe that global. And as I said in my comments, we pretty much know who the first customer will be for safe that global. And we also believe we have a really good idea of who the first customer will be for SafePath premium. So down and give you some idea that there are other players from a standpoint of the types of carriers? It covers a broad swath. We are we continue to focus heavily on the tier Tier one carriers in North America as well as in the Europe in the European marketplace. But we're also seeing activity on from Tier twos, Tier threes and from some really impactful MVNOs So look, I think what is happening in this world. I've talked about it on previous calls. We are just in the right spot at the right time. And with all the turmoil and all the chaos that you see around the world to today, the need to keep our Loveland safe is becoming really a major driver and a product like safe that which is designed to help do that. And it really tends to benefit from it it. So yes, there's a lot to be excited about. There is some of the new product ideas are really, you know, quite innovative. And with the SafePath OS. carriers will be able to launch kids' phones and kids tablets, all of which will not require anybody to buy a different brand file and it can be a brand phone that the carrier already sells, but it will come pre loaded with SafePath a place which will then just out of the box, make everything work. There's nothing that it has to be done to get the thing up and up and running. This becomes an exciting market. As you see kids growing and they get their first phone. And this is when parents really have to take a moment and they go. Wow. Now I'm I'm exposing my kid to all sorts of things that I'm really not sure I really like that are on the Internet. So now I better figure out a way to keep them safe. Well, in this case with SafePath OOS., they can get a tablet, which may be the first device or a phone and they can have it free free loaded and all the safety features are there from the minute you power up the device, the first time iBill."", 'Scott Searle', ""Maybe to just follow up on that front, specifically in Europe, what is the competitive landscape look like considering that there are additional security requirements and privacy requirements, particularly around young adults. Does that changed the competitive landscape in the European theater? Or are there new competitors on that front? And then just a quick question on pricing. Premium pricing will have premium pricing, but our SafePath global is that the expectation that's going to place in the same range of what you're seeing today? Or how are you thinking about that?"", 'William Smith', 'Let me parse it apart and then come back if I miss first off on the global product, will price exactly the same, same prices, the current safe safe as off-rate, the premium product will be priced at a premium price. So that deal gives both the carrier and the Smith Micro of opportunity to enhance revenue. Give me your packaged up a half a lot of questions.', 'Scott Searle', ""Well, just the competitive landscape in Europe, given what you had to have new distinct paths to have any kind of upgrade the security features on. You've mentioned a couple of times about cyber bullying or I'm just kind of wondering what that what does the competitive landscape in Europe right now? Because it sounds like you check all the boxes. Is there anyone else who's able to do that?"", 'William Smith', ""Well, honestly, from a carrier of marketing staff standpoint, we really are the only serious player this marketing guy directly to carriers the over the top players like for you, at least through 60 Embarq. They also have presence in Europe just the same as they do here in the US. So I think from a from a competitive landscape point of view is it's pretty much the same in both geographies from a privacy issue. We have as many growing privacy laws here in North America as they already have in Europe. And so this is something that we pay a lot of attention to. We are constantly making sure that our software meets the needs and the spirit of the law. What of what ever needs to be done is all built into the product before the priority, the launches. So the privacy issues are paramount and really pretty much around the world, but definitely in the geos that we're focused on. So we are really on that. That's a that's a that's a big effort."", 'Scott Searle', 'And lastly, if I could, and I apologize if you covered this earlier, I hopped on the call little bit late, but the AT&T ramp. If we look back to history and the Sprint ramp, you really started to gain some momentum about 18 months plus in how are you thinking about AT&T a little bit longer. Does it does it really start to get that meaningful inflection when we think about where Sprint was 18 to 24 months into the ramp? Or are there some headwinds that are going on in terms of marketing deployment or otherwise that it takes a little bit of a more muted trajectory? Thanks.', 'Charles Messman', ""Yes. So I think what we talked about on the call. This is that Charlie, Scott, we talked about on the call was that now that the migrations efforts are done, we see we're starting to see this next wave beginning to start. And we're doing some very unique things that AT&T on that that I think is going to start to Spartan as it builds upon itself once it gets going these things like going, getting all the employees is that there's lots of different activities going on right now to get the get the ball rolling on and we start to see some. Now that again, we're past migration. We think that we've turned the corner."", 'Scott Searle', 'Yes. Perfect. Thanks, Charles.', 'Operator', 'This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Charles Messman for any closing remarks.', 'Charles Messman', ""Want to thank everybody for joining us today. Should you have any further questions, please reach out to us and we'll look forward to talking to you pretty soon here on Q1. Thanks."", 'Operator', ""The conference has now concluded.

It's edging lower on the day."", ""Joining us now is Hugh Odom, Vertical Consultants founder and president Hugh, it is good to have you on the show. And maybe, Hugh, just I want to just start getting your general take on this event here, Hugh, because this outage, listen, it was widespread. It was national. As we noted there, a lot of people impacted. What's your response, Hugh?"", ""HUGH ODOM: Well, as you mentioned, it's been a crazy morning for AT&T and the other carriers, because usually when you have an outage it's localized or even regionalized. But when you have a widespread outage, that's a big issue because you're seeing something that gets outside of the control of AT&T. When it gets outside of the control of AT&T, you start looking at situations by which somebody outside of AT&T has got into their system."", ""And right now, the wireless networks, the infrastructure, the cell towers, et cetera are spread too thin with the rollout of 5G. So it exposes this situation even further. And I think this is one of the situations we're going to encounter with this continued rollout of 5G and the underlying infrastructure not meeting up to that demand."", ""JULIE HYMAN: So, Hugh, it's Julie here. So what needs to happen then to prevent this from happening? Is it just-- or is it just growing pains and it's going to happen as 5G gets rolled out? Is there anything that can be done to prevent it?"", ""HUGH ODOM: Well, I think two things. I think, one, we have to understand that with 5G, you're going to spread the network and you're going to see some exposure. So you need to really look and see how you can at least know where those exposures are and address them if they do come to fruition of having an issue with them."", ""Second, as I mentioned, we have a lack of cell sites out of the United States to accommodate 5G. That's just a simple fact of it. We are lagging behind the rest of the world. Unless we build out more cell towers and upgrade the ones that are out there, we're going to see this continual issue both in urban and more particularly in rural areas where you have that spread of coverage."", ""And the big issue there is AT&T recently said they're going to get away-- or get rid of, sorry, landlines.

Equate this to driving down the road and you get more cars on the road and you don't have wider lanes. And when you got more data coming across those ethernet services or, sorry, wireless services and networks, you're going to see more and more issues pop up. That exposure gets greater, the traffic gets greater, the overload becomes more a problem. And that just turns into bigger issues like we're seeing today, a nationwide outage. This doesn't really happen that often."", 'JOSH LIPTON: What do you make of, Hugh, how AT&T sort of handled this whole situation in terms of their reaction, their response, their messaging?', ""HUGH ODOM: I don't think they have had a message. I don't think they've had a response. I think their response is we're sorry for the outage, but we're not going to tell you what the reasoning was behind the outage. I think that's the Department of Homeland Security is investigating this. AT&T is apologized. But no one of the tens of thousands, if not more, of people who've been impacted have got an answer of what happened."", ""And that is an issue because we rely upon communications. It's our fourth utility. And when you shut that down, you can't communicate with people.

But, Hugh, no, seriously though, I know it is very important in a lot of situations. Should they be-- will we see customers leave AT&T? I mean, this is just a one-off, but should they be concerned about that?"", ""HUGH ODOM: I think AT&T and Verizon especially are so far behind T-Mobile, that's my personal opinion, that any bad news is worse news for AT&T. I think they're trying to catch up. And with this situation, sometimes they say any news is good news when you're out there. This isn't good news, because this says not only do they have an issue with service, its exposure. And that becomes an issue for security situations when you're using your wireless devices, your phone, et cetera.

The year-over-year decrease was primarily attributable to higher operating expenses led by a goodwill impairment charge of $5,841 million. Excluding non-recurring items, quarterly adjusted earnings were $1.08 per share compared with $1.19 in the prior-year quarter. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.For 2023, GAAP earnings declined to $12,095 million or $2.75 per share from $21,748 million or $5.06 per share in 2022. Adjusted earnings for 2023 were $4.71 per share compared with $5.18 in 2022.', 'Quarterly total operating revenues decreased to $35,130 million from $35,251 million in the prior year owing to lower wireless equipment revenues driven by a challenging macroeconomic environment and lower postpaid phone upgrades.

On average, rates for newly leased apartment homes exceeded our initial underwriting by more than $700 per month. Once fully stabilized, the projects underway during 2023 remain on pace to deliver an average yield on cost of approximately 7%.', ""Transaction activity was relatively muted during 2023 as capital and financial markets searched for solid footing. In our continued effort to simplify the business, and eliminate exposure to legacy investments, we sold a 20% stake in the Parkmerced mezzanine loan and monetized the associated interest rate swaption, resulting in proceeds of $91.5 million. In the fourth quarter, the purchaser of that position forfeited their option to acquire the remaining 80% which resulted in the subordination of their earlier investment. Also during the fourth quarter, we recognized a non-cash impairment to fully write off the remaining investment given the expiration of the buyer's purchase option, the loan's upcoming maturity date, and the financial position of the borrower. Aimco will continue to closely monitor the investment and engage with the borrower as we move closer to the loan’s initial maturity date in December 2024 which is concurrent with the maturity of the property's senior mortgage. In addition, during the fourth quarter we sold an entitled one-acre land parcel in Fort Lauderdale for $31 million ($16 million Aimco share), producing a levered IRR of more than 30% on the Aimco equity invested."", 'We view shares of Aimco common stock as an attractive investment opportunity given their pricing relative to the value of our assets and platform.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Having said that, from a first glance at Tapestry (NYSE:TPR) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look."", ""For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Tapestry is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.10 = US$1.2b ÷ (US$14b - US$1.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""Therefore, Tapestry has an ROCE of 10%. That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 12% generated by the Luxury industry."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Tapestry ', ""Above you can see how the current ROCE for Tapestry compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Tapestry ."", ""On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Tapestry doesn't inspire confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 10% from 16% five years ago. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments."", ""Bringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Tapestry's reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. Since the stock has gained an impressive 58% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward."", ""Tapestry does have some risks though, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Tapestry  that you might be interested in."", ""While Tapestry isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets."", 'Have feedback on this article?

Growth investors seek companies that offer strong earnings growth, while value investors seek stocks that appear to be undervalued and which they expect will return to fair value over time. Because the two styles complement each other, they can help add diversity to a portfolio when used together. When used together, some call the amalgamation ""growth at a reasonable price,"" or GARP. Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) has said the difference between value and growth investing is a false dichotomy. He wrote in Berkshire Hathaway\'s (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) 1993 annual letter:', '""Most analysts feel they must choose between two approaches customarily thought to be in opposition: \'value\' and \'growth.\' Indeed, many investment professionals see any mixing of the two terms as a form of intellectual cross-dressing. We view that as fuzzy thinking (in which, it must be confessed, I myself engaged some years ago). In our opinion, the two approaches are joined at the hip: Growth is always a component in the calculation of value, constituting a variable whose importance can range from negligible to enormous and whose impact can be negative as well as positive.', 'Buffet\'s business partner, the late Charlie Munger, further summed this up when he said,""Basically, all investment is value investment in the sense that you\'re always trying to get better prospects that you\'re paying for.""', 'Thus, a primary goal for investors is to not to overpay for stocks, whether you are going for growth or going for value (or conversely, not to sell too cheaply if you are selling). This is a particularly acute problem for growth investors as they have a tendency to overpay for growth. On the other hand, the major problem for value investors is a tendency to buy value traps, which they think are cheap, but actually expensive because they do not account for a declining business. For every security, there is a ""stupid price zone"" and a ""smart price zone"" and a range of values in between. The idea is to buy at the ""smart"" zone and sell at the ""stupid"" zone. Another trap for investors is timing, meaning either buying or selling too early or too late. This is easier said than done, of course. That is why Munger calls investing simple, but not easy.', 'Let us start this meditation on price with granddaddy of valuation techniques, the venerable price-earnings ratio.', 'The price-earnings ratio is, of course, a simplistic measure as it merely the ratio of stock price to earnings per share. It itself gives no guidance as to what is an acceptable ratio. Many investors have developed rules of thumb to judge whether a price-earnings ratio is expensive or cheap. For example, they would use a multiple of 15, which they consider the long-term price-eanings ratio of the S&P 500 as the bright line separating cheap from expensive. The lower the ratio, the cheaper the stock is. The higher the ratio, the more expensive it is.', 'The practical problem is that often the price-earnings ratio is wrong. For cyclical stocks, often the best time to buy is when the ratio is very high or is zero (because earnings have evaporated). Look at the chart of price and price-earnings ratio for Goodyear (NASDAQ:GT) (a classic cyclical stock) below.', 'GT Data by GuruFocus', 'Another big problem with the ratio is the earnings are based on GAAP earnings, which can fluctuate widely and may not reflect the true state of affairs of the earning power of the company. Take a look at Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) below. A great time to buy the stock would have been is 2019 when the price-earnings ratio was actually very high (the company had taken some non-cash write-offs at that time, which crashed the stock temporarily). Expected and unexpected events are contantly rocking the price-earnings line, making it a very unreliable measure.', 'PG Data by GuruFocus', 'Some problems can be avoided by looking at the median price-earnings ratio over a period of time (say 10 years) and then deriving a ""fair price"" from this median. This technique would have got us into P&G in 2018-19, but we would have sold too soon in 2000 as the stock rebounded above the median price line.', 'PG Data by GuruFocus', 'GuruFocus also provides the Shiller PE on its stock summary page, which is derived from the 10-year average of the inflation-adjusted earnings. Think of Shiller PE as a normalized price-earnings ratio that removes year-to-year distortions from the price-earnings line. In the chart below, the Shiller PE and price-earnings ratios are charted together with price. When the PE line is below the Shiller PE line, then chances are the stock may be undervalued (and vice versa).', 'However, this signal is not very clear in the case of Goodyear as the company is very cyclical. Both the regular and Shiller PEs fluctuate widely. We could argue that it is a good time to go long when the regular price-earnings ratio hits an extreme level or goes to zero and then sell when it comes back to normal.', 'GT Data by GuruFocus', 'For Goodyear, the median price-earnings technique does not work as the line is too fickle. Further, the median price-sales line, while better, is too slow to have much predictive value.', 'GT Data by GuruFocus', 'The main point I want to make is that while price-earnngs may be a quick and useful metric with most stocks, it has to be used carefully. Many times it is absolutely misleading. Charting the ratio with its derivatives is helpful to discern if there is a valid valuation signal. Overall, I feel the price-earnings ratio is more often misleading and do not rely on it much.', 'Then there is the PEG ratio, an old warhorse that incorporates growth. It was popularized by famous former fund manager Peter Lynch, who argued that a PEG ratio of 1 was a fair price, as he thought the earnings growth of a stock should ideally equal or exceed its price-earnings ratio.', ""The price-earnings to growth ratio, or PEG ratio, is a valuation measure that investors use to get a broad assessment of a company's performance and evaluate investment risk."", 'PEG ratio is calculated as follows: PEG = PE ratio/Earnings growth over five years.', ""In theory, a PEG ratio of 1 represents a perfect correlation between the company's market value and its projected earnings growth. PEG ratios higher than 1 are generally considered unfavorable, suggesting a stock is overvalued. Conversely, ratios lower than 1 are considered better, indicating a stock is undervalued."", 'There are two problems with the PEG ratio, however. One is price-earnings (the numerator) itself is problematic, which I have gone over already. The second problem is the denominator, or growth. Lynch used projected earnings growth, which requires judgement and is frequently wrong. Thus, the PEG is reduced to a judgement call.', 'A popular, ""more objective"" number is to use past actual Ebitda growth. The problem, of course, is that this is backward-looking and assumes the past growth trajectory will continue in the future. I still lean toward the latter as there is no getting away from it, unless you want to get into the judgement game and plug in an estimated forward growth. For cyclical stocks like Goodyear, I would prefer to substitute one-year trailing 12-month Ebitda growth for the five-year growth as used for stocks like P&G.', 'The PEG ratio is more often wrong than right. Below is an annual chart showing price and PEG. As you can see, it is pretty much useless as a predictor of value or growth. (Note: chart below is annual numbers.)', ""The GF Value chart is a proprietary measure which compares a company's current stock price to its GF Value Line. The GF Value Line is an intrinsic value estimate developed by GuruFocus that is calculated based on the following factors:"", 'Historical multiples (price-earnings ratio, price-sales ratio, price-book ratio and price-to-free cash flow) that the stock has traded at.', ""A GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth."", 'Future estimates of business performance from Morningstar analysts.', 'Exactly how the GF Value is calculated is not disclosed. While in my short experience it is a fine measure with good predictability, the lack of transparency of the calculation methodology prevents it from being used outside of GuruFocus.', 'Earning power value, or EPV, is based on the concept first popularized by Columbia University professor Bruce Greenblatt that one should value a stock based on the current operating profits of company and not on future projections, which may or may not come true. Some argue it is a better though conservative way to analyze stocks than discounted cash flow analysis, which relies on highly speculative growth assumptions projected many years into the future. The main assumption for EPV is that the current profitability is sustainable. I find this method useful for assessing value stocks with little or no growth, but for stocks which rely on growth, it is pretty much useless.', 'Applying the EPV method to Procter & Gamble and Goodyear, we find little if any predictive power for this method in valuing the two companies. This method would have prevented us from buying P&G over the last 25 years and given false results on Goodyear by indicating a buy in years when it would not have been prudent and a sell when the stock was undervalued.', 'PG Data by GuruFocus', 'Probably the most popular method of valuation used by more sophisticated investors who have graduated from using price-earnings and PEG ratios, the discounted cash flow (DCF) method is a technique used to estimate the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows. It involves discounting the projected cash flows (or earnings) back to their present value using a chosen discount rate, such as the weighted average cost of capital. The DCF method helps investors assess the potential profitability of an investment while accounting for the time value of money.', ""DCF models can become quite complex, but this does not make them better. GuruFocus, for example offers a two-stage valuation model in its DCF calculator, which can use GAAP earnings or free cash flow as a starting point . The major input in GuruFocus' calculator is the choice of starting value, growth rates and discount rates. We will notice that small changes in assumption of these variables can have a big impact on the final valuation. Thus, investors get the results they want by playing around with the variables, which limits the usefulness of this technique. Too much skepticism and conservatism will make us miss opportunity and too much optimism will cause us to make mistakes. Errors are inevitable as we are projecting decades into the future. In the end, DCF, like other valuation techniques, is a tool and the utility of a tool depends on the skill we use it with. Just because we give an amateur a power saw does not make him into a carpenter. He can easily hurt himself."", 'Below is a valuation of Procter & Gamble using the default inputs. The model says the stock is very overvalued. I can, of course, play around with the model and get whatever value I want. Frankly, this becomes an exercise in self-justification.', ""Another model which is available as part of GuruFocus' valuation panel is the projected free cash flow methodology. According to GuruFocus, since the DCF intrinsic value calculations are based on free cash flow or earnings, it cannot be applied to companies without consistent revenue and earnings. GuruFocus developed the projected FCF valuation model based on the normalized free cash flow and book value of the company. How it calculates the intrinsic value of stocks is described in detail here. Essentially, the method takes 80% of the book value and adds it to the present value of free cash flow averaged over six years. So in essence, it's another variation of the DCF model. Looking at Procter & Gamble's valuation using this method, we see it appears to undervalue the stock."", ""The same thing can be said for Goodyear's projected value."", ""I find the projected free cash flow is more useful in cases where company's business is capital intensive and cyclical and book value is a crucial component."", 'In thinking about growth and value and my aversion to over-paying, I have been pondering on how to come up with a single measure which can incorporate both. How do you balance the two attributes and reconcile with the price of the stock?', 'I devised a technique that I am sharing below. The technique involves reducing the value and growth attributes of the stock into a common scale which I call ""factors.""', 'The technique has three steps. First, calculate the value factor. Second, calculate the growth factor. Third, add the value and growth factors together. The higher the total, the better. I will break these steps down further.', 'First, derive the value factor by calculating the value of a stock with respect to a risk-free 10-year U.S. government bond. For instance:', 'Value factor = Operating profits/ (enterprise value 10-year U.S. treasury bond rate)', 'The logic of the formula is as follows:', 'Numerator: Operating profits are the pre-tax profits a company generates (for this exercise we ignore taxes).', 'Denominator: The enterprise value is the logical value an external buyer would pay for the entire company on the open market. This includes market capitalization minus debt plus cash. Multiplying enterprise value by the 10-year treasury rate gives us the risk-free return an investor would get if was to invest the entire amount in 10-year U.S. treasury bonds.', 'Basically, you want the operating profit of the company to be higher than the amount you would get if you were to invest the same amount in Treasuries, which are risk free. You obviously want to be paid more than the risk-free rate. The higher the factor, the better. Note this does not take into account growth of operating profit and enterprise value. Therefore, it is a conservative estimate. Here are some examples.', 'Looking at Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), at present you can get 13% better risk-free income from 10-year U.S. T-bills, while with Verizon (NYSE:VZ), you can get 116% more income as compared to the same bonds. This income is not the same as a dividend as a portion of this is retained earnings and also does not include taxes. Hot stock Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is, of course, growing very fast and you may well decide the low factor of safety does not matter in the long run. But you are making this decision with eyes wide open. Same with Exxon (NYSE:XOM); while the factor of value is very high at present, it may be temporary given the high price of oil and it may well evaporate in the years to come.', 'For step two, the growth factor is calculated as the five-year Ebitda growth rate per share divided by the growth divider.', 'Breaking it down further:', ""Numerator: Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, is a measure of a company's profitability and efficiency. Growing Ebitda is important for business owners and investors because it indicates an improvement in the company's performance and earnings per share. It also demonstrates the company's worth and attractiveness to potential investors. It also allows for a fair comparison of different companies with different capital structure, debt and tax profiles. Further, it separates revenue from other expenses and shows the core profitability of a business. It forms a middle ground between revenue growth and net income growth, so I find it more consistent and useful than either. The five-year period for Ebitda growth allows us sufficient time to get a consistent or secular growth number, though a shorter period might be more appropriate for cyclical businesses. For the purpose of this excercise, I will stick to five years."", 'Denominator: Here this technique gets a little judgmental and arbitrary. I had to come up with a divisor which would give me a ""weight"" for each point of Ebitda growth. By trial and error, I found that a divider of 5 gives me decent results. Therefore, in this system, each five percentage points of Ebitda growth ( i.e., one growth factor) is equivalent to one value factor. Therefore, a company with a five-year Ebitda growth profile of 10% will give us a growth factor of 2 and so on.', 'For step three, we simply add the growth and value factors together to get a single number. The higher the number, the better.', ""Let us start with the Nvidia, which is the stock du jour. The company's operating income for the trailing 12 months is $20.61 billion, while the current enterprise value is $1.34 trillion, the five-year Ebitda growth rate is 19.4%, 10-year Treasury yield is 3.94% and the growth divider is 5. Putting all this together, we get the following:"", 'Value factor = 20613/(1343984.2*3.94/100) = 0.3893', 'Growth factor = 19.4/5=3.88', 'Sum = 0.38+3.88=4.26', ""Therefore, I find that Nvidia's growth factor is very high and more than makes up for the low value factor, making for a very good combined value and growth factor. This makes Nvidia a strong buy by this technique."", ""The following chart show Nvidia's value (blue bar), growth (red bar) and sum (combined, yellow line) factors over the last 10 years. The stock price is shown as a green line and plotted on the right vertical axis. Nvidia was showing signs of being a great buy as early as 2015, which became pretty clear by 2017 and the sum reached a peak in 2019, when the stock price was still quite low. Interestingly enough, the stock still looks like a buy with a combined factor value over 4, obviously because of its extraordinary growth."", 'Here is a similar chart for Microsoft, which also shows that it is still a buy (with a combined value and growth factor score of over 4) even after an epic run-up.', 'Here is a similar chart for Dominion (NYSE:D), a beaten down utility. While the combined factor is now over 1, it had very low growth factor. Overall, this is a hold, but is probably OK for value investors who are not looking for growth.', 'Lumen Technologies (NYSE:LUMN) looks like a stock to avoid or sell. While the value factor is good, the growth factor is deeply negative. It looks like a melting icecube. At the very least, wait until the growth factor starts to reverse.', 'Overall, I find the simple value and growth factor method intuitive and reasonably predictable, as well as a useful addition to my valuation toolbox. It brings structure to the two most important attributes of price and helps seperate the signal from the noise.', 'Conclusion', ""There are many other valuation techniques such as the Graham number and enterprise value/Ebitda that are also of limited value in specific situations which I won't bother discussing."", 'Given the plethora of valuation techniques available, valuation is more of an art than a science. I think most experienced investors tend to use multiple techniques and then trigulate them to arrive at a value they think is fair and with which they feel comfortable. It is important to have a lattice work of mental models and be able to filter your ideas through them. Most of the ideas will be discarded and only a few remain.', ""As Munger said, What makes investment hard is that [on one hand] it's easy to see that some companies have better businesses than others, but [on the other hand] the price of the stock goes up so high that all of a sudden, the question of which stock is the best to buy gets quite difficult. We've never eliminated the difficulty of that problem."", 'Munger and Buffett addressed this problem by practicing extreme patience in waiting for the right ""fat pitch."" They are not afraid to let suboptimal pitches go by (in investing, unlike baseball, there is no compulsion to swing). However, when a fat pitch does arrive, they swing aggresively and decisively to hit the ball outside the park.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

By leveraging data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, GPC can optimize its inventory management, improve customer service, and streamline operations. This technological edge could lead to increased efficiency, cost savings, and an improved customer experience, further solidifying GPC's market position."", ""Geopolitical Risks: GPC's international operations expose it to various geopolitical risks, including economic sanctions, trade disputes, and regional conflicts.

These uncertainties could adversely affect GPC's business, particularly in Europe, and require vigilant risk management and contingency planning."", 'Technological Disruption: The automotive industry is undergoing significant transformation with the rise of electric vehicles, ride-sharing services, and autonomous driving technology. These shifts could alter the demand for traditional automotive parts and necessitate a strategic pivot for GPC.

Discovery (WBD), and Fox (FOX, FOXA), S&P Global believes investor fears may be overblown concerning bundling services' position against TV packages."", 'Yahoo Finance Entertainment Reporter Alexandra Canal breaks down the details and what ""skinny bundle"" offerings mean for ESPN.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan."", ""- Let's stick with the streaming space because we got a lot to talk about. Warner Brothers Discovery ESPN and Fox reaching an agreement for that joint sports streaming venture that we've been talking about leaving investors questioning the fate of pay TV. But there's a new report out from S&P Global saying that fears may be overblown."", ""Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal has the details for us. Ali, a little overblown, I guess, at this point?"", 'ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah--', '- From their perspective.', ""ALEXANDRA CANAL: From their perspective. And there's been a lot talk about what this skinny bundle means for the future of linear TV, especially because all of these companies, Warner Brothers, Discovery, Disney, Fox, they have a lot of exposure to linear networks. And that bundle does help fund a lot of those streaming initiatives."", ""So the fear here is that are we going to pull customers away from that pay TV bundle and could that impact profitability? Which is one of the reasons why we sometimes see the shares move lower on the heels of these streaming centric announcements. But S&P is arguing that these fears are overblown and that the joint venture, if it's priced correctly, could actually add pay TV customers. So it all comes down to pricing. If it's priced too high, it's not going to appeal to the cord cutters. If it's priced too low, that could potentially cannibalize existing pay TV users."", ""So S&P is anticipating a price point between 40 to 50 bucks. But it's important to remember that this is a skinny package of linear TV networks, and consumers will only have access to games and packages that these companies have the rights to."", ""So if you're a pay TV subscriber, you're likely a pay TV subscriber because of sports. You see the value in having access to the full slate of content. You probably aren't going to opt in for this skinny bundle because you want as much content as possible. If you're a cord cutter, you probably either don't care about sports or you just don't want to pay that high price point."", ""So I think there's an interesting argument here that it all comes down to what ultimately this is going to be priced at when you think about who this is going to attract the most. And there's a lot of unanswered questions here, not only with pricing but also with FTC, antitrust. Obviously, we have that Fubo lawsuit. So a lot of question marks and answers that these companies are going to have to ultimately come up with."", ""- Well, I have another question mark for you. What does this skinny bundle mean for Disney's flagship ESPN service as well? I mean, that's set to launch in 2025."", ""ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, I think it could potentially give Disney some really interesting insights into who the customer is, who wants to pay for an over-the-top sports streaming bundle? What the price point could potentially be, which is another reason why if it's priced too low, that could be a net negative for Disney because it potentially puts a ceiling, a cap on what that pricing could be."", 'But Disney could also see some interesting insights when it comes to marketing, when it comes to consumer demand. So this could be a pretty good test, I think, for Disney as it plans to launch that ESPN flagship service in 2025.', ""- And so Ali, it's going to be a test here for Disney. But also do you think it's a test, right? For the broader industry as well just in terms of how successful this is going to be, what it's going to do for future bundling, and really giving us a better idea of what the consumer at the end of the day is interested and willing to pay up for?"", 'ALEXANDRA CANAL: Absolutely. It all comes down to demand, right? Are customers going to be interested in something like this? And if they are, who is that target audience?', ""Then you think about the companies that are left out of the bundle. You have Paramount, you have NBC Universal. This could potentially hurt them in the long run because the assumption is that the ABC and Fox affiliates, they're going to get paid for being a part of this skinny bundle. So I think that's why we heard that one rumor, that one report that Peacock and Paramount Plus are potentially thinking about joining forces."", 'So this is going to lead to a lot of interesting moves among all of these companies and potentially more consolidation.']"

Before control of the district changed hands early last year, the Disney supporters on its board signed agreements with Disney shifting control over design and construction at Disney World to the company.

Discovery (WBD), and Fox (FOX, FOXA), S&P Global believes investor fears may be overblown concerning bundling services' position against TV packages."", 'Yahoo Finance Entertainment Reporter Alexandra Canal breaks down the details and what ""skinny bundle"" offerings mean for ESPN.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan."", ""- Let's stick with the streaming space because we got a lot to talk about. Warner Brothers Discovery ESPN and Fox reaching an agreement for that joint sports streaming venture that we've been talking about leaving investors questioning the fate of pay TV. But there's a new report out from S&P Global saying that fears may be overblown."", ""Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal has the details for us. Ali, a little overblown, I guess, at this point?"", 'ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah--', '- From their perspective.', ""ALEXANDRA CANAL: From their perspective. And there's been a lot talk about what this skinny bundle means for the future of linear TV, especially because all of these companies, Warner Brothers, Discovery, Disney, Fox, they have a lot of exposure to linear networks. And that bundle does help fund a lot of those streaming initiatives."", ""So the fear here is that are we going to pull customers away from that pay TV bundle and could that impact profitability? Which is one of the reasons why we sometimes see the shares move lower on the heels of these streaming centric announcements. But S&P is arguing that these fears are overblown and that the joint venture, if it's priced correctly, could actually add pay TV customers. So it all comes down to pricing. If it's priced too high, it's not going to appeal to the cord cutters. If it's priced too low, that could potentially cannibalize existing pay TV users."", ""So S&P is anticipating a price point between 40 to 50 bucks. But it's important to remember that this is a skinny package of linear TV networks, and consumers will only have access to games and packages that these companies have the rights to."", ""So if you're a pay TV subscriber, you're likely a pay TV subscriber because of sports. You see the value in having access to the full slate of content. You probably aren't going to opt in for this skinny bundle because you want as much content as possible. If you're a cord cutter, you probably either don't care about sports or you just don't want to pay that high price point."", ""So I think there's an interesting argument here that it all comes down to what ultimately this is going to be priced at when you think about who this is going to attract the most. And there's a lot of unanswered questions here, not only with pricing but also with FTC, antitrust. Obviously, we have that Fubo lawsuit. So a lot of question marks and answers that these companies are going to have to ultimately come up with."", ""- Well, I have another question mark for you. What does this skinny bundle mean for Disney's flagship ESPN service as well? I mean, that's set to launch in 2025."", ""ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, I think it could potentially give Disney some really interesting insights into who the customer is, who wants to pay for an over-the-top sports streaming bundle? What the price point could potentially be, which is another reason why if it's priced too low, that could be a net negative for Disney because it potentially puts a ceiling, a cap on what that pricing could be."", 'But Disney could also see some interesting insights when it comes to marketing, when it comes to consumer demand. So this could be a pretty good test, I think, for Disney as it plans to launch that ESPN flagship service in 2025.', ""- And so Ali, it's going to be a test here for Disney. But also do you think it's a test, right? For the broader industry as well just in terms of how successful this is going to be, what it's going to do for future bundling, and really giving us a better idea of what the consumer at the end of the day is interested and willing to pay up for?"", 'ALEXANDRA CANAL: Absolutely. It all comes down to demand, right? Are customers going to be interested in something like this? And if they are, who is that target audience?', ""Then you think about the companies that are left out of the bundle. You have Paramount, you have NBC Universal. This could potentially hurt them in the long run because the assumption is that the ABC and Fox affiliates, they're going to get paid for being a part of this skinny bundle. So I think that's why we heard that one rumor, that one report that Peacock and Paramount Plus are potentially thinking about joining forces."", 'So this is going to lead to a lot of interesting moves among all of these companies and potentially more consolidation.']"

Its forecast calling for adjusted earnings per share of $9.50 to $9.70 this year was well received. It was well ahead of the $9.19 a share that analysts were targeting at the time. It would also represent 40% to 43% improvement over 2023.', 'On Wednesday the outlook got even better. The country\'s second-largest cruise line now expects to earn between $9.90 and $10.10 a share on an adjusted basis, a 46% to 49% increase.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks in the Dow and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dow Jones Dividend Stocks According to Analysts.\xa0', ""Investors have employed various dividend strategies over time to enhance their returns. Looking back at history, it's evident that dividend-paying stocks have often outperformed other types of investments. Opting for dividend stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) can be particularly advantageous. This index comprises numerous dividend-paying stocks, notably blue-chip companies renowned for their consistent dividend increases. In 2023, the DJIA saw a significant increase of 14%, with 19 component stocks experiencing gains while 11 component stocks faced declines over the course of the year. Towards the end of the year, in December, the index reached a record-breaking high, surpassing the $37,000 mark."", 'Apart from delivering robust returns over the years, dividends have also maintained their significance as a growing component of personal income. As per a report from S&P Dow Jones Indices, the proportion of personal income attributed to dividend earnings has consistently risen over time, underscoring their importance as a source of income. In 2012, dividend income accounted for 5.64% of per capita personal income in the U.S., compared to 4.39% in the previous decade and 3.51% two decades prior. Conversely, during this same period, interest income from capital markets has steadily declined, dropping to 7.39% in 2012 from 13.51% in 1992. According to the report, the total dividend income, adjusted for inflation to $2000, experienced a substantial rise from $187.6 billion in 1992 to $757 billion in 2012, marking an impressive growth of over 300%. In contrast, interest income grew by less than 100% over the same period.', ""When investors consider dividend stocks for their portfolios, they often prioritize dividend yields. However, it's important to note that companies offering high yields but lacking solid financial stability could face the risk of reducing dividends, especially amidst global economic uncertainties and increasing interest rates. Therefore, investment strategies aimed at high yields should also prioritize the quality and stability of the companies in question. The Dow Jones Dividend 100 Index Series tracks the performance of 100 high-dividend-yielding stocks within each covered market, chosen for their consistent dividend payments and strong fundamental strength. When utilizing any income strategy, market participants typically prioritize both yield and capital gain. The Dow Jones Dividend 100 Indices have demonstrated superior yields and comparable capital gains over the long term when compared to their respective benchmarks. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, for the period spanning from June 30, 2001, to June 30, 2023, the total return of the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index, which assumes theoretical reinvestment of dividends, averaged 11.7% annually.

Reported EPS is $0.6, expectations were $0.58. Exelon Corporation isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).', ""Operator: Hello, and welcome to Exelon's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Gigi, and I'll be your event specialist today. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Please note that today's webcast is being recorded. During the presentation, we'll have a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Andrew Plenge, Vice President of Investor Relations. The floor is yours."", ""Andrew Plenge : Thank you, Gigi, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to have you with us for our 2023 fourth quarter earnings call. Leading the call today are Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeanne Jones, Exelon's Chief Financial Officer. Other members of Exelon senior management team are also with us today, and they will be available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. Today's presentation, along with our earnings release and other financial information can be found in the Investor Relations section of Exelon's website. We'd also like to remind you that today's presentation and the associated earnings release materials contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties."", ""You can find the cautionary statements on these risks on Slide 2 of today's presentation or in our SEC filings. In addition, today's presentation includes references to adjusted operating earnings and other non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations between these measures and the nearest equivalent GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of our presentation and in our earnings release. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Calvin Butler, Exelon's President and CEO."", ""Calvin Butler: Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. On Slide 4, we have laid out our key messages for today's call. First, we are pleased to share that final results for 2023 exceeded the midpoint of our narrowed guidance, delivering $2.38 per share of operating earnings, or almost 6% growth off of last year's guidance midpoint. This is the second year in our two years as a purely regulated T&D utility that we have delivered results in the top half of guidance. And that is despite historically mild weather in the Mid-Atlantic where PECO experienced its mildest year in the 50 years we have on record. We also executed exactly as expected on our financing plan, including issuing one-third of our original $425 million equity commitment."", ""Operationally, we continue to set the bar for the industry. We closed out another year with leading performance setting records for performance at multiple utilities. As it pertains to our regulatory activity, we completed three rate cases last year and continue to make progress on the three others at Delmarva Power Delaware, Pepco Maryland and Pepco DC. We received the final order in BGE's second multiyear plan filing for rates effective 2024 to 2026. We were encouraged to receive an order that recognized the importance of investment in support of Maryland's energy goals and a thoughtful path towards decarbonization. We also reached a constructive settlement in Atlantic City Electric rate case. The increased revenue requirement will support its smart meter rollout, its EV smart program for easy and cost-efficient charger installation, and other investments to maintain safety and reliability, as well as improved service for our customers in New Jersey."", ""Last, we received an order in ComEd's first multiyear rate plan, and it was a disappointing outcome. First, the order failed to recognize the financial cost of ComEd's investment, despite nation-leading reliability and low customer rates. It adopted a significantly below average ROE, refused to reflect in rates the prudent share of equity and removed any return on our pension asset despite that asset delivering over $1 billion in customer and counting. But more importantly, it rejected our grid plan which was carefully developed over almost two years through dozens of stakeholder workshops and presentations reaching over 1,000 people and bolstered by voluminous support in the rate case process. Support for the investment plan was very strong, up through the administrative law judge's proposed order."", ""It's important to all of us that are working to meet our state's goals and serving our customers that we have a stable and certain regulatory environments, and we'll work with all of our stakeholders to achieve such an environment and ensure that Illinois is a state that investors are comfortable committing to. As such, a key focus of this team for 2024 will be regaining momentum in Illinois and resolving some of this uncertainty. It is in no one's interest, particularly those in the Illinois communities we serve and live in for the state to lose further ground in its opportunity to lead the energy transformation and forgo significant economic opportunity. We will be working diligently with stakeholders to get it back on track. Jeanne will cover more of the detail around Illinois shortly, and additional details on other rate cases can be found in the appendix."", ""Our last key message pertains to our projected outlook. Consistent with past practice, we have rolled forward our disclosures after adding a year to our guidance window with our guidance running from 2024 through 2027. You'll see that we have added $3.2 billion of capital to our four-year outlook, growing from $31.3 billion over the 2023 to 2026 guidance period to $34.5 billion over 2024 to 2027, an increase of over 10%. This reflects a number of updates across the platform to meet customer needs and jurisdictional goals. Including the addition of transmission investments assigned from the brand insurer's retirement and awarded in PJM's 3 RTEP reliability window to resolve reliability issues from data center growth in the region. These additions are partially offset by the reduction of approximately $1.25 billion in ComEd distribution spend."", 'While we are working to finalize the revised grid plan for our March filing, we believe our plan appropriately accounts for the uncertain regulatory outlook while ensuring customers continue to receive safe and adequate service, and we meet the basic requirements laid out under the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. This increase in capital expenditures result in rate base growth of 7.5% from 2023 to 2027. And as a result of the significant increase in investment, we have included in our four-year projections incremental equity of $1.3 billion, which represents approximately 40% of the net incremental capital and ensures we maintain a strong balance sheet as we lead the energy transformation. In addition, despite below average returns we are receiving at ComEd, we continue to expect to realize a consolidated ROE in the 9% to 10% range.', ""The result of the plan is an annualized operating earnings growth target of 5% to 7% through 2027 from our 2023 guidance midpoint of $2.36 per share. Now lowering our earnings growth outlook is not a change we took lightly, particularly given the amount of investment needed for this multi-decade energy transformation and our unique scale and platform to lead that work. Reducing investment in ComEd as a result of the final quarter lowered our expected rate base growth, but it also provided us an additional opportunity to deploy capital in other parts of the system across our seven jurisdictions to serve our customers, particularly in transmission. I'll note that the financial benefits of these investments do take longer to play out. Given the larger scale and scope of transmission projects, they require more time to generate cash and earnings relative to the distribution investments they are replacing."", 'But we are confident that we can deliver at the midpoint or better of our annualized growth rating -- growth rate change of 5% to 7% over the 2023 to 2027 horizon and beyond, even after accounting for the potential that the uncertain process in Illinois may require significant further adjustments. And once again, Jeanne will speak more to these updates to our long-term outlook shortly. Lastly, for 2024, we are initiating our projected operating earnings guidance at $2.40 to $2.50 per share. This range gives us confidence that we can accommodate a variety of outcomes through the ComEd rehearing and grid plan processes, along with our typical risk and opportunities we see across our platform. We have also announced an annualized dividend of $1.52 per share in 2024, reflecting 5.5% growth off of our $1.44 dividend per share in 2023, in line with our long-term earnings growth and approximately 60% payout ratio.', ""Moving to slide 5. I will review the 2023 commitments and priorities that we initiated on last year's fourth quarter call and recognize the significant progress we made across all of the areas that we prioritize as a pure-play transmission and distribution utility, which is leading the energy transformation. First, it was another tremendous year operationally. You can see this not only in our scorecard, but the industry recognizes it as well. As we mentioned in our last call, ComEd won, PA Consulting's ReliabilityOne Award as the country's most reliable utility. The best ever performance at ComEd and Pepco Holdings speaks to the high quality of our workforce and our efforts to attract, engage and retain talent. We also met all of our financial goals."", 'We invested $7.3 billion of capital to serve our customers. We earned a 9.3% return on equity, well within the targeted range of 9% to 10% that we target earnings on a consolidated basis. And as I mentioned, we delivered earnings in the upper half of our guidance range. We executed as promised on our strategy to maintain a healthy and strong balance sheet. We issued one-third of our existing equity commitment, raised debt at attractive interest rates at both our operating companies and holding company, and we took advantage of a variety of hedging instruments. We were very active and extremely successful in securing grants enabled by the infrastructure, investment and Jobs Act, securing close to $200 million in awards to support grid resiliency and modernization, at BGE, PECO and ComEd that will make our jurisdictions progress on their energy goals more affordable and equitable.', ""And further, to the focus on customer affordability, we again helped secure $550 million of federal, state and local support for low-income customers that need assistance in paying their energy bills. We also made significant progress in our efforts to maximize value for our customers, institutionalizing a permanent team to discover and execute on opportunities to deliver industry-leading operational excellence for our customers at lower cost, which you'll hear more about from Jeanne. Lastly, we executed on a busy regulatory calendar, setting a rate case -- settling a rate case at ACE concluding another successful multiyear plan for BGE's electric and gas customers that aligns on an appropriate investment strategy for the next three years, and making substantial progress in our Delmarva Power electric rate case and Pepco multiyear plans."", ""As we talked about, while we completed our ComEd rate case, it was a disappointing outcome for all parties. But we've already begun to establish and execute on a path forward, and that's become our top priority in 2024. I will now turn to slide 6 to review how we closed out 2023 from an operational perspective. Starting first with reliability. We again kept outage frequency and duration at top quartile levels or above. ComEd and Pepco Holdings operated at best on record levels in both categories. Performance like this is not something that can be turned on and off overnight. First, it takes a talented and trained workforce. As I mentioned earlier, and we thank the teams that show up each and every day no matter the conditions to compete the lights on and the gas flowing as they did during the severe storms and brutal cold snap that struck in January."", ""Across ComEd, PECO and PHI, over 500,000 customers were impacted, and it takes investment. The demands placed on our system by more severe weather by an increasingly distributed and non-dispatchable generation fleet and by an economy that's more and more reliant on electricity, they all require investment. That's why it's so important to us to have stable and certain regulatory environments. It gives us the confidence to execute on forward-looking planning to manage the pace of investment for the energy transformation and ensure the reliability that all customers deserve and rightly expect. On safety, performance will continue to be a critical area of attention for us in 2024. Our OSHA performance was lacking in 2023 and we remain highly focused on understanding and correcting drivers of underperformance at each of our utility operating companies."", ""The biggest drivers across all of our utilities continue to remain in the day-to-day basics like ergonomics and vehicle-related incidents not the high energy events that truly differentiate utility work and demand particular focus. But this substandard performance even in the lower impact areas is not acceptable, and I expect us to do better in 2024. Customer satisfaction almost universally improved in the fourth quarter with ComEd rising into the first quartile. We are pleased that our efforts to ensure our customers see value in the service we provide are paying off, and we look forward to continuing this progress well into 2024. And finally, gas odor response remained at the dollar levels. And we continue to deliver on what we have here, and I'm so proud of the BGE and PECO, Pepco team -- and Delmarva teams."", 'There was a lot for our employees to be proud of in 2023. We know we have what it takes to be a premier utility and we execute it like one. I will now turn it over to Jeanne to speak more about our financial and regulatory update. With that, Jeanne?', 'Jeanne Jones: Thank you, Calvin and good morning everyone. Today, I will cover our fourth quarter and full year results, key regulatory developments in Illinois and across the platform, and provide annual updates to our financial disclosures, including 2024 guidance. Starting on Slide 7. As Calvin noted, we delivered strong financial results for the second year in a row despite the historically mild weather impacting our non-decoupled jurisdictions. For the fourth quarter, Exelon earned $0.62 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.60 per share on a non-GAAP basis. For the full year 2023, we earned $2.34 per share on a GAAP basis and $2.38 per share on a non-GAAP basis, results that are at the top end of our narrowed guidance range, and represent almost 6% growth off the midpoint of the 2022 guidance range.', ""Throughout the year, we benefited from a higher earned ROE at ComEd, primarily due to rising treasury rates, impacting ComEd's distribution ROE as well as favorable depreciation of PECO relative to expectations. Additionally, the ruling in December on BGE's reconciliation from its first multiyear plan approved recovery for over 90% of the requested 2021 and 2022 amounts and established a precedent to record a portion related to the 2023 reconciliation, which is expected to be determined in a future proceeding. These benefits, coupled with our ability to manage our plans across the platform, allowed us to mitigate nearly $140 million of weather and storm challenges relative to prior year, along with the labor strike in New Jersey that occurred late in the year, driving contracting costs up year-over-year."", 'In a year in which we faced multiple headwinds, we delivered on our goal to achieve earnings in the top half of our guidance range. Quarter-to-date and year-to-date drivers relative to prior year are detailed in the appendix on Slides 30 and 31. Turning to our outlook for 2024, we are initiating adjusted operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.50 per share, with BGE and PEPCO entering the next cycles of their multiyear plan, 2024 earnings are expected to grow approximately 4% relative to the midpoint of our 2023 original guidance range. Compared to our last update, the reduction in expected year-over-year earnings growth is driven solely by the December 14th rate order issued by the Illinois Commerce Commission and ComEd multiyear rate plan.', 'which we were only able to partially mitigate in 2024 with cost management, redirected investment to serve our customers, and margin we had built up in the plan. Outright rejection of the grid plan, the challenging financial support for our net distribution investment in the December order, and uncertainty around the amount of spend ComEd will be able to recover has caused us to dramatically reduce the originally planned level of distribution investment in Illinois this year. Until there is resolution on the grid plan, our 2024 plan has been risk-adjusted for the overall uncertainty and prudently assumes earnings at ComEd consistent with the December rate order. While the rehearing on the interim revenue requirement is expected to provide additional cost recovery and so grid plan approval, we have not assumed this as our base case.', ""Therefore, despite the uncertainty that remains at ComEd, we expect our 2024 range to cover a range of possible outcomes, from not receiving any rate relief relative to the final order to the prospect that we receive an approval of our revised grid plan. The uncertainty in Illinois will further cause volatile quarterly earnings shaping in 2024, both due to the significant rework of ComEd's operational plan in 2024, as well as due to the fact of the prospects for the rehearing and revised grid plan processes to impact ComEd expected revenue requirements. We currently expect to realize approximately 29% of full year earnings in the first quarter, which accounts for the December rate order ComEd, seasonal weather patterns and the completed rate cases at our other utilities."", ""Moving to Slide 9. I would like to take a moment to step through the regulatory developments in Illinois since receipt of the ITC's final order in mid-December. First, starting with the application for rehearing on December 22, and ComEd acted swiftly to request the commission correct fundamental, legal and evidentiary errors around four primary issues with the final order. Return on equity, capital structure, return on pension assets and the basis of the ordered revenue requirement across all test years that was adopted absent an approved grid plan. At an open meeting on January 10, the ICC granted one portion of ComEd's application. Directing that 150-day rehearing process reconsider the year-over-year revenue requirement increases absent an approved grid plan."", ""While ComEd anticipates that the revenue requirements will be further updated upon approval of our revised grid plan, the rehearing order due on June 10 is expected to reset interim rates for 2024 at the discretion of the commission. Immediately following the open meeting on January 10, ComEd filed with the Third District of Appellate Court, and appeal of the three other elements of the ICC's final order on which rehearing was denied. While there is no set schedule or deadline for an appeal conclusion, we will seek to move expeditiously through the core process. Separately, as directed in the final order, ComEd will file a revised grid plan by March 13. ComEd has fully reengaged staff and all parties to the proceeding to align on the appropriate adjustments to the revised grid plan to fully address the concerns expressed by the commission."", ""We continue to believe significant investment is needed to support Illinois' clean energy goals and desire to promote economic element in the state, a fact acknowledged by all stakeholders. But the revised grid plan we expect to file will reflect the significantly below average financial support provided in the final order and address the commission's feedback to further prioritize affordability. We simply cannot invest at the same pace under an ROE that does not fairly recognize ComEd's cost of financing to do so, especially in the current interest rate and inflation environment. There is no statutory deadline action on the revised grid plan. However, final order stated that the commission appreciates urgency of having a compliant grid plan in place, and is eager to move forward with the grid plan that satisfies the statutory requirements for approval."", ""And so we are optimistic for resolution by year-end. In response to the challenging rate order, our long-term guidance reflects a $1.25 billion reduction in ComEd distribution capital expenditures over the three-year period spanning 2024 to 2026 relative to our Q4 2022 disclosure update. This updated investment outlook for ComEd distribution business includes reductions agreed to with stakeholders, leading up to last October's per quarter. Along with additional reductions to result in a plan that further balances priorities across our stakeholders. As I will discuss later, around our long-term outlook, our guidance has accounted for the possibility that substantially more capital is removed from the plan as a result of the process, despite significant broad-reaching support for our investment strategy."", ""On Slide 10, we provide our updated outlook for CapEx and rate base, covering 2024 to 2027. We plan to invest $7.4 billion in 2024 and a total of $34.5 billion over the next four years, an increase of $3.2 billion or over 10% from the prior planning period. So we reduced ComEd's distribution capital plan by over 18% in response to the final order, the multi-decade energy transformation continues to gain momentum, and we see no shortage of needs to invest for our customers across all of our service territories and an ability to do so at a reasonable cost. We are the largest transmission and distribution utility in the country by customer count, and we have the privilege and responsibility to serve many major densely populated areas. We operate six utilities across seven jurisdictions, including FERC."", 'And beyond our industry-leading size and scale, we are also one of the best operators in this sector, providing a world-class customer experience for reliability at very competitive rates. Given the power of this platform, our updated four-year capital plan includes $3.2 billion of additional capital, net of the adjustments to common distribution to serve our customers. Included in that increase is $1.5 billion of incremental transmission capital over the 2023 to 2026 period, since our last disclosure update. Addressing the significant need for high-voltage investments to support federal, state and customer goals on renewable energy and electrification. $725 million of that increase is projected at ComEd for data center and other high intense new load growth, along with increasing renewables and retirements of older fossil fuel generation is driving increased transmission investment needs.', 'The balance of the additional transmission largely relates to the two large transmission projects discussed on prior earnings calls. The RTEP reliability Window 3 projects awarded by PJM to mitigate reliability challenges driven by incremental data center demand in the region and the other assigned due to the retirement of the brand insurance coal plant. While some of the transmission capital at ComEd is expected to go in service during the guidance period, very little of the transmission spend for the large East Coast project is reflected in the updated rate base outlook. Brand Insurance is expected to go into service in 2028, while the RTEP Window 3 project will be in service closer to 2030, providing line of sight to strong rate base growth beyond the current guidance window.', 'We continue to expect there will be transmission opportunity across our service territories, associated with the same drivers underpinning these projects, high-density, localized load growth, traditional fossil fuel plant retirements increased renewables, not to mention from our extremely well-positioned footprint on the Mid-Atlantic Coast for offshore wind interconnection. To further put our competitive position into perspective, all but one mile of those two large transmission projects is expected to occur on our existing rightways. We expect to remain active in seeking additional opportunities to lead in this space. And as always, we will only include spend in our plan that is identified and expected to proceed tied to the needs of our jurisdictions.', ""In total, our capital plan updates are expected to result in an increase to rate base of 7.5% over the next four years on a compound annual growth basis to $74 billion. This growth adds approximately $18.5 billion to rate base from 2024 through 2027 and reflects a shift in the mix of our total capital growth portfolio by 2% from distribution to transmission since the last disclosure update despite a significant portion of the transmission capital added, not yet placed in service. Exelon's transmission rate base growth recovered through FERC formula rate provides a stable and predictable financial profile. As clean energy and electrification continue to grow, our transmission strategy is designed to adapt to this new paradigm, while continuing to operate the transmission system at world class levels."", ""Moving to slide 11. One way to ensure sustainability of our capital growth profile is to continue delivering superior value as efficiently as possible to our customers and communities. And as one Exelon, we are building from a strong foundation. Our history of steady cost discipline, while delivering a premier experience for our customers has positioned us very well, as you can see in the chart on the right. Exelon's investment in grid modernization has enabled an approximate 40% increase in reliability performance across the platform, whether based on outage frequency or outage duration, while maintaining average electric rates 17% below the top 20 metropolitan cities in the United States. More simply put, when a dollar is placed in our hands to invest, our customers entrust us to create value through reliable, affordable service."", ""Had our adjusted O&M costs growing in line with historical annualized inflation rate of 3.5% from 2016 through 2024, they would have increased by approximately $1.2 billion. Instead, we are projecting a 2.4% CAGR for the same period, eliminating $400 million of customer rate increases that would have occurred without our intentional focus on driving efficiencies. And while 2024 is expected to grow at a higher rate, one key driver is the number of significant back office and operational IT system investments whose savings will be monetized over a longer period of time, as I'll discuss in a minute. In addition, upon aligning with several of our jurisdictions on the spending programs associated with advancing their state's energy goals and priorities, through the recently approved rate cases, we are anticipating some catch up to meet the levels of service and investment agreed upon with our jurisdictions."", ""However, we expect to maintain an annualized growth rate of approximately 2% through 2027, a below inflation level that is expected to result in – to our customers over $400 million lower than they otherwise would have been. Our expectation is to limit the annualized O&M growth rate to approximately 2% over the long-term and maintain our competitive position with rates among those that are the lowest in the nation will improve our customers' experiences. In fact, our multiyear plan rate structures allow us to quickly flow any benefits back to customers. Let me take a moment to highlight a few ways in which we continue delivering value for our customers. First, as Calvin mentioned, a permanent team has established in 2023 to continue efforts to standardize and streamline the structure and operations of the organization."", 'Ensuring all of our efforts are coordinated with the sole purpose of serving our customers and communities in an efficient and superior manner. Second, we have several initiatives underway to upgrade major enterprise resource planning, customer billing and automated work order systems expected to create work efficiencies, some of which I mentioned are driving our spend in 2024. Third, we are standardizing storm response protocol to increase rolled transparency and accountability and emergency events, mitigating cost risk and improving restoration performance in the future. Fourth, we are delivering a framework to migrate from a preventive maintenance, asset management strategy to an automated condition-based maintenance strategy in our transmission operations.', 'And lastly, we are streamlining processes and leveraging technology, particularly in the call center and field for increased efficiency and responsiveness to our customers. To ensure that R&R remain strong and we can invest at the levels our jurisdictions want, we are committed to leveraging our size and scale as one Exelon to manage costs across our operating companies and deliver affordable rates for our customers. Turning to slide 12. With $34.5 billion of projected capital spend driving 7.5% rate base growth and with continued focus on earning ROEs of 9% to 10%. We are initiating an annualized operating earnings growth target of 5% to 7% through 2027 from our 2023 guidance midpoint of $2.36 per share. The lower growth outlook from what we previously laid out is not a decision we took lightly, but as a result of the challenging rate case outcomes and decelerated piece of investment in Illinois.', 'As you heard from Calvin, Illinois is only one jurisdiction in which we operate. We are continuing momentum in our other jurisdictions as the second multiyear plans at Pepco progressed in line with our expectations, as PECO anticipates filing in the first half of this year, consistent with our general two to three-year rate case cadence and does all of our utilities execute on the robust transmission strategy and cost management initiatives outlined on the prior slide. Accordingly, we are confident that our earnings CAGR will be at midpoint or better of the 5% to 7% range over the 2023 to 2027 period and in future updates. Even with the process in Illinois remaining uncertain, our earnings growth guidance is resilient and account for the possibility that limited progress is made in Illinois, and we need to significantly reduce investment in common distribution further.', 'We also continue to project an approximate 60% dividend payout ratio of operating earnings, with the dividend growing in line with our long-term earnings target. We announced today an expected annualized dividend of $1.52 per share in 2024 which is over 5.5% higher than the 23% dividends. Maintaining our commitment to transparency and predictability, we have provided year-over-year drivers contributing to the expected annual growth in our earnings through 2027 on slide 13. While there is variability in the year-over-year growth over the four year time period, the business drivers provide transparency into our expected 5% to 7% growth through 2027. Including an expectation to deliver every year after 2024 within the 5% to 7% range, if not above.', ""I will conclude with a review of our balance sheet activity on slide 14. As you have heard from us before, maintaining a strong balance sheet is core to our strategy, and we closed out another year with credit metrics comfortably exceeding S&P and Moody's downgrade thresholds of 12%. Similar to the first two years since operation, over the guidance period, we project to continue to have approximately 100 basis points of cushion on average for our consolidated corporate credit metrics above the threshold specified by the agencies. While the final rate order issued by the commission in Illinois negatively impacted our future cash flow outlook, we have largely mitigated those impacts through cost management and curtailment of distribution capital spend at ComEd, while ensuring we maintain a safe, reliable growth for customers."", ""As we identify new investments in the plan, we are funding in a prudent manner by incorporating an incremental $1.3 billion of equity to ensure we maintain our previous commitment on pushing and keep us on a path to 13% to 14% consolidated credit metrics over time. As our consolidated spend profile has shifted more towards transmission, the cash generated from these longer-dated investments is expected to follow the earnings largely beyond the guidance period and further strengthen our credit metrics over time. Additionally, I'd remind you that our plan continues to incorporate the assumption that the corporate alternative minimum tax will not allow for repairs. If implemented in a way that mitigates the cash impact, we'd expect an increase of approximately 50 basis points to our consolidated credit metrics average on average over the plan, which would provide incremental cushion."", 'From a financing perspective, we expect the $34.5 billion capital plan to be supported by $19 billion of internally generated cash flow. $10 billion of debt at the utilities and $3 billion of debt at the holding company with the balance funded with a modest amount of equity. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we completed $142 million of equity via our ATM and expect $150 million to be issued in 2024. And as mentioned, to fund the robust $3.2 billion of incremental capital opportunities while maintaining a strong balance sheet, our financing plan includes $1.3 billion of additional equity that we expect to issue over the 2025 through 2027 period. The incremental equity funds 40% of the incremental capital investments over the four-year plan and represent slightly more than 1% per year of Exelon current market cap.', ""As we work with our jurisdictions and identify needs for further investment of utilities, we anticipate that any incremental capital investment will be funded by no more than approximately 40% equity. I want to close by reiterating our confidence in investing an estimated $35 billion of capital across our diversified platform from 2024 to 2027, driving 5% to 7% earnings growth from 2023 to 2027 with an expectation of midpoint or better and maintaining a strong balance sheet while doing so. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Calvin for his closing remarks."", ""Calvin Butler: Thank you, Jeanne. I'd like to conclude with our priorities and commitments for this year and remind you of Exelon's unique value proposition for their jurisdictions it serves and its investors. As you'll see, they're very consistent with our focus areas for 2024, a good reminder that we aim to reliably deliver against a predictable and consistent strategy, as you'd expect from a premier utility. First, you can count on us to prioritize operational excellence and safety in service of our customers. As you may have seen, once the creation of a Chief Operating Officer position and named Mike Innocenzo, the CEO of PECO to that role. Mike will build on the top-tier performance level customers have come to expect. And in succeeding him, Dave Velazquez, will bring his wealth of experience and strong leadership to PECO."", ""Both moves are a testament to the unparalleled bench strength that Exelon enjoys. And our Chief Human Resource Officer, Amy Best, has been instrumental in building that advantage. We wish her all the best in her next chapter and look forward to Denise Galambos' leadership as Exelon's new Head of HR. Second, we expect to deliver on the prudent financial plan that we have laid out. Spending $7.4 billion less in the grid on behalf of our customers and communities, earning a consolidated return on equity in the 9% to 10% range, consistent with the cost of investing in the grid, and delivering earnings in the range of $2.40 and $2.50 per share, while maintaining a strong balance sheet in executing our financing strategy. Next, we expect to reach collaborative and constructive outcome of the rate cases we have underway, along with the ones we expect to initiate in 2024 to ensure we can continue to deliver safe, reliable, and affordable energy to our customers and help the states make their desired progress on their energy goals."", ""And we will continue our efforts to ensure the energy transformation is as equitable and affordable as possible. Building on our success in 2023 in mid-January, we submitted seven concept papers for the next $3.9 billion that the Department of Energy's grid deployment office is making available under its GRIP program enabled by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. With proposals ranging from software across the enterprise to enable increasing levels of distributed renewable energy sources to target an investment at Pepco Holdings to combat coastal impacts of climate change they highlight our creative and far-reaching efforts to partner with our jurisdictions and creatively line local state and federal policy. And beyond accessing these funding sources, as Jeanne highlighted, we will continue our efforts to standardize and simplify our operations to manage the increases in costs associated with the expanding needs of the grid, while delivering premium for customers."", ""Lastly, what's distinct this year is a recognition that last December's final order in the ComEd multiyear plan did not bring the resolution on how to invest over the coming years in the first rate case process undertaken by the approach laid out in the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. But while we are disappointed, we are not deterred. We are committed to finding a path forward with stakeholders that restore certainty for our customers, employees and investors. We believe everyone wants a level of investment that can deliver on the promise of seizure and positions us to lead the energy transformation. And so will we be working toward that outcome while preparing to pivot if that's not the case. Delivering against these priorities while continuing to establish our position as a premier T&D utility, and Slide 16 reinforces that value that we offer."", ""Exelon's platform is incredibly unique. We have the privilege and responsibility serving some of the nation's greatest cities with jurisdictions that recognize the unique opportunity they have to lead the energy transformation. Our asset footprint, the transmission and distribution network that is the lifeblood of making that transformation happen for our jurisdictions is unmatched. As is our scale with over 10.5 million customers across our seven ratemaking jurisdictions. We have been setting the bar for operational performance for years and our ability to invest to support that performance is backed by strong forward-looking and predictable regulatory mechanisms. With our dividend yield at 4.5% and a 5% to 7% annualized earnings growth rate that we have a strong conviction in achieving, we are offering investors total shareholder returns in the 9.5% to 11.5% range and extremely attracted risk-adjusted proposition."", ""I am so proud of this team for the commitments made and kept in 2023, and we look forward to doing the same in 2024. As always, thank you for your time and support, and we'll now take your questions."", 'See also 13 Best Short Squeeze Stocks To Buy Now and 10 Fastest Growing Energy Drink Stocks in the US.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Not surprisingly, Comcast continues to lose video subscribers. In the third quarter, it lost 561,000 video subscribers, while in the fourth quarter it lost 389,000. It ended 2023 with 14.1 million video customers, so it is still seeing meaningful losses each quarter.', 'This has also started to bleed over into losing broadband customers as well. Comcast saw an unexpected decline in broadband customers in the third quarter, when it lost 18,000 customers. The decline accelerated in the fourth quarter as it lost 34,000 broadband subscribers. It ended the year with 32.25 million broadband subscribers. Now while cord cutting is pretty much a given at this point, it does appear the company is losing some business to its competitors, which is not something that was expected to happen.', 'Comcast expects the broadband market to be more stable in 2024, but any accelerated cord-cutting and continued loss of broadband customers remain its biggest risks. To counteract the latter, it has invested in connectivity to both pass through more homes and businesses, as well as increase speeds and lower latency through its DOCSIS 4.0 technology. It began rolling out this new technology last fall and will continue to roll it out across the country over the next few years.', ""One area where the company has been doing well with adding subscribers, meanwhile, is with wireless services. The company is a mobile virtual network operator that uses Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) wireless network. Like most MVNOs, it plans are cheaper than the major carriers, but unlike most MVNOs, it comes with the Xfinity brand name and can be bundled with its other services.

It ended the year with 6.58 million subscribers."", ""Comcast's Peacock streaming service has also been growing the top line nicely, and it will look to turn the business Ebitda positive in the next couple of years. The streaming service accounted for $2.7 billion in Ebitda losses in 2023, so turning this business profitable is a big opportunity.

If the company were to buy back $10 billion in shares in 2024, it would reduce its share count by about 240 million.', 'Given its low revenue growth, but solid balance sheet (2.40 times leverage), strong free cash and opportunity to scale and leverage Peacock, I think a 7 to 8 times multiple is fair. Taking into account the share reduction over the next year and placing a 7 to 8 times multiple on 2025 Ebitda would value the stock between $51 and $61.50 in about a year.', 'Despite facing cord-cutting headwinds for a while now, Comcast has done a nice job of steadily growing its revenue over the years. Peacock should continue to drive revenue growth going forward and eventually get enough scale to turn Ebitda profitable. Meanwhile, I expect the broadband business to be remain steady and for it to continue to gain wireless subscribers.', 'As such, I think Comcast is a solid choice for dividend growth investors. The company has steadily grown its dividend for over a decade and a half, while more recently it has been aggressively using cash to reduce its share count.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.', ""Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration company have returned +6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, which Devon Energy falls in, has gained 8.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $1.39 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -16.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2%.', 'The consensus earnings estimate of $5.67 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -31.8%. This estimate has changed -3.1% over the last 30 days.', 'For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.34 indicates a change of -5.8% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.1%.', ""Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Devon Energy is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell)."", ""The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:"", '12 Month EPS', 'Projected Revenue Growth', ""Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial."", 'For Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $3.87 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -10%. For the current and next fiscal years, $15.06 billion and $14.95 billion estimates indicate -21.5% and -0.7% changes, respectively.', 'Last Reported Results and Surprise History', 'Devon Energy reported revenues of $3.84 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -29.4%. EPS of $1.65 for the same period compares with $2.18 a year ago.', 'Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.03 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -4.82%. The EPS surprise was +5.77%.', 'Over the last four quarters, Devon Energy surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company could not beat consensus revenue estimates in any of the last four quarters.', 'Valuation', ""Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects."", ""While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price."", 'The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.', 'Devon Energy is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers.

This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for P10, Inc.', 'For P10, Inc.The Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate.

Would post earnings of $0.18 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.20, delivering a surprise of +11.11%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success.

Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", ""P10, Inc. Doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

Of course, if you have more, please feel free to jump back in queue. With that, I'll turn it over to Joe."", ""Joe Russell: Thank you, Ryan, and thank you for joining us today. Tom and I will walk you through our fourth quarter and full year 2023 performance, industry views and 2024 outlook. Then we'll open it up for Q&A. 2023 was a year of significant achievement for public storage amidst a competitive industry environment. The team elevated our customer experience and financial profile through digital and operating model transformation. Enhanced existing properties with over 500 solar installations and the Property of Tomorrow program. Advanced complementary business lines, including tenant reinsurance and third-party management and grew the portfolio through acquisitions, development and redevelopment. We did so while maintaining one of the real estate industry's best balance sheets, which is poised to fund growth moving forward in conjunction with significant retained cash flow."", 'Just a few of our collective accomplishments include: exceeding 3,000 owned properties and serving nearly 2 million in-place customers. Achieving an approximately 80% stabilized direct NOI margin through revenue generation and expense efficiency that only Public Storage is capable of. Acquiring and quickly integrating the $2.2 billion Simply Self Storage portfolio with approximately 90,000 customers across nearly 130 properties. This was the largest private acquisition in company history. Increasing the size of our high-growth non-same-store pool to 705 properties and 63 million square feet now comprising nearly 30% of our overall portfolio. Generating record revenues, net operating income and core funds from operations. Accelerating growth in third-party property management, adding 132 properties and reaching 324 properties in total.', ""And receiving several accolades tied to sustainability including NAREIT's Leader in the Light Award, a second consecutive great Place to Work award and achieving top scoring benchmarks among U.S. self-storage REITs. The strength of our team, platform and brand was evident with move-in volumes up an impressive 9% in 2023, despite a backdrop of weaker customer demand during the year. The new customer environment remains challenging, but we have seen a degree of improvement in move-in rent trends recently. And our in-place customer base continues to perform well with average length of stay that are longer than the historic norm. We expect demand from new customers to stabilize during 2024 and the behavior of existing customers including our recent move-ins to remain strong due to clear macro conditions, including the potential for a soft landing, the potential for easing interest rates, resilient consumers, leveling home sales and strong home renter behavior."", ""We also anticipate fewer completions of new self-storage facilities nationally reducing the competitive impact of new supply in our local markets. All in, the industry is in better position entering 2024 than it was entering 2023. The full Public Storage team is focused on exercising our competitive advantages, which include advancing our digital and operating model transformation, expanding complementary businesses and creating partnerships across the broader industry, growing the portfolio through acquisitions, development, redevelopment and third-party management, and funding innovation and growth today and into the future with the industry's best balance sheet. All of this adds to the growth of our business over the near, medium and long term."", ""And it comes at a time with the potential for further stabilization in the move-in environment, existing customers exhibiting strong behavior and an outlook for new competitive supply that is clearly in our favor. With good trends in customer demand, less pressure from new supply and our numerous competitive advantages, we are well positioned for 2024 and beyond. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom."", ""Tom Boyle: Thanks, Joe. On to financial performance, we finished the year reporting core FFO of $4.20 for the quarter and $16.89 for the year, ahead of the upper end of our guidance range representing 1% growth over the fourth quarter of '22, and 8.3% growth for 2023 overall, excluding the impact of PSB. Looking at the same-store portfolio, revenue increased 80 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of '22, at the higher end of our expectation. That was driven by better move-in volume and move-in rate performance. On expenses, same-store cost of operations were up 5.1% for the fourth quarter, largely driven by increases in marketing spend to support that move-in activity. In total, net operating income for the same-store pool of stabilized properties declined 50 basis points in the quarter."", ""Meanwhile, the non-same-store NOI grew 31% and 25% for the fourth quarter and '23, respectively, demonstrating the continued strength of our lease-up and non-stabilized assets. Now turning to the outlook for '24. We introduced 2024 core FFO guidance with a $16.90 midpoint on par with 2023. As Joe mentioned, we entered the year more encouraged than we were last year at this time. We've seen the industry work through the declines in new customer demand from the peaks of 2021. We're anticipating that new customer demand stabilizes in 2024 as the macroeconomic picture becomes clearer. That paired with a consistently strong consumer and lower new competitive new supply. If we look at the same-store outlook for '24 specifically, the midpoint calls for revenue on par with '23."", ""Similar to last year, move-in rates continue to be the biggest variable in the forecast heading through 2024 as well. We're anticipating at the midpoint case that move-in rents lap easier comps through the year, and crossed zero on a year-over-year basis towards the end of the summer. And occupancy results down 80 basis points, which is roughly on top of 2019 occupancies as we sit here today. Our expectations are for 2.75% same-store expense growth driven primarily by property tax and marketing expense. That leads to same-store NOI growth at the midpoint of a decline of 90 basis points. Our non-same-store acquisition and development properties are poised to be a strong contributor again in 2024, growing from $370 million of NOI contribution in '23 to $505 million at the midpoint and will grow from there in future years."", ""In addition, embedded in the outlook is incremental acquisition and development activity, $500 million of acquisitions, and we plan to deliver a record $450 million of development in '24. Finally, our capital and liquidity position remains solid. Our leverage of 3.9x net debt and preferred to EBITDA combined with nearly $400 million of cash on hand at quarter end puts us in a very strong position heading into 2024. With that, I'll turn it back to you, Rob."", 'See also 10 Countries with the Most Military Drones in the World and 11 Best Semiconductor Stocks To Invest In for the AI Boom.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

It will have to compete with China, which is also offering more generous government incentives, and perhaps burgeoning private efforts like Altman's goal of raising up to $7 trillion for semiconductor manufacturing, according to a Wall Street Journal report."", 'The plan has garnered a skeptical media and industry response to whether such a project is possible, as well as the tone Altman has taken.

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with MCD.', ""On February 22, 2024, McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) released its 10-K filing, providing a comprehensive overview of its financial performance and strategic initiatives. As the world's largest restaurant owner-operator, McDonald's reported system sales of $130 billion in 2023, demonstrating its expansive reach across 42,000 stores in 115 markets. The company's revenue streams are primarily derived from franchise royalty fees and lease payments, which constitute about 60% of its total revenue. The remaining revenue is generated from company-operated stores, which are strategically segmented into the United States, internationally operated markets, and international developmental/licensed markets. McDonald's Corp's financial tables reveal a company that is not only a leader in the quick-service restaurant industry but also one that is actively investing in its future through digital innovation and global business services, all while navigating a complex and competitive landscape."", 'Global Brand Recognition and Customer Loyalty: McDonald\'s Corp (NYSE:MCD) boasts one of the most recognizable brands in the world, with a loyal customer base that spans across diverse demographics and geographies. The ""McDonald\'s"" trademark and the Golden Arches logo are considered critical assets, contributing significantly to the company\'s competitive advantage.

This global brand equity is a testament to McDonald\'s consistent quality, service, and innovation, which have solidified its market position.', ""Franchise Model and Financial Health: McDonald's Corp's franchise model has been a cornerstone of its success, allowing for rapid expansion and a strong, steady stream of revenue from royalty fees and lease payments. The company's financial health is underpinned by its robust balance sheet, with system sales growth contributing to a healthy operating margin in the mid-to-high 40% range. The franchise model also facilitates scalability and risk distribution, as independent franchisees bear a significant portion of the capital and operational costs."", ""Operational Complexity and Supply Chain Risks: Despite its strengths, McDonald's Corp faces challenges related to the complexity of its global operations and supply chain management. The company relies on numerous independent suppliers for food, packaging, and equipment, which can lead to potential disruptions and increased costs. These risks are exacerbated by geopolitical tensions, such as the war in the Middle East, which have negatively impacted systemwide sales and revenue, particularly in the International Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate segment."", ""Labor Market Dynamics: The quick-service restaurant industry is labor-intensive, and McDonald's is not immune to the challenges of attracting and retaining a qualified workforce. The company has experienced difficulties in staffing certain restaurants adequately, which can affect service speed, operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction. Additionally, the competitive labor market has led to increased costs associated with recruitment and retention, impacting the company's profitability."", ""Digital Innovation and Customer Experience Transformation: McDonald's Corp has identified significant opportunities in digital innovation and customer experience enhancement. The company's investments in technology, digital engagement, and delivery services are aimed at meeting evolving consumer preferences and improving service models. Initiatives such as mobile ordering, payment systems, and drive-thru technologies are expected to drive growth and customer loyalty, positioning McDonald's at the forefront of the digital revolution in the quick-service restaurant sector."", ""Global Expansion and Market Penetration: With plans to open more than 2,100 restaurants globally in 2024, McDonald's Corp is poised to further penetrate existing markets and enter new ones. The company's strategy includes a mix of company-operated and franchised locations, with a focus on unit expansion contributing nearly 2% to systemwide sales growth. This expansion underscores McDonald's commitment to increasing its global footprint and capitalizing on emerging market opportunities."", ""Intense Competition and Market Saturation: McDonald's Corp operates in a highly competitive informal eating out (IEO) segment, facing pressure from traditional, fast casual, and other food service competitors. The company must continuously innovate and adapt to maintain its market share, as competitors may introduce new products, technologies, or consolidate, potentially impacting McDonald's sales and guest counts."", ""Regulatory and Environmental Challenges: The company is subject to a myriad of laws and regulations across the jurisdictions it operates in. New environmental laws or regulations could increase operational costs and complexity. McDonald's commitment to sustainability, including initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support deforestation-free sourcing, is crucial in navigating these challenges and meeting stakeholder expectations."", ""In conclusion, McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) presents a compelling case of a company with formidable strengths, including its global brand recognition and proven franchise model, which have underpinned its financial success. However, it must contend with operational complexities, labor market challenges, and the relentless pace of competition. The company's strategic investments in digital innovation and global expansion offer significant opportunities for growth, while regulatory pressures and environmental concerns pose ongoing threats. As McDonald's continues to adapt to an uncertain macro environment, its ability to leverage its strengths and mitigate its weaknesses will be critical in maintaining its leadership position in the quick-service restaurant industry."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Looking back at history, it's evident that dividend-paying stocks have often outperformed other types of investments. Opting for dividend stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) can be particularly advantageous. This index comprises numerous dividend-paying stocks, notably blue-chip companies renowned for their consistent dividend increases. In 2023, the DJIA saw a significant increase of 14%, with 19 component stocks experiencing gains while 11 component stocks faced declines over the course of the year. Towards the end of the year, in December, the index reached a record-breaking high, surpassing the $37,000 mark."", 'Apart from delivering robust returns over the years, dividends have also maintained their significance as a growing component of personal income. As per a report from S&P Dow Jones Indices, the proportion of personal income attributed to dividend earnings has consistently risen over time, underscoring their importance as a source of income. In 2012, dividend income accounted for 5.64% of per capita personal income in the U.S., compared to 4.39% in the previous decade and 3.51% two decades prior. Conversely, during this same period, interest income from capital markets has steadily declined, dropping to 7.39% in 2012 from 13.51% in 1992. According to the report, the total dividend income, adjusted for inflation to $2000, experienced a substantial rise from $187.6 billion in 1992 to $757 billion in 2012, marking an impressive growth of over 300%. In contrast, interest income grew by less than 100% over the same period.', ""When investors consider dividend stocks for their portfolios, they often prioritize dividend yields. However, it's important to note that companies offering high yields but lacking solid financial stability could face the risk of reducing dividends, especially amidst global economic uncertainties and increasing interest rates. Therefore, investment strategies aimed at high yields should also prioritize the quality and stability of the companies in question. The Dow Jones Dividend 100 Index Series tracks the performance of 100 high-dividend-yielding stocks within each covered market, chosen for their consistent dividend payments and strong fundamental strength. When utilizing any income strategy, market participants typically prioritize both yield and capital gain. The Dow Jones Dividend 100 Indices have demonstrated superior yields and comparable capital gains over the long term when compared to their respective benchmarks. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, for the period spanning from June 30, 2001, to June 30, 2023, the total return of the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index, which assumes theoretical reinvestment of dividends, averaged 11.7% annually.

That includes some of the sector's highest performers: Prologis (NYSE: PLD), Extra Space Storage (NYSE: EXR), and Equity Lifestyle Properties (NYSE: ELS). With interest rates set to fall this year, these top REITs look like no-brainer dividend stocks to buy right now for those with around $1,000 to invest."", ""Prologis is one of the five best-performing REITs over the past decade. However, like most of its peers, it's trading well off its peak. Shares of the leading industrial REIT are more than 20% below their pinnacle from a few years ago. Even with that decline, Prologis has grown $1,000 into nearly $4,400 over the past 10 years. "", 'That slump came even though Prologis has continued to increase its core funds from operations (FFO) and dividend at strong rates. As a result, it trades at a much lower valuation and offers a higher dividend yield (currently 2.6%).', 'The company sees more room for expansion ahead. The REIT expects strong demand for warehouse space to drive 7.5% to 8.5% annual net operating income growth across its existing portfolio over the next few years. Add in value-creating development projects, and its core FFO per share should rise by 9% to 11% annually through 2026. It could grow even faster if it makes acquisitions. That positions the REIT to deliver double-digit total annual returns with additional upside potential if its valuation multiple expands following its rate-driven contraction. ', 'Extra Space Storage has been another top-five performer among REITs over the past decade. The self-storage REIT has grown a $1,000 investment into over $4,200 during the last 10 years. Powering those returns is the rapid growth in its core FFO per share (695% since 2011) and dividend (548% over the last decade). ', 'Investors can currently buy this magnificent value-creating REIT at a 40% discount to its peak price. That enables them to lock in a much higher dividend yield (4.6% at present). ', 'Extra Space is in an excellent position to continue creating value for investors. The REIT recently closed its needle-moving merger with Life Storage, forming the largest self-storage operator in the country. The deal will boost its core FFO per share while enhancing its growth profile. The company also has the financial flexibility to continue expanding its property portfolio and growing its sector-leading third-party management platform. ', 'Equity Lifestyle Properties has also been a top-five performer in the REIT sector over the past 10 years. That has enabled it to grow a $1,000 investment into more than $4,200 during that period. The residential REIT has expanded at an above-average rate by focusing on investments off the beaten path, like manufactured housing, RV parks, and marinas. It increased its normalized FFO per share at a 9% compound annual rate from 2006 to 2022 while boosting its dividend at a 21% compound annual rate during that period. ', 'The high-performing REIT currently sells for around 25% below its recent peak price. That enables investors to lock in a higher dividend yield (about 2.9% presently). ', 'Equity Lifestyle should continue growing at an above-average rate. Demand for manufactured housing is strong due to the high cost of single-family homes. Meanwhile, demand for experiences like camping and boating is rising as more people retire or take the time to enjoy the great outdoors. Those factors are driving healthy growth rates at its existing properties. Meanwhile, the REIT has a strong balance sheet, giving it the financial flexibility to expand its portfolio by making acquisitions and investing in expansion projects.', 'Prologis, Extra Space Storage, and Equity Lifestyle have a knack for creating shareholder value. They were three of the five best-performing REITs over the past 10 years. However, they currently trade at steep discounts to their peak prices due to the rise in interest rates.

The new strategy, dubbed Tricolor, is designed to segregate priority overnight parcels from slower freight to keep sort centers more fluid and lower expenses.', '“FedEx’s new Tricolor initiative muddies the water, making it less clear how much air capacity and cost the company will reduce. Nonetheless, we view potential cessation of USPS flying or a renegotiated contract as driving earnings upside for FedEx,” Oglenski said in a recent client report. “We see FedEx as potentially able to cut 50% of daytime network capacity if the USPS contract is not renewed, which we estimate could save the company $1.5 billion.', '“UPS operates a much smaller daytime air operation, effectively only flying aircraft where two-to-three day service commitments cannot be achieved by truck. We believe a similar footprint at FedEx could be accretive to earnings, as the company would not be trying to sell expensive air capacity into truck dominated linehaul markets.”', 'A majority of FedEx Express’ air network is geared to daytime flying for the Postal Service. Over nearly a quarter-century, the Postal Service has grown into FedEx’s largest customer. Conversely, FedEx has been the largest provider of air transportation capacity to the Postal Service for 20 consecutive years, according to data compiled by David Hendel, a transportation attorney at Culhane Meadows. But under a streamlining initiative four years ago, the agency decided to use less air transportation and rely more on cheaper ground carriers, which is eating into FedEx Express volumes distributed via its Memphis, Tennessee, hub.', '', 'FedEx’s revenue from its Postal Service contract in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 2022, fell $236 million to $1.9 billion and is expected to decrease again in Hendel’s next list. Postal business represents 4% of total and 10% of domestic Express revenue at FedEx. The contract previously generated annual revenue of at least $2 billion.', 'FedEx devotes about 100 aircraft to carry postal business at an annual cost of about $3 billion, according to Oglenski’s research. In its December earnings report, the company identified the Postal Service contract as a $400 million drag on earnings. The Priority Mail packages that FedEx primarily hauls have a similar service (two to three days) and pricing profile to packages moved by ground transport, which translates to lower yields and margins when using air transport.', 'FedEx officials privately acknowledge that the Postal Service contract is barely profitable. Minimum service requirements have forced FedEx to commit expensive plane capacity to relatively low-yielding parcel volume.', 'Pat DiMento, FedEx’s vice president of flight operations and training, recently told a group of airline employees that the postal contract led to network inefficiencies as FedEx accommodated increases in mail volumes while priority flying at night stayed the same, according to audio of the private meeting obtained by FreightWaves. A route from Raleigh, North Carolina, to Memphis, for example, might only require a small jet for overnight delivery, but FedEx will upsize to a larger freighter to meet the daytime mail requirement.', 'FedEx is likely to lose 50% of its daytime flying with the Postal Service, he speculated.', 'Largely due to the Postal Service business, domestic air operations are much larger at Fed Express than at UPS despite their having a similar share of the high-yielding express package market.', 'FedEx’s mainline fleet is 43% larger than UPS’ — 418 to 292 aircraft, according to company fact sheets. The company operates 24% more flights and has 40% more capacity than its rival, resulting in annual airline operating expenses of $18 billion compared to $8 billion at UPS, Oglenski estimated. (He acknowledged the figures are skewed a bit because FedEx tends to allocate a greater share of parcel network costs in the airline to the income statement than does UPS.)', 'The Barclays analyst said air assets with high fixed costs are justified for express networks. They depend on highly orchestrated operations with precision scheduling to meet demanding service expectations, and carriers can charge a significant premium above standard transportation.', 'While FedEx generates $6 billion more global airfreight revenue than UPS, overreliance on the air network has suppressed operating profits for a long time, Oglenski argued.', 'Under the Tricolor strategy, however, FedEx also intends to aggressively go after heavyweight cargo booked by logistics providers to offset slower growth in the main Express product and declining postal business. Executives announced that the fleet will be reallocated to the so-called Orange network, which will operate off-schedule to carry heavy freight that doesn’t require maximum speed and is better suited for a truck-fly-truck delivery model than flying the entire trip. These planes will fly into primary and regional sortation centers such as Newark, New Jersey, and Oakland, California, during the daytime when workers have more time to build dense pallets. The idea is that by segregating parcels and freight, the hub facilities will operate more efficiently because the two shipment types are processed differently.', 'Although management has publicly discussed shrinking the freighter fleet in line with lower demand, DiMento said the new strategy is aimed at shippers with both parcel and freight needs that like using a single service provider when possible.', '“If we don’t capture some of that middle band, we will never get their [shippers’] freight that is also in the priority range. Right now, we don’t offer much in that middle band to save money for these companies. So they are trying to capture that so that we can also grow what is our priority, international business,” he said in the private meeting.', 'Management pushed back on the characterization that the company is going after general cargo, saying the Orange network will function as an extension of the carrier’s shared truckload networks around the world.', 'Tricolor “expands FedEx’s offerings across the globe for freight shipments which have similar characteristics to less-than-truckload vs. the much heavier and lower yield per-pound consignments which are the provenance of traditional all-cargo carriers,” Richard Smith, president and CEO of airline and international at FedEx Express, said in a letter to FreightWaves. “In addition to international LTL shipments, the Orange network handles International Economy packages that similarly interface with FedEx’s global ground parcel systems at very low incremental costs.”', 'Oglenski questioned the attempt to offer underutilized aircraft space to the “saturated deferred freight market, dominated by improved and much lower cost LTL offerings from the likes of FedEx Freight, Old Dominion and XPO.”', 'When the Postal Service contract comes up for renewal later this year, FedEx needs to renegotiate for better pricing on a smaller piece of the Priority Mail business or consider walking away from the contract, he said. FedEx has previously said the Postal Service contract will need to be revised for it to consider renewal.', '“We appreciate the relationship we have enjoyed with the United States Postal Service for the past 22 years. Like any other customer relationship, we are focused on ensuring it continues to make good business sense for both parties as we each realign our networks for the future,” the company said in a statement.', 'Jettisoning the postal business presents an opportunity to halve the daytime air operation and rely more heavily on cheaper linehaul movement of deferred packages, as UPS does, said Oglenski.', '“While we find the desire to keep capacity in the market admirable, decades of margin underperformance and lack of generating re-investable returns suggest the more prudent action is downsizing operations,” he wrote.', 'Click here for more FreightWaves and American Shipper articles by Eric Kulisch.', 'FedEx braces for 50% cut in Postal Service air contract', 'FedEx fleet restructure poses threat to freighter operators', 'The post How FedEx could win by losing its Postal Service business appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

The S&P 500 has long been a source of passive income. But investing in an S&P 500 index fund yields just 1.5% right now, far lower than the risk-free 10-year Treasury rate at 4.2%.', ""The S&P 500's yield is down because the index's growth has outpaced the growth rate of many top dividend stocks, and the fact that the index is now made up of a higher percentage of companies that don't pay dividends at all (or very low dividends)."", ""Chevron (NYSE: CVX), United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS), and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) all yield more than double the S&P 500. Here's why each dividend stock is worth buying now."", 'A lot is going right for Chevron right now. The company just raised its dividend by 8% to a record high thanks to a strong overall performance in 2023. It also bought back a record amount of its own stock last year.', ""And to top it all off, Berkshire Hathaway's latest 13F filing showed that it increased its Chevron stake by 14.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023."", 'Chevron is down 17.8% from its all-time high, but if oil prices remain where they are, it has what it takes to make a new all-time high.', ""West Texas Intermediate, the domestic benchmark oil price, is $78 a barrel as of this writing. It's not the blowout price we saw in 2022, but Chevron doesn't need a triple-digit oil price to generate gobs of free cash flow."", ""Technological improvements, portfolio optimization, and cost reductions have combined to make today's market leaders some of the most efficient and profitable producers the energy industry has ever seen."", ""Chevron has the balance sheet needed to handle a drawdown in oil prices, and plenty of upside potential if oil prices climb from here. It also has a 4% dividend yield, which is competitive in today's market."", ""UPS hasn't always been the high-yield dividend stock it is today. In early 2022, it raised its dividend by 49% on the back of record years in 2020 and 2021. It has raised its dividend slightly since then. Today, it pays a $1.63 quarterly dividend, good for a forward yield of 4.4%."", ""As you can see in the chart, UPS' yield is higher than historic levels, Chevron's has moved up and down due to the volatility of the oil and gas industry, Coke's has stayed consistent, and the yield of the S&P 500 has trended down."", ""UPS' yield is particularly high because the stock has been under pressure. Despite management's hopes, the surge in package delivery volumes in 2020 and 2021 has proved to be less sticky than originally thought. Revenue has been declining, but it's the profitability that has taken the biggest hit since UPS has continued to invest in growth and route expansions."", 'Operating margins went from a 10-year high to near a 10-year low. Earnings are getting closer to reaching their pre-pandemic levels. And so is the stock price, which finished 2019 at $117 a share and is currently around $148.', ""The setup for UPS makes a lot of sense. The company is undergoing a cyclical downturn but is less than 30% higher than where it finished in 2019. That's way too low for all of the improvements UPS has made over the last four years, not to mention the dividend is far higher today."", ""Results for UPS will probably get worse or at least languish before they get better. But if you're patient, it could be a great turnaround play to buy now, not to mention a worthwhile passive-income source."", ""The dividend yields of individual companies can rise and fall for various reasons. But the two big factors are a stock's price and its history of dividend raises."", 'If a stock rises, on average, 5% a year and raises its dividend at 5% per year, we should expect the yield to stay the same. Whereas if a stock doubles, but the company only raises the dividend by 25%, then investors will be happy even though the stock has a lower yield.', 'Coca-Cola has been underperforming the market. But it has been an incredible dividend payer. On Feb. 15, it announced its 62nd consecutive annual dividend increase, bringing the quarterly dividend to $0.485 per share, or $1.94 per year.', 'The company is a Dividend King -- one of a group of businesses that have paid and raised their dividends annually for at least 50 consecutive years. However, many Dividend Kings implement minimum raises to keep the streak alive.', ""Coke doesn't do that. It has the earnings growth and balance sheet to make more meaningful raises. The recent raise boosted the dividend by 5.4%, which is a lot for a company the size of Coca-Cola. Over the last 12 months, it has paid nearly $8 billion in dividends, so for each percentage point it increases, it pays another $80 million a year."", ""Coke might not always keep pace with a strong bull market, but its business model isn't cyclical and is recession-resistant. It is dependable no matter what the market is doing. That might not mean much for a young risk-tolerant investor with a multidecade time horizon. But for a risk-averse investor or someone in retirement, Coca-Cola is the perfect dividend stock to buy now."", 'Dividend-paying companies take a portion of their earnings and return them to shareholders instead of using all of their earnings to fuel their growth. The strategy makes sense for established businesses like Chevron, UPS, and Coke, but not for a fast-growing company with capital-intensive growth opportunities.', 'For this reason, dividend-paying companies often underperform the market when it is putting up blowout returns, but they can keep pace or even beat the market during mediocre conditions.', ""These three companies aren't ideal investments if you're trying to ride the market wave higher, but they are the perfect long-term investments for compounding wealth over time -- a strategy that is always better than trying to time the market."", 'Chevron, UPS, and Coke deserve to be top choices for investors looking for well-rounded companies with yields that are substantially higher than the market average.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Chevron right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Chevron, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Chevron wasn’t one of them.

During the past 90 days, the shares have risen by more than 30%.', ""With the stock trading at all-time highs, it's reasonable to question whether the valuation has gotten out of hand. The stock is no longer the bargain it was a couple of months ago, but there are many reasons American Express remains a wonderful buy-and-hold investment."", ""If a certain investment rises considerably in value, that doesn't always mean it's become overpriced. It's important to dig into the numbers to understand what's driving the performance. Many times, a stock can skyrocket in price and still be a relative bargain. That appears to be the case for American Express."", ""Before the stock went on its latest run, the shares traded at a free cash flow yield of nearly 18%, notable for a brand that's globally renowned and has repeatedly earned the praise of investing greats like Warren Buffett. In retrospect, this was a mistake by the market. The shares have traded at such levels only briefly over the past decade. Add in a rapid decline in debt levels right as interest rates started to rise, and American Express was in a terrific position to succeed."", 'On paper, American Express stock was a steal back in November. In many ways, the stock remains a bargain today. Investors still secure a nearly 11% free cash flow yield, and debt levels remain well below historical norms, giving American Express operational flexibility while interest rates remain elevated.', 'Equally impressive, American Express continues to generate high returns on equity despite falling debt levels. Often, return on equity, a rough measurement of how efficient a company is at converting earnings into shareholder wealth, can be boosted by increasing debt levels.', ""The fact that American Express has been able to maintain a high return on equity even with relatively lower debt levels is a sign of its efficient business model and competitive advantages. At its foundation, American Express is an asset-light business. That means it can generate profit without needing to invest heavily in physical assets like property and equipment. Moreover, the company's brand alone is likely worth tens of billions of dollars. It would take a competitor decades to replicate its business model and brand recognition."", ""What is a forever stock? As the name implies, it's a stock you can buy and hold forever. American Express is such a stock."", 'There are several things to look for when identifying forever stocks. The most important, however, is finding a company that creates a positive feedback loop. That is, whenever the business grows, that past growth creates future growth.', ""Consider a company like Amazon, arguably another forever stock. The more that buyers flock to its platform, the more sellers are encouraged to follow suit. That attracts even more buyers, attracting yet more sellers. It's a positive feedback loop that propelled Amazon to a trillion-dollar valuation."", ""American Express benefits from its own feedback loops. The company has roots going back to 1850 . Closing in on two centuries of operation, American Express has built an enviable brand, earning eighth place on Fortune's 2024 list of the most admirable brands."", 'American Express has a trusted name, which attracts a constant influx of new customers. Having more customers use its products only accrues more brand value, attracting even more customers.', 'American Express also benefits from powerful network effects, similar to both Visa and Mastercard. When using a credit card, for example, you have a finite list of accepted networks. Visa, Mastercard, and American Express are almost always on that list. So many people use these card networks that merchants are in many ways forced to accept them. Having more merchants accept American Express means more people will use American Express products, thus forcing more merchants to follow suit -- yet another positive feedback loop.', ""From a financial standpoint, American Express shares are hardly overpriced, even following the latest spike. The most attractive aspect of this stock, however, isn't short-term performance. American Express has built a business that will continue to benefit from positive feedback loops for decades. Getting a bargain valuation is nice, but the best strategy for stocks like American Express is simply to buy and hold them forever."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in American Express right now?', 'Before you buy stock in American Express, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and American Express wasn’t one of them.

Adopting his philosophy can lead to extraordinary results if executed well and with patience. What does he advocate? Berkshire Hathaway's CEO has a propensity to invest in companies with competitive advantages over their rivals."", ""Buffett also likes to buy stocks for Berkshire when the stocks are trading for less than their intrinsic value. Still, it's a company's competitive advantages that ensure it will be around for decades, compounding the investment's value."", ""If you want to invest like Buffett, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and American Express (NYSE: AXP) would be two good stocks to buy and hold long-term. Here's what Buffett likes about these two companies, and why they should grow for a long time in Berkshire's portfolio of stocks."", 'Buffett has said Apple was better than any business Berkshire owns. The qualities he likes about Apple are its powerful brand and the attachment people have to their iPhones.', 'Apple is investing a lot of money in technology, especially artificial intelligence (AI), but Buffett sees it as a strong consumer brand more than anything else. The company rakes in $385 billion a year in revenue, with around half that coming from iPhone sales.', ""There haven't been any significant changes to the iPhone, the iPad, or Mac computers in years, but Apple continues to generate a fairly stable base of revenue across its product portfolio. The company's installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high of more than 2.2 billion in the most recent quarter."", 'Apple\'s large customer base provides it with enormous profits that the company can invest in developing new products, such as its recently launched Vision Pro ""spacial computing"" headset, not to mention AI-powered features to make its products better and keep customers on a continuous upgrade path. Apple\'s $100 billion in annual profits, in combination with its high 58% return on invested capital, point to more returns for shareholders in the years to come.', ""American Express is one of the longest-held positions in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. While the stock underperformed the broader market over the last 10 years, it has slightly outperformed the S&P 500 index over the last five. A big reason for that is the company's resilient business model."", ""The average Amex cardholder tends to spend more than the users of rival credit card brands. It's for this reason that merchants are willing to accept it and pay its higher transaction fees. The company invests some of the revenue from those fees into the premium rewards and services it provides to its cardholders -- offerings that help insulate the business from its competitors."", ""Despite sluggish consumer discretionary spending last year, American Express earned $8.3 billion in profit on $60 billion of revenue net of interest expense in 2023. Its revenue rose 14% on a constant-currency basis. Those were impressive results for a 173-year-old company, and they were consistent with management's long-term goal to grow revenue by 10% or more per year and earnings per share at a mid-teens percentage."", ""American Express is an old company but it's seeing strong growth from millennials and Gen Zers.

Americans spending money essentially makes the world's economy go round."", 'All that money must flow on networks connecting consumers, merchants, and banks, which many call the payments industry. Just a tiny trio dominates this space. Approximately 96% of U.S. debit and credit card payments ran on just three networks in 2022, according to research by The Motley Fool.', 'As you might imagine, the companies behind the networks have been stellar investments for years.', 'The best part? They are poised for more success; you can buy and hold stock in all three for under $1,000.', ""Visa (NYSE: V) is the largest payment network in the United States and the world (excluding China). Approximately 71% of America's debit and prepaid card purchase volume ran on Visa's payment network in 2022, and just over half of credit card volume. Visa is like a toll booth charging a fee, a percentage of each transaction, to access its network."", ""When you swipe your Visa card, data runs back and forth between the point of sale and whatever financial institution is holding your money. The network authenticates and approves the transaction, which is why you see your card was approved at the payment terminal. Visa's network is established, so it doesn't need much constant investment. As people ditch cash over time, growing payment volume creates enormous profits for Visa."", 'The company generates $19 billion in free cash flow on $33 billion in revenue, an impressive 57% conversion rate. Management is using its billions in cash to repurchase shares and grow its dividend. Analysts believe Visa will continue growing earnings at an annual average of 15%, making the stock a no-brainer buy and forever hold for as long as it maintains its dominance in the industry.', ""Despite Visa's dominance, the payments industry is so large that Mastercard (NYSE: MA) has done remarkably well as the industry's runner-up. Mastercard powers roughly 29% and 24% of U.S. debit and credit transactions. It's also a global payments network with an estimated 28% market share, second to Visa's 47%."", ""Frankly, Mastercard and Visa are nearly identical businesses. Of course, they partner with different card issuers, but Mastercard has a solid footing in payments, and its business is similarly lucrative. Mastercard generates nearly $11 billion in cash flow on $25 billion in revenue. One key difference between Visa, Mastercard, and the next company is that the first two are dedicated payment networks. They don't directly issue cards or lend money."", ""Mastercard follows the same formula with its vast cash flow streams -- share repurchases steadily lower outstanding shares and support earnings growth. Analysts believe Mastercard's earnings could grow by an annual average of 18% moving forward. That should translate to more robust dividend growth. Mastercard's dividend has grown by an average of 20% annually, increasing five-fold over the past decade. And yet the payout still only uses up about a fifth of Mastercard's cash flow today."", ""The story changes a bit with American Express (NYSE: AXP). It's both a payment network and a bank, meaning it's issuing payment cards and lending the money when consumers rack up debt on their credit cards. It's a smaller network but still owns about 13% of America's credit card market and has a single-digit percentage of the global market. Famous investor Warren Buffett has owned the stock as a top holding for decades within his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway."", ""American Express carries credit risk in its business as a lender, which investors should consider when buying the stock. However, American Express has been in business since the mid-1800s, navigating various economic storms throughout American history, so investors can feel good about the company's durability."", ""Importantly, management has noted in recent earnings calls that millennial and Generation Z consumers are its fastest-growing customer demographics, which bodes well for American Express' long-term future as a fixture in the consumer-spending landscape. Analysts believe earnings will compound at 14%."", 'These companies dominate U.S. payments, which establishes powerful network effects. In other words, merchants have little reason to use different networks because these three are accepted virtually everywhere.', 'Market share dynamics between them could always change, but investors could easily buy and hold all three and ride the years-long shift away from cash payments. In 2015, roughly 24% of U.S. consumers stated they no longer use cash, according to a study by Pew Research Center. By 2022, that percentage had grown to 41%.', 'The long-term trend is clear: These three companies will likely continue performing well as consumers move away from paying with paper currency.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Visa right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

I’d now like to turn the call over to Lloyd.', 'Lloyd Yates: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I’m excited to be with you this morning to share outstanding financial results and to discuss the advancement of key business initiatives, which are devoted and talented workforce delivered to support our customers, communities and our shareholders across all of 2023. We began the year with a premium business plan represented by the value proposition you see on Slide 3. The bottom line is the NiSource team delivered. You’ll notice successful execution of these key initiatives across the Board. Let me provide a few highlights, which fuel our resilient and sustaining business across all years of our plan. We executed our highest CapEx investment in 2023, exceeding our rate based investment goals.', 'As of the year-end 2023, we had $18.8 billion of rate base. We continue to forecast $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion of capital expenditures in 2024 and $16 billion over our five-year financial plan through 2028. Year-over-year, NOEPS growth achieved 9% increase and achieved the highest end of our guidance range. We are acutely focused on smart capital deployment and maximizing risk adjusted returns and responsible rate-based investing through strong recovery mechanisms across our businesses. Project Apollo achieved this goal of over $50 million of cost savings initiatives. Perhaps more important than the amount of savings is the energy and support demonstrated by our people to build a continuous improvement mindset and enhance productivity by doing things safer, better, more efficiently and with less cost.', 'These initiatives contributed greatly to a total shareholder return, which exceeded mid cap and large cap U.S. utility peers in 2023. For the three-year period, total shareholder return was 10.1% compound annual growth rate versus 5% per peers, which is reflective of our strong earnings per share execution and future growth prospects. We are confident our commitments are resilient to rapidly changing business conditions such as those seen by the utility industry over the last two years and which our financial results have delivered over this period. We continue building a track record of growth and execution, and our commitment to investors, customers, employees is central to everything we do. On Slide 4, you’ll see our key priorities. First, as you observed in our release, we delivered 2023 non-GAAP EP – NOEPS of $1.60 versus the upper half of $1.54 to $1.60 revised guidance range.', 'This underscores our execution of resilient financial commitments and a business plan which anticipated the broader headwinds our customers and our sector are facing today. This result was achieved despite a $128 million increase in interest expense and without sacrificing our FFO to debt commitment. Built on the strength of our infrastructure investment programs, we are raising 2024 guidance to $1.70 to $1.74 from $1.68 to $.72, which we initiated in November. We continue to expect a 2023 through 2028 annual EPS growth rate of 6% to 8%, supported by 8% to 10% annual rate-based growth. The 2024 guidance range is refreshed reflective of the annual growth expected up our strong year-end 2023 financial results. Second, our superior regulatory and stakeholder foundation differentiates us from peers.', 'NIPSCO received IURC approval of renewable CPCN amendment for several of our investments in January. Intervener testimony was also received last month for our NIPSCO gas rate case filed in October 2023. Third, our balance sheet flexibility allows us to optimize cost of capital for customers and ultimate return on capital for shareholders. A key focus for 2023 was the NIPSCO minority interest transaction with Blackstone Infrastructure Partners, which successfully closed in December. This transaction diversified capital fundraising for NiSource from public capital markets and creates a long-term partnership for years to come. Fourth, our company is experiencing a record investment cycle driven by safety, reliability, regulation, decarbonization and modernization.', 'Slide 5 details our annual capital expenditures across our six state service territory. Our $16 billion five-year plan was introduced in November 2023, built on and extended our prior November 2022, $15 billion plan. It incorporates electric generation, transmission, gas modernization and economic development investments through 2028. The nature of our capital plan diversifies project risk, including our generation project investments, which lack the large project execution risk on the scale seen elsewhere in the industry in recent years. We intend to layer in projects from our $2 billion upside capital program as they meet our threshold for base plan execution. Key rate case and capital rider activity is shown on Slide 6. Our leading regulatory and stakeholder execution advances as we continue to work with stakeholders through rate case and tracker cycles to efficiently deploy capital investments and recover cost associated with these investments to drive value for customers, our communities and our shareholders.', 'The strength of our company continues to be working constructively with stakeholders and communities to safely and reliably deliver the energy they deserve and to be there for our customers when they need energy most. Since our last update, our Virginia SAVE Rider was approved and implemented and our Kentucky SMRP Rider went into effect subject to refund, together covering over $100 million of capital investment made for our customers. Slide 7 shows how our operational excellence model is incorporated into decision making in all areas of the company. Last year, we significantly improved safety performance by delivering a 14% reduction in Days Away Restricted or Transferred or DART, and are on a path to achieving a goal of top decile performance.', 'Additionally, we recorded a 16% reduction in Preventable Vehicle Collisions, or PVC. As I already mentioned, Project Apollo is generating enhanced productivity by doing things safer, better, more efficiently and with less costs. The improvements in our work plans and cost profiles are expected to continue and sustain this year after an implementation that exceeded expectations in 2023. I have provided you with specific examples of project initiatives in recent quarters, but want to highlight the underlying cultural change occurring throughout the company. The team continues to find new ways to improve every day and this will generate value for all our stakeholders for decades. I am impressed with the continuous improvement mindset fueling our organization and I am excited for our teams as we continue this journey.', 'Before we advance the call, I want to close this section with the following. I couldn’t be more proud of our entire team and their devotion each and every day to support our nearly 4 million customers. With extreme cold weather across much of January, we delivered critical energy to keep our customers safe and warm. 2023 was a banner year for NiSource as the first full year of execution across our strategy shared in November 2022 and we deliver on all marks across the Board. This sets the foundation for continued growth in safety and reliability for our customers and value for our shareholders, which we strongly believe in. Michael and Shawn will dive into greater details on why 2023 was a successful year for our stakeholders, and also why 2024 and beyond will be even better.', 'Now, I’ll turn the call over to Michael.', 'Michael Luhrs: Thank you, Lloyd. I’ll begin on Slide 8. NIPSCO’s generation transition remains on track, I believe support the retirement of two of the remaining three coal-fired generation units by the end of 2025 and the final unit by 2028. To this end, construction on our crossroads two wind PPA was completed at the end of 2023 and the facility is now producing sustainable zero fuel cost generation for NIPSCO’s Northern Indiana customers. In fact, customers are seeing the benefit of this generation as part of our renewable portfolio already receiving $18 million in renewable energy credits sold into the marketplace in 2023, lowering customers overall cost of energy. In November of 2023, NIPSCO received approval on a CPCN amendment converting Gibson from a PPA to a build-transfer agreement.', 'Also, progress continues on Cavalry and Dunns Bridge II Solar facilities, and we expect both to be completed as planned later this year. In January, NIPSCO received approval from the IURC to own 100% of these two projects in lieu of owning them through tax equity joint ventures. Fully owning these projects will benefit customers by leveraging the tax credit transferability provisions of the IRA, NIPSCO will be able to monetize tax credits associated with the projects more efficiently than under tax equity agreements, resulting in comparatively lower energy costs for customers. We continue to evaluate the customer benefits of utilizing similar approaches for the Fairbanks and Gibson projects, which are in development. Though we have made significant advancements in our generation portfolio, we are looking forward to how we advance the portfolio in reliability, resiliency, customer benefits, and towards our goal of net zero by 2040.', 'An important component of our generation portfolio planning process is NIPSCO’s Triennial Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP. The 2024 IRP will evaluate NIPSCO’s long-term generating capacity requirements and inform generation investment decisions beyond NIPSCO’s gas peaker project and the renewable projects already in development. The 2024 IRP will incorporate a number of scenarios and updates since the 2021 IRP, such as MISO seasonal construct and its proposed resource accreditation approach. The customer centric process will include a series of stakeholder meetings that will kick off in the spring and will culminate with the submissions of an integrated resource plan to the IURC in November. We look forward to working together with stakeholders to continue on our path to reliably serve and strengthen our communities.', 'The IRP will build on our current generation portfolio, our build transfer agreements and PPA projects in development as outlined on Slide 8, and our 400 megawatt gas peaker project expected in service in 2027. As a reminder, the base capital plan released in November includes the gas peaker full ownership of Cavalry and Dunns Bridge II projects, and tax equity joint ventures for the Fairbanks and Gibson projects. On Slide 9, you’ll see additional investment opportunities not included in our current base five-year capital plan. We continue to develop and grow in a disciplined and measured way a portfolio of opportunities that benefit customers and stakeholders. We continue to advance these opportunities and will layer them into the upside CapEx plan as appropriate.', 'Relative to gas system investments, the PHMSA rulemaking process is now expected to take longer than originally anticipated. However, we still expect regulatory clarity in 2024. We do not believe the final rule will materially shift CapEx within our base plan. We will continue to evaluate how the rules apply to our systems and engage with stakeholders to deliver the system reliability and benefits expected under the rules. This engagement will inform how the implementation of rules may shape timing of investments in our upside CapEx plan. I would like to conclude my comments today with an update on our ESG performance. In addition to being on track to achieve our net zero and interim decarbonization goals, we achieved 19% diverse supplier spend in 2023, up from 16% in 2022 and 10% in 2021, and are well on our way to our goal of achieving 25% diverse supplier spend by 2025.', 'I’ll now turn the call over to Shawn.', 'Shawn Anderson: Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I’m excited to share our 2023 financial results on Slide 10. Non-GAAP net operating earnings in the fourth quarter were $239 million or $0.53 per diluted share, up from $221 million or $0.50 per diluted share in the same period in 2022. This earnings increase is driven by regulatory mechanisms recovering capital investment, partly offset by a modest increase in non-tracked O&M and higher interest expense. For the full year, we reported $716 million of non-GAAP net operating earnings for $1.60 per diluted share, up from $648 million and $1.47 in 2022, respectively. Across this period, regulated revenue returns were partly offset by higher depreciation expense, interest expense, and lower other income.', 'On Slide 11, you’ll find segment detail and key drivers of our results. For the full year, non-GAAP operating income increased across each of the gas, electric and corporate segments, accounting for a $209 million increase to consolidated net operating earnings. Capital expenditures fueled regulated returns, and as Lloyd highlighted earlier, we deployed approximately $3.6 billion in infrastructure projects to enhance safety and reliability of our energy systems. This drove an increase of $335 million through regulatory activity, in rate cases and capital trackers across our jurisdictions. A growing customer base across our businesses also provided a lift in our 2023 financial results and supports customer affordability. Demand for our fuel continues to be very strong, with residential customer count growing over 80 basis points in our gas businesses and over 50 basis points in our electric business last year, both of which enhanced the scale of NiSource.', 'Economic development continues to thrive in the Midwest, and there is no better example of how this collaboration can benefit customers, communities and investors than in Ohio. Our operations in the state serve 1.5 million customers, nearly 550,000 of which are supported by our Columbus operations center. Public private partnership has propelled Ohio’s recent economic development success. In 2023 alone, 33 projects were brought to central Ohio, with over $10 billion in investment being committed. This momentum continues today as there are nearly 100 active opportunities being pursued for future development with the potential to create thousands of new jobs and invest billions of dollars more into central Ohio communities. The majority of these projects are focused in manufacturing industries, representing a diverse range of sectors, including electric vehicles, energy storage, logistics, life sciences, semiconductors, advanced computing facilities and many more.', 'Additionally, Ohio will continue to see new corporate investment driven by downstream supplier activity from megaprojects currently under construction, such as a joint venture with Honda and LG Energy and the Intel chip manufacturing facility. This development can enhance value for NiSource and create an upside to our plan from residential housing demand, which grows as these secondary businesses develop. Central Ohio’s metro population grew an average of 1.8% annually over the last 30 years, and the population is expected to grow an additional 30% by 2050, boosted by strong economic development prospects. Broad stakeholder and policy support is critical to onshoring and manufacturing success and will fuel healthy and growing Midwest economies.', 'Our communities benefit from numerous constructive regulatory mechanisms that encourage energy infrastructure investment across to our states, including economic development programs to spur investments in our region, which create jobs and enhance local tax base. Switching to Slide 13, I’d like to highlight several key value drivers which represent the foundation of our long-term financial commitments. We have increased our non-GAAP net operating earnings per share guidance range for 2024 by $0.02 at the midpoint compared to the range introduced in November. This midpoint now represents a 7.5% year-over-year growth rate from 2023 actual results. The revised guidance is driven primarily by revenues from regulatory activity and enhanced customer demand and lower financing costs relative to our prior year forecast.', 'These growth drivers, along with the strength of our infrastructure investment programs, underpin our expectation to continue to deliver annual non-GAAP NOEPS growth of 6% to 8% and annual rate based growth of 8% to 10% over the 2023 to 2028 period. This is driven by $16 billion of capital expenditures, and it is expected to approximate residential customer bill growth to below 4% on average across the plan horizon. Finally, inconsistent with our last update, our base capital plan includes full ownership of Cavalry and Dunns Bridge II solar projects expected in service in 2024. Fairbanks and Gibson continue to be expected in service in 2025, using a tax equity financing structure. Our upside plan includes incremental CapEx associated with full ownership of these projects, as well as electric and gas investments which Michael detailed earlier.', 'Our financing plan is outlined on Slide 14, which remains unchanged from our mid-November update. As we outlined in that update, we continue to expect to issue up to $600 million in ATM equity in 2024 and $200 million to $300 million of maintenance ATM equity annually in the 2025 to 2028 period to support our base capital plan. Within the operation of our at-the-market program, we retain the flexibility to include small, bilateral discrete transactions should they be efficient to execute. We also continue to reaffirm our commitment to an FFO to debt ratio of 14% to 16% through 2028. In January, our board of directors authorized a 6% increase to our dividend, which is consistent with the annual increase authorized last year. This projects our annual dividend at the bottom half of our stated range for targeted dividend payout ratio of 60% to 70%.', 'We will continue to be thoughtful about capital allocation in the high cost of capital environment. The final two slides will conclude our presentation and focus on execution of our stakeholder commitments. First, our multiyear track record of execution and growth continued in 2023. Lloyd touched on the premium business plan we shared with each of you in November of 2022, and this represents the full year of execution of this plan. We continue to prioritize safety while optimizing our long-term cost profile. We built on our superior regulatory and stakeholder foundation through the execution of four general rate cases and numerous CPCN amendments and capital tracker approvals. During the year, we invested over $3.6 billion to support our customers and keep our communities and our employees safe, all while enhancing the balance sheet afforded through the minority interest sale.', 'We are proud of the execution delivered by the entire NiSource team, including achieving a 9% year-over-year growth rate and landing at the high end of our guidance range. All of these investments and the long-term visibility of our results fuel our confidence to execute each and every year as we move forward. As we share on Slide 16, each of the last three years, we’ve executed strong financial growth, achieving the upper half of our guidance range in each year. This is important. Each year we’ve done this, we’ve rebased future NOEPS guidance upwards off those actual results. We’ve accomplished this in 2021, 2022 and now 2023. And we expect to keep doing this, as we move forward, exemplified by our upgraded guidance range with an implied midpoint of 7.5% over 2023’s already strong results.', 'And this is differentiated in our sector, which has delivered an average 5% non-GAAP NOEPS CAGR since 2021 compared to the 8% achieved by NiSource. The underlying business plan supported by strong regulatory construct in NiSource jurisdictions coupled with responsible investments in identifiable regulatory programs, enable a reasonable return of investment over our plan. The confidence in these investments enables the rebasing of annual growth rate which supports this higher NOEPS range as we execute the plan, which in turn enhances the future earnings potential of our business in each forward year of our plan. We are excited about the future prospects of our business and to continue building a track record of execution and growth. We remain confident.', 'Our commitments are resilient to rapidly changing business conditions, as which was seen across the utility industry over the last two years. Despite this, the NiSource plan is stronger than ever. Thank you for your time this morning and your interest in NiSource. And with that, I’d like to open the call to your questions.', 'See also 11 Best Big Name Stocks to Buy Right Now and 20 Best Divorce and Child Custody Lawyers in New Jersey.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Good morning, and good afternoon. Thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings call. I am proud to report our strong quarterly and full year results which really speak to the growth and operational momentum we are achieving.', 'Total company inbound for the year grew to $11 billion. This included subsea orders of $9.7 billion, which was an increase of 45% versus the prior year and a book-to-bill of 1.5. These strong results benefited from a record level of iEPCI awards in the period. Total company revenue for the year grew 17% to $7.8 billion.', 'Adjusted EBITDA improved to $939 million when excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This was an increase of 30% percent when compared to the prior year. We generated free cash flow of $468 million for the year and we returned nearly $250 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. While these are solid improvements, I am particularly pleased with the quality of the inbound received in 2023 with direct awards iEPCI and subsea services together exceeding 70% of subsea inbound.', ""We're also seeing tangible improvements in Surface Technologies. This has resulted in improved financial performance, higher cash generation and greater consistency in delivering on our annual commitments. Anyway, you look at it 2023 was a period of strong growth for our company and we see continued strength ahead, driven by the resiliency and durability of this cycle. The demand for energy will continue to grow."", ""A more than a decade unconventional resources in North America have provided a significant portion of the world's hydrocarbon globe. The growth from the region will be more limited in the years ahead driven by Capital Frameworks that reward higher economic returns and increased shareholder distributions. This means that the incremental production needed to support global growth will come primarily from international markets driven by the Middle East and offshore. Looking ahead, the market for conventional energy resources will evolve differently than what we have experienced in the past, driven by three major trends, a shift in capital flows, an increased role for new technologies and an expanded role for subsea services, all of which will allow TechnipFMC to leverage the full capabilities of our integrated solutions, differentiated technologies, and the industry's most comprehensive subsea service capabilities."", ""Looking more closely at these major trends, let's start with the shift in capital flows. We expect to see continued strength in spending both in land and offshore markets. However, the dynamics will differ across the major markets as capital flows are typically a function of returns and access. In North America, the industry has access to resources, but economic returns will continue to be challenged outside the most prolific basins."", 'We believe this will result in more modest growth in the region. Opportunities in the Middle East benefit from strong economic returns that will drive continued growth. That said, the number of operators that have access to these attractive resources is far more limited, which brings us to the offshore markets. Here we believe much improved economic returns and broad operator access to deep water resources will attract a growing share of global capital flows.', 'And with more than 90% of our total revenue generated outside the North America land market, FTI stands out as the pure-play equity to address this opportunity. While the strength of these trends is partly reflected in our current backlog and revenue guidance, we have high confidence in the durability of the market over the intermediate term. In 2024, we remain on track to meet our prior guidance for subsea inbound, with current year order expectations approaching $10 billion. Today, we are also increasing our expectations for subsea inbound over the three-year period ending 2025 to reach $30 billion, a 20% increase versus our prior view.', 'Looking beyond capital flows, we expected technology will also play a bigger role in spending behavior. Here TechnipFMC is focused on developing technologies for both conventional and new energies to drive market expansion. More specifically, we are using technology to drive further innovation in the offshore market creating new growth opportunities. A clear example of innovation is the Mero 3 HISEP contract, which we were awarded just last month.', 'The significance of this project for the subsea industry cannot be overstated. It would be the first to use subsea processing to capture CO2 directly from the well stream for injection back into the reservoir. Importantly, this will all take place on the sea floor. In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emission intensity, HISEP technologies will increase production capacity by debottlenecking the gas processing plant that currently resides on the FPSO.', 'By moving the gas processing entirely to the seafloor, future FPSO topside designs can be further simplified driving significant improvement in project economics. HISEP is a major milestone for the subsea industry and for TechnipFMC. This project plays to our strengths. HISEP will allow us to demonstrate how technology innovation, project integration and partner collaboration enable our meaningful participation in the energy transition, while remaining aligned with our strategic priorities.', 'It is the first iEPCI project ever awarded by Petrobras. And it builds upon Our strong order momentum starting the year with an iEPCI award that exceeded $1 billion. And finally, the third major trend driving subsea market growth opportunities can be found in services. Today, subsea fields hosts more than 7,000 subsea trees and associated infrastructure, including manifolds, control systems, umbilicals and flexible pipe.', ""This list is certainly not inclusive of all major components of a subsea production system. However, it does highlight the size and scale of the industry's large and more importantly growing installed base. TechnipFMC's global services organization plays a critical role throughout the entire life of the field, from system installation to maintenance intervention and production optimization and all the way through life of field. Our 2023 results clearly demonstrate that our strategy to enhance this resilient, growing, and high-return business is delivering real value with our services revenue having achieved over $1.5 billion for the year."", 'In summary, we close out a solid year having delivered many notable achievements. Subsea inbound orders increased 45% versus the prior year and included a new record for iEPCI awards. This growth in orders also drove a 50% increase in subsea backlog to over $12 billion with high-quality inbound supported with further improvement in our financial returns. And our growth in full-year operational results reflect strong momentum that continues into 2024.', 'We have entered an unprecedented time for the development of conventional energy resources, driven by three major trends, a shift in capital flows, which we believe will largely be directed to the offshore and Middle East markets, an increased role for new technologies as shown by the MERO 3 HISEP award, and an expanded role for subsea services driven by the needs of growing and aging infrastructure. Importantly, these trends underpin the 20% increase in our expectation for subsea inbound over the three-year period ending 2025, which had $30 billion will provide additional growth in backlog and further expand the execution of our project portfolio through the end of the decade. I will now turn the call over to Alf.', 'Alf Melin -- Chief Financial Officer', 'Thanks, Doug. Inbound in the quarter was $1.5 billion, driven by $1.3 billion of subsea orders. Revenue in the quarter totaled $2.1 billion. EBITDA was $245 million, when excluding foreign exchange loss of $26 million and restructuring impairment and other charges totaling $10 million.', 'Turning to segment results, Subsea revenue of $1.7 billion increased modestly versus the third quarter. The increase in revenue was due to higher productivity in the Gulf of Mexico, Asia Pacific and Africa, driven in part by accelerated conversion of several projects from backlog. The increased activity was largely offset by seasonal factors that impacted vessel utilization. Revenue for Subsea Services modestly increased due to strength in asset maintenance and ROE services in Norway, in the Gulf of Mexico.', 'Services revenue was also less impacted in the quarter by typical offshore seasonality, particularly in the North Sea. Adjusted EBITDA was $225 million, with a margin of 13.1%, down 200 basis points from the third quarter due to lower vessel-based activity and a mix of projects executed from backlog in the period. For the full year, subsea revenue grew 18% percent versus the prior year with adjusted EBITDA margin up 180 basis points to 13.3%. In Surface Technologies revenue was $357 million in the quarter, an increase of 2% sequentially.', 'The increase in revenue was driven by higher activity in international and North America markets, both benefiting from higher wellhead equipment sales. Adjusted EBITDA was $52 million, a 5% sequential increase benefiting from increased contribution from international services and higher wellhead sales. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 14.7%, up 30 basis points versus the third quarter. For the full year, Surface Technologies revenue was up 12% versus the prior year with adjusted EBITDA margin up 230 basis points to 13.6%.', 'Turning to corporate and other items in the quarter. Corporate expense was $33 million, when excluding $5 million of charges. Net interest expense was $13 million and benefited from increased interest income in the period, driven in part by strong cash generation. Tax expense was $54 million.', 'And lastly, foreign exchange loss was $26 million, the majority of which was related to the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso. Cash flow from operating activities was $701 million. Capital expenditures were $72 million. This resulted in free cash flow of $630 million in the quarter.', 'Free cash flow for the full year was $468 million, above the high end of our guidance range. When excluding impact of foreign exchange, we converted 50% of adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow, achieving the cash conversion rates we had previously targeted for 2025. Total shareholder distributions where $77 million in the quarter and $249 million for the full year. We ended the period with cash and cash equivalents on $952 million.', 'Net debt declined more than $500 million to $116 million. In November, we announced an agreement to sell our Measurement Solutions business for $205 million in cash. We now expect to conclude the transaction by the end of the first quarter subject to customary closing conditions. Moving to our financial outlook, we have provided detailed guidance for the current fiscal year in our earnings release.', ""I won't speak to all the details, but will provide some context for certain items for the full year and first quarter. I will begin with Subsea. At the midpoint of our full-year guidance range, we anticipate revenue of $7.4 billion with an EBITDA margin of 16%. This represents a 270 basis point margin improvement from the prior year."", 'Our outlook also anticipates contingent growth in Subsea Services revenue to approximately $1.65 billion, achieving this level, one year ahead of our previous target. For the first quarter, we anticipate Subsea revenue to decline low-to-mid single-digits due to more typical seasonal activity patterns, and EBITDA margin to be in line with fourth quarter results. Turning to Surface Technologies, at the midpoint of our full-year guidance range, we anticipate revenue of approximately $1.275 billion with an EBITDA margin of 14%. This guidance assumes we complete the sale of our Measurement Solutions business by the end of the first quarter.', 'When excluding the impact of this sale, as well as the exit of certain geographies and portfolio rationalization in the Americas, our Surface Technologies revenue is anticipated to grow approximately 5% year over year. For the first quarter, we anticipate revenue to decline approximately 10%, when compared to fourth quarter results with an EBITDA margin of approximately 13%. We anticipate full year corporate expense of $115 million to $125 million. In 2023, the company initiated an ERP system upgrade.', 'Our corporate expense now includes approximately $10 million in annual costs related to the implementation of the upgraded system. We expect to incur a similar cost each year until completion of the project in 2027. We anticipate capital expenditures of $275 million, which is just over 3% of revenue at the midpoint of our guidance range. Finally, we are guiding free cash flow for the full year to a range of $350 million to 500 million.', 'This includes approximately $170 million for the remaining payments related to the resolution of all outstanding matters with the PNF. Excluding these payments the midpoint of our free cash flow guidance would approximate $600 million. In closing when our guidance items are taken at the midpoint of the range, we anticipate total company EBITDA of $1.25 billion for the full year. This represents EBITDA growth of 33% percent versus the prior year, when excluding foreign exchange.', 'I also want to stress that we expect to achieve this significant growth, despite the impact of the strategic actions taken in Surface Technologies and the incremental spend related to the ERP system upgrade. This is also first second consecutive year for free cash flow conversion of nearly 50% when excluding the settlement payments. And we expect this to drive growth in shareholder distribution of at least 35% and a further reduction in net debt. Operator, you may now open the line for questions.', '', 'Operator', 'Thank you. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC. Your line is open.', 'Arun Jayaram -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', 'Yeah. Good morning, Doug. I wanted to first start with the increase in your long-term or three-year order guide, you raised that from $25 billion to $30 billion. I was wondering if you can comment on what drove the increase and perhaps give us a sense of how much of this was your expectation for more market share versus just the growing TAM in terms of Subsea and offshore FIDs?', 'Doug Pferdehirt -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure, good morning, Arun. It's really a combination of both. Clearly, both the total market size is increasing and as you know our-the share of the market, we continue to enjoy an increasing share due to the unique offering that we provide. Look, we are seeing, is just giving us much greater visibility into the durability of the cycle and much greater confidence when we kind of risk weight opportunities when you're in a direct negotiation, there is no competitive tender as stated in my prepared remarks, which represents over 70% of our Subsea business."", ""You just obviously have a much higher ability to be able to properly risk weight for those opportunities. You see the outlook slides that we provide and that the markets there, the size of the markets there, it's solid. It's growing. It's just really we're in a privileged position which we are humble about it."", ""We are honored to have this position and we offer our customers a clear line of sight to improve Subsea project economics that these are unique to our offering both in terms of our Subsea 2.0 architecture. And our and iEPCI offering that reduces their cycle time by 12 to 14 months on a deepwater project, thus vastly improving their economics. So it's a privileged position to be in one we don't take lightly and we continue to work really, really hard to deliver for our customers every day."", 'Arun Jayaram -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""Great. My follow-up, Doug, we're intrigued by the MERO 3 project award I know you announced just a bit earlier in the quarter. But I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about some of the unique technology that you're bringing to table for this and it seems like a an application that could open up a world of new opportunities despite taking some of the processing and separation to the sea floor as you mentioned it would perhaps reduce some of the needs at the surface in terms of the design of the facility subsides. So I was wondering if you can maybe comment on the technology and perhaps the scope here of future opportunities and what this could open up for FTI?"", 'Doug Pferdehirt -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure, and thank you for the question because the award was announced earlier. We haven't had a chance to talk about it here in this forum. This was the first opportunity. So very excited as I pointed out."", ""I think it-we said it's really, really unique both for the industry, as well as for our company. And I think understanding, as you said what are some of the actual award and then there's with those what is it enabled by that? So, let's start with just some of the highlights. Yes, one of the bottlenecks that we see in Greenfield developments as the offshore market continues to grow will be the delivery of the FPSO. The FPSOs are complicated and there are certain number of providers of those FPSOs and clearly they are becoming, if you will, the long pole in the tent in terms of the project cycle time."", ""Our approach to ensuring that deepwater economics remain privileged, i.e. drove our customers global capital spend. It is by really doing everything we can to in every way address the cycle time, as well as reducing the risk of delivering the projects and ensuring that they're delivered on time. So an example of that would be, the FPSO itself is an intriguing unit."", ""But let's see, the complexity is really in the top sides configuration that you put on top. And you do that because, you either have to separate water from oil or you have to treat the gas or you have two separate, in this case high CO2 rich dense gas from the flow stream. If you can do that on the seabed, it has many advantages, one, simplifying the FPSO, therefore reducing that risk of that becoming a bottleneck in terms of driving even further improvements in cycle time. Secondly, there's obviously more real estate on the sea floor."", ""We could do things, if you will horizontally, whereas if you're on a ship you are pretty much constrained to doing things vertically Any sort of vertical construction costs more than horizontal construction. So in the simplest terms, we just have more real estate and to play with. And more and just as importantly than the economics is this is ACC has project. This is about reducing greenhouse gas intensity."", ""This is about separating the CO2 on the sea floor and reinjecting it into the subsurface. It never sees the atmosphere. It is at the bottom of the ocean, on the sea floor in a closed loop system where we can separate out the CO2 and again reinject CO2, hence the delivering a much lower greenhouse gas intensity for the project. And then, I also mentioned and I think it's important to point out, this is the first-ever iEPCI, which is our unique commercial model, the integrated commercial model."", ""The first time Petrobras is using this model. So, you're absolutely right. We've done separation projects in the past. We've done boosting."", 'This is a unique combination of advanced separation, the first time for CO2 specifically, as well as boosting and reinjection and putting this all together into an integrated system architecture is something that we are extremely proud and excited to be working on Petrobras that deliver this. And this is a-being done under the premise of design one build many. So as you point out, this can start to open up all sorts of other opportunities as we move forward.', 'Arun Jayaram -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst', ""Thanks Doug. I'll turn it back."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Dave Anderson with Barclays. Your line is open.', 'Dave Anderson -- Barclays -- Analyst', 'Great. Thanks. Good morning, Doug. How are you?', 'Doug Pferdehirt -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'Good morning, Dave. Great. Thank you.', 'Dave Anderson -- Barclays -- Analyst', ""Just to follow up on that – Arun's question on the subsea processing. Subsea processing we've been talking about for a long time. I want to go if I go back to probably more than 10 years ago you guys start introducing this. The cycle kind of ended I think-if my memory serves I think the cycle kind of ended before this really became before this really kind of took off."", ""So maybe can you just talk about kind of what's different today about subsea processing versus ten years ago? Maybe it's just the CCS part. And how effective was it before? Kind of what's changing? I'm just kind of curious why the adoption today, you've talked about the FPSO, but I seem to recall that was kind of the whole kind of point of this in the first place. So why didn't that catch on before or maybe it did and why did it catch on now?"", 'Doug Pferdehirt -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Dave, I wouldn't disagree. I would say the subsea processing market has maybe under-delivered in the past to be very blunt. What we're looking at here is a completely different application. And as you know, that greenhouse gas intensity, CCS opens up a completely different dynamic in terms of the thinking around sanctioning a project."", ""OK. So let's just say it adds an additional dimension, which is one reason why we believe that that this is a-I would call it almost a new market, almost wouldn't put it under the bucket of subsea processing, even though it's using many of the same technologies, there's, multi-phase pumps and separation etc., but it is a unique application. Secondly, there is unique technology involved here and we've been working with Petrobras since 2016. We have a R&D center for Subsea in Brazil, which gives us the unique ability to work closely with Petrobras in developing and bringing this technology to life."", ""And then, just our experience in terms of system integration and putting together the entire package gives us a reason to believe, Dave, that this application again, and I'm going to go back to point one, when you add this other dimension into the project if you will sanctioning criteria, I believe it makes the decision-means the decision more toward the Subsea."", 'Dave Anderson -- Barclays -- Analyst', ""And as you're saying and it takes cost off the FPSO, as well as that sort of the idea to help kind of lower the overall development cost of the project. Is that sort of the intent here?"", 'Doug Pferdehirt -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, cost, but more importantly it just is going to you can build an FPSO with a basic top side in a fraction of the time that it takes to build one with a full gas processing plant on top. It doesn't-the time isn't in the building the haul and building the storage and the onloading and offloading system. The time element is in the topside configuration, which as you know is often done at a different yard than the haul is made or at multiple different yards then has to be all brought together configured assembled. You're building a floating if you will gas processing Unit or refinery in a broad sense are just much more complex."", ""So, as our whole focus and it's why our customers I think are proud of what we're doing is, we're going to help them improve their economics by focusing on shortening the cycle time. That's the real focus today."", 'Dave Anderson -- Barclays -- Analyst', 'OK. Thanks. And if I go back to the awards, your kind of two year outlook on Subsea awards out there. Even such essentially kind of added about $5 billion in orders to your kind of next year view.', ""I'm just curious. In terms of your iEPCI awards, you're saying 70% today. Does that number go up over the next two years? And I'm assuming – are you already working on these projects? I mean, is that kind of where your confidence comes from because I know these iEPCI award start at a very early stage. Is that kind of where this is all coming from? And so, and if I can just pile on one more question in there."", ""How is pricing evolving here? We're in a consolidated market now. Are we starting to show up? Is that starting to show up in the bids? Sorry I packed a lot in there."", 'Doug Pferdehirt -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'No problem, Dave. I will try to address it, as well as I can. So, the 70% over 70% that we refer to as you know is the direct awards, which is a combination of those iEPCIs that are direct awarded, the most of ours are direct awarded, very few go out to a competitive tender, as well as our Subsea Services and other direct awards from our alliance partners. On the iEPCI portion for us, is about 50% of our total.', ""Do I see that increasing? Yes. What gives me the confidence and visibility is remember, they typically almost always in our case start with an integrated feed study, the integrated front end engineering and design which is two to three years old. So what gives us the unique visibility is, one, we can see, because we're at the table much earlier. We are-in many cases doing an integrated feed study and iFeed."", ""Contractually, we don't do iFeeds unless it will be direct awarded to us, because it would not make sense for us to do an integrated feed study demonstrating the value of integration if we weren't going to execute the project. So, in the front-end engineering studies, which are at a very robust level right now, the percentage of integrated feeds, which will convert into integrated EPCI studies continues to grow, which again gives us that confidence. So, we know the client. We know the basin."", ""We know that working together, if we can achieve the economic, the right economics for the project, then that will turn around and be direct awarded to our company. So, I would say, we have great confidence as you know, and we give our inbound outlook. It's by project, by name, there's a great degree of confidence in the numbers that we put out there in our ability and consistent track record of delivering against them. So we have the visibility from the feed studies that gives us the confidence."", ""We continue to see the direct awards going up. And I'll make one other kind of comment here for you Dave. It wasn't part of your question, but I do think it's interesting. Just this year, right? I mean, we're not that far into the New Year."", ""I will tell you the number of very large Greenfield projects that we are already in the front-end engineering and/or commercial tendering stage or let's say commercial negotiation stage, because again, if they are direct award, there is no tender. I've never seen anything like it. And it's, the cadence and the size of the projects are really quite – it will be record – it will be one record after the next record. And by the way, I'm not counting the emerging countries in here."", ""And there may be at Tanzania, Colombia, etc. I'm not counting those. I'm saying this is within the traditional or known basins that were operating in today. There's a lot of big projects coming in and we think, we're working very closely with our customers to bring those to life."", 'Dave Anderson -- Barclays -- Analyst', ""And Doug, is that incremental to the orders that you're highlighting further out to '25?"", 'Doug Pferdehirt -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, no, not necessarily. If we're – obviously, if we are in direct negotiations today and probably going to happen before then, but you raised another good point and I don't want to be too verbose here. But, we are and I've mentioned this on past calls, this started about nine months ago, our clients want to secure our capacity. They understand what we have is a unique offering."", ""So they're not only talking to us about the current award, but in most cases are talking to us about the future phase where the future tie-ins or whatever we may be.

My first question, Doug is, on the subject of the additional awards and the $30 billion after 2025 you talked a lot in the past about the manufacturing process you've put in place as well to be able to deliver all the services you built. So can we talk about the if there is any impact to the expected margin from this additional if not and larger market outlook? That's my first question. Thank you."", 'Doug Pferdehirt -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Sure. Good afternoon, Mark. So, I believe you're going the anger of capex and I'm going to go there even, I hope that's where you wanted me to go, but look, because of the 2.0 in the configure to order, some of which I believe you've had an opportunity to witness yourself. It allows us to actually achieve these higher rates of throughput within the existing facilities without having to spend additional capital."", 'So as always, there will be capital spend on replacing certain machine tools, etc. But in terms of roof line capacity or major expansion or major capital investment to be able to deliver this growth that is not the case. It would be within our normal capex expenditures.', 'Mark Wilson -- Jefferies -- Analyst', ""Thanks for that. And actually, where I was really looking is on the EBITDA margin you'd be expected to generate, if we're not having to put in more investment other economies of scale, frankly from a higher throughput coming through within your margin expectations. Thanks."", 'Doug Pferdehirt -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', 'I would agree with that statement. Fully agree with that statement.', 'Mark Wilson -- Jefferies -- Analyst', ""OK. Thank you, very much. And then, lastly, looking further ahead and obviously you've spoken to a lot of technology coming through, the gas processing, Subsea separation CO2 injection. There are new basins emerging, clearly bringing some things in Brazil, which is now been out there for a few decades now."", 'But there are new basins coming through with new technologies, new levels have to go to so many kinds of depth and with gas processing. Where would you suggest the industry is looking in terms of the next technological step? Is it in terms of going deeper doing more with gas or indeed electrification just generally? Thanks.', 'Doug Pferdehirt -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Mark, I am laughing, because you are spot on it, it's as if you were in our technology review with our chief technology officer the other day. And the only thing I would add to what you said is, one actually enables the other. So deeper and electrified are actually complementary and electrification will allow us to go deeper. We've talked about electrification in the past in terms of allowing us to have a longer step outs."", ""But it's just ability to be able to transmit hydraulic fluid and the response time, because the further you push it the more friction pressure, the more delays, if you will and to be able to get a response from a hydraulic actuation versus an electric actuation, which can be done very, very quickly. So, I went so certainly deeper. Now, it is only electrification, but electrification will enable deeper. But there's also other aspects to going deeper, particularly when you think about things like, flexible pipe design."", ""We have the only flexible pipe that will be able to work at the depths that these emerging basins are being developed. It takes a very, very unique design. So there's other technologies that we're working on that will also be very beneficial as we move into some of the new basins, which indeed will be at greater depths than we've routinely operated out today."", 'Mark Wilson -- Jefferies -- Analyst', ""Thank you very much.

One we look at oven and I'm actually looking at the Subsea opportunity list as I answer your question.

And in some cases, projects are done here because they're confidential or their projects that are going to be direct awarded to our company. So they are not on the list. I will tell you looking at the list right here in front of me the same one you are I can confidently say, all but one, as you said are you either going through a refreshed feed study and/or in at some level of a commercial negotiation so actually the vast majority of them? And I know, I understand the point and I know there's been some of these have been here a while and some of these have been discussed many times over."", ""But just be very blunt that was before iEPCI, that was before Subsea 2.0.

So, last June, you had referenced you had increased visibility on potential projects that extend out toward the end of the decade you continue to reiterate that in each and every conference call. Yet there seems to be a significant disconnect between what investors want to believe and what you are actually seeing predicated on the discussions, the game plan that that your customers have a it's probably the biggest disconnect I've ever seen in my 35 years in this business. So, you've given a lot of input in commentary and data points around what you're seeing and but what's driving the conviction of what do you think is driving the conviction of your customer base to pursue these projects, for oil production that's going to come online in three to five years, when everybody's freaking out about what oil demand is going to do. So, what are the oil companies seeing that the investor base may not in your personal opinion?"", 'Doug Pferdehirt -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Look, I don't, Kurt, learned a long time ago is a service hand not to speak on behalf of my clients. And so, I'll just give you my perspective, not speaking on behalf of my clients and they may or they may agree or disagree with me. But look, I think everybody has their long-term energy outlook. People understand the rate of change both in terms of the demand is going to go up."", ""And the rate of change of the energy mix. And I think when you look at those two through a realistic lens, you come to a conclusion that these are probably the right investments to be making to ensure that the world has access to reliable and dependable energy as we continue our journey forward. These are solid projects with solid economics and are created, now with the confidence they have, because of what we have done as a company and by the creation of TechnipFMC and our ability to deliver these projects consistently on schedule or ahead of schedule which again is, 12 plus months faster than anyone else can do it, because they're doing it the old-fashioned way. It's just a very unique scenario to be and then they have a much higher level of confidence, I would tell you in our company."", ""It's hard for me to say that, I wish, they always did but when we were all doing bespoke work, like the rest of the market is doing today, you have confidence until something goes wrong, because you've never done it before. We're not doing bespoke anymore. We're doing configured order versus engineered order. So, the level of confidence is there."", ""We are giving our customers that level of confidence would bear deciding in their investment decisions. I don't you know want to weigh-in on. But I, again, will just reiterate we know the demand going to be there and as we move toward just be simple impact of artificial intelligence in the electricity demand that that's going to require there's news demand coming from all facets on the energy complex. And then, you just have to make a decision based upon what is the realistic energy mix to be able to deliver that demand."", ""Our customers I can tell you and I don't know that it's a disconnect. I'll maybe be a little less, I'd probably appreciate your viewpoint and I don't disagree with what you said, but look, I think people are quickly recognizing that this is the new reality and we will just keep our head down, execute, inbound execute, continue to grow, continue to innovate, bring in other applications that will allow our business to continue to grow both in terms of top-line and profitability. And we've been extremely disciplined and good stewards of returning to our shareholders and will continue to do so. So, I think what is continued doing what is the right thing to do and confident that we will be rewarded or continue to be rewarded for doing that, Kurt."", 'Kurt Hallead -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst', ""I appreciate tht insight. Doug, now to follow up on that, right, so you you've indicated that your iEPCI process and integrated processes reduced cycle time by 12 to 14 months. I think you can do it faster than some of your competitors in similar time period. So is that max out or how much more can you reduce that cycle time? How do we think about that?"", 'Doug Pferdehirt -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""So to continue, it's a continuous innovation curve. You know, look, this is a new, right we saw this. This is what happened in the unconventionals. And when I was back in the day when I was fracking it was single-stage, single well, and most you do two a day, because you had a rig down move to the next well, and we know then we went to 24 hours, then we went to simul fracking, now trimul fracking."", ""So, look, there will continue to be we're in the very early stages versus, well, let me say it a different way.

Look Scott, I appreciate the question. Clearly, kind of based upon the whole discussion we've had thus far on the call, the markets there, our position in the market is there, our unique offering is there, the direct awards are there, we just talked about that there is more leverage to come both in terms of cycle time, which will improve project economics and improve the total available market. But also in terms of our own internal cycle time and benefit and leverage, if you will, as we go more so conversion to 2.0 in iEPCI, neither of which are at a 100% today and they never be exactly a 100%."", ""But will certainly be more than they are today. So, look, let's just say we remain very confident that we will continue on the path that we're on and have certainly, as we've said before, they comments like, a major milestone on a more ambitious journey, and then really I just think it's fair if I stick with that kind of terminology today, but certainly no less confidence if anything even more conviction."", 'Scott Gruber -- Citi -- Analyst', ""I appreciate it. I thought a few years out, but had to ask, I was going to come back to the Subsea separation, to talk about again. Can you help us think about the content uplift? Or STI by putting the separation and reinjection on the seafloor? I imagine there's a range based upon what is actually done on the seafloor and the content, the production stream, just kind of what the reasonable range for us to think about in terms of content uplift?"", 'Doug Pferdehirt -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer', ""Well, the way I would view it is, we know that it's a billion dollar plus award, because that's how we classified it. Right? So that was being done somewhere else and, if you will on the top side today. So from an FTI we don't do top sides or we do know engineering construction work whatsoever. So, you just think of it at a minimum, you're taking a functionality that was being under the scope of someone else and putting it under the scope of FTI."", ""And then, we're putting it on the sea floor. So that's kind of one aspect that I would kind of think about in terms of margin expansion. And again, if you say well, what is the scale of that? Well, this is actually a Brownfield project. It's not a Greenfield project."", ""So this is a Brownfield project where you're seeing an incremental billion dollar plus scope coming to our company as a result of this unique offering and capability. So that's, you can't multiply that by every Brownfield. But if you multiply it by just a few, that's a pretty dramatic uplift, right there Scott. And then, the other kind of interesting thing and I alluded to it when I said it was a Brownfield versus a Greenfield, this is a billion dollar reward that doesn't include a single Christmas tree."", ""So, we've often in the past always thought about trees and trees and tree count.

And comping that with a positive momentum in our Subsea Services business all that adds up to really to having just greater confidence overall in the Subsea outlook. And what Doug was talking about and maybe call it little bit similar to 2024, we do expect the lower Surface revenue due to the Measurement Solutions sale, as well as some of the-rationalization we've done over the last 12 to 18 months. And clearly we will expect to offset that by a higher relative earnings mix coming from Subsea in 2025."", ""And maybe – or maybe I skipped your free cash flow question. So let me get back to that. So first of all, you appropriately noted that in part of the Q4 inflow did indeed come from advance-not necessarily advances, but offset in milestone and progress payments on our Subsea business.

A quarter ago, it was expected that this provider of equipment and services to energy companies would post earnings of $0.20 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.21, delivering a surprise of 5%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.', 'FMC Technologies , which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, posted revenues of $2.08 billion for the quarter ended December 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.88%.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately."", 'Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.', ""Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for FMC Technologies: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here."", 'It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead.

One new strategy that those companies spoke on was ""price pack architecture,"" or the idea of providing more sizes of products at different prices.', ""Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer, Brooke DiPalma, and Pras Subramanian break down the latest from these food companies and what both investors and consumers should keep in mind."", 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', ""Editor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino"", 'BROOKE DIPALMA: Guys, I was at a consumer conference and the evolving consumer dynamic was definitely on the menu at this event in Boca Raton, Florida. Got back late last night from the conference hosted by Consumer Analyst Group of New York, where some big names in food like PepsiCo, Hershey, and Mondelez all presented. And after Ozempic fears have settled in, consumers pulled back amid higher prices, and a few lingering post-COVID supply chain issues have settled out, food executives were so eager to move the narrative forward in an effort to get back volume.', ""Now Hershey's and Mondelez, they did none to this price pack architecture. So I thought that was really interesting way of framing it, ultimately providing more sizes more value opportunities as people really get back on the go and are really mindful of how much they're eating and how much they're spending here."", ""JOSH SCHAFER: The price pack thing is interesting to me, right, because to me, I feel like when I go to the grocery store, you think you're pack of Diet Pepsi or your bag of chips or whatever is just supposed to cost a certain amount without really noticing how many cans you're getting or how many chips you're-- like, it's a smart way to frame it, right? You think your Diet Pepsi should be $5 or whatever it is. And even if they're giving you 10 cans instead of 12, be like, oh, yeah, it's $5 it's always $5."", ""And then you kind of maybe don't fully take in that you're not getting the same amount of product and you feel better about it or you're just more willing to spend a certain amount on that product. So it seems like a smart move in terms of at least how I think about shopping at the grocery store and buying food."", ""BROOKE DIPALMA: Yeah. And also, too, you have to keep in mind, there are so many people who are buying in bulk, they have bigger families. And so they are super mindful about the price increases that we saw last year. That's causing a pullback in volume. And so when they go to the store and they realize just how much more they're spending, these companies ultimately want to get out in front of it and offer something that's a little bit leaning towards value but ultimately still getting bang for their buck, even though they are higher in cost."", ""PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: So we've been seeing that food prices have been sort of a little bit stickier than other types of items, right? Do they talk about why that is potentially?"", ""BROOKE DIPALMA: So volume recovery was a hint of that topic around curve of the conference. Basically, they're trying to get ahead of it by saying that we're talking about this price pack architecture. We're talking about innovation was a big play. And also talking about M&A, that was another little tease there."", 'But really, it was not sort of-- well, it was sort of the elephant in the room that these companies need to find a way to bring back consumers. They need to find a way to lure people back in after they took such a hit last year with higher prices, higher commodity costs, and so on and so forth. So innovation really is something all these companies are looking at in 2024.', ""We're hearing some crazy ones. Hershey's introducing a partnership with Shaq."", ""JOSH SCHAFER: I was going to say, Brooke. We buried the lead. We haven't talked about Shaq yet."", '[INTERPOSING VOICES]', ""JOSH SCHAFER: If you want to sell more Hershey's, you just partner with Shaq. Shaq's awesome."", ""PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: He's a Midas touch. I mean, anything he does--"", ""BROOKE DIPALMA: He really, really does. Yeah, he walked out on stage as always, look so tall. And yeah, he was sitting next to Michelle Buck. They were both chatting about how they're doubling down on gummy segment. Shaq said they're going to win big in the gummy segment. They said it's the fastest growing sweets category. And I do wonder to myself how this has to do with consumer preference sort of changing. Do they think that gummies was the fastest growing sweet segment?"", ""JOSH SCHAFER: I'm going to go ahead and assume that gummies are what made Shaq grow taller and bigger.

It employs almost 3,000 people in the country across three manufacturing plants, and has begun operating its Russian business as a separate, standalone entity.', 'Mr Van de Put said in an interview with the Financial Times that there had been “no shareholder pressure whatsoever” to quit doing business in Russia. He added that he had faced some questions from a handful of European funds but there had been “no request to leave Russia from any of our investors”.', '“I don’t think [investors] morally care,” he said.', 'However, he added: “If you have an important Russian business, the hit on the company would be huge, and that becomes a different discussion.”', 'He defended his stance on the basis that the assets of Western companies exiting Russia could end up in the hands of people and entities close to Vladimir Putin’s regime.', 'Mr Van de Put added: “I wonder what happened with the companies that were sold, who got them and what are they doing with the cash that those companies generate? They all went to friends of Putin.”', 'Western companies that have continued to trade in Russia have faced mounting anger from campaigners, who have accused them of indirectly contributing to the Kremlin’s war effort by paying taxes in the country.', 'A spokesman for B4Ukraine, a group of more than 80 nonprofits who are urging multinationals to leave Russia, said: “The comments of the CEO of the Cadbury maker Mondelez highlight complete moral bankruptcy of the American snacking giant. We are not surprised as our numerous attempts to engage with the company have fallen on deaf ears.', '“Such comments ignore over 125,000 war crimes committed by Russia in this illegal invasion and the responsibility of business to protect human rights under the UN Guiding Principles.', '“There is no mention of the appeal from over 1,200 of Mondelez’s global staff to exit Russia and the extensive boycott of its products across Scandinavia.” ', 'Mondelez has been called an “international sponsor of war” by Ukraine’s National Agency on Corruption Prevention. It has also faced boycotts from companies in Scandinavia, which stopped selling its products over its stance on Russia.', 'Christopher Ford, secretary of the Ukraine Solidarity Campaign, said: “Any company that operates in Russia should have UK contracts rescinded and put on notice of public boycott and disinvestment. The lives of Ukrainians have greater value than the immoral profiteering of such investors.”', 'Mondelez’s three biggest shareholders, the investment firms Vanguard, Blackrock and The Capital Group, all declined to comment. However, Vanguard has previously said that it donates to organisations providing supplies and resources to Ukrainian children and families, and that it “moved swiftly” to carry out sanctions levied against Russian entities.', 'Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the Conservative MP who has called for seized Russian assets to be used to rebuild Ukraine, said: “Just as we don’t want companies trading with North Korea, we don’t particularly want companies trading with Russia, either.', '“You’ve got to make it clear to the Russian government and Russian people that what they’re doing in Ukraine is completely unacceptable.”', 'Other consumer giants such as Unilever and Bacardi have been criticised on similar grounds, while some Western companies that have tried to sell their Russian businesses have had them confiscated by the state.', 'Carlsberg and Danone’s Russian subsidiaries were both commandeered by Russian authorities last year after Mr Putin signed a decree giving Russia fresh powers to take control of Western assets.', 'Hein Schumacher, the chief executive of Unilever, said in July that continuing to do business in Russia was the “least bad option” for the company.', 'He said at the time: “The first option is to abandon our business. We feel that, in effect, that could result in it being nationalised, given all of the developments that have recently taken place.', '“The second option is to sell the business, but the reality is, we have not found a viable solution that meets our stated objectives. None of the options are actually good, but the final option of operating our business in a constrained manner is the least bad and that is where we are.”', 'A Mondelez spokesman said: “In terms of our operations in Russia, there is no simple solution. If stopping our operations in Russia would stop the war, we would do it immediately. Unfortunately, it is not that straightforward.', '“Like most other global food and beverage companies, we are continuing to provide food during these challenging times in accordance with applicable sanctions.', '“Suspending our operations would mean cutting off part of the food supply for many families who have no say in the war.

""If the label expansion for KALYDECO is approved, this would allow eligible infants with CF to receive a treatment that targets the underlying cause of their disease at the very start of their lives.""', 'In the European Union, KALYDECO® is already approved for the treatment of people with CF ages 4 months old and above with specific mutations in the CFTR gene.', 'About Cystic FibrosisCystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare, life-shortening genetic disease affecting more than 92,000 people globally. CF is a progressive, multi-organ disease that affects the lungs, liver, pancreas, GI tract, sinuses, sweat glands and reproductive tract. CF is caused by a defective and/or missing CFTR protein resulting from certain mutations in the CFTR gene. Children must inherit two defective CFTR genes — one from each parent — to have CF, and these mutations can be identified by a genetic test. While there are many different types of CFTR mutations that can cause the disease, the vast majority of people with CF have at least one F508del mutation. CFTR mutations lead to CF by causing CFTR protein to be defective or by leading to a shortage or absence of CFTR protein at the cell surface. The defective function and/or absence of CFTR protein results in poor flow of salt and water into and out of the cells in a number of organs. In the lungs, this leads to the buildup of abnormally thick, sticky mucus, chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage that eventually leads to death for many patients. The median age of death is in the 30s, but with treatment, projected survival is improving.', 'Diagnosis of CF is often made by genetic testing and is confirmed by testing sweat chloride (SwCl), which measures CFTR protein dysfunction. The diagnostic threshold for CF is SwCl ≥60 mmol/L, while levels between 30-59 indicate CF is possible and more testing may be needed to make the diagnosis of CF. A SwCl level of <30 mmol/L is seen in people who carry one copy of the CF gene but do not have any manifestation of disease (carriers). Higher levels of SwCl are associated with more severe disease. Restoring CFTR function leads to lower levels of SwCl.', 'About KALYDECO® (ivacaftor)In people with certain types of mutations in the CFTR gene, the CFTR protein at the cell surface does not function properly. Known as a CFTR potentiator, ivacaftor is an oral medicine designed to facilitate the ability of CFTR proteins to transport salt and water across the cell membrane, which helps hydrate and clear mucus from the airways. KALYDECO® (ivacaftor) was the first medicine to treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis in people with specific mutations in the CFTR gene.', 'KALYDECO® (ivacaftor) is a prescription medicine used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged at least 4 months and older who have the following mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene: R117H, G551D, G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N or S549R.', 'For complete product information, please see the Summary of Product Characteristics that can be found on www.ema.europa.eu.', 'About VertexVertex is a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases.

Here are my picks for the best stocks to invest $5,000 in right now.', 'Two technologies hold the potential to transform our world over the next few decades -- artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is a leader in both of them.', ""The company's recent launch of its Gemini AI model proves that it won't be left behind in the AI race. Gemini Ultra beat the top AI models available (including GPT-4) on 30 of 32 key benchmarks. It's also the first AI system to outperform human experts on the MMLU (massive multitask language understanding) test, which includes 57 subjects."", ""I fully expect future versions of Gemini will be even more powerful. That's great news for Google Cloud, as more customers move their apps and data to the cloud to harness the power of AI."", 'Quantum computing still has a long way to go. However, Alphabet has achieved two key milestones. The company thinks it could realistically develop a functional commercial quantum computer within the next decade.', ""In the meantime, Alphabet is highly profitable with a huge cash stockpile. The company dominates multiple markets, including search. Its valuation also isn't as ridiculously high as many other top AI stocks. Alphabet's shares are trading at less than 21x forward earnings."", 'You might be surprised to see PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) on this list. The fintech stock has been a big loser in recent years and is down more than 20% over the last 12 months.', ""But this steep sell-off has caused PayPal's shares to become dirt cheap. The stock trades at a forward earnings multiple of less than 11.6x. Is PayPal a value trap? I don't think so."", ""The company's business continues to perform relatively well, even though growth isn't as impressive as in the past. PayPal's revenue jumped 9% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023 and adjusted earnings per share soared 19%."", ""PayPal's Braintree payments platform, which processes credit cards, debit cards, and more, is an especially important growth driver. The company also has solid growth opportunities with its Venmo peer-to-peer payment offering."", ""Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) is arguably one of the most resilient stocks on the market. The big-biotech's shares jumped in 2022 when the overall market plunged and last year, when the market was booming. Over the last 12 months, Vertex's share price has more than doubled."", 'I expect those winning ways to continue. Vertex recently won U.S. and U.K. approvals for Casgevy in treating sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. The gene-editing therapy is effectively a cure for the two rare genetic diseases. Casgevy looks like a sure-fire megablockbuster.', ""Vertex expects to file for regulatory approvals for two other drugs this summer. VX-548 has significant potential as a non-opioid treatment for acute pain. The company's vanzacaftor triple-drug combo could be its most powerful and most profitable cystic fibrosis (CF) therapy yet."", 'Speaking of CF, Vertex still has plenty of growth opportunities in this market. The company continues to push for label expansions of its already-approved therapies to treat younger children and secure additional reimbursements.', 'More game-changing therapies could be on the way. Vertex is advancing inaxaplin into late-stage testing as a treatment for APOL1-mediated kidney disease (AMKS). There are currently no approved drugs that treat the underlying cause of AMKD, and the disease affects more patients than CF does worldwide. In addition, Vertex has multiple programs in early-stage testing that hold the potential to cure type 1 diabetes.', 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), one of the most well-known dividend-paying companies, just raised its dividend by 5.4% to a record high of $0.485 per share. The dividend is payable on April 1 to shareholders of record as of March 15."", ""Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) latest 13F filing came out on Feb. 14, and showed that the company still owns 400 million shares of Coca-Cola, its fourth-largest public equity holding. Here's why the dividend stock is worth buying now."", ""The $0.10 dividend raise is the largest nominal increase since Coke's $0.10 raise between 2014 and 2015. But because the dividend is higher today, the percentage increase is 5.4% compared to 8.2% 10 years ago."", 'Year', 'Dividends per Share', 'Year-Over-Year Increase', '2024 (projected)', '$1.94', '5.4%', '2023', '$1.84', '4.6%', '2022', '$1.76', '4.8%', '2021', '$1.68', '2.4%', '2020', '$1.64', '2.5%', '2019', '$1.60', '2.6%', '2018', '$1.56', '5.4%', '2017', '$1.48', '5.7%', '2016', '$1.40', '6.1%', '2015', '$1.32', '8.2%', 'Data source: Coca-Cola.', 'Still, this is the largest percentage increase Coke has granted since 2017 to 2018. A big reason why is revenue and earnings growth.', 'It has been a challenging time for Coke and its peers, which have dealt with changes in consumer demand, supply chain challenges, and inflationary pressures. Yet Coke has shown impressive pricing power.', ""As you can see in the chart, Coke's earnings are now at a 10-year high, and its sales have improved dramatically. Over the last three years, Coke's revenue is up 37% and diluted earnings per share are up an even better 49%."", ""Coke's revenue is still down from 10 years ago, but the company has transformed from a low 20s operating margin business to a high 20s business. A big part of that is due to operational improvements, but it would be a mistake to overlook Coke's successful portfolio improvements and brand acquisitions, such as Topo Chico in 2017, Costa Coffee in 2018, and full ownership of BodyArmor in 2021."", ""All three deals expand beyond Coke's traditional soft drink business and provide the diversification needed to address evolving consumer preferences. There have been some hiccups along the way, namely with BodyArmor. But overall, Coke's management of new brands has been a success."", 'Coke is staging a comeback, but the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 over the last decade, putting up a 110% total return (which includes dividends) compared to 228% for the S&P 500. Coke should have better returns as long as the fundamentals continue to improve.', ""But no matter what, Coke's dividend is there for investors to collect a reliable source of passive income. The dividend is arguably the most important element of the Coke investment thesis. It's one of the reasons why Berkshire Hathaway has held Coke stock for decades. To quote the Berkshire Hathaway 2022 annual letter:"", ""In August 1994 -- yes, 1994 -- Berkshire completed its seven-year purchase of the 400 million shares of Coca-Cola we now own. The total cost was $1.3 billion -- then a very meaningful sum at Berkshire. The cash dividend we received from Coke in 1994 was $75 million. By 2022, the dividend had increased to $704 million. Growth occurred every year, just as certain as birthdays. All Charlie and I were required to do was cash Coke's quarterly dividend checks. We expect that those checks are highly likely to grow."", ""Coke is the perfect role-player stock in a diversified portfolio. It's not going to put up jaw-dropping capital gains, but it is going to fulfill a specific purpose and come through even in a bear market."", ""Coke has a 3.3% dividend yield compared to 4.2% for the 10-year Treasury . But between the two, I would say Coke is a much better choice. Coke's dividend is as reliable as it gets. Not as reliable as a risk-free rate from the U.S. government.\xa0But with Coke, you get to collect one of the most reliable payouts out there while also participating in the stock market."", ""The business is in its best shape in over seven years. The company wouldn't issue a dividend raise this large unless it were confident in its earnings growth and ability to build upon that raise. Meanwhile, the stock isn't terribly expensive, sporting a 24 price-to-earnings ratio, compared to just over 27 for the S&P 500."", ""All told, Coke blends a sizable dividend yield with a reliable business. It's the perfect dividend stock for risk-averse investors or retirees looking to supplement income in retirement."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

The S&P 500 has long been a source of passive income. But investing in an S&P 500 index fund yields just 1.5% right now, far lower than the risk-free 10-year Treasury rate at 4.2%.', ""The S&P 500's yield is down because the index's growth has outpaced the growth rate of many top dividend stocks, and the fact that the index is now made up of a higher percentage of companies that don't pay dividends at all (or very low dividends)."", ""Chevron (NYSE: CVX), United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS), and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) all yield more than double the S&P 500. Here's why each dividend stock is worth buying now."", 'A lot is going right for Chevron right now. The company just raised its dividend by 8% to a record high thanks to a strong overall performance in 2023. It also bought back a record amount of its own stock last year.', ""And to top it all off, Berkshire Hathaway's latest 13F filing showed that it increased its Chevron stake by 14.4% in the fourth quarter of 2023."", 'Chevron is down 17.8% from its all-time high, but if oil prices remain where they are, it has what it takes to make a new all-time high.', ""West Texas Intermediate, the domestic benchmark oil price, is $78 a barrel as of this writing. It's not the blowout price we saw in 2022, but Chevron doesn't need a triple-digit oil price to generate gobs of free cash flow."", ""Technological improvements, portfolio optimization, and cost reductions have combined to make today's market leaders some of the most efficient and profitable producers the energy industry has ever seen."", ""Chevron has the balance sheet needed to handle a drawdown in oil prices, and plenty of upside potential if oil prices climb from here. It also has a 4% dividend yield, which is competitive in today's market."", ""UPS hasn't always been the high-yield dividend stock it is today. In early 2022, it raised its dividend by 49% on the back of record years in 2020 and 2021. It has raised its dividend slightly since then. Today, it pays a $1.63 quarterly dividend, good for a forward yield of 4.4%."", ""As you can see in the chart, UPS' yield is higher than historic levels, Chevron's has moved up and down due to the volatility of the oil and gas industry, Coke's has stayed consistent, and the yield of the S&P 500 has trended down."", ""UPS' yield is particularly high because the stock has been under pressure. Despite management's hopes, the surge in package delivery volumes in 2020 and 2021 has proved to be less sticky than originally thought. Revenue has been declining, but it's the profitability that has taken the biggest hit since UPS has continued to invest in growth and route expansions."", 'Operating margins went from a 10-year high to near a 10-year low. Earnings are getting closer to reaching their pre-pandemic levels. And so is the stock price, which finished 2019 at $117 a share and is currently around $148.', ""The setup for UPS makes a lot of sense. The company is undergoing a cyclical downturn but is less than 30% higher than where it finished in 2019. That's way too low for all of the improvements UPS has made over the last four years, not to mention the dividend is far higher today."", ""Results for UPS will probably get worse or at least languish before they get better. But if you're patient, it could be a great turnaround play to buy now, not to mention a worthwhile passive-income source."", ""The dividend yields of individual companies can rise and fall for various reasons. But the two big factors are a stock's price and its history of dividend raises."", 'If a stock rises, on average, 5% a year and raises its dividend at 5% per year, we should expect the yield to stay the same. Whereas if a stock doubles, but the company only raises the dividend by 25%, then investors will be happy even though the stock has a lower yield.', 'Coca-Cola has been underperforming the market. But it has been an incredible dividend payer. On Feb. 15, it announced its 62nd consecutive annual dividend increase, bringing the quarterly dividend to $0.485 per share, or $1.94 per year.', 'The company is a Dividend King -- one of a group of businesses that have paid and raised their dividends annually for at least 50 consecutive years. However, many Dividend Kings implement minimum raises to keep the streak alive.', ""Coke doesn't do that. It has the earnings growth and balance sheet to make more meaningful raises. The recent raise boosted the dividend by 5.4%, which is a lot for a company the size of Coca-Cola. Over the last 12 months, it has paid nearly $8 billion in dividends, so for each percentage point it increases, it pays another $80 million a year."", ""Coke might not always keep pace with a strong bull market, but its business model isn't cyclical and is recession-resistant. It is dependable no matter what the market is doing. That might not mean much for a young risk-tolerant investor with a multidecade time horizon. But for a risk-averse investor or someone in retirement, Coca-Cola is the perfect dividend stock to buy now."", 'Dividend-paying companies take a portion of their earnings and return them to shareholders instead of using all of their earnings to fuel their growth. The strategy makes sense for established businesses like Chevron, UPS, and Coke, but not for a fast-growing company with capital-intensive growth opportunities.', 'For this reason, dividend-paying companies often underperform the market when it is putting up blowout returns, but they can keep pace or even beat the market during mediocre conditions.', ""These three companies aren't ideal investments if you're trying to ride the market wave higher, but they are the perfect long-term investments for compounding wealth over time -- a strategy that is always better than trying to time the market."", 'Chevron, UPS, and Coke deserve to be top choices for investors looking for well-rounded companies with yields that are substantially higher than the market average.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Chevron right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Chevron, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Chevron wasn’t one of them.

The filing indicates that Intuit Inc (NASDAQ:INTU) has achieved a net revenue increase from $5,638 million in the six months ended January 31, 2023, to $6,364 million in the same period in 2024. Net income has also seen a substantial rise from $208 million to $594 million. This financial overview suggests that Intuit Inc (NASDAQ:INTU) is not only expanding its market presence but also enhancing its profitability, a testament to its strategic initiatives and robust product offerings.', ""Market Leadership and Brand Equity: Intuit Inc (NASDAQ:INTU) continues to dominate the U.S. market for small-business accounting and DIY tax-filing software, thanks to its flagship products QuickBooks and TurboTax. The company's strong brand equity, built over decades, has fostered a loyal customer base and high brand recognition. This is evident in the latest financial results, where service revenue has increased from $4,573 million to $5,143 million year-over-year for the six months ended January 31, 2024. The brand's strength is a key differentiator in the competitive financial software market."", ""Financial Performance: The company's financial health is robust, with a significant increase in net income from $208 million to $594 million for the six months ended January 31, 2024. This financial stability is underpinned by a strong balance sheet and a consistent track record of profitability. Intuit Inc (NASDAQ:INTU)'s ability to generate cash from operations, which stands at $516 million for the six months ended January 31, 2024, provides it with the flexibility to invest in growth opportunities and return value to shareholders."", ""Dependence on Seasonal Patterns: Intuit Inc (NASDAQ:INTU)'s business model exhibits a significant degree of seasonality, with a substantial portion of its revenue derived from tax-related products and services during the tax season. This seasonality can lead to fluctuations in quarterly financial results, potentially affecting stock performance and investor sentiment. The company's operating income reflects this pattern, with higher net revenues typically recorded in the second and third quarters."", ""Legal and Regulatory Challenges: Intuit Inc (NASDAQ:INTU) faces ongoing legal proceedings, such as the FTC Actions, which could result in significant costs and impact the company's reputation. Although the FTC's final order does not contain monetary penalties, the requirement to adhere to certain marketing practices could constrain Intuit Inc (NASDAQ:INTU)'s promotional strategies. The complexity and uncertain nature of legal proceedings pose a risk to the company's operational and financial stability."", ""Technological Innovation: Intuit Inc (NASDAQ:INTU) is heavily invested in AI and data capabilities, which are crucial for delivering accelerated innovation. The company's focus on developing an AI-driven expert platform positions it to offer cutting-edge solutions that address customer needs effectively. This technological edge could lead to the development of new products and services, further solidifying Intuit Inc (NASDAQ:INTU)'s market position."", 'Strategic Acquisitions: Intuit Inc (NASDAQ:INTU) has a history of strategic acquisitions, such as Mailchimp, which enhance its product offerings and expand its market reach. These acquisitions allow Intuit Inc (NASDAQ:INTU) to tap into new customer segments and offer a more comprehensive suite of services, driving long-term growth and customer retention.', ""Intense Competition: The financial technology sector is highly competitive, with new entrants and established players vying for market share. Intuit Inc (NASDAQ:INTU) must continuously innovate and improve its offerings to maintain its leadership position. The company's reliance on third-party distribution platforms, such as Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store, also exposes it to changes in terms and policies that could adversely affect its financial results."", ""Macroeconomic Conditions: Macroeconomic factors, such as interest rate fluctuations and economic downturns, can impact consumer and small business spending patterns. Intuit Inc (NASDAQ:INTU)'s performance is tied to the financial health of its customer base, making it susceptible to broader economic trends that could affect demand for its products and services."", ""In conclusion, Intuit Inc (NASDAQ:INTU) demonstrates a strong financial performance and strategic positioning in its latest 10-Q filing. The company's strengths, such as its market leadership and robust financials, provide a solid foundation for growth. However, it must navigate weaknesses like seasonality and legal challenges while capitalizing on opportunities in AI and strategic acquisitions. Intuit Inc (NASDAQ:INTU) must also remain vigilant against threats from intense competition and macroeconomic conditions to sustain its success in the dynamic financial technology landscape."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with VMC.', ""On February 22, 2024, Vulcan Materials Co (NYSE:VMC), the United States' premier producer of construction aggregates, released its annual 10-K filing, revealing a year of robust performance and strategic positioning. With 234.3 million tons of aggregates sold and a substantial 16 billion tons of aggregates reserves, VMC's financial health is reflected in its increased aggregates gross profit per ton from $5.81 to $7.40 over two years. The company's focus on high-growth metropolitan areas and its strategic approach to operations have contributed to its strong financial standing and market leadership."", ""Market Leadership and Scale: Vulcan Materials Co (NYSE:VMC) stands as the largest producer of construction aggregates in the U.S., a position that affords it significant competitive advantages. With 397 active aggregates facilities and a presence in key growth states, VMC's scale allows for operational efficiencies and cost-effective procurement. The company's strategic reserve locations, catering to high-growth metropolitan areas, ensure a steady demand for its products. This scale and market presence have enabled VMC to achieve a 27% increase in aggregates gross profit per ton from 2021 to 2023, showcasing the strength of its business model."", ""Innovative Operational Practices: VMC's operational excellence is a cornerstone of its success. The company's Vulcan Way of Operating, which emphasizes continuous improvement and safety, coupled with its Commercial Excellence & Logistics Innovation, has driven profitability. These practices have not only improved customer service and asset utilization but have also led to a significant increase in aggregates cash gross profit per ton, demonstrating the effectiveness of VMC's strategic disciplines."", ""Dependence on Cyclical Construction Industry: VMC's reliance on the construction industry, which is inherently cyclical, poses a risk to its financial stability. Economic downturns or reductions in infrastructure spending can lead to decreased demand for aggregates, impacting VMC's revenue. This dependence is evident in the company's top ten revenue-producing states, which accounted for 88% of its 2023 revenues, indicating a potential vulnerability to regional economic fluctuations."", ""Regulatory and Environmental Challenges: The aggregates industry is heavily regulated, with stringent zoning and permitting regulations. VMC's operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations that can impose significant costs and constraints. For instance, the company's Calica operations in Mexico are currently halted, highlighting the impact that regulatory challenges can have on its international business endeavors."", ""Demographic and Economic Growth in Served States: VMC is well-positioned to capitalize on projected demographic and economic growth in the states it serves. With 76% of the U.S. population growth and 75% of household formations expected to occur in Vulcan-served states over the next decade, the company has significant opportunities to invest in high-return projects. This growth potential is supported by VMC's strategic reserve locations and its focus on metropolitan areas with high demand for construction materials."", ""Strategic Acquisitions and Market Expansion: VMC has a history of growth through strategic acquisitions, such as the purchase of U.S. Concrete, which expanded its aggregates-led business in growing metropolitan areas. The fragmented nature of the aggregates industry presents ongoing opportunities for consolidation and market expansion. VMC's disciplined approach to mergers and acquisitions positions it to continue enhancing its core business and expanding its reach."", ""Economic and Political Uncertainties: VMC's business could be adversely affected by economic and political uncertainties, including changes in federal, state, and local funding for infrastructure. The company's reliance on public infrastructure projects, which are often subject to political decision-making and budgetary constraints, could lead to fluctuations in demand for its products. Additionally, global economic developments and domestic policy changes, such as those related to climate change and tax policy, could pose threats to VMC's operations."", 'Competition and Technological Disruption: The construction industry is highly competitive, and VMC must continuously innovate to maintain its market position. Technological advancements could disrupt traditional business models and distribution methods. VMC must stay ahead of such changes to remain competitive and avoid losing market share to emerging competitors or alternative materials.', 'In conclusion, Vulcan Materials Co (NYSE:VMC) exhibits a robust SWOT profile with its strong market leadership, operational excellence, and strategic positioning poised to leverage growth opportunities in high-demand areas.

GuruFocus has detected 11 Warning Signs with PCG.', ""Valero Energy Corp (NYSE:VLO), a leading independent refiner, has recently filed its 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. With a market capitalization of approximately $41.4 billion as of mid-2023, Valero operates 15 refineries and 12 ethanol plants, boasting a significant throughput capacity. The company's financial health is reflected in its strategic share repurchase programs, indicating a strong balance sheet and investor confidence. The recent filing provides a comprehensive view of Valero's operational strengths, potential growth areas, and the challenges it faces in a dynamic market environment."", ""Refining and Production Capabilities: Valero Energy Corp's extensive refining network, with a capacity of 3.2 million barrels per day, positions it as a dominant player in the industry. Its strategic locations across the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. enable efficient distribution and supply chain management. Valero's ethanol production further diversifies its portfolio, with 1.6 billion gallons per year capacity, reinforcing its market presence and providing a hedge against crude oil price volatility."", ""Financial Resilience: Valero's financial acumen is evident in its share repurchase programs, with $2.5 billion authorized in September 2023 and an additional $2.5 billion in February 2024. These buybacks reflect a strong balance sheet and a commitment to delivering shareholder value. The company's ability to maintain liquidity and manage debt effectively, even amidst market fluctuations, underscores its financial stability."", ""Dependency on Commodity Prices: Valero's profitability is closely tied to the margins between feedstock costs and product prices, which are subject to global supply and demand dynamics. The inherent volatility in crude oil and ethanol markets can lead to unpredictable financial results, posing a challenge to sustained profitability."", ""Regulatory and Environmental Pressures: Compliance with evolving environmental regulations, such as California's SBx 1-2, requires significant investment and can impact operational flexibility. The potential imposition of penalties for exceeding maximum margins or restrictions on maintenance activities could adversely affect Valero's financial performance and necessitate asset impairment considerations."", ""Low-Carbon Fuel Demand: Valero's joint venture in Diamond Green Diesel positions it to capitalize on the growing demand for renewable diesel. With a production capacity of 1.2 billion gallons per year, the company is well-placed to benefit from regulations and policies driving low-carbon fuel consumption, presenting a significant growth opportunity."", ""Strategic Investments: Valero's investments in logistics assets, such as pipelines and marine transportation, enhance its operational efficiency and provide a competitive edge. The company's ability to optimize its supply chain and access key markets can lead to expanded market share and revenue growth."", ""Market Volatility: The cyclical nature of the energy sector exposes Valero to market volatility. Fluctuations in feedstock prices and product demand can lead to margin pressures, impacting the company's financial performance. Additionally, geopolitical events and OPEC's influence on crude oil prices add layers of unpredictability to Valero's operating environment."", ""Environmental and Legal Risks: Valero faces ongoing legal proceedings and environmental enforcement matters, such as those with the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. These proceedings can result in significant monetary sanctions and reputational damage. Moreover, the company's operations are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations, which could lead to increased compliance costs and operational constraints."", ""In conclusion, Valero Energy Corp (NYSE:VLO) exhibits a strong operational foundation with significant refining and ethanol production capabilities. Its financial resilience is a testament to its strategic management and shareholder value focus. However, the company must navigate the challenges of commodity price dependency, regulatory pressures, and market volatility. By leveraging opportunities in renewable diesel and strategic investments, Valero can enhance its competitive position and address potential threats. The company's forward-looking strategies, aimed at meeting low-carbon fuel demand, will be crucial in sustaining its market leadership in the evolving energy landscape."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

With a market capitalization of approximately $15.5 billion as of mid-2023, LKQ Corp has established itself as a significant player in the automotive aftermarket industry. The company's financial tables reveal a robust business model, with a diverse product portfolio and a strategic focus on operational excellence, margin enhancement, and free cash flow growth. LKQ Corp's extensive network of approximately 1,700 facilities worldwide underscores its commitment to providing a comprehensive range of automotive parts and services, positioning it well to capitalize on market opportunities and navigate industry challenges."", ""Extensive Distribution Network and Product Offerings: LKQ Corp's expansive distribution network, comprising roughly 1,650 facilities globally, is a cornerstone of its competitive advantage.

However, it must address challenges related to economic dependencies and product portfolio complexity.

In the interim, Justin is serving as our Global Chief Operating Officer, and I look forward to working with him and our segment teams to ensure the continuation of our operational excellence program that we started late in 2018. Nowhere has this program been more evident than in our Wholesale North America segment, which under Justin's direction has significantly expanded margins, improved cash flow, all while enhancing our leading market position. Time and again, Justin has proven himself as both a strong operating executive and an effective leader who definitively embodies LKQ's values. It is a pleasure having Justin on the call today in his well-deserved new role. I'm going to start by providing some high-level comments related to our performance in the quarter and the full year 2023 followed by Rick, who will dive into the financial details and discuss our 2024 guidance, and then Justin will provide some initial thoughts and commentary on our businesses, the path forward and an update on our Uni-Select integration. Let me start with what LKQ accomplished in the last year, a year where operational excellence remained at the forefront of our efforts as we look to drive organic revenue growth, productivity and excellent free cash flow. I am proud to say that the LKQ team delivered. Here are some of the 2023 accomplishments worth noting. LKQ delivered strong full year organic revenue growth for parts and services of 4.7% on a reported basis and 5.1% on a per day basis. In February, we announced the highly synergistic Uni-Select acquisition and closed the transaction on August 1. We used our free cash flow to begin paying down debt as we strive to reduce our total leverage ratio to 2.0x. We're well on our way with net debt paydowns of over $375 million since the transaction closing and the total leverage ratio at year-end was just 2.3x. We returned about $300 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and increased the quarterly amount by 9% in October. We also continued our share repurchase program with a $38 million outlay during the year, of which $30 million was completed in the fourth quarter. And finally, we sustained the positive momentum in terms of cash flow generation with free cash flow of approximately $1 billion in 2023. This represents the fourth consecutive year at or above $1 billion and the 2023 results reflect a solid conversion ratio of 59% of adjusted EBITDA. Now on to the quarterly results. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $3.5 billion, an increase of 16.6% as compared to $3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022. Parts and services organic revenue increased 2.8% on a reported basis and 3.4% on a per day basis. Foreign exchange rates increased revenue by 2.7% and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures increased revenue by 13.1% year-over-year for a total parts and services revenue increase of 18.7%. Other revenue fell 16.4%, primarily due to weaker precious metal prices relative to the same period in 2022. Let's turn to some of the quarterly segment highlights. Organic revenue for parts and services for our North America segment increased 5.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. We continue to perform well in North America, especially when you consider that according to CCC, collision and liability-related auto claims were down 7.9% year-over-year. We believe the significant outperformance is due to several factors, including an industry-wide increase in alternative part usage or APU, which was in part driven by the continued progress of the State Farm rollout. The remaining positive impact of the UAW strikes and lastly, LKQ continuing to take market share. The upward trend in our aftermarket volumes and the ongoing improvement in our order fill rates continued with fill rates reaching close to 95% in the fourth quarter, the highest level in 2023. As the supply chain recovered and fill rates increased, APU trended in our favor, particularly when looking at vehicles in our sweet spot. While total APU was about 36% in 2023, when looking at vehicles 4 to 6 old, it was approximately 40% and for vehicles more than 7 years old, it was 51.6%. Both results represent meaningful increases over the 2022 levels. The aging car part will increase demand for the types of parts we sell into the collision repair industry. The salvage business had solid organic growth, largely driven by volume. Total loss rates increased a bit in 2023 to 20.8%. But as you can see, it had no impact on our organic growth. Importantly, the increase in total loss rates is largely being driven by vehicles 10 years and older, which is a population of vehicles at the very tail end of our sweet spot. For perspective, today, the average model year of vehicle being repaired in a Collision Bay is a 2017 model with the total loss rate for that cohort of vehicles being just 18.4% in 2023, that further supports our thesis that total loss rates will not materially impact our growth. Industry experts believe the total loss rate will edge down a bit in 2024. As we have always stated, fluctuations in total loss rates are largely net neutral events for LKQ. During the quarter, we realized a slight revenue uplift from the UAW strike which has now leveled off and no further benefit is expected. Moving to our European segment. Europe organic revenue for parts and services in the quarter increased 3.9% on a reported basis and 5.1% on a per day basis. All the regions produced solid organic growth in the quarter with a particularly strong performance in the Benelux and Eastern European markets as well as with our private label and salvage product lines. During the fourth quarter, our operations in Germany were again impacted by employee strikes at our large distribution center in Bavaria, while the ongoing discussions and negotiations between the Works Council and Employers Association continued. Throughout this process, our European team has worked diligently to mitigate the day-to-day impact of the strikes and their efforts have begun to offset some of the challenges that have impacted our German operations. Although the strikes continue, we have been able to temporarily add some short-term capacity to operate our business and service our customers. Additionally, to foster a resolution, we recently initiated an incremental and unique approach and proposed terms of an LKQ only offer to the Works Council. We have also commuted those terms to our employees and are cautiously optimistic that we are making positive progress towards a resolution. Rick will provide you with the financial impact shortly. Now let's move on to our Specialty segment. During the fourth quarter, Specialty reported a decrease in organic revenue of 7%, which was under our expectations. Specialty again confronted headwinds specific to RV and towing products. Within the RV space, RV wholesale shipments of new units from the OEs to the dealers ended 2023 on a positive note with an increase of 8.1% in December. This was the second consecutive month of year-over-year growth. Full year shipments, however, were down 36.5%. The general sense in the industry is that the RV headwinds have bottomed out, but we are not yet out of the woods as the dealers are still reluctant to fully restock accessories until they see the demand for new units increase. Truck accessories were also under some pressure in the quarter due to the drop in new vehicle production specific to the pickup and Jeep categories, while marine and off-road product lines generated positive growth. Now to our Self Service segment. Organic revenue for parts and services for Self Service segment decreased 5.6% in the fourth quarter. Self Service was again challenged by soft commodity pricing as seen in the other revenue decline, which impacted our expectations. The soft precious metal prices have continued into 2024. And in the short term, we expect little relief from commodities as we have modeled accordingly. Briefly on the Red Sea crisis, as far as we can predict, there will be minimal impact on parts availability in our key segments. In Europe, our procurement team is seeing some disruption with the shipping lines having to divert their vessels via the Cape of Good Hope around South Africa, increasing lead times and freight costs. The freight cost is expected to soften once the Chinese New Year, 4 weeks from mid-January ends. As one would expect, if the crisis persists, then we will potentially witness an increase in freight costs. Our supply chain team is taking precautionary measures by adding additional orders to address the extra lead times, especially with our private label product. Lastly, on October 25, 2023, as I mentioned on the last earnings call, we completed the divestment of GSF Car Parts, formerly owned by Uni-Select. Since the GSF Car Parts business was held separately and never integrated into our business, we classified the business as discontinued operations upon acquisition. Before I turn it over to Rick, who will run through the details of the segment results and discuss our outlook for 2024, I am pleased to announce that on February 20, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share of common stock that will be payable on March 28 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 14, 2024."", 'Rick Galloway', ""Thank you, Nick, and welcome to everyone joining us today. Before I address the fourth quarter, I would like to reflect on what LKQ accomplished throughout 2023. We were optimistic about our prospects going into 2023 despite macroeconomic challenges, inflation and declining commodity prices. With our operational excellence focus and strong balance sheet, we concentrated on the things we could control. And in those areas, we were very pleased with our performance. We encountered headwinds that set back the overall profitability, but we believe many of these are transitory and will be minimal in 2024. The nondiscretionary nature of the majority of our business and the resiliency of our industry allows us to perform well in almost any market environment. Referring to the walk on Slide 4, I want to highlight the key year-over-year variances in our full year results. We reported diluted earnings per share of $3.51 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.83, the latter of which was a $0.02 decrease relative to 2022. Our operational performance was a strong positive delivering $0.27 year-over-year improvement with exceptional growth in North America, partially offset by softness in precious metal prices and difficult market conditions impacting our Specialty and Self Service segments. Europe also contributed to the improvement with solid revenue growth and productivity benefits, helping to offset the effects of the German strikes and the value-added tax matter in Italy. We benefited by $0.10 due to the lower share count resulting from our share repurchases in 2022. We experienced year-over-year headwinds from market conditions, the most notable of which were $0.19 from the impact of metal prices as shown on Slide 28, and $0.13 in higher interest expense resulting from rate increases, excluding Uni-Select costs. Acquisition and divestiture activities had a negative effect, including a $0.04 of dilution from the Uni-Select acquisition. Important to note, this result was $0.01 better than we anticipated in our Q4 guidance and $0.02 of reduced earnings related to the PGW divestiture in April 2022. Foreign exchange rates were favorable on average in 2023, which contributed to a $0.02 benefit. The tax provision represented a $0.06 benefit, driven mostly by favorable impacts from discrete items. We have also included a fourth quarter EPS walk on Slide 5. The main variances are similar to the full year drivers but with income taxes representing the largest variance from 2022. The 2023 provision included favorable discrete items and a slight full year effective rate reduction, while 2022 reflected a negative provision effect from increasing our full year effective rate and unfavorable discrete items. To expand on the operating performance for the quarter, I will provide additional detail on the segment results. Going to Slide 12. Wholesale North America continued its strong performance with a segment EBITDA margin of 16.3%. Q4 was the first full quarter with Uni-Select and as communicated, the transaction was dilutive to the segment margin by 220 basis points. Without Uni-Select, North American margins would have been comparable to Q4 2022 and would have delivered a record full year EBITDA margin of 19.7%. Q4 2023 benefited from some incremental sales in October and November attributed to effects of the UAW strike, and we don't expect further upside in 2024. The Uni-Select integration is progressing ahead of schedule. And with FinishMaster and LKQ locations merging, it's becoming increasingly difficult to determine a stand-alone Uni-Select impact. Therefore, we will not provide specific Uni-Select impacts on the North American results going forward, but we'll instead report just on synergy achievement. We expect the 2024 North American full year EBITDA margin, including Uni-Select to be around 17%. As shown on Slide 13, Europe reported segment EBITDA margin of 8.3%, down 170 basis points from the prior year period. There were several unusual items, which had a negative effect of 110 basis points on the results. First, the strikes at our primary distribution center in Germany continued in Q4, and we estimated the loss revenue and negative effect on the segment EBITDA margin of 50 basis points. Second, we booked a nonrecurring compensation charge for $6 million which impacted the margin by 40 basis points. Finally, we recorded a reserve for a value-added tax matter, which lowered the margin by 20 basis points. The remaining margin variance is attributable to inflationary cost effects in SG&A expenses, primarily in personnel costs. Looking ahead to 2024, we project a return to a double-digit margin as we work past the strikes and the transitory effects that dropped the segment below a 10% margin in 2023. Moving to Slide 14. Specialties EBITDA margin of 5.7% decreased 50 basis points compared to the prior year. Gross margin, which was down 290 basis points year-over-year is under pressure from increased price competition as inventory availability continues to improve for our competitors. In addition to unfavorable product mix as the lower-margin lines such as auto and marine have been less affected by revenue reductions than the RV market. I am pleased to report our SG&A expenses were favorable by 210 basis points mostly related to personnel and primarily coming from management restructuring efforts in the last 12 months to align the cost structure with revenue trends and lower benefits and insurance costs. 2023 was a tough year for Specialty. But by focusing on controllable costs, the team was able to mitigate some of the negative leverage effect on margin caused by the revenue decline. Going into 2024, this segment still faces challenging conditions, and we expect low single-digit organic revenue growth. However, we are optimistic about our ability to improve EBITDA margins by 10 to 30 basis points through productivity. As you can see on Slide 15, Self Service profitability improved sequentially to EBITDA margins of 6.0% this quarter from a loss of 0.6% in the third quarter and increased relative to the 5.2% reported in Q4 2022. Metals prices had a net negative effect on results of $6 million with lower precious metal prices representing a $13 million reduction in EBITDA and lag effects from sequential scrap steel price changes driving a $7 million improvement. Other revenue decreased by 25% in total, contributing to a reduction in operating leverage of 620 basis points. As part of the actions taken earlier in 2023, our average car cost decreased by 6% and 18% in Q4 relative to Q3 and Q2, respectively, which provided some margin relief and contributed to the year-over-year improvement. We are pleased with the return to profitability in the fourth quarter and expect to improve our 2024 segment EBITDA in dollar terms compared to 2023. Shifting to cash flows and the balance sheet. We produced $87 million in free cash flow during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $1.0 billion. As expected, free cash flow was relatively light in the quarter as we had $96 million of interest payments including the first payment on the U.S. bonds issued in May and $125 million of capital expenditures. And $358 million of CapEx for the year, we exceeded our prior guidance by $58 million as we took advantage of our strong cash flow and liquidity position to make strategic purchases, some of which were pulled forward from our 2024 plan. For the year, the cash conversion ratio is 59% conversion of EBITDA to free cash flow, in line with our targeted range of 55% to 60%. With the future headwinds related to interest expense and capital spending requirements, we are widening our cash conversion target range to 50% to 60%. While we have opportunities to drive trade working capital lower, such as with the supply chain finance program, these opportunities are not as abundant as they were years ago when we began our operational excellence journey. The team has done terrific work to lower working capital levels over the last 5 years and the effects we're seeing in the strong free cash flow figures. We believe we can continue to generate free cash flow in the range of $1 billion on a recurring basis by converting earnings growth into cash flow, being efficient in our deployment of trade working capital and expanding our supply chain finance program. As of December 31, we had total debt of $4.3 billion with a total leverage ratio 2.3x EBITDA. We paid down over $375 million in debt between the acquisition of Uni-Select at the beginning of August and year-end, a portion of which came from the sale proceeds related to the GSF business we divested in October. We remain committed to reducing our total leverage ratio to 2.0x within 18 months of the Uni-Select acquisition or more specifically during Q1 2025. Our current maturities include the EUR 500 million senior notes due on April 1, we are working on refinancing options and expect to have a refinancing in place in the near term. Our effective borrowing rate was 5.8% for the quarter as market rates remained relatively high in the U.S. and Europe. We have $1.2 billion in unhedged variable rate debt, so a 100 basis point rise in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by $12 million. I will conclude with our thoughts on projected 2024 results as shown on Slides 6 and 7. Our guidance is based on current market conditions, recent trends and assume scrap and precious metal prices hold near December prices. On foreign exchange, our guidance includes recent European rates with balance of the year rates for the euro of $1.09, the pound sterling at $1.27 and the Canadian dollar at $0.74. We expect organic parts and services revenue growth between 3.5% and 5.5%. Please note that we have 1 to 2 more selling days in 2024, depending on the market, with the increase coming in the second half of the year. Europe will be down a selling day in Q1 due to the timing of Easter. Our 2024 estimate includes growth associated with the expansion of aftermarket parts volume resulting from State Farm and the impact of Uni-Select, which will be included in organic parts and services revenue beginning on August 1. We are projecting full year adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.90 to $4.20 with a midpoint of $4.05. This is an increase of $0.22 or 6% at the midpoint relative to the 2023 actual figure. Looking at Slide 6 in the presentation, you can see how we get from the 2023 actual EPS to our 2024 guidance. Operating performance is expected to generate growth of $0.22 relative to the 2023 results with growth coming from all 4 segments. We expect Europe and North America, including the Uni-Select contribution to generate more year-over-year growth than Specialty and Self Service. The transitory items in Europe noted in the last few quarters are expected to be a lesser impact in 2024 and thus will add $0.09 compared to 2023. The exchange rate benefit is nominal. Commodity prices are expected to be a headwind of $0.09 as the current precious metal prices used in the guidance are below the 2023 average. Excluding the impact of Uni-Select, interest expense is projected to be a nominal impact with a higher average rate mitigated by debt paydowns. Consistent with past practices, we have not anticipated future share repurchases beyond the call date of our guidance. We have included an effective tax rate of 26.8% in our 2024 guidance in line with the final 2023 rate. We expect to deliver approximately $1 billion of free cash flow for the year, achieving an EBITDA conversion to free cash flow in the low 50% range. There are various puts and takes in this estimate, including higher cash payments for interest and building inventory, offset by improved earnings and increased payables. Capital spending is expected to be at the high end of our target range, again, at $350 million, which includes key investments in salvage capacity and Specialty distribution to support productivity and margin enhancement initiatives. We feel good about the projected full year cash flow estimate and the conversion ratio, generating $1 billion in free cash flow provides flexibility to continue a balanced capital allocation strategy, including debt paydowns, our quarterly dividend, share repurchases and investments in high synergy tuck-in acquisitions. In terms of quarterly phasing, we expect the earnings growth to be weighted more heavily to the back half of the year. Q1 has been affected by extreme weather conditions in certain markets and very low catalytic converter prices, which in recent weeks were running near 50% of the price in the same period of 2023. Q1 will also be affected by the timing of Easter, resulting in a loss selling day in Europe. The balance of the year will benefit from the additional selling base mentioned previously and a ramp-up of Uni-Select synergies as the year progresses. Thanks for your time today. With that, I'll turn the call to Justin to discuss his vision and priorities for LKQ going forward."", 'Justin L. Jude', ""Thank you, Rick, and good morning to everyone on the call. First, I am honored to be chosen to succeed Nick later this year as the next Chief Executive Officer of LKQ. And I'm humbled to be able to lead our talented team into the future. I'd like to thank Nick for his mentorship and leadership. Our Board trusted me to lead LKQ through this next chapter and most importantly, I'd like to thank my wife and kids for their love, patience and support because without them, I wouldn't to be where I am today. As I prepare to step into the CEO role in July, I am filled with enthusiasm and a deep sense of responsibility. My vision for LKQ is rooted in 3 fundamental principles: people, growth and operational excellence. People are at the heart of LKQ. My first and foremost commitment is to each of my fellow team members across our global organization who are the backbone in essence of LKQ. LKQ's employee-focused culture centered around communication, accountability, integrity and respect is not just a goal. It's a necessity for our collective success. Growing our business, delivering excellent service and products to our customers is a part of who we are. We will drive revenue organically by growing share of wallet with our customers and being opportunistic on tuck-in acquisitions. And lastly, operational excellence. We will continue to hone our culture of lean management throughout our operations. This will not only improve our financial metrics, but will also provide a consistent and repeatable operating rhythm where our customers will see continual improvements in our service levels. Alongside these principles, we will focus on 4 key priorities: first, integrate our businesses and simplify our operating model. Second, focus on profitable revenue growth and sustainable margin expansion. Third, drive high levels of free cash flow, which in turn will give us the flexibility to maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy and return capital back to our shareholders and finally, invest in our future. In the short term, the North American wholesale team is focused on the integration of our Uni-Select acquisition and taking full advantage of the tremendous synergies that exist within our global footprint. I'm extremely proud of how the team is performing with the integration. As of today, we have integrated a total of 75 of the 151 FinishMaster locations representing over 52% of the consolidated revenue. Corporate synergies are largely complete and on pace to slightly exceed our expectations. The overall synergy plan is on track to deliver above our previously stated targets well ahead of schedule. The Bumper to Bumper business in Canada completed 2 tuck-in acquisitions in October of 2023, representing a total of 14 locations as we convert some of that market from 3-step to 2-step. And Bumper to Bumper is working closely with our North American and European procurement teams to maximize additional revenue and cost synergies. In January, Bumper to Bumper placed their first purchase order with our Europe's private label team, and we are confident these synergistic orders will increase over time, enhancing our offering and our competitiveness. Importantly, I want to again emphasize that Uni-Select was a unique opportunity that will enable us to widen the moat around our North American business and capitalize on revenue synergies both in the paint and the hard part side that weren't there prior to this acquisition. Our North American teams are the best operators, motivators and integrators in the industry and the results since starting our operational excellence journey and 2019 speaks for itself. I am confident of their ability to generate positive, operational and financial returns with our Uni-Select business integration. Long term, in North America, we will continue to invest both in the recycled and remanufactured EV battery process as we are a Natural fit to become the market leader in this growing space. Turning to Europe. Over the last 45 days, I spent time with our European leadership team diving into multiple aspects of their business. Andy Hamilton, our new CEO of Europe, and I agree that there are many levers to pull in Europe. Our primary objective is to accelerate the integration of 1 LKQ Europe to fully leverage the network of our inventory, which today is still largely country specific. By linking the geographical and regional distribution network across our European footprint, we will drive higher levels of productivity, leading to improved fulfillment rates, enhanced customer service and improved trade working capital. Achieving this objective will allow us to profitably grow and increase our market-leading position. Additionally, in Europe, there is an opportunity to grow our offerings in such areas as private label, collision components, diagnostics and calibration, recycling, remanufacturing and EV aftermarket parts. We also have the ability to expand our LKQ Academy, a program that we offer to independent garages to enhance their EV knowledge base and capabilities allowing these shops to see the changing technology as an opportunity. Lastly, I believe we have an opportunity to rationalize certain areas of our business through facility consolidation and fleet and logistics network optimization, which will allow us to create efficiencies across geographies and product groups. As we work through our ongoing integration efforts, we will continue to assess our mix of businesses and take decisive actions to determine if we are the right owners of certain assets prior to integrating. In closing, I am extremely excited about driving our mission forward and expanding a lean operating model across our entire organization with a primary objective to move swiftly. LKQ has an extraordinary history and importantly, an extremely bright future. Now let me turn it back over to Nick for his closing comments."", 'Dominick P. Zarcone', ""Thank you, Justin, for your thoughtful perspective and comments and Rick for that detailed financial overview. Our organization has once again proven to be incredibly resilient in any operating environment. Our global teams have worked with agility and urgency to continuously achieve positive results with our operational excellence strategy and establishing 1 LKQ, a unified and globally focused team.This success is a direct result of a shared mission amongst our over 49,000 employees, which is simply being the leading global value-added and sustainable distributor of vehicle parts and accessories by offering our customers the most comprehensive, available and cost-effective selection of parts and service solutions while building strong partnerships with our employees and the communities in which we operate. I'm confident LKQ will live that mission in 2024 and excel through this leadership transition. LKQ's future is very bright with Justin at the helm. And with that, operator, we are now ready to open the call to questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Daniel Imbro of Stephens.', 'Daniel Robert Imbro', ""Congrats on the quarter. Maybe on -- want to start on the North American side. Rick, Justin, I know you guys aren't guiding to growth by segment. But obviously, it's been holding in there nicely this year. Would this 3.5% to 5.5% kind of organic growth guide be a fair range for North America as well? And could you break out maybe your expectations on what you plan on seeing between pricing and then traffic growth as we head through the new year here in North American side?"", 'Rick Galloway', ""Yes, sure. Thanks, Daniel. Thanks for the question. The way to think about it, I talked a little bit about it in the prepared remarks, Specialty is going to be in the low single digits. So that's going to be on the downside of it, whereas North America and Europe will actually be on a little bit of a higher side. When you think about both of them, it's going to be primarily driven by volumes, as far as where that's going to come out for our North American operations. And then I did talk a little bit about the EBITDA percentage with Uni-Select included 17% is the number that we're guiding towards for our North American operations."", 'Daniel Robert Imbro', ""Great. And then as a follow-up, want to touch on the balance sheet. Obviously, free cash generation remains strong. I want to focus on vendor financing over in Europe. Is there still room to drive that higher? Can you provide any quantification on maybe the progress you've made Rick, over the last few years. And then in terms of uses of cash, good to see the buyback restart here in 4Q. Are you comfortable with that being a more ratable part of capital allocation moving forward?"", 'Rick Galloway', ""Yes. I appreciate the question. You're spot on. The vendor financing program, supplier financial program, we're very pleased with what we saw. We ended the year at $411 million of -- in the vendor financing program. That includes $71 million related to Uni-Select with the acquisition that we did. That's compared to $244 million that we had at the end of 2022. Obviously, there's going to be some ups and downs. We finished a little bit on the high end from what we expected, but very good usage. We'll continue to see a little bit more going into that, particularly for our European but also for our Uni-Select operations, hoping to drive a little bit more free cash flow, but it's not going to be at those same levels. It's not going to be a 20% increase going into 2024. So I caution you to not put too much in there as far as that goes. And then on the share repurchases, we're pleased with where we are turning out on free cash flow. We hit the $1 billion that we had talked about. That's inclusive of the $30 million that we purchased in Q4 on shares. And then again, we were active in Q1, and we think that this will be a regular piece of it. Obviously, there's significant commitment that we made on the leverage ratios getting down to 2x within the first 18 months. So that's technically January or Q1 of 2025. So there'll be a significant overweighting on the debt payments throughout the year, but we will be active as we see opportunities."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman of Stifel.', 'Michael Edward Hoffman', 'Nick, I know you got 1 more earnings call, but you do get to leave the business better than you found it. So well done.', 'Dominick P. Zarcone', 'Thank you, Michael.', 'Michael Edward Hoffman', ""So my question is back to the free cash. I think you're getting a lot of these today probably. And there's 2 parts of it. When do we get back to a compounded growth rate in the cash? And then the European question, part of that is, what's the remaining gap between payables and inventory in Europe that is an opportunity to capture that would drive some of that compounding?"", 'Rick Galloway', ""Yes. Thanks, Michael. As far as the free cash flow goes, if you think about the last couple of years, and I talked briefly about this in the prepared remarks. We were able to drive a significant portion of some of our lower-hanging fruit on trade working capital. And then in addition to that, we did have a little bit of a benefit in the last couple of years, not '23, but prior to that, if you're looking back a little bit on CapEx as well, where we did -- we had some supply chain financing -- not supply chain financing, but supply chain issues and getting some of those materials. And so CapEx was a little bit lower. If you think back to like 2020, when we had a high, we only delivered -- we only had about $172 million of CapEx, whereas we have $358 million this year. So there's pretty significant catch-up, if you will, on that portion. So what I would say is we're at a normalized level. And the compounding you're talking about with EBITDA and then driving overall earnings and then driving free cash flow. That's what we should start expecting as we've just now normalized that amount. As far as the opportunity in Europe goes, we think that there's still opportunity. I wouldn't put necessarily a number to it, Michael. I think we had about a 20% improvement, a little over 20% improvement in our vendor financing program in 2023, which is great, it's not going to be 20% in 2024. It's going to be lower than that, but it's still going to be positive and still going to be cash generation coming out of our trade working capital going into 2024."", 'Michael Edward Hoffman', ""Okay. And then my second question, Justin alluded to the possibility of portfolio optimization, and I'll get very specific. I get that self-serve was the start of the company. But at this point, do you need to own the self-serve business to be the LKQ you are today going forward?"", 'Justin L. Jude', ""So first off, I would say our self-serve team managed very well through some challenging conditions in '23. But I'll give you an answer on my overall thoughts on portfolio management, which really hasn't changed for -- from the company standpoint, from a mix standpoint. Our job is always to look at whether we're the right owners of the businesses, whether it's product lines, whether it's businesses that operate in different geographies. And if they fit in our long-term operating model, if they hit our financial metrics, it's something we'll look at keeping and optimizing. And if not, we'll optimize it and look to split. But I would say that's just my general idea on portfolio management. Historically, Self Service has been a decent business for us too."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Craig Kennison of Baird.', 'Craig R. Kennison', 'Nick and Justin, congratulations to you both. Question Justin, I think you talked [about] Europe and some levers that you and Andy might pull. Maybe you could dig into that a little more, especially on the private label side, but any other levers that you can pull to drive margin expansion?', 'Justin L. Jude', ""Yes. Sure. And thanks for the question. I have spent several weeks over in Europe, meeting the teams over there, the leaders of our different businesses. I'm very optimistic about our future. I spent quite a bit of time with Andy Hamilton, our new CEO. Andy did run our ECP operations in the U.K., which was our highest profitable and one of our highest businesses that drive private label. Some of the things that him and I have talked about that and he is laser focused on is category management and that includes driving more private label, which will bring us better margins. Really leveraging our inventory and logistics without borders. Today, we're very optimized within the countries for which we operate, but we're still independent within those countries. So we're going to continue to accelerate the 1 LKQ Europe to leverage that inventory, freeing up free capital. In addition, it will give us better fulfillment rates, which will drive organic revenue and also looking at labor productivity. And so these are things that Andy has been, once again, laser focused on with his team and him and I are aligned on that pretty well. So I'm very optimistic about the opportunities in Europe."", 'Craig R. Kennison', 'As a follow-up, is there a way to frame your fulfillment rates in Europe and contrast them with what you can achieve in the U.S. or North America?', 'Justin L. Jude', ""It's a lot of different product lines today. We're heavily collision-focused in the U.S. and North America versus hard parts over there. We're grabbing some of that, I would say, the best practice is to track fulfillment rates. We have a lot of orders in our European operations that are not necessarily on the phone like they are in the U.S. So a lot of online, a lot of e-commerce with businesses. But one of the things when we look at category management and we rationalized some of the different excess product lines that we make carry, still carrying an application for what the customer is looking for, but maybe not so many different brands that will actually allow us to driver our fulfillment rates up."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Bret Jordan of Jefferies.', 'Bret David Jordan', 'You talked about Bumper to Bumper doing some purchasing from European vendors. Could you talk about how much supply chain synergy there is there? How much Bumper to Bumper product could come from existing vendors?', 'Rick Galloway', ""Yes. We've got -- so Bret, I'll start and then if you want to chime in, Justin. So we've identified within the $55 million, some procurement synergies, it's less than a $10 million number as far as the overall opportunities on that portion of it that we have been already active talking back and forth with our European operations in driving some of that. And it's been real small thus far. As far as the opportunity goes, getting into the P&L but it is progressing nicely. So Justin, I don't know if you want to add anything?"", 'Justin L. Jude', ""Yes. To your point, we have started leveraging our European supply chain, bringing in some private label that we already operated on or already carried in at Bumper to Bumper in Canada. Our next phase of looking at new product lines that today, Bumper to Bumper does not carry. So it's not only cost of goods [to pay] there, but also a revenue generation and margin improvement with new brands and new product lines offering within the private label so..."", 'Dominick P. Zarcone', ""Yes. You'll recall that when we announced the transaction back in February '23, one of the opportunities we saw actually related to European makes and models because today, up in Canada, that cohort of cars represents about 10% of the car part, but Bumper to Bumper historically has distributed almost product for European mixed models. And we know somebody who knows a lot about the European marketplace, and that's where the focus will be, will be to bring in product lines to service that 10% of the market up in Canada."", 'Bret David Jordan', 'Okay. And then you talked about EV battery recycling. And I guess, what does that mean? Are you talking about extracting them or actually processing like Redwood Materials is that North America or Europe? And is that a capital investment to get into that business?', 'Dominick P. Zarcone', ""Yes. So our primary focus now, Bret, is on the remanufacturing of the batteries. Taking a battery that's not operating at normal levels, taking out the cells that are defective, putting in new cells and getting that battery back on the road, essentially extending the life of the powertrain. We have, as we noted last year, we're talking with some third parties about recycling, not where we would be operating facilities, but where we could be a partner because nobody has access to the batteries, none of the big 3 folks trying to do the recycling really have access to the supply chain. And with our salvage operations, we are the perfect entity to help partner. So we are taking a hard look at key partnerships that could help us move forward on the recycling side, but we would not be necessarily owning and operating large recycling facilities."", 'Operator', ""With that, we have no further questions on the line. So I'll hand back to Nick for any closing remarks."", 'Dominick P. Zarcone', ""Well, we certainly thank you for your time and attention this morning and for a productive call, a good set of questions. Just a couple of key dates for everyone to keep in the back of their mind. First, our first quarter call is going to be on Tuesday, Tuesday, April 23. Normally, we host our calls on Thursday, but this year, that week in April is an overlap with our Annual Leadership Conference in North America, which begins on Thursday 25th. So Q1 reporting will be on Tuesday, April 23. Second, we'd like everyone to mark their calendars for our 2024 Investor Day, and that's going to take place on September 10 and will be held at our North American headquarters down in Nashville, Tennessee. So April 23 and September 10. And with that, I'd like to thank everybody on the call for your time and attention. And as always, I extend my sincere thanks to the 49,000 strong LKQuers who make it happen every day. Take care, everyone."", 'Operator', ""Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining today's call.

Growth investors seek companies that offer strong earnings growth, while value investors seek stocks that appear to be undervalued and which they expect will return to fair value over time. Because the two styles complement each other, they can help add diversity to a portfolio when used together. When used together, some call the amalgamation ""growth at a reasonable price,"" or GARP. Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) has said the difference between value and growth investing is a false dichotomy. He wrote in Berkshire Hathaway\'s (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) 1993 annual letter:', '""Most analysts feel they must choose between two approaches customarily thought to be in opposition: \'value\' and \'growth.\' Indeed, many investment professionals see any mixing of the two terms as a form of intellectual cross-dressing. We view that as fuzzy thinking (in which, it must be confessed, I myself engaged some years ago). In our opinion, the two approaches are joined at the hip: Growth is always a component in the calculation of value, constituting a variable whose importance can range from negligible to enormous and whose impact can be negative as well as positive.', 'Buffet\'s business partner, the late Charlie Munger, further summed this up when he said,""Basically, all investment is value investment in the sense that you\'re always trying to get better prospects that you\'re paying for.""', 'Thus, a primary goal for investors is to not to overpay for stocks, whether you are going for growth or going for value (or conversely, not to sell too cheaply if you are selling). This is a particularly acute problem for growth investors as they have a tendency to overpay for growth. On the other hand, the major problem for value investors is a tendency to buy value traps, which they think are cheap, but actually expensive because they do not account for a declining business. For every security, there is a ""stupid price zone"" and a ""smart price zone"" and a range of values in between. The idea is to buy at the ""smart"" zone and sell at the ""stupid"" zone. Another trap for investors is timing, meaning either buying or selling too early or too late. This is easier said than done, of course. That is why Munger calls investing simple, but not easy.', 'Let us start this meditation on price with granddaddy of valuation techniques, the venerable price-earnings ratio.', 'The price-earnings ratio is, of course, a simplistic measure as it merely the ratio of stock price to earnings per share. It itself gives no guidance as to what is an acceptable ratio. Many investors have developed rules of thumb to judge whether a price-earnings ratio is expensive or cheap. For example, they would use a multiple of 15, which they consider the long-term price-eanings ratio of the S&P 500 as the bright line separating cheap from expensive. The lower the ratio, the cheaper the stock is. The higher the ratio, the more expensive it is.', 'The practical problem is that often the price-earnings ratio is wrong. For cyclical stocks, often the best time to buy is when the ratio is very high or is zero (because earnings have evaporated). Look at the chart of price and price-earnings ratio for Goodyear (NASDAQ:GT) (a classic cyclical stock) below.', 'GT Data by GuruFocus', 'Another big problem with the ratio is the earnings are based on GAAP earnings, which can fluctuate widely and may not reflect the true state of affairs of the earning power of the company. Take a look at Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) below. A great time to buy the stock would have been is 2019 when the price-earnings ratio was actually very high (the company had taken some non-cash write-offs at that time, which crashed the stock temporarily). Expected and unexpected events are contantly rocking the price-earnings line, making it a very unreliable measure.', 'PG Data by GuruFocus', 'Some problems can be avoided by looking at the median price-earnings ratio over a period of time (say 10 years) and then deriving a ""fair price"" from this median. This technique would have got us into P&G in 2018-19, but we would have sold too soon in 2000 as the stock rebounded above the median price line.', 'PG Data by GuruFocus', 'GuruFocus also provides the Shiller PE on its stock summary page, which is derived from the 10-year average of the inflation-adjusted earnings. Think of Shiller PE as a normalized price-earnings ratio that removes year-to-year distortions from the price-earnings line. In the chart below, the Shiller PE and price-earnings ratios are charted together with price. When the PE line is below the Shiller PE line, then chances are the stock may be undervalued (and vice versa).', 'However, this signal is not very clear in the case of Goodyear as the company is very cyclical. Both the regular and Shiller PEs fluctuate widely. We could argue that it is a good time to go long when the regular price-earnings ratio hits an extreme level or goes to zero and then sell when it comes back to normal.', 'GT Data by GuruFocus', 'For Goodyear, the median price-earnings technique does not work as the line is too fickle. Further, the median price-sales line, while better, is too slow to have much predictive value.', 'GT Data by GuruFocus', 'The main point I want to make is that while price-earnngs may be a quick and useful metric with most stocks, it has to be used carefully. Many times it is absolutely misleading. Charting the ratio with its derivatives is helpful to discern if there is a valid valuation signal. Overall, I feel the price-earnings ratio is more often misleading and do not rely on it much.', 'Then there is the PEG ratio, an old warhorse that incorporates growth. It was popularized by famous former fund manager Peter Lynch, who argued that a PEG ratio of 1 was a fair price, as he thought the earnings growth of a stock should ideally equal or exceed its price-earnings ratio.', ""The price-earnings to growth ratio, or PEG ratio, is a valuation measure that investors use to get a broad assessment of a company's performance and evaluate investment risk."", 'PEG ratio is calculated as follows: PEG = PE ratio/Earnings growth over five years.', ""In theory, a PEG ratio of 1 represents a perfect correlation between the company's market value and its projected earnings growth. PEG ratios higher than 1 are generally considered unfavorable, suggesting a stock is overvalued. Conversely, ratios lower than 1 are considered better, indicating a stock is undervalued."", 'There are two problems with the PEG ratio, however. One is price-earnings (the numerator) itself is problematic, which I have gone over already. The second problem is the denominator, or growth. Lynch used projected earnings growth, which requires judgement and is frequently wrong. Thus, the PEG is reduced to a judgement call.', 'A popular, ""more objective"" number is to use past actual Ebitda growth. The problem, of course, is that this is backward-looking and assumes the past growth trajectory will continue in the future. I still lean toward the latter as there is no getting away from it, unless you want to get into the judgement game and plug in an estimated forward growth. For cyclical stocks like Goodyear, I would prefer to substitute one-year trailing 12-month Ebitda growth for the five-year growth as used for stocks like P&G.', 'The PEG ratio is more often wrong than right. Below is an annual chart showing price and PEG. As you can see, it is pretty much useless as a predictor of value or growth. (Note: chart below is annual numbers.)', ""The GF Value chart is a proprietary measure which compares a company's current stock price to its GF Value Line. The GF Value Line is an intrinsic value estimate developed by GuruFocus that is calculated based on the following factors:"", 'Historical multiples (price-earnings ratio, price-sales ratio, price-book ratio and price-to-free cash flow) that the stock has traded at.', ""A GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth."", 'Future estimates of business performance from Morningstar analysts.', 'Exactly how the GF Value is calculated is not disclosed. While in my short experience it is a fine measure with good predictability, the lack of transparency of the calculation methodology prevents it from being used outside of GuruFocus.', 'Earning power value, or EPV, is based on the concept first popularized by Columbia University professor Bruce Greenblatt that one should value a stock based on the current operating profits of company and not on future projections, which may or may not come true. Some argue it is a better though conservative way to analyze stocks than discounted cash flow analysis, which relies on highly speculative growth assumptions projected many years into the future. The main assumption for EPV is that the current profitability is sustainable. I find this method useful for assessing value stocks with little or no growth, but for stocks which rely on growth, it is pretty much useless.', 'Applying the EPV method to Procter & Gamble and Goodyear, we find little if any predictive power for this method in valuing the two companies. This method would have prevented us from buying P&G over the last 25 years and given false results on Goodyear by indicating a buy in years when it would not have been prudent and a sell when the stock was undervalued.', 'PG Data by GuruFocus', 'Probably the most popular method of valuation used by more sophisticated investors who have graduated from using price-earnings and PEG ratios, the discounted cash flow (DCF) method is a technique used to estimate the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows. It involves discounting the projected cash flows (or earnings) back to their present value using a chosen discount rate, such as the weighted average cost of capital. The DCF method helps investors assess the potential profitability of an investment while accounting for the time value of money.', ""DCF models can become quite complex, but this does not make them better. GuruFocus, for example offers a two-stage valuation model in its DCF calculator, which can use GAAP earnings or free cash flow as a starting point . The major input in GuruFocus' calculator is the choice of starting value, growth rates and discount rates. We will notice that small changes in assumption of these variables can have a big impact on the final valuation. Thus, investors get the results they want by playing around with the variables, which limits the usefulness of this technique. Too much skepticism and conservatism will make us miss opportunity and too much optimism will cause us to make mistakes. Errors are inevitable as we are projecting decades into the future. In the end, DCF, like other valuation techniques, is a tool and the utility of a tool depends on the skill we use it with. Just because we give an amateur a power saw does not make him into a carpenter. He can easily hurt himself."", 'Below is a valuation of Procter & Gamble using the default inputs. The model says the stock is very overvalued. I can, of course, play around with the model and get whatever value I want. Frankly, this becomes an exercise in self-justification.', ""Another model which is available as part of GuruFocus' valuation panel is the projected free cash flow methodology. According to GuruFocus, since the DCF intrinsic value calculations are based on free cash flow or earnings, it cannot be applied to companies without consistent revenue and earnings. GuruFocus developed the projected FCF valuation model based on the normalized free cash flow and book value of the company. How it calculates the intrinsic value of stocks is described in detail here. Essentially, the method takes 80% of the book value and adds it to the present value of free cash flow averaged over six years. So in essence, it's another variation of the DCF model. Looking at Procter & Gamble's valuation using this method, we see it appears to undervalue the stock."", ""The same thing can be said for Goodyear's projected value."", ""I find the projected free cash flow is more useful in cases where company's business is capital intensive and cyclical and book value is a crucial component."", 'In thinking about growth and value and my aversion to over-paying, I have been pondering on how to come up with a single measure which can incorporate both. How do you balance the two attributes and reconcile with the price of the stock?', 'I devised a technique that I am sharing below. The technique involves reducing the value and growth attributes of the stock into a common scale which I call ""factors.""', 'The technique has three steps. First, calculate the value factor. Second, calculate the growth factor. Third, add the value and growth factors together. The higher the total, the better. I will break these steps down further.', 'First, derive the value factor by calculating the value of a stock with respect to a risk-free 10-year U.S. government bond. For instance:', 'Value factor = Operating profits/ (enterprise value 10-year U.S. treasury bond rate)', 'The logic of the formula is as follows:', 'Numerator: Operating profits are the pre-tax profits a company generates (for this exercise we ignore taxes).', 'Denominator: The enterprise value is the logical value an external buyer would pay for the entire company on the open market. This includes market capitalization minus debt plus cash. Multiplying enterprise value by the 10-year treasury rate gives us the risk-free return an investor would get if was to invest the entire amount in 10-year U.S. treasury bonds.', 'Basically, you want the operating profit of the company to be higher than the amount you would get if you were to invest the same amount in Treasuries, which are risk free. You obviously want to be paid more than the risk-free rate. The higher the factor, the better. Note this does not take into account growth of operating profit and enterprise value. Therefore, it is a conservative estimate. Here are some examples.', 'Looking at Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), at present you can get 13% better risk-free income from 10-year U.S. T-bills, while with Verizon (NYSE:VZ), you can get 116% more income as compared to the same bonds. This income is not the same as a dividend as a portion of this is retained earnings and also does not include taxes. Hot stock Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is, of course, growing very fast and you may well decide the low factor of safety does not matter in the long run. But you are making this decision with eyes wide open. Same with Exxon (NYSE:XOM); while the factor of value is very high at present, it may be temporary given the high price of oil and it may well evaporate in the years to come.', 'For step two, the growth factor is calculated as the five-year Ebitda growth rate per share divided by the growth divider.', 'Breaking it down further:', ""Numerator: Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, is a measure of a company's profitability and efficiency. Growing Ebitda is important for business owners and investors because it indicates an improvement in the company's performance and earnings per share. It also demonstrates the company's worth and attractiveness to potential investors. It also allows for a fair comparison of different companies with different capital structure, debt and tax profiles. Further, it separates revenue from other expenses and shows the core profitability of a business. It forms a middle ground between revenue growth and net income growth, so I find it more consistent and useful than either. The five-year period for Ebitda growth allows us sufficient time to get a consistent or secular growth number, though a shorter period might be more appropriate for cyclical businesses. For the purpose of this excercise, I will stick to five years."", 'Denominator: Here this technique gets a little judgmental and arbitrary. I had to come up with a divisor which would give me a ""weight"" for each point of Ebitda growth. By trial and error, I found that a divider of 5 gives me decent results. Therefore, in this system, each five percentage points of Ebitda growth ( i.e., one growth factor) is equivalent to one value factor. Therefore, a company with a five-year Ebitda growth profile of 10% will give us a growth factor of 2 and so on.', 'For step three, we simply add the growth and value factors together to get a single number. The higher the number, the better.', ""Let us start with the Nvidia, which is the stock du jour. The company's operating income for the trailing 12 months is $20.61 billion, while the current enterprise value is $1.34 trillion, the five-year Ebitda growth rate is 19.4%, 10-year Treasury yield is 3.94% and the growth divider is 5.

I think most experienced investors tend to use multiple techniques and then trigulate them to arrive at a value they think is fair and with which they feel comfortable. It is important to have a lattice work of mental models and be able to filter your ideas through them. Most of the ideas will be discarded and only a few remain.', ""As Munger said, What makes investment hard is that [on one hand] it's easy to see that some companies have better businesses than others, but [on the other hand] the price of the stock goes up so high that all of a sudden, the question of which stock is the best to buy gets quite difficult. We've never eliminated the difficulty of that problem."", 'Munger and Buffett addressed this problem by practicing extreme patience in waiting for the right ""fat pitch.""

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with PFE.', ""On February 22, 2024, Aflac Inc (NYSE:AFL) filed its 10-K report, revealing a company that has cemented its place as a leader in supplemental health and life insurance in the U.S. and Japan. With a history spanning over six decades, Aflac Inc has developed a comprehensive portfolio of insurance products designed to alleviate financial stress during medical events. The company's financial tables reflect a strategy focused on innovation and customer-centric product development, with a consistent and straightforward growth trajectory in its two largest markets. Aflac Inc's marketing prowess, particularly its iconic Aflac Duck, has significantly enhanced brand awareness, contributing to its strong market presence. As we delve into the SWOT analysis, we will explore how Aflac Inc's financial health and strategic initiatives position it within the competitive insurance landscape."", ""Brand Recognition and Marketing Excellence: Aflac Inc's brand strength is a formidable asset, with the Aflac Duck campaign catapulting brand awareness from a mere 10% to one of the most recognized icons in advertising. This brand power is not just superficial; it translates into customer loyalty and trust, which are critical in the insurance industry. Aflac Inc's marketing strategy has effectively communicated the value of its products, leading to a dominant position in Japan as the largest insurer by policies in force for cancer and medical insurance products. The company's ability to maintain top-of-mind awareness through innovative marketing initiatives has been a key driver of its sustained market share."", ""Market Leadership in Japan: Aflac Japan's contribution to the parent company's consolidated earnings is a testament to its strength in the Japanese insurance market. As the principal contributor, Aflac Japan's operating results reflect a deep understanding of customer needs and a product suite tailored to the Japanese market. This segment's performance is indicative of Aflac Inc's ability to leverage its strengths in a competitive international market, ensuring a diversified revenue stream and reducing reliance on any single market."", ""Regulatory and Compliance Risks: Aflac Inc operates in a highly regulated environment, with stringent oversight from various governmental authorities. The complexity and ever-changing nature of these regulations pose a significant challenge, as compliance requires substantial resources and continuous vigilance. Any failure to adhere to these regulations could result in costly penalties, legal battles, and damage to the company's reputation. The proposed regulations in July 2023, if enacted, could materially affect Aflac U.S.'s sales, highlighting the vulnerability of the company's operations to regulatory changes."", ""Reliance on Independent Distribution Channels: Aflac Inc's distribution model is heavily reliant on independent sales associates, brokers, and other partners. While this allows for a broad reach and flexibility, it also introduces risks associated with maintaining a motivated and effective sales force. The competitive landscape for attracting and retaining top sales talent is fierce, and any shift in focus by these independent contractors to competitors' products could adversely affect Aflac Inc's sales and market position. Additionally, the company's expansion into digital sales methods, while promising, requires careful execution to avoid cannibalizing its existing sales channels."", ""Digital Transformation and Innovation: Aflac Inc's strategic investments in digital enhancements and innovation present significant opportunities for growth. The shift towards digital sales methods aligns with changing consumer behaviors, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. By capitalizing on digital lead generation and online sales platforms, Aflac Inc can reach a wider audience, improve customer engagement, and streamline operations. The company's focus on cultivating an innovation-driven culture, particularly in Japan, positions it to rapidly adapt to societal shifts and emerging market demands."", ""Strategic Partnerships and Acquisitions: Aflac Inc's approach to growth through strategic partnerships and acquisitions offers pathways to expand its product distribution and enter new markets. The company's agreements with 360 banks in Japan to market its products and its investments in distribution opportunities in the U.S. demonstrate a proactive stance in leveraging external relationships to drive sales. These collaborations can also provide Aflac Inc with valuable insights into customer preferences and competitive strategies, informing future product development and marketing campaigns."", ""Catastrophic Events and Climate Change: Aflac Inc's exposure to catastrophic events, including those resulting from climate change, poses a significant threat to its financial stability. The potential for increased frequency and severity of natural disasters could lead to higher claims and volatility in financial results. Additionally, such events can disrupt the company's operations and infrastructure, necessitating robust crisis management and contingency planning to mitigate these risks. The company's proactive approach to integrating climate change-related risks into its credit review process is a step in the right direction, but the unpredictable nature of these events remains a looming threat."", ""Intensifying Competition: The insurance industry is characterized by intense competition, with companies vying for market share through product innovation, pricing strategies, and customer service. Aflac Inc's competitors, including major medical carriers expanding into supplemental products, pose a threat to the company's profitability and market position. The bundling and discounting of products by these carriers to gain market share could pressure Aflac Inc to adjust its own pricing and product offerings, potentially impacting its margins and growth prospects."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Additional features include a custom colorway, which leverages Pepsi’s color palette, electric blue laces and the use of the Pepsi Globe to replace Reebok’s “pump,” per release details. The design elements of the shoe embody Pepsi’s visual overhaul\xa0last year — its first in 14 years — that notably saw it swap its muted blue color scheme for a bolder, more vibrant appearance.', 'The commemorative sneakers also feature nostalgic callbacks, with the design nodding to O’Neal’s first NBA team, Orlando Magic, which retired the icon’s No. 32 jersey on Feb. 13. The jersey represents the first to be retired by the team. Additionally, the marketing play reunites Pepsi, Reebok and O’Neal, a trio that first came together in the early ‘90s.', 'In a further nod to O’Neal’s shoe size, an additional 22 shoes will be up for grabs to 22 consumers who share their love for Pepsi Mini Cans on social media and use the hashtags #PepsiMinis #Sweepstakes now through Feb. 25.', 'Nostalgia has been a major theme for Pepsi following the kick-off of a marketing blitz last fall to commemorate the brand’s 125th anniversary, a milestone celebration that has included a slew of callbacks to memorable moments of its past, including the Pepsi Challenge and “Pepsi Girl” from the ’90s and the resurrection of past commercials from stars like Madonna. The media blitz also served as the official introduction of the brand’s visual overhaul, which also includes a new logo and “pulse” motif.', 'PepsiCo saw organic revenue increase 4.5% in Q4, a decline from the 14.6% organic revenue growth reported during the same period the year prior, according to an earnings statement. The marketer also reported a decline in organic volume, a shift that it attributed to consumers’ growing preference for smaller pack sizes, which could explain the recent emphasis on Pepsi’s 7.5-ounce mini cans.', 'For the full year, PepsiCo’s North America Beverages division in 2023 saw organic revenue increase 7%. The company in its earnings statement attributed investments in “advertising, digitalization, and go-to-market execution” for its success along with high-single-digit growth from brands Pepsi and Gatorade.', 'This story was originally published on Marketing Dive.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent® (dupilumab) in a sixth potential indication as an add-on maintenance treatment in certain adult patients with uncontrolled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The target action date for the FDA decision is June 27, 2024. Regulatory submissions are under review in China and Europe.', 'The sBLA, as well as other submissions around the world, is supported by data from the Phase 3 COPD clinical research program evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults who were current or former smokers with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation (i.e., blood eosinophils ≥300 cells per μL). All patients were on background maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (nearly all on triple therapy). The primary endpoint was met in both trials (BOREAS, NOTUS), showing Dupixent significantly reduced annualized moderate or severe acute COPD exacerbations by 30% and 34%, respectively, compared to placebo. In both trials, Dupixent rapidly and significantly improved lung function compared to placebo, with improvements sustained at 52 weeks.', 'Safety results in both trials were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) compared to placebo in either trial were\xa0back pain, COVID-19, diarrhea, headache and nasopharyngitis.', 'Priority Review is granted to regulatory applications seeking approval for therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions. The potential use of Dupixent in COPD is currently under clinical development, and its safety and efficacy for this indication have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.', 'About COPDCOPD is a respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline. Symptoms include persistent cough, breathlessness and excessive mucus production that may not only impair the ability to perform routine daily activities, but can also lead to anxiety, depression and sleep disturbances. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD, but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop or continue having the disease. There have been no new treatment approaches approved for more than a decade. In\xa0the U.S., approximately 300,000 people live with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation.About Regeneron and Sanofi’s COPD Clinical Research ProgramRegeneron and\xa0Sanofi\xa0are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics, Dupixent and itepekimab.', 'Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33), an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD.', 'Itepekimab is currently under clinical investigation, with two Phase 3 trials currently enrolling, and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.', 'About DupixentDupixent, which was invented using Regeneron’s proprietary\xa0VelocImmune®\xa0technology, is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials, establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent, such as atopic dermatitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), prurigo nodularis and chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU).', 'Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis, asthma, CRSwNP, EoE, prurigo nodularis or CSU in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries, including in\xa0Europe, the\xa0U.S.\xa0and\xa0Japan. Approximately 800,000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.', ""About Regeneron's\xa0VelocImmune®\xa0TechnologyRegeneron's\xa0VelocImmune\xa0technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies.
