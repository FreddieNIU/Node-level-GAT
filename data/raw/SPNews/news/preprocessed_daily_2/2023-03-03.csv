(NASDAQ:VRSK) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript March 1, 2023Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Fourth Quarter 2022 Earning Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would now turn -- like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, you may go ahead.Stacey Brodbar: Thank you, Devin, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our fourth quarter 2022 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-K can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including those related to our financial guidance.Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that the financial results for recent dispositions are included in our consolidated and GAAP results are excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures. A reconciliation of reported and historic non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call is provided in our 8-K and today's earnings presentation posted on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. However, we are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable expected GAAP results because of the unreasonable effort and high unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from projected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gain or loss from dispositions and other nonrecurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant.Story continuesAnd now I would like to turn the call over to Lee Shavel.Lee Shavel: Good morning, everyone, and thank you, Stacey, and thanks to you all for participating today. We've really been looking forward to this call because it's our first opportunity to reintroduce Verisk in our new insurance-focused configuration, to discuss the momentum in the fourth quarter and given all the structural changes, give you a forward view of our expected performance in 2023. We accomplished an extraordinary amount in 2022, so let me provide a brief summary. First, there's been a lot of structural change. In March, we sold 3E, our environmental health and safety business, for net cash proceeds of $575 million. In April, we sold Verisk Financial Services for net cash proceeds of approximately $500 million.And most recently in February, we sold Wood Mackenzie for approximately $3.1 billion. We've begun the process of returning a substantial majority of the after-tax proceeds of those transactions to shareholders through share repurchases as promised. Despite a challenging economic, geopolitical and financing environment, we were able to complete these transactions at attractive valuations through the strong underlying businesses, capable management teams and a well-organized sale process. Let's turn to governance change. Structural change wasn't the only transition at Verisk. We also made a number of governance changes that shareholders suggested. We are transitioning to a declassified Board with annual elections. We added four new directors with fresh perspectives and experiences: Jeff Dailey, Wendy Lane, Olumide Soroye and Kim Stevenson.We separated the Chairman and CEO role with the election of Bruce Hansen as our new Chair. I have to personally thank Bruce for his advice and leadership through my transition. As a former CEO, he's been a great coach to me as have been all of our directors. Let's turn to organizational change. Finally, organizationally, we've had substantial change. In addition to Scott Stephenson's retirement last year, Mark Anquillare stepping down in January and the addition of Elizabeth Mann as our CFO, we have made over a dozen changes in senior management. These have enabled the next generation of management to rise, bringing new energy and fresh perspectives how we can make Verisk better. At the highest level, I have reconstituted our Senior Operating Committee with 10 colleagues, six of whom are new to the committee, who represent a better balance of business unit leaders and corporate leaders for improved integration and coordination.I'm also proud that the committee represents 50% gender diversity and 40% ethnic diversity, a strong signal for our entire organization. We all share the common mission of creating value for our clients, employees and shareholders. With all this change, we were, of course, carefully watching for disruption with our employees and clients. While there is some understandable anxiety with any organizational change, the feedback from employees at three town halls, anonymous surveys and informal feedback has been very positive with enthusiasm for our refocused strategy in insurance and new leadership. In particular, our purpose of working together to build global resilience for individuals, communities and businesses has resonated strongly with our employees as has our new cultural values of learning, caring and results.As I believe all of you can appreciate, what we accomplished in terms of structure and organizational change in 2022 was no foregone conclusion, and the delivery of a clear view of our insurance-only operations in our 10-K was a massively complex exercise. It required the effort, expertise and commitment of hundreds of our employees to accomplish. So I'd like to take this opportunity to personally thank all of our nearly 7,000 employees for their professionalism, commitment and understanding as we have undergone so much change in 2022. They are absolutely talented and critical to our future success. What we accomplished this year demonstrates what we're capable of ahead. On the client front, we have also received a positive response from many clients who appreciate our renewed insurance focus and desire to improve our relationships across their organizations.I experienced this first-hand at our Elevate Conference in Salt Lake City and dozens of client meetings and calls. Their feedback reinforces that while we have been a great product organization, we can be a much better client organization. And that's an area where I'm dedicating substantial time and leading from the front. I spent most of my career as a client professional, and I'm excited to be returning to this particular role. Let's move to financial change. I won't steal Elizabeth's thunder on the financials. However, there are two elements that matter most to me in our 2022 performance and what we intend to achieve in 2023. First is our ability to continue to deliver strong revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth despite the changes and challenging environment in 2022 and the clear momentum in the fourth quarter results.We have clearly demonstrated what Verisk is capable of in the fourth quarter by delivering organic constant currency revenue growth of over 7% in the insurance-only business even after eliminating the impact of storms. I'd also note that fiscal year 2022, the insurance OCC revenue growth of 6.5% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 8% is a solid result for a year of substantial change and macroeconomic challenges and is a strong reflection of the stability of our business and a good foundation to build on to in 2023 and beyond. Second is our delivery of clear margin improvement consistent with the clear goals we set for the insurance-focused business of 300 basis points to 500 basis points improvement from a normalized base of 50% to 51% in 2021. At 52.7% for the fourth quarter, we are on the cusp of delivering at the low end of our targeted range of 53% to 56% for 2024.And our guidance for 2023 is for adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 53% and 54%. Finally, we are providing expanded financial guidance for 2023 as a reflection of the complex structural changes in 2022 as well as an expectation of more predictable growth with our refocused business. This decision also reflects the input from many of our shareholders who ask for improved financial guidance. Naturally, it will come with the necessary caveats that we can't predict all contingencies but represents our best assessment of 2023 financial performance. So where does that leave us after all of these changes? We are, as of this moment, a new Verisk, new structurally, organizationally and with a reenergized and refocused purpose values. There's a lot that you'll be familiar with, including our insurance focus, industry centrality, strong market position, stable growth and strong margins and some new elements that are expanding our growth opportunities in areas such as life assurance, marketing solutions and in our European businesses, including specialty business solutions, where we are improving workflows and efficiency in the Lloyd's nonstandard market.You will also see changes in our expense discipline to drive margin expansion and a new approach to providing financial guidance for the year ahead. Let's step back and take a moment to reframe our opportunity. The insurance industry is massive, complex and growing globally. Our clients face substantial technology, regulatory and macroeconomic challenges in a rapidly evolving environment. This is less an assertion than an often repeated sentiment that I hear from the leaders of our clients. One of my favorite client quotes was, ""Lee, we need Verisk's help to address this, but more importantly, the industry needs Verisk's help."" That crystallizes our opportunity and position. You'll hear at Investor Day from several clients that Verisk is considered a true business partner rather than a vendor and that we work together to collectively solve problems for the insurance industry.We create value for our clients through a simple economic mechanism. We invest in data, analytics and software at scale to address industry needs much more efficiently than individual companies can. We are addressing hundreds of billions of dollars of premiums and expense across the industry to improve revenue growth, risk outcomes, fund experience, productivity and margins. These investments deliver real value to the industry and in turn, drive our growth, operating leverage and high incremental returns on capital. Much of this opportunity is realized by facilitating connectivity across the insurance ecosystem. Hence, the theme of our annual report for 2022: Connecting What Matters. To connect, you must be central. You must be trusted, and you must understand the needs of the ecosystem.No company is better positioned than Verisk with our scale, relationships and expertise to create this value for the insurance industry. We're very proud of what we accomplished in 2022, but it was all to put us in this position where we can demonstrate our full potential, focused on serving the substantial and expanding needs of the insurance industry. With a reconfigured and energized organization bound together by a common purpose and values, we are very excited about the path ahead and can already feel the benefits of this better integrated and focused approach. This is the way. As our 2023 financial guidance implies and as you'll hear at our upcoming Investor Day, we believe this path will see continued growth, improving margins and strong returns on capital.Analysis, finances, workPhoto by Carlos Muza on UnsplashI'll end with thanks to our shareholders who encouraged us to consider new approaches and offered their perspectives directly or indirectly through surveys and our analyst community. We and our Board have listened carefully. And our actions and path ahead clearly reflect your input. We are here to expand the opportunity, execute on the plan and deliver value on your behalf. I can't imagine us being in a better position to do so, and we're off to a solid start. With that, I'll hand it over to Elizabeth to review our financial results for the quarter, the year and our financial guidance for 2023.Elizabeth Mann: Thanks, Lee, and good day to everyone on the call. Before I start with the fourth quarter results, I have a few reminders for everyone. First, all consolidated and GAAP numbers are negatively impacted by the dispositions of 3E and Verisk Financial Services. This effect will continue through the first quarter of 2023 when we will anniversary those transactions. Second, as we described previously, due to its materiality, Wood Mackenzie is accounted for as discontinued operations beginning this quarter. And its results are not included in our revenue or adjusted EBITDA results in either the current period or the prior period. Third, in the earnings presentation now posted on the Investors section of our website, we have included certain pro forma quarterly financial metrics, removing the operational results of all our divestitures as well as a reconciliation to our historical reported results, which we hope you will find helpful.Turning now to the financial results. I'm pleased to share that we had a strong finish to 2022. For the fourth quarter, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue was $630 million, up slightly versus the prior year, reflecting growth in insurance, offset by the impact of the VFS and 3E dispositions. Income from continuing operations was $216 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk was $1.37. Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we are very pleased with our operating results, which demonstrated strong sequential improvement relative to the third quarter as a broad-based recovery across our business contributed to the strongest quarter of the year.In the fourth quarter, OCC revenues grew 8.1% with growth of 6.5% in underwriting and rating and 11.9% in claims. This quarter's results included $5.6 million in storm-related revenue associated with Hurricane Ian. Excluding the storm-related revenues, OCC revenue would have grown 7.1%. Our subscription revenues, which comprise 80% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 7.2% on an OCC basis. We saw broad-based growth across most of our businesses with strength in core underwriting, property estimating solutions, extreme events, antifraud and life insurance solutions. We did experience a modest negative impact from the liquidations in Florida. As we noted in previous calls, Florida has been a trouble spot for the insurance industry, and the losses from Hurricane Ian add complication.In 2022, the market saw six liquidations. And so far in '23, we have seen one company placed into receivership after higher-than-expected losses from Hurricane Ian, which is the carrier into insolvency. We continue to work to offset this headwind through engagement with our customers by helping them adapt to Florida's new roof coverage rules and by better segmenting risk using both new and existing sources such as our roof age data and aerial imagery. Our analytics have been integrated into our LightSpeed platform and can help customers leverage data earlier in their quoting process, ensuring they underwrite risk appropriately as well as help drive non-rate action for in-force policies. Transactional OCC revenue growth of 12.1%, representing 20% of total revenue in the fourth quarter, also improved from the third quarter, reflecting the revenues associated with Hurricane Ian.Adjusting for the storm impact, transactional growth was a healthy 8.2% comprised of continued strong recovery in international travel, strong sales of life insurance solutions and a modest contribution from our workers' compensation business, which is improving though, continues to be below pre-pandemic levels. This was offset in part by continued weakness across auto underwriting and marketing solutions. On the auto underwriting side, we continue to see cyclical softness across our auto underwriting and marketing solutions as carriers are dealing with the impact of rising inflation and increasing loss ratios. To that end, carriers have pulled back on underwriting new auto policies as well as on marketing spending to drive new policy volume and customer acquisition.Carriers are working to reset pricing, which we think could take another six to 12 months to truly take effect. To help our customers bridge this uncertain time and drive growth for Verisk, we are working with them to help identify ways to improve profitability with targeted non-rate actions that minimize premium leakage. We are actively engaging with customers about our risk check renewal product, which allows insurance -- which allows insurers to analyze an entire book of business with minimal IT resources and pinpoint policies that require attention. Moving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 12.9% in the fourth quarter, reflecting core operating leverage and the impact of certain cost reduction actions we have taken in connection with our margin expansion objectives.Total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 52.7%, up 210 basis points from the reported results in the prior year, reflecting the benefit from recent dispositions, strong cost and operational discipline, the impact of certain cost reduction actions and the high incremental margins associated with storm-related revenue. This level of margin also includes a number of margin headwinds, including approximately 110 basis points from recent acquisitions as well as 80 basis points from the headwinds from our ongoing technological transformation and higher T&amp;E expenses. In addition, this quarter included certain onetime or non-operating expenses including severance, FX impact and a decrease in our pension credit, which collectively negatively impacted margins by 190 basis points.Finally, if you compare the fourth quarter margins on a pro forma basis for all divestitures, the 4Q 2022 margins of 52.7% represent an 80 basis point margin expansion from 51.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021 pro forma. Reflecting on our objective to deliver 300 basis points to 500 basis points of margin improvement in 2024 from a normalized base of 50% to 51% in 2021, we took great strides in 2022 with full year adjusted EBITDA margin of 52% on a pro forma basis, reflecting approximately 140 basis points of margin expansion associated with our operational excellence focus. To date, we have made decisions and taken actions to address more than 60% of the run rate cost savings we are targeting. The impact of those actions will be realized through 2024 with about 30% of the cumulated expected cost savings already achieved in the reported results in 2022.Our business continues to demonstrate the operating leverage embedded in our data analytics business model. And we have confidence in our ability to deliver on the objective in 2024. Interest expense. Interest expense totaled $41 million for the fourth quarter compared to $30.2 million in the prior year. For the full year, interest expense totaled $139 million versus $127 million in 2021. This increase in interest expense is related to higher balances on our revolving credit facility as well as higher interest rates. We have paid off all borrowings under our credit facility as of February 2023. And in the near term, we'll look to establish a go-forward balance sheet for the business, staying within our targeted leverage range of 2x to 3x adjusted EBITDA.Taxes. Our reported effective tax rate was 9.9% compared to 16.8% in the prior year quarter. This lower tax rate included a onetime benefit of approximately $30 million, which was primarily the result of transaction benefits related to our Wood Mackenzie divestiture, offset in part by lower stock compensation benefits versus the prior year period. For the full year '22, our effective tax rate was 17.5% as compared to 22.8% in the prior year, including approximately $67.7 million in benefits related to all our dispositions throughout the year. The net effect of these transaction-related tax benefits was a reduction in our full year effective tax rate of 5.4%. Adjusted net income and diluted adjusted EPS. Adjusted net income increased 14% to $225 million, and diluted adjusted EPS increased 18% to $1.43 for the fourth quarter '22.These changes reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count. Capital returns. During the fourth quarter, we returned $514 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends as our strong cash flow allows us to consistently return capital to shareholders while also investing in our business. In particular, included in that amount is $366 million of share repurchases we have completed since the announcement of the Wood Mackenzie transaction back in November. In the coming days, we intend to enter into an additional $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement for a total capital return of $2.87 billion associated with the transaction proceeds.This is consistent with our plan to return the majority of the proceeds from the Wood Mackenzie divestiture to shareholders via share repurchases. We continue to expect the dilution from the transaction to be within the 4% to 6% range. Looking ahead to 2023, as Lee mentioned, we have listened to shareholder feedback, and we'll now be providing annual financial guidance. We have posted a summary of all guidance measures in the earnings deck on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. Specifically, for 2023, we expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $2.59 billion to $2.63 billion versus $2.437 billion in 2022 pro forma. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.37 billion to $1.42 billion versus $1.266 billion in 2022 pro forma and adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 53% to 54%.Working further down the P&amp;L, we expect fixed asset D&amp;A to be between $175 million and $195 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $70 million. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases, the completion of projects and future M&amp;A activity. We also expect capital expenditures to be between $200 million and $230 million as we continue to invest organically behind our highest return on investment opportunities. These include a modernization of our core line services to digitize our industry standard offering and enable expansion into new workflows that improve productivity for the industry. We are also investing in an upgrade of our financial and human capital systems that will enable future efficiencies once implemented.As previously communicated, we expect the tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%, bringing adjusted earnings per share to a range of $5.20 to $5.50. This range represents strong double-digit growth rates on EPS after normalizing for the impact of transaction tax benefits in 2022. Before I turn the call over to Lee, I just want to remind everyone that we're hosting an Investor Day on March 14 here in Jersey City, where we will provide more transparency and clarity on our strategic profile, growth drivers and long-term financial targets. And now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.Lee Shavel: Thanks, Elizabeth. In summary, we are excited to focus all our attention, talent and resources on the global insurance industry where we can deliver substantial value to our clients through improved decision-making and operational efficiency. We will be engaged more intensively as a strategic technology partner to our clients and the broader insurance industry to identify and develop ways for Verisk to support their objectives. With our scale, relationships and expertise, we are well positioned to help make those connections in this period of accelerated change for the industry and by extension, to the people and communities they serve. Our motivating purpose is to work together with our clients in building resilience for individuals, communities and businesses globally.Combined with our focused business model and unique market position, this is a formula that will deliver value to our shareholders through growth and returns. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.See also 12 High Growth SaaS Stocks that are Profitable and 15 Best Short-Term Stocks to Buy.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

Some are shifts based on inflation, such as a higher minimum tax exemption and slightly different tax brackets.See: 7 Things You Won’t Pay Taxes on in 2023Find: 3 Signs You’re Serious About Raising Your Credit ScoreCharles Schwab recently outlined several changes to tax laws for the 2023 tax season. You’ll want to keep these numbers in mind before you file your federal income taxes for 2022.$12,950: The New Standard DeductionIndividual taxpayers (including married individuals filing separately) who choose not to itemize deductions can take a standard deduction of $12,950. This is an increase of $400 from $12,550 in 2021. Married couples filing jointly can now take a standard deduction of $29,500. Heads of household can take a deduction of $19,400.$2,000: The Child Tax Credit for 2022Parents and caretakers enjoyed a bump in their child tax credit (CTC), with half of the amount paid upfront, in 2021. For 2022 tax returns, the CTC returns to $2,000 per child aged 16 or younger. Parents can no longer claim the CTC for a child aged 17 and cannot claim a higher credit for children under 6. “The credit is also subject to a phase-out starting at $400,000 for joint filers and $200,000 for single filers. For other qualified dependents, you can claim a $500 credit,” per Charles Schwab.$75,900: The AMT Exemption for 2022The alternative minimum tax (AMT) was “designed to keep wealthy taxpayers from using loopholes to avoid paying taxes,” per Intuit TurboTax. The AMT exemption is the amount a taxpayer can deduct from their alternative minimum taxable income (AMTI), so that lower and middle-income taxpayers are not subject to AMT. The exception for the 2022 tax year is $75,900 for single filers or those filing head of household, $118,100 for married filing jointly or a surviving spouse, and $59,050 for taxpayers who are married, filing separately.Story continuesThe AMT phases out at $1,079,800 for those who are married, filing jointly, and $539,900 for all other filers.$12.06 million: Estate and Gift Tax ExemptionThe estate and gift tax exemption is indexed for inflation. In 2022, it rose to $12.06 million. This is the amount of inheritance — in money, property or other assets — that can be distributed tax-free to your heirs. Estate taxes are paid upon your death for assets exceeding $12.06 million before your estate is distributed to heirs.$16,000: Gift Tax ExclusionThe IRS allows people to gift friends and family with no tax liability on either side, exclusive of any estate taxes. In 2022, the annual gift exclusion rose to $16,000 per recipient, an increase of $1,000 from 2021, Charles Schwab reported.Take Our Poll: Do You Think Bankruptcy Is an Acceptable Way To Escape Student Loan Debt?More: 9 Things Tax Filers Over 65 Need To Know in 2023Tax Refunds Smaller This YearTax experts told NPR that refunds are likely to be smaller this year, especially with the elimination of the enhanced CTC and a few other tax breaks.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 73% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Charles Schwab. Check out our latest analysis for Charles Schwab ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Charles Schwab?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Charles Schwab. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Charles Schwab's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Charles Schwab. Our data shows that The Toronto-Dominion Bank is the largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. With 6.7% and 5.7% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 17 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Charles SchwabThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.We can see that insiders own shares in The Charles Schwab Corporation. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$2.7b.

General Public OwnershipWith a 12% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Charles Schwab.

This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

6,975b251b-7c49-3f44-b9b7-7de4e2040705,WDC,2023-03-03,Why Is Western Digital (WDC) Down 12% Since Last Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-western-digital-wdc-down-163004424.html,1677774604,STORY,['WDC'],"[A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Western Digital (WDC). Shares have lost about 12% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Western Digital due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Western Digital Reports Loss in Q2, Revenues BeatWestern Digital reported second-quarter fiscal 2023 non-GAAP loss of 42 cents per share, compared unfavorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for loss of 8 cents per share. The company had reported earnings of $2.30 per share in the prior-year quarter.The performance was affected by challenging flash pricing environment and higher-than-expected ACD underutilization charges which pressured margins, noted Western Digital.However, revenues of $3.107 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.1%.The top line decreased 36% year over year. The decline was owing to weak performance across all segments. On a sequential basis, revenues decreased 17%.Quarter in DetailBeginning with first-quarter fiscal 2022, Western Digital started reporting revenues under three refined end markets — Cloud (includes products for public or private cloud), Client (includes products sold directly to OEMs or through distribution) and Consumer (includes retail and other end-user products).Revenues from the Cloud end market (39% of total revenues) fell 36% year over year to $1.224 billion owing to inventory digestion in hard drives. On a sequential basis, cloud revenues were down 33%.Revenues from the Client end market (35% of total revenues) were down 41% year over year and declined 11% sequentially to $1.089 billion. The downtick was caused by lower flash pricing on a year-over-year basis and reduced client SSD shipments for PC applications.Story continuesRevenues from the Consumer end market (26% of total revenues) were down 25% year over year but up 17% sequentially to $794 million. Sequential performance was driven by seasonal increase in demand for both retail hard drives and flash.Considering revenues by product group, HDD revenues (47% of total revenues) decreased 34% year over year to $1.45 billion. The downtick was mainly caused by cloud inventory digestion which offset improvement in demand for retail and client HDD solutions. Revenues declined 28% quarter over quarter.Flash revenues (53% of total revenues) declined 37% from the year-ago quarter’s figure to $1.657 billion. Sequentially, flash revenues fell 4%Key MetricsThe company shipped 12.9 million HDDs at an average selling price (ASP) of $99. The reported shipments declined 40.3% from the year-ago quarter’s levels.On a quarter-over-quarter basis, HDD Exabytes sales were down 35%. Flash exabytes sales were up 20%. Total exabytes sales (excluding non-memory products) were down 28% sequentially.ASP/Gigabytes (excluding licensing, royalties, and non-memory products) were down 20% sequentially.MarginsNon-GAAP gross margin was 17.4% compared with 33.6% reported in the year-ago quarter.HDD gross margin contracted 990 bps year over year to 20.7%. Flash gross margin was 15%, down from 36% reported in the year-ago quarter.Non-GAAP operating expenses moved down 11.1% from the year-ago quarter’s level to $659 million.Non-GAAP operating loss came in at $119 million, compared with non-GAAP operating income of $882 million in the year ago quarterBalance Sheet &amp; Cash FlowAs of Dec 30, 2022, cash and cash equivalents were $1.871 billion compared with $2.049 billion reported as of Sep 30, 2022.The long-term debt (including the current portion) was $7.071 billion as of Dec 30, 2022.Western Digital generated $35 million in cash from operations compared with $666 million reported in the previous-year quarter.Free cash outflow came in at $240 million compared with free cash flow $407 million reported in the prior-year quarter.During the quarter, the company did not pay out any dividends. On Apr 30, 2020, Western Digital suspended its dividend policy to strengthen reinvestment in innovation and growth as well as facilitate ongoing deleveraging efforts.Q3 GuidanceFor third-quarter fiscal 2023, the company expects non-GAAP revenues in the range of $2.6-$2.8 billion.Management projects non-GAAP loss per share to be between $1.40 and $1.70.WDC expects the non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 9-11%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be between $600 million and $620 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted -195.14% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Western Digital has a subpar Growth Score of D, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Western Digital has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

7,a04b648a-e05c-3926-bd6b-b635ed8e8468,RRC,2023-03-03,Range Resources Corporation (NYSE:RRC) Analysts Just Cut Their EPS Forecasts Substantially,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/range-resources-corporation-nyse-rrc-102232801.html,1677838952,STORY,['RRC'],"[The latest analyst coverage could presage a bad day for Range Resources Corporation (NYSE:RRC), with the analysts making across-the-board cuts to their statutory estimates that might leave shareholders a little shell-shocked. Both revenue and earnings per share (EPS) estimates were cut sharply as the analysts factored in the latest outlook for the business, concluding that they were too optimistic previously.Following the latest downgrade, the 15 analysts covering Range Resources provided consensus estimates of US$2.8b revenue in 2023, which would reflect a sizeable 47% decline on its sales over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are anticipated to crater 42% to US$2.80 in the same period. Prior to this update, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$3.3b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$3.63 in 2023. Indeed, we can see that the analysts are a lot more bearish about Range Resources' prospects, administering a substantial drop in revenue estimates and slashing their EPS estimates to boot. Check out our latest analysis for Range Resources earnings-and-revenue-growthDespite the cuts to forecast earnings, there was no real change to the US$31.70 price target, showing that the analysts don't think the changes have a meaningful impact on its intrinsic value. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. The most optimistic Range Resources analyst has a price target of US$48.00 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$20.00. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that the analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business.Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. These estimates imply that sales are expected to slow, with a forecast annualised revenue decline of 47% by the end of 2023. This indicates a significant reduction from annual growth of 8.8% over the last five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the industry are forecast to see their revenue decline 6.3% annually for the foreseeable future. So it's pretty clear that Range Resources' revenues are expected to shrink faster than the wider industry.Story continuesThe Bottom LineThe biggest issue in the new estimates is that analysts have reduced their earnings per share estimates, suggesting business headwinds lay ahead for Range Resources. Unfortunately they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and our aggregation of analyst estimates suggests that Range Resources revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider market. The lack of change in the price target is puzzling in light of the downgrade but, with a serious decline expected this year, we wouldn't be surprised if investors were a bit wary of Range Resources.As you can see, the analysts clearly aren't bullish, and there might be good reason for that. We've identified some potential issues with Range Resources' financials, such as a weak balance sheet.

It will be located in Decatur, AL, near Nucor’s Steel Decatur sheet mill. This project is expected to result in 200 full-time jobs.Nucor is one of the most diverse steel product manufacturers in the United States and has a long-standing presence in Alabama. This will enable the company to efficiently supply the facility, ensuring the nation’s critical energy and digital infrastructure is built with the cleanest and most sustainable steel in the world.The company’s new production plant will enhance its capabilities to provide engineered solutions for utility and construction projects. The plant will be highly automated, utilizing efficient straight-line production and incorporating advanced hot-dip galvanizing operations. After the acquisition of Summit Utility Structures LLC, a producer of metal poles and other steel structures for utility infrastructure last year, Nucor formed its Towers &amp; Structures business. This business plans to establish a country-wide footprint by building two new production towers with an investment of $270 million.The need for these production plants comes from strong demand for utility infrastructures resulting from increasing demand for grid hardening, renewable energy projects, building a nationwide network of EV chargers, natural disasters and replacements, and population growth. The company expects the federal government’s support for electric infrastructures and clean energy projects in the recent Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and Inflation Reduction Act will boost demand for these transmission plants as the acts provide half a trillion dollars in incentives for a clean energy future.Nucor’s shares have gained 24.1% over the past year compared with a 4.2% rise recorded by its industry.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNucor expects operating income for its business segment to rise sequentially in the first quarter of 2023. It also expects earnings for its steel mill segment to increase sequentially, factoring in higher margins and volumes, with the biggest rise in profitability expected at its sheet mills. Nucor also expects a sequential rise in profitability for its steel products segment. Earnings for the raw material segment are likely to rise in the first quarter, backed by increased volumes at DRI facilities and scrap recycling and brokerage operations.However, due to intercompany eliminations in the quarter and the absence of state tax benefits that it registered in fourth-quarter 2022, it expects its consolidated net earnings to decline sequentially in the first quarter. Nucor Corporation Price and ConsensusNucor Corporation Price and ConsensusNucor Corporation price-consensus-chart | Nucor Corporation QuoteZacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksNucor currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks to consider in the basic materials space are Olympic Steel, Inc.  ZEUS, ATI Inc.

After declining 12.5% over the past four weeks, the stock looks well positioned for a trend reversal as it is now in oversold territory and there is strong agreement among Wall Street analysts that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier.Guide to Identifying Oversold StocksWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Here's Why ARE Could Experience a TurnaroundThe RSI reading of 25.65 for ARE is an indication that the heavy selling could be in the process of exhausting itself, so the stock could bounce back in a quest for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.This technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering ARE in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 0.2% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, ARE currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

""I think there's a safe and familiar feeling in seeing someone that looks like them, and that's why they approached me.""That safe and familiar feeling is one reason U.S. Bank has a focus on increasing Black representation in mortgage loan officers as part of its Access Home initiative, which is designed to increase Black homeownership through key pillars that also include partnering with nonprofit organizations and providing financial education and community outreach programs.Egerson is one of 12 employees across the country who are part of the bank's first-ever training and development program designed to deliver on Access Home's commitment to creating future mortgage leaders who represent all the communities the bank serves, starting with Black consumers. Mortgage experience wasn't required to participate.""It's a yearlong program for the cohort,"" said Egerson, who joined U.S. Bank in September to take part in the program. ""I have a mentor who I shadow and we're doing a lot of intensive training. We're on month five now and it's going well.""The program's concentration on increasing homeownership among people of color was a big draw for Egerson, who has been in banking since 1990.""I think there's a safe and familiar feeling in seeing someone that looks like them.""- Tracy Egerson ""There's definitely a big gap in the percentage of Black versus white homeownership rates and I wanted to be part of fixing that gap,"" she said.Story continuesOne of the keys in addressing the issue, Egerson said, is giving people access to the information and resources they need when navigating the homebuying process.""A lot of people think it's more difficult to purchase a home than it really is,"" Egerson said. ""So many people believe you have to have 20 percent down to buy a home, and that's not the case. Folks also feel that if they have the slightest blemish on their credit score, they won't qualify for a loan, or they won't qualify if they've ever filed bankruptcy, and those aren't true, either.""As part of the training program, Egerson and others are working with community organizations to help address those misconceptions and let potential homebuyers know about tools and programs that can help them become homeowners.""We are learning how to guide folks on how to be prepared for a mortgage and show them that we are valued partners they can count on to dispel the myths around credit score and down payment assistance,"" she said.Egerson said it's very meaningful to her and her peers in the mortgage loan officer development program that they can help create sustainable homeownership, which can be key in building wealth and legacies, for the communities they represent.""It's so great to see people's faces when they start to realize that they can buy a home with as little as 3 percent down, and that they may be able to receive down payment assistance,"" she said. ""It starts to sink in that homeownership may be in their reach.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from U.S. Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: U.S. BankWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/us-bankEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: U.S. BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/741682/Mortgage-Loan-Originator-Trainee-Focused-on-Advancing-Black-Homeownership]"

Respondents reported that emerging payments technology – like contactless, embedded and real-time payments capabilities – enhances business profitability, with almost two-thirds calling the use of modern payment options a competitive differentiator.""The payments landscape is evolving at lightning speed and digital payment methods are quickly gaining traction with U.S. consumers,"" said Jamie Walker, CEO of Elavon, one of the largest payments processors globally and a subsidiary of U.S. Bank. ""More than three-quarters of retail-sector leaders surveyed believe positive checkout experiences are as important as product quality.

For business and finance leaders, improved convenience also equates to faster payments, improving cash flow.""By embracing the convenient payment processing options desired by consumers, large businesses and government agencies can get paid more quickly,"" Walker said. ""We found that across all sectors, more than 75% of financial leaders are relying on payments transformation to feed into greater sales and greater profitability for their organization.""Positive Payment Experiences to Drive Business GrowthThe survey results found:Respondents hope that payments transformation will reduce operational expenditure (64%) and improve liquidity (63%).

CTAS’ top line increased 10.4% and 13.7% year over year in fiscal 2022 and the first six months of fiscal 2023, respectively.The Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment is benefiting from increased volumes and higher prices. Revenues from the unit rose 9.4% and 12% year over year in fiscal 2022 and the first six months of fiscal 2023, respectively. Strength across the first aid cabinet service business is boosting the First Aid and Safety Services segment’s performance. Revenues from the segment climbed 6.1% and 17.2% in fiscal 2022 and the first six months of fiscal 2023, respectively.Cintas is also seeing strong growth across its uniform direct sale (33.9% organic growth in fiscal second quarter) and fire protection services (18% organic growth in fiscal second quarter) businesses.Cintas Corporation Price and ConsensusCintas Corporation Price and ConsensusCintas Corporation price-consensus-chart | Cintas Corporation QuoteCintas’ improved fiscal 2023 outlook raises optimism in the stock. The company now expects revenues of $8.67-$8.75 billion in fiscal 2023 compared with $8.58-$8.67 billion anticipated earlier. Earnings are estimated to be in the range of $12.50-$12.80 per share compared with $12.30 to $12.65 expected earlier. For fiscal 2023, Cintas expects adjusted operating income between $1.75 billion and $1.79 billion ($1.55 billion reported in fiscal 2022).Cintas' focus on enhancement of its product portfolio, along with investments in technology and existing facilities, should continue to drive its performance. Also, its focus on operational execution, cost-control measures and pricing actions is helping it maintain healthy margin performance. For instance, in the fiscal second quarter, gross margin increased 100 basis points to 47%.Cintas’ measures to consistently reward shareholders through dividends and share repurchases are encouraging. In the first six months of fiscal 2023, the company repurchased shares worth $348.68 million and paid dividends of $215.01 million. In fiscal 2022, the company repurchased shares worth $1.53 billion, up from $554.12 million in the year-ago period. Dividend payments totaled $375.12 million in fiscal 2022. Owing to strong performance in fiscal 2022, the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 21.1% to $1.15 per share in July 2022. Cintas has consistently raised its dividend for 39 straight years.On the flip side, Cintas, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has lately been enduring labor shortages and the adverse impacts of high costs and expenses. In the first six months of fiscal 2023, its cost of sales (comprising costs related to uniform rental and facility services as well as others) increased 12.8% year over year to $2.29 billion. High energy expenses are pushing up costs. In fiscal 2022, cost of sales increased 11.1% year over year to $4.22 billion. High labor and purchasing costs drove expenses. Escalating costs and expenses, if not checked, might negatively impact its profitability in the quarters ahead.Given its vast geographical spread, Cintas is exposed to currency translation risks. A stronger U.S. dollar might depress the company's overseas business results in the quarters ahead.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks within the broader Industrial Products sector are as follows:Deere &amp; Company DE currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Amazon’s push into healthcare some five years ago has yet to disrupt longstanding industry practices or reap windfalls from its virtual pharmacy and other programs.Best Buy Chief Financial Officer Matthew Bilunas, however, predicted continued growth of the company's health services would contribute to gross profit rate expansion even as it anticipates cooling demand throughout 2023.Best Buy’s comparable sales declined 9.3% over the holiday quarter, slightly above Wall Street expectations. Demand for computers, home theater equipment, appliances and cell phones were particularly soft, driven by higher consumer spending on essentials like food and fuel.Story continues“When the basics are where that sustained inflation is, it does mean the customer is going to make trade-off decisions,” CEO Barry said on the call.Best Buy has been investing heavily in health care services over the last few years as an alternative revenue stream to electronics sales, and has made several acquisitions in the sector, the most notable being its $800 million purchase of senior-citizen focused GreatCall Inc in 2018.In 2021, the company also bought Current Health, a home-care technology platform that offers monitoring through wearable devices.""The role of technology within health care is becoming more important than ever, and our strategy is to enable care at home for everyone,"" Barry said.New sign-ups for Best Buy's health services are expected to help drive a 40 to 70 basis point improvement in gross margins this year, despite lower sales. To save costs, the company is also removing some features from its tech-focused membership services, including free same-day delivery.""It's a very profitable business,"" said Hilding Anderson, vice president and head of retail strategy for consulting firm Publicis Sapient.""The margins you can make in some of the wellness and health product categories has become pretty significant. It also drives the foot traffic in physical stores and that's the primary revenue source for most of these retailers.""Both Walmart and Amazon also forecast lower-than-expected annual profits as consumers pull back on spending and gravitate toward lower-priced private label brands for essentials.Health spending - projected to reach $5.2 trillion nationally by 2025, according to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services - has become an alluring growth avenue for some retailers.In addition to its investment in One Medical, Amazon has added a generic drug subscription add-on as a way to attract new business.

Founded in Germany, this chain now has more than 2,000 stores in the U.S. and offers a no-frills shopping experience. You have to bring your own shopping bags and pay 25 cents to use a shopping cart (you get your quarter back when you return your cart). Plus, Aldi stores carry only the most commonly purchased grocery items, and most of them are exclusive Aldi brands. By carrying only the essentials, with a limited selection of each, the Aldi stores are much smaller than the competition.And as inflation has squeezed family shopping budgets, more and more people have discovered Aldi.Costco's Best Deals?

One thing is clear: Aldi compares favorably to traditional grocery and big-box stores.by AldiBest Things To Buy at AldiYou can save a lot buying private-label brands at Aldi rather than brand-name items at other stores. In fact, Aldi-exclusive brands often are cheaper than other grocery store brands. Plus, Aldi has the lowest prices on many organic items.Live Richer Podcast: Why Not Having a High-Yield Savings Account Can Be a Huge MistakeMarie C Fields / Shutterstock.comBaking SuppliesBaking supplies are among the best Aldi deals.Story continuesFor example, a 5-pound bag of all-purpose flour is $2.19 at Aldi versus $2.79 at Ralphs stores for the house brand. Continue down the baking aisle at Aldi and you'll stumble upon the boxes of gelatin mix. Price of the store brand is 36 cents. At Ralphs in Southern California, you'll pay 59 cents for a similar box of the house brand or $1.99 for the Jell-O brand.Chamille White / Shutterstock.comBaked Goods and BreadAldi offers some of the best deals on bread and baked goods. In fact, it's hard to beat the store's low price of $1.89 for a bag of cinnamon raisin bagels or $2.75 for a dozen Hawaiian sweet dinner rolls. Compare that to the national brands at Target: $4.19 for plain bagels and $4.79 for the Hawaiian rolls.Yulia Lisitsa / iStock.comCoffee CreamerTo give your coffee a kick of French vanilla or hazelnut flavor, Aldi's Barissimo brand coffee creamer, found in the dairy section, could do the trick at a discount. A 32-ounce container costs $2.49. Compare that to the Ralphs store brand, which costs about $1 more, or to the national Coffee mate brand, which has a regular price of $4.49 at Kroger.P_Wei / Getty Images/iStockphotoDairyDairy items like Greek yogurt at Aldi are good for you and your wallet. A 5.3-ounce carton on Aldi's nonfat Greek yogurt costs 62 cents, whereas the national brand sold at Target is priced at $1.29.Yellowj / Shutterstock.comGourmet CheeseOne of the best buys at Aldi is gourmet cheese. You can find several types for less than what you'd pay at another store. For example, an 8-ounce package of brie costs $3.39 at Aldi. The same-sized package at Kroger costs $5.26.Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.comAlmond MilkYou can get a great deal on almond milk - either chocolate or vanilla - at Aldi stores. A half-gallon carton of Aldi's almond milk, at $2.39 per half gallon, costs 60 cents less than the Simple Truth almond milk at Ralphs.baibaz / Shutterstock.comOrganic Peanut ButterOne of the Aldi special buys is its award-winning organic peanut butter. So if you have a peanut butter lover in your household, you can stock up on this item for less. A 16-ounce jar of Aldi's Simply Nature organic peanut butter is $4.19 - less than the $4.79 you'll pay for Target's Good &amp; Gather brand.Angel Simon / Shutterstock.comOrganic Olive OilYou'll get a much better deal on organic olive oil at Aldi than at other grocery stores. Aldi's price for a 17-ounce bottle is $4.49, and that is $1 lower than the regular price at Ralphs. And that container at Ralphs holds only 16.9 ounces, making the cost savings per ounce even better.Zadorozhna Natalia / Shutterstock.comOrganic CoffeeLike most of its other organic products, Aldi's Simply Nature brand of organic coffee offers significant savings over organic coffee at other grocery stores. For example, a 12-ounce package of Simply Nature fair trade organic coffee is $6.47, or $4.99 for a 12-pack of pods. The same-sized bag of Target's Good &amp; Gather fair trade organic coffee is regularly priced at $7.39, with a 16-pack of pods at $11.89. The difference in the price per pod is significant: 42 cents at Aldi versus 74 cents at Target.Igor Dutina / Shutterstock.comSnacksSnack foods are a great deal at Aldi. For example, an 11-ounce bag of Santitas tortilla chips is regularly priced at $2.49. However, you can get a 13-ounce bag of tortilla chips at Aldi for just $1.95. The price difference per ounce is nearly 8 cents.by AldiWorst Things To Buy at AldiIt's honestly tough to beat most of the prices at Aldi. However, there are a handful of items you can get for less at other supermarkets and retailers. Plus, some of Aldi's low-priced products should be avoided because the quality is subpar.George Rudy / Shutterstock.comBrand-Name FoodIf you shop at Aldi, you're better off buying its private-label brands. Often, Aldi has name-brand foods on the shelf, but they cost more than they do at grocery stores, which also will accept manufacturers' coupons, offer digital coupons in app and often have sales. The cereal aisle is a great example of the difference between store brands and national ones. A 15.4-ounce box of Honey Nut Cheerios costs $4.33 at Aldi versus $5.98 for a 29.4-ounce box at Walmart. Buying your cereal at Walmart will save you more than 8 cents per ounce.The same goes for Fruity Pebbles. Buy 15 ounces at Aldi for $3.98 or 27.5 ounces at Walmart for $5.98. The difference is almost 5 cents per ounce.LenaPl / Shutterstock.comBody WashWhen it comes to shopping for personal care items in liquid form, it pays to compare price per ounce, and that includes body wash. Walmart sells Old Spice body wash for men, Swagger scent, in a 30-ounce bottle for about $8. That's about 27 cents per ounce, well below the approximately 37 cents per ounce you'll pay for the smaller 16-ounce bottle at Aldi.Andrii Zastrozhnov / Shutterstock.comGarbage BagsWhen you buy house-brand garbage bags at Aldi, you run the risk of a lesser-quality product than offered by competitors. Many online reviewers rate Aldi's Boulder brand flex kitchen trash bags as substandard. At about $7 for a box of 40, that's less than the $7.62 you'll pay for Walmart's Great Value brand, but reviewers give those bags 4.3 stars out of five.Piotr Adamowicz / Shutterstock.comEggsFinally, egg prices are coming down. Now, at $3.29 a dozen, eggs are a more affordable source of protein found at Aldi, but you'll find them for less at Walmart. The price at Walmart hovered close to $5 per dozen a few months ago, but it's dropped to $2.36. The difference in price can add up if you and your large family eat eggs daily or if you use them for baking.shapecharge / Getty Images/iStockphotoOver-the-Counter MedicationFor starters, you won't find much of a selection of over-the-counter medication at Aldi. Plus, you can get a better deal buying it in bulk because over-the-counter medication is one of the best buys at Sam's Club.A bottle with 100 caplets of ibuprofen costs about $2 at Aldi -- about 2 cents per caplet. At Sam's, you can get 1,200 caplets for just a bit more than 1 cent per caplet. If you don't need quite that many, Walmart has a package of 500 for $7.98 - just 1.6 cents each.DustyPixel / Getty Images/iStockphotoPaper PlatesAldi doesn't have a big assortment of paper plates to choose from, but the 100-count package of 10-inch everyday plates for $7.69 could last your family awhile. But it you can get by with 9-inch plates, you'll pay $6.22 for a 100-pack of Walmart's Great Value paper plates.OlegDoroshin / Shutterstock.comSodaThe price of brand-name soda has risen drastically the past few years, and you won't necessarily find it cheaper at Aldi; a 12-pack of Coca-Cola costs $7.46 there. And while a single pack is expensive everywhere, other stores often offer deals if you buy multiple packs. You often can pick up three packs of soda for a discount off  at Walgreens, find a coupon on your grocer's app or save a percentage off with Target Circle.jadimages / Shutterstock.comTide DetergentA jug containing 42 pods of Tide detergent costs about $13 at Aldi, Walmart and Target. And while the price is the same, there frequently are manufacturers coupons for Tide, either in the Sunday newspaper or downloadable on the website of your local grocery store. Sign up for free for Target Circle and you're also eligible for promotions, such as buying two eligible products and receiving a $5 Target gift card. Often, you'll find Target to be the best shopping destination for name-brand products.Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.comToilet PaperAldi's package of 18 mega-rolls of Willow toilet paper - the equivalent of 72 regular rolls - sounds like a good deal at $13.79 until you comparison shop. You'll save $3 on 18 mega-rolls of Angel Soft at Walmart, where a package is priced at $11.99.More From GOBankingRatesStudent Loan Forgiveness: Will You Qualify for $0 Payments Under Biden's New Plan?Get Tax Guidance and Tips for Your 2023 FilingMaximize your savings with these 3 expert tips6 Strategies for Paying Off Multiple Credit CardsJami Farkas contributed to the reporting for this article.This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 19 Best and Worst Deals at Aldi]"

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I'll turn the call over to Sara Penner, Manager of Investor Relations for Nordstrom. You may now begin.Sara PennerGood afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to mention that we'll be referring to slides, which can be viewed in the Investor Relations section on nordstrom.com. Our discussion may include forward-looking statements, so please refer to the slide with our safe harbor language. As a reminder, we are here today to discuss our business and fourth quarter performance, and we will not be taking questions on other matters. Participating in today's call are Erik Nordstrom, Chief Executive Officer; Pete Nordstrom, President and Chief Brand Officer; and Michael Maher, Interim Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a business update and discuss the company's fourth quarter performance. And now I'll turn the call over to Erik.Erik B. NordstromThank you, Sara, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. For the fourth quarter, we delivered net sales of $4.2 billion and earnings per share of $0.74. Looking back on the fiscal year, revenue increased 5% from 2021 and adjusted EBIT margin was in line with last year at 3.3%. We saw customers starting to pull back in late June, primarily in Nordstrom Rack, and this trend continued through the holiday season. Across both banners, the softening trend was more pronounced in customers with lower income profiles. Given the uncertain environment, we are executing with agility. We took actions starting in Q3 to clear excess inventory and optimize our product mix. As a result, we are now in a much healthier position with inventory levels down 15% from last year and in line with 2019 levels. While this was the right strategy to better position our inventory levels for 2023, we implemented more markdowns than we had initially planned to achieve our goal. This was compounded by the softening trend, excess inventory levels and promotional intensity in our sector. As a result, our margins were lower than expected in the fourth quarter. Despite this, I'm pleased that our supply chain initiatives delivered efficiency and lower per unit costs in Q4, resulting in more than 200 basis points of SG&amp;A rate improvement even with lower sales leverage and ongoing inflationary pressures. At the same time, we remain committed to driving more profitable long-term growth. We are looking across our business and operations with this clear mindset to ensure we are deploying our financial resources and talent against the opportunities where we are best positioned to win in the medium and long term. With this in mind, we have decided to wind down our Canadian business over the next few months to simplify our operations and increase our focus on our core U.S. business. We entered Canada in 2014 because we believed it presented a compelling opportunity, and we are grateful for the many customer relationships we have built over the years. Despite our team's best efforts, including multiple initiatives to improve our outcomes, our Canadian business has not been profitable. The impact from COVID drove further losses with no realistic path to sustainable profitability. Canada accounts for less than 3% of our total sales, and we believe we will benefit from a sharper focus on our U.S. business. Michael will provide more detail on the onetime charges related to this decision and the impact on our sales and profitability going forward. While we are confident in our decision, it was a difficult one to make, and we recognize the personal impact on our employees. We are committed to treating our Canadian employees with fairness and respect. We are establishing an employee trust that will provide additional benefits for employees during the wind down period. I have the deepest appreciation for the talent and passion of our great team in Canada. I want to sincerely thank them for their dedication to customers and the service they have provided over the years. More than ever, I believe Nordstrom is uniquely positioned to meet the changing needs of our customers. With our 2 powerful interconnected brands, the breadth of our products, styles and prices, and most of all, our unwavering passion for customer service, we have a durable foundation for growth. We are taking clear actions in 2023 to expand market share and improve our profitability. It starts with our loyal customer base, our greatest asset. We acquired approximately 10 million new customers in 2022 and added 2.5 million new Nordy Club members. We are committed to building on these successes while delivering on our legacy of service across physical stores and digitally as the customer experience continues to evolve to be even more omnichannel. This is critical to driving engagement and attracting more customers. In addition to improving the customer experience, we are focused on 3 specific priorities to drive better financial performance in 2023. One, improving Nordstrom Rack performance. Two, increasing our inventory productivity; and three, continuing to advance our supply chain optimization initiatives. I'll address each of these briefly, then Pete will go into more depth on some of our initiatives in support of these priorities. Starting with Nordstrom Rack. Sales in Q4 declined 8% versus last year as we saw consumers pull back spending. We estimate that a little over half of the decrease was driven by specific actions we took to improve profitability, namely eliminating costly Rack store-based order fulfillment and raising the minimum order amount to receive free ship-to-store delivery on nordstromrack.com. These actions reduced order cancellations, simplified Rack operations and improved Rack profitability, but negatively impacted topline growth at the Rack. We also cleared out older and unproductive inventory giving us increased open-to-buy and therefore, greater flexibility to improve our merchandise assortment as we enter 2023. We are committed to improving both our top and bottom line performance at Nordstrom Rack in 3 ways. First and most importantly, we are prioritizing 100 nationally recognized strategic brands to help us drive sales and grow market share. Simply put, we know we win with customers at the Rack when we deliver great brands at great prices. We believe strong brand recognition drives outsized customer engagement, and these brands are proven performers many of which are not widely available in the off-price space. By increasing inventory turns at the Rack, we can increase the flow of these great brands and give customers newness each time they visit us. Second, we are expanding our reach and convenience for customers by opening 20 new Rack stores this year. Rack stores continue to be our largest source of new customer acquisition, accounting for more than 40% of newly acquired customers in 2022. Our Rack store fleet is underpenetrated, and we have an opportunity to attract more customers and drive profitable growth through a proven model as we expand our reach with more new stores. Third, we will drive greater engagement and higher profitability at nordstromrack.com. Our digital capabilities are unique in the off-price space, and we see opportunities to leverage our digital assets to increase engagement with our Rack customers. We will also continue to optimize the operational model for improved profitability as we did by discontinuing store-based fulfillment of nordstromrack.com orders. Moving now to our second priority for 2023, inventory productivity. Better inventory discipline across our operation provides customers with relevant and new assortments from the world's best brands. We also have a significant opportunity to improve our earnings and returns on invested capital through increased productivity from our merchandise inventory, our largest annual investment. The substantial disruptions and volatility in our business over the past 3 years had a significant impact on our inventory management and outcomes, including buy plans, receipt flows, stock levels, markdowns and turns. As supply chains have stabilized, we have an opportunity to return to pre-pandemic norms across these elements of our inventory management. Finally, let's turn to our third priority of supply chain optimization. We made great progress in 2022 on our supply chain initiatives, which drove improvement in our SG&amp;A rate despite lower sales leverage and continued inflationary pressure. Pete will provide highlights from our work in 2022. This year, we will build on our momentum to further improve the customer experience while driving greater expense efficiency. We're continuing to scale our West Coast omnichannel center, and we are building productivity across our network. Improvements in inventory turns and flow also continue to help reduce supply chain costs. The past 3 years have been the most challenging and unpredictable for our industry in more than a generation. We are incredibly proud of the way our people navigated the unprecedented circumstances, while remaining true to our core values. As we enter 2023, we are ready to move forward. We have a clear set of priorities that we expect will drive improved performance in the near term while positioning us for longer-term profitable growth. We have made difficult decisions to increase our focus on executing against those priorities in our core business. We have a strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows, and we remain committed to putting the customer at the center of everything we do. With that, I'll turn it over to Pete.Story continuesPeter E. NordstromThanks, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to talk about our merchandise performance during the fourth quarter, then follow up with highlights from the work streams under each of the 3 focus areas Erik discussed. Starting with merchandise performance. We prioritize getting to healthy inventory levels by year-end and taking additional markdowns to do so impacted our results in most categories. That said, we saw areas of strength in the quarter. We were pleased to see strength in men's apparel, which was up versus last year and at 2019 levels, particularly in dress wear as people shop for special occasions and updated the return to office looks. At the Rack banner, Beauty grew high single digits as consumers responded well to our expanded offerings with brands like MAC and Clinique. To illustrate our efforts to get to a cleaner inventory position, seasonal categories, including outerwear, sweaters and boots, had strong sell-through with ending inventory levels 30% less than prior year. After a robust start to 2022, our designer business softened in the back half, and we are reviewing our inventory positions to adjust where needed to improve productivity. At the Nordstrom banner, we're making progress on delivering selection, relevance and inspiration to our customers by partnering with brands in alternative ways. We grew our sales through unowned inventory models by 10% over the last year, and they now make up 12% of GMV at the Nordstrom banner. We continue to scale our Nordstrom Media Network, which grew over 50% versus last year. In the fourth quarter, we expanded our advertising offering to brands and categories adjacent to Nordstrom, launched offsite partnerships with TikTok and Pinterest and scaled on-site advertising with display ads on Nordstrom.com. Our brand partners value the opportunity to connect with our highly engaged and loyal customers with a strong return on ad spend, particularly as advertisers look to diversify their media mix. Now on to our initiatives. As Erik mentioned, we're focused on improving Rack performance. And one of the initiatives to drive sales and faster inventory turn is prioritizing 100 strategic brands that are well known and loved across the U.S. but also have room to grow in the off-price space. Strategic brands have better productivity than other brands in terms of average selling price and monthly sell-through. These include many brands we carry at the Nordstrom banner. As we previously mentioned, 90% of the top 50 brands at Nordstrom are also carried at Nordstrom Rack. Looking forward, our healthier inventory levels provide us an open-to-buy position and we are leaning into strategic brands. While these brands accounted for half of Rack sales in 2022, they make up 60% of our on order for the first half of '23. We're still on track to have the Rack assortment in a good place by mid-'23. With more open to buy and access to great brands, especially in the current environment, we are well positioned to deliver a more constant stream of newness and improve inventory flow. A second initiative at Rack is to expand our reach with new stores as part of our closer-to-use strategy. We are encouraged by the results of our 3 newest stores, which have exceeded our expectations and performed better than the fleet average in terms of sales productivity. This proof point gives us further confidence in the product mix we're working towards and the opportunity for improvement in our overall Rack business through greater focus on strategic brands, newness and inventory flow. The third initiative with Rack is driving greater customer engagement and profitability at nordstromrack.com. By increasing the penetration of strategic brands online and leveraging our digital marketing capabilities, we will drive traffic and sales both at nordstromrack.com and in our stores. We also continue to drive omnichannel engagement across banners. For example, 1 in 5 Nordstrom.com, buy online, pick up in store orders are actually picked up at our Rack stores after we launched this service just 3 years ago. The second area of focus across both banners is increasing our inventory productivity. This started with entering 2023 in a healthier inventory position. Looking forward, we have conservative buy plans in place, consistent with our outlook for continued macroeconomic pressure on consumer spending. We are also maintaining increased reserves against our buy plans, which enables us to be opportunistic in season, and we are planning for faster inventory turns with an increase of at least 10% over 2022 to drive newness and flow while also increasing the return on our inventory investment. We are also enhancing our capabilities to manage inventory with greater precision at the unit level through investments in RFID and the shift to cost accounting for internal merchandising. These capabilities will help us deliver a fresh and relevant assortment at the store level for our customers. It will also improve our ability to buy, allocate and track merchandise across our network, provide us greater visibility in the profitability at the unit level, increase efficiency and reduce shrinkage. Our third focus area, continuing to enhance our supply chain capabilities is also an essential part of our closer-to-use strategy. We built momentum throughout 2022 on several initiatives to improve the customer experience and our profitability despite ongoing cost pressures. I'll highlight a few. We made significant progress in optimizing our unit flow from suppliers to customers by both changing some of our ordering practices as well as partnering with suppliers on shipment standards, and we'll be rolling this out further this year. We improved productivity and throughput in our distribution and fulfillment centers by more than 20% through better unit flow, focusing on team member retention and leveraging data for scheduling and training. Lastly, we increased delivery speed from click to delivery overall. For instance, our share of orders delivered within 4 days or less is up 40% from last year. These actions will continue to improve the customer experience, increase sell-through and reduce markdowns by allowing us to place the right assortment with the right depth closer to the customer. We expect to see further benefits from these efforts as well as from additional supply chain actions throughout 2023. In closing, we are entering 2023 positioned for increased agility and are focused on our key priorities for improving the customer experience and our profitability. We especially want to thank our team for their ongoing commitment to helping our customers feel good and look their best. With that, I'll turn it over to Michael to discuss our financial results.Michael W. MaherThank you, Pete. I'll begin with our fourth quarter results and then walk through our outlook for fiscal 2023. For the fourth quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.74. Net sales in GMV each decreased 4%. For the full year, total revenue, net sales and GMV were all up 5%. In Q4, Nordstrom banner sales decreased to 2% and GMV decreased to 3% versus last year. Nordstrom Rack sales decreased 8%, with a little over half of this decrease attributable to the elimination of Rack store fulfillment starting in the third quarter. Digital sales decreased to 13% this quarter including an estimated 500 basis point impact from eliminating Rack store fulfillment and sunsetting Trunk Club earlier in 2022. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased 525 basis points, primarily due to higher markdowns as we prioritized rightsizing inventory to start fiscal 2023 in a healthier position. Ending inventory decreased 15% from a year ago compared to a 4% decrease in fourth quarter sales. We remain committed to a disciplined approach to inventory management in 2023 with a goal of improving turns by at least 10%. Despite lower sales than last year, total SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales decreased 240 basis points in the fourth quarter, primarily due to supply chain expense efficiencies. As with last quarter, we're pleased with the progress we made on our supply chain optimization initiatives despite labor and transportation cost pressures. We expect these initiatives will continue to deliver significant benefits in 2023. EBIT margin was 4.5% for the fourth quarter. For the year, EBIT margin was 3.1%, and adjusted EBIT margin was 3.3%. We have a strong balance sheet and financial position, ending the fourth quarter with $1.5 billion in available liquidity, including the full $800 million available on our revolving line of credit. Turning to our 2023 outlook. I'll start by discussing the macroeconomic backdrop and the related assumptions underlying our guidance. We expect that elevated inflation and rising interest rates will continue to weigh on consumer spending, especially in the first half of the year. We also anticipate continuing inflationary pressure on our expenses, especially labor and transportation costs. However, we also expect global supply chain disruptions to continue to dissipate, benefiting inbound freight costs and inventory flow. Taking these factors into consideration, for fiscal 2023, we expect revenue to decline 4% to 6% versus 2022. This outlook includes 2 significant items worth calling out. The first is an approximately 2.5 percentage point negative impact from the wind down of our Canadian operations, which delivered sales of approximately $400 million in 2022. The second is an approximately 1.3 percentage point positive impact from the 53rd week in fiscal 2023, which we expect will add approximately $200 million in sales to the fourth quarter. Next, I'll highlight 3 factors that shape our outlook between the first and the second half of 2023. Year-over-year sales comparisons will be more difficult in the first half against our stronger first half in 2022, with more favorable comparisons expected in the second half. In addition, 1 week of the anniversary sale will shift from the second quarter into the third quarter this year. This will negatively impact second quarter sales and positively impact third quarter sales by approximately 200 basis points. We expect improvements in our business to build into the second half especially in the Rack as our merchandise assortment continues to improve, and we open new stores. We will also lap the impact of discontinuing Rack store fulfillment of online orders beginning in the third quarter. As a result of these factors, we expect revenue to decrease by a low double-digit percentage in the first half and to increase by a low single-digit percentage in the second half versus 2022. We expect the wind down of our Canadian operations to result in onetime pretax charges of $300 million to $350 million in the first quarter of 2023, primarily related to the write-off of our investment in Nordstrom Canada. These charges will reduce our first quarter and full year earnings per share by approximately $1.40 to $1.60. Excluding these charges, we expect an adjusted EBIT margin of approximately 3.7% to 4.2% for the full year versus 3.3% in 2022. Our forecast assumes that adjusted EBIT margin expansion will be driven primarily by gross margin improvements from our focus on inventory productivity, especially in the second half of the year when compared to the elevated markdowns we took in 2022. The wind down of Canadian operations will also improve EBIT, excluding onetime charges by approximately $35 million with most of the associated 20 basis points of EBIT margin improvement reflected in buying and occupancy costs as part of our gross profit margin. Continued progress on our supply chain optimization initiatives will help partially mitigate SG&amp;A expense deleverage resulting from lower sales and inflationary cost pressures. Given the previously mentioned sales and gross margin trends, we expect EBIT margin increases in the second half of the year offsetting decreases from lower sales in the first half of the year. Our plan assumes that first quarter EBIT will be roughly breakeven. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 32% for the fiscal year which includes an estimated 500 basis point impact from the onetime Canada charges. Our tax rate, excluding this impact is expected to be approximately 27%. We expect earnings per share of $0.20 to $0.80. Excluding charges related to the wind down of Canadian operations, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.80 to $2.20. Our earnings per share projections exclude the impact of share repurchases, if any. Shifting to capital allocation, our priorities remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in the business to better serve our customers and support long-term growth. We are planning capital expenditures of 3% to 4% of net sales, primarily for investments in supply chain and technology capabilities. Our second priority is reducing our leverage. We remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating through a combination of earnings improvement and debt reduction. We ended the year at 3.1x and continue to target a leverage ratio below 2.5x. We continue to return cash to shareholders. Earlier this week, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share. In addition, during fiscal 2022, we repurchased approximately $62 million of our stock at an average price of $22 per share. We have $438 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. We will continue to take a measured approach to share repurchases aligning with our cash flow and market conditions. As you've heard today, we are taking significant steps to execute with agility given the continued challenging macroeconomic backdrop. We are prioritizing initiatives that will drive greater profitability through improved performance at Rack, a disciplined approach to increase inventory productivity and continued progress on our supply chain optimization efforts. We are confident in our ability to navigate through economic uncertainty and remain excited about the future of our business and our ability to deliver significant shareholder value over time. With that, Sara, we're ready for questions.Sara PennerThank you, Michael. Before we get started with Q&amp;A, we ask that participants please limit themselves to 1 question and 1 follow-up. We'll now move to the Q&amp;A session.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs.Brooke Siler RoachI'd love to spend a little bit more time digging in on the timeline to positive comparable sales growth at the Rack business. How are you currently forecasting Rack sales cadencing throughout the year? What are you seeing from your initial inventory rebalancing efforts? And can you provide a little bit more context on the profit impact of rightsizing the business to focus on your most important brands?Michael W. MaherYes. Thanks. This is Michael. I'll go ahead and take the shot first at the way we've contemplated the flow of revenue through the year. And then I'll let Pete talk a little bit about the inventory availability and what we're seeing on that front. So first of all, on the topline, there's just a number of factors there to bear in mind as you think about starting the year off -- we are first and foremost being, we're lapping a much stronger first half of last year. In the first quarter, in particular, we were up 19% year-over-year in the first quarter last year. So we've just got a tougher comparison as we start the year out. We also have, as we've talked about, as we're building our assortment of strategic brands in the Rack, we expect to get to a place where we're targeting somewhere around the middle of the year, but we expect sequential improvement as we go through the next couple of quarters. And then we're also opening new Rack stores. Those will begin here in the spring, so we'll see some benefits in the first half of the year. But it will be most pronounced as we get into the second half. And then finally, you've just -- you've got the impact of eliminating Rack store fulfillment, which we did in the third quarter of last year. And so that results in a step-up as well when we get into the third quarter this year, and we aren't going against that headwind any further. That's sort of how Rack factors into the shape of that overall revenue guidance. Pete, do you want to talk a little bit about the inventory positioning at Rack and what was the availability?Peter E. NordstromSure. Yes. We've done a lot of work over the last couple of years to figure out our Rack strategy. And as you know, maybe 2 years ago now, we went with a (inaudible) a strategy that had us lowering AUR a little bit to try to see if we could gather more customers that way. We did, but not enough, really, I think to offset the lower AUR. In a lot of ways, what we've learned and maybe validated something we knew all the way along is the secret sauce for us in the off-price is the quality of the brands that we're able to offer. And that's why the whole kind of great brands, great prices thing is really where we're focused. We know that customers come to Nordstrom Rack because they look for the brand they wouldn't typically find at other off-price retailers. We talked about 90% of the brand -- our top 50 brands in the Nordstrom banner are available in the Rack. And that's a good thing for us. But to do that well, we have to be in a lean inventory position where we could be opportunistic about the buys from those brands. And we just were to position this last year where we had to switch inventory, and that really hurt us. So we took aggressive position to get the markdowns there to clean ourselves out, to get ourselves in a really good spot for '23 with the balance of seasonality, age and categories. And now we have open-to-buy. We're chasing into it. There's a good product to be bought out there, and it starts with these top strategic brands.OperatorNext is Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.Matthew Robert BossGreat. So Erik, could you elaborate on more recent trends that you're seeing maybe across income cohorts in particular. I think you cited the softening more at the lower income side. And maybe could you touch on trends that you're seeing on the designer end? And then, Michael, just in terms of the phasing of the year, could you just maybe help bridge or walk through your confidence in the phasing of revenues front half down low double digits to the up low single digits in the back half of the year.Erik B. NordstromYes, when we look at our customer cohorts, it's pretty clear that the customer across the board is challenged, and there's some softness, and I think particularly in discretionary areas, we have seen that softness more pronounced in our lower income, in our Rack business. But it's safe to say that we've seen a pullback across our customers. For designer, I think Pete can go into that a little deeper.Peter E. NordstromYes. The designer business for us, I mean, to put this in context, I think this may be the first quarterly call I've been on the last 10 years, what I didn't say designer was one of our best-performing categories last month -- or last quarter. So I think it's important to keep this in context. I mean one quarter is not a trend make here. And to put it in a different context, last year, we did more designer sales than we've ever done in the history of our company. We had double-digit increase. So what happened to us though is that we had a very large double-digit increase trend going with our sales that dropped rather precipitously to more normalized levels. And so as a result, right now, we find ourselves with too much designer inventory in this moment. And so we're working through that, and we'll have to make some adjustments on some onward in the near term. But these cyclical things happen in this business, and we'll be able to work through that. But I think the good news is our customers over a long period of time have showed a strong interest in the designer business, and it's something that's really important to our overall success, and we have good partnerships there, and again, continues to be an important part of our business and what our customers expect from us.Michael W. MaherSo Matt, you had asked about the revenue cadence between the first and the second half. So let me talk about a few factors there that led us to set the outlook out that way. So first of all, those more difficult comparisons in the first half. Not that 2019 is necessarily the perfect baseline. But if you just look at the way last year progressed relative to that, in the first half of the year, we were up mid-single digits. And in the back half of the year, we were down mid-single digits relative to 2019. So just on the current run rate, we've got an easier comparison that gives you a sense of the order of magnitude of that. The other thing is we've talked about is those choices we made around digital sales earlier in 2022, both Racks or fulfillment and also discontinuing our Trunk Club business. So that is together worth about 200 basis points of headwind to the first half of the year, and it essentially -- it disappears in the second half. We'll be fully lapping those things. And then the last thing is -- well, actually, 2 more things. One of them is the Rack new store openings, I mentioned will begin in the spring, but the cumulative effect of the first half won't be very big. It will be worth about 150 basis points to the second half of the year, though. And then finally, the anniversary timing shift, that 1 week, it's a couple of hundred basis points between Q2 and Q3. That roughly equates to about 100 basis points between half 1 and half 2. So -- you put all those things together, and it gets us to a low double-digit decrease in the first half of the year and low single-digit increase in the back half.OperatorNext is Noah Zatzkin with KeyBanc Capital Markets. .Noah Seth ZatzkinJust any color on what you've been seeing in the promotional environment exiting the year, particularly as it relates to the planned cadence of gross margin moving through the year would be helpful. Obviously, compares become easier in the back half. But with inventory in a healthier position exiting the year, just any color on puts and takes we should be thinking about would be helpful.Peter E. NordstromYes. This is Pete. The biggest factor on our promotions has to do with our own inventory levels. So you saw increased markdown level in the fourth quarter for us, and that was largely of our own doing. There was regular promotional activity happening to competition that we had to respond to. But most of that was really our own things. So I think what you should see going forward to this next year is a more normal rhythm of how promotions impact our business. We can't control what's going on with the other retailers and what their inventory position is. And at a certain level, we have to be responsive to that. So we'll see how that plays out. But for now, we can tell you with a lot of confidence that we're going to return to more normal markdown cadence because our inventory is in much better position.Michael W. MaherNoah, it's Michael. I'll just add to that that our outlook for gross margin assumes a more normalized level of markdown. So not any kind of historic best or anything like that, but just a normal cadence at a normal level. We do have some remaining pockets that we expect we'll be clearing in the first half of the year. That's contemplated in there as well. But then just through greater inventory discipline and turns, we would expect, as you go against that elevated level of markdowns in the fourth quarter that we should see some meaningful improvement.OperatorNext is Blake Anderson with Jefferies.Blake AndersonSo I wanted to ask on the previous medium-term guide you provided a couple of years ago. Just thinking about the margin targets. I think you had said you could do a 4.5% margin -- operating margin if you're at least $14.5 billion in revenue, which is what your guide implies this year. You're slightly below that on the margin guide. So how do we think about you bridging back to at least 4.5%? And then I wanted to revisit how you get back to that second target of 6% plus?Michael W. MaherYes, Blake, it's Michael. I'll take a first shot at that. We believe that those targets are -- remain achievable in a normalized environment with sort of sustainable low single-digit topline growth, we believe we can achieve better margins than we did on comparable revenue beforehand. We're not quite in a normalized environment at this point. We talked about some of the macro headwinds we're seeing right now on consumer spending and also the inflationary pressures. But we took a meaningful amount of our overhead costs out back in 2020, as you might recall. We continue to drive meaningful efficiencies in our supply chain, which is now the largest element of our SG&amp;A. And we've been driving down our buying and occupancy as a percentage of our sales as well, which, as you know, is a component of gross profit for us. So really, the last element in that equation for us is once we're in sort of a normalized macro environment where we can generate and sustain low single-digit topline growth, we believe we're positioned to achieve those long-term EBIT margin target.Blake AndersonOkay. And then just wanted to follow up on the Rack inventory. I mean you've talked about the excess inventory environment potentially being a benefit. Did you see that in Q4 at all? And then how much are you baking in for that this year as well?Erik B. NordstromWe started to see it in the fourth quarter, but we really weren't in a great position to chase into it because we were still cleaning up our inventory level. So I think it's one of the things that gives us some level of confidence. I mean that switch doesn't get flipped overnight, that all of a sudden, we completely transform our inventory. But again, I think it's fair to say we're open to buy going forward, and we're in a position to start receiving the newness of the brands and the balance that's going to be a good recipe for us in the Rack.OperatorNext is Ed Yruma with Piper Sandler.Edward James YrumaFirst, a housekeeping question. The 20 new Rack stores, I guess, how much does that contribute to sales growth in '23? And I guess just stepping back a little bit. I know that the store comp maybe was a little easier because of Omicron, but even ex some of these special items, digital seems to be underperforming. How should we think about your digital business in '23? Will it outperform the storage business or more in line? And kind of what initiatives do you have underway to kind of restore health there?Michael W. MaherEd, I'll start with the Rack new store contribution. It is approximately 100 basis points to the year, and that's going to be back half weighted. And then as far as digital, I could talk a little bit about the trends and then let Erik speak to just more generally the outlook for our digital business. So yes, as you mentioned, we're comping Omicron in the fourth quarter of last year when we saw store traffic fall off in a pretty meaningful way in the middle of the quarter and a lot of that shift to digital. And so we saw the reverse of that in terms of the year-over-year trends this year. I'd expect that to continue into the first half at least as we're still -- what we saw in the first half of last year, you'll probably recall there was a strong pent-up demand for getting out again. Stores were especially -- showing especially strong growth, a little bit of a retreat in the digital penetration, and then we're -- to your point, we're lapping some of the decisions that we made last year that have suppressed our digital growth, but are helping us be more profitable. So we remain a 40% digital business. We continue to see it as a meaningful part of our overall business. And I think once we're past some of those timing impacts, we should see growth normalize. Erik, anything you want to add on that?Erik B. NordstromYes. I think in digital, one piece of context, we made some decisions last year to focus on profitable growth, which hurt some of our topline digitally, in particular, stopping store foot film on our rack.com order. So about 500 basis points on our digital performance. But we do see Nordstrom.com, in particular, as a growth vehicle for us. And our focus there isn't so much about pure digital growth. It is about engagement with customers as we continue to see the customer want omnichannel capabilities, things like only buy online, pick up in store. But for us, -- it's been very successful and we opened up our Rack stores to be the pickup point for Nordstrom.com orders. So not only having cross-channel capabilities but leveraging the 2 brands that we have there. The other piece I'd call out, which is a big general area for us to work on is around discovery. Our strength is around newness and inspiring our customers to try something new and introduce new brands to them. We've had a lot of success over the years. And it's not necessarily exclusive products, but it's brands that aren't up and aren't widely distributed. And digital is a real important part of that of the discovery experience as more and more customers start their journeys online, even if they end up being in store. So discovery is something that we have a lot of initiatives around this year.OperatorNext is Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.Eric Michael CohenThis is Eric Cohen on for Chuck. You talked about the consumer being under pressure, particularly more of the Rack customer. So I guess trying to understand the acceleration in the Rack openings this year. So why doing it now when comps have been under pressure, maybe not wait until the business is a little more on steady footing?Erik B. NordstromIt's a great question. First and foremost, our Rack stores are a great return on investment, full stop. We have a real strong track record of the return on these stores. It is a great use of capital -- it's low capital investments, low-risk investment on a proven model, and our most recent proof point to share would be our 3 recent store openings in Rack. All 3 of them are beating plan. All 3 of them are outperforming our fleet average and sales productivity and EBIT margin. And part of that, if you step back a little bit, off-price in particular, is a real requirement around convenience. And the discovery process in off-price for a lot of customers lends to sell to stores. So having more stores provides a lot more convenience. And sure seems clear to us that our fleet is underpenetrated. You look at our store count compared to others out there, we see a lot of room for growth there. The other piece I just would call out is what Rack stores do to our ecosystem. Rack stores remain the largest source of new customer acquisition for us. It's more than 40% of our new customer acquisition occurred in Rack stores. So there's just a lot of goodness all around for us to open Rack stores.Michael W. MaherErik one other thing I would just add to underscore Erik's comment about Rack stores being a great investment. They're a little capital investment, which you said. Just to highlight that, though, our cumulative investment this year in Rack new store openings is going to be less than 15% of our total capital expenditure plan. So we feel really good about making that commitment and getting the returns that I talked about.Eric Michael CohenGreat. When you look at sort of the credit card business, your portfolio, just on talks of increasing delinquencies, are you seeing anything with your customers in there? And anything in the portfolio that sort of shapes the way how you think the consumer is going to spend in 2023?Michael W. MaherYes. Well, what we've seen in terms of our credit card portfolio is similar to what we've seen sort of more broadly reported out there with larger card issuers. In general, we see consumers pulling back a little bit on discretionary categories. We see the credit metrics declining a little bit from where they were last year. But just for context, as a reminder, they were at historically good levels last year coming out of COVID with stimulus money and excess savings, consumers paid down balances, charge-offs and delinquencies were at historic lows. And we're back to something more normalized now, but actually still better for us than pre-pandemic levels. So what we're seeing now and what we expect to see and was contemplated in our '23 guidance is that with higher balances, we'll get higher finance charge and fee income. That will be offset by some higher loss rates. Overall, we think credit revenue will be a similar percentage of our total revenue.OperatorOur last question comes from Oliver Chen with TD Cowen.Oliver ChenEric Peter and Michael, regarding inventory, how should we think about inventory growth relative to sales growth in the next few quarters? Also, as you mentioned, there's a big opportunity to increase inventory turns. Which categories do you see the most opportunity? And then you also mentioned the cost method of accounting for inventory and switching from the retail to the cost method. That sounds like it could be very customer-centric and helpful. Would love more information on timing and how that may or may not impact agility and decision-making in terms of understanding the gross margin return on inventory profile.Michael W. MaherThanks, Oliver, for the question. I'll start, and then I'm going to let Pete chime in as well. First of all, in terms of the inventory versus sales growth. Yes, with the 10% or better improvement in turn, you should expect inventory levels to be lower than sales. Whatever kind of change in sales we see, we should be better than that in terms of inventory. I'll let Pete speak to the specific categories where we think we have the most opportunity. But real quickly before I turn it over to him, I just want add to address the cost method. We've made that switch for internal merchandising. We absolutely agree. It gives us the opportunity to be much more item-focused and precise in the way we're managing our inventory, which is good for customers, as you said. Do you just want to clarify, though, that you won't -- there is no change to our external reporting. We remain on the retail method for our financial accounting and external reporting. So you won't see any impact to our reported gross margin. Pete, do you want to add to that?Peter E. NordstromYes. With turn, I mean, I think the blanket answer is we have room to improve across the board but if I'm to choose or probably the biggest opportunity is I'd say the Rack all up across all categories, I'd say probably particularly in apparel, there's a version of that also in the Nordstrom banner, I would say, apparel is probably the one. And the reason I'd say that is probably the most perishable stuff that we have in terms of its seasonality and what have you. So there's opportunity across the board. And what we've done is we've gone back in context through historical best and turns and how that impacts our markdown rates and our margins and really not use last year as a guide, but really kind of starting at the all-time best that we had and planning accordingly. And so yes, again, I think the answer is across the board.Sara PennerWe want to thank you for joining today's call.

But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. To wit, the MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) share price has flown 115% in the last three years. How nice for those who held the stock! Also pleasing for shareholders was the 20% gain in the last three months. The company reported its financial results recently; you can catch up on the latest numbers by reading our company report.Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. Check out our latest analysis for MGM Resorts International There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During the three years of share price growth, MGM Resorts International actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) drop 0.4% per year.Companies are not always focussed on EPS growth in the short term, and looking at how the share price has reacted, we don't think EPS is the most important metric for MGM Resorts International at the moment. So other metrics may hold the key to understanding what is influencing investors.It could be that the revenue growth of 11% per year is viewed as evidence that MGM Resorts International is growing. If the company is being managed for the long term good, today's shareholders might be right to hold on.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-and-revenue-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months.

Michal Mrozek / UnsplashCruise companies are still continuing with their new vessel orders despite choppy waters in an uncertain consumer spending environment — and face the risks of piling on more debt.Take Norwegian Cruise Lines, which is planning to invest $2.4 billion in ship construction-related capital expenditures for 2023, and anticipates the figure to be $500 million and $1.8 billion for 2024 and 2025, respectively. Royal Caribbean Group also sees approximately $4.1 billion in ship construction costs in 2023 and an aggregate total of $9.8 billion for all existing ship orders. Carnival Corporation expects contracted new-builds to be $1.8 billion for 2023, and is reshaping its investment spending outlook to scale back on capital expenditures.The three major cruise lines, with $74 billion of debt combined, according to Bloomberg, face incoming competition from billionaires and hotels hoping to start their own fleets. Betting on the luxury tier and existing customer loyalty bases, these new entrants will be vying for a chunk of the premium market.After scrambling to renegotiate credit terms and grabbing lifelines from governments and banks to stay afloat during the pandemic, cruise companies are now in a balancing act between paying off debt and rebuilding profit streams.The industry was exposed for its wasteful practices and detrimental environmental impact, no more so than during the height of the pandemic. Facing significant backlash and pressure to address carbon footprints, cruise lines will likely take on even heftier costs to reduce food waste and implement additional sustainability measures. Some are unwilling to give up new-build pipelines, but all are reevaluating operational structures and strategic priorities to sail back to profitable growth.“You’ve likely seen some of the actions we’ve already taken to improve our cost structure,” said Frank del Rio, president and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line, during the company’s most recent earnings call. “Normalization of marketing spend, corporate overhead reductions, itinerary optimization, supply chain initiatives, and thoughtful rationalization of product delivery. We will continue to leave no stone unturned as we identify and evaluate incremental opportunities.”Story continuesWhat Norwegian Cruise’s Mounting Costs Tell UsAdjusted net cruise costs based on passenger capacity compared to pre-pandemic levels. Source: Morgan Stanley ResearchNorwegian served 1.7 million guests in 2022, and expects its full-year book position in 2023 to top pre-pandemic levels. It is optimistic that it can continue to ride 2022 tailwinds from marketing, pricing and service strategies despite plans for trimming down costs.The cruise line operates through three brands, including Norwegian, Regent and Oceania Cruises, and foresees one new build per brand for a total of three new ships to join its fleet in 2023. At least one new ship is scheduled to be delivered each year through 2028. According to its recent annual report, around 80 percent of each ship’s contract price will be funded through export credit financing, which it is working to secure.Export credit financing is a typical loan arrangement to finance cruise ship constructions. This is often negotiated with export credit facilities of countries where the shipyards are located, allowing cruise companies to place ship orders without having to pay much in advance. The main portion of the cost will be due on each ship’s delivery date, which could be years later.Measuring Cruise Lines DebtAverage cost of debt financing for three major cruise lines. Source: Morgan Stanley ResearchRoyal Caribbean Group has the same approach and expects 2023 capacity to increase by approximately 14 percent from 2019 levels. Its wholly-owned brands will also each welcome a new ship in 2023, with Silversea debuting the first of the Evolution class, Celebrity Cruises welcoming the fourth ship in its Edge series and Royal Caribbean International marking its first new ship class in nine years.Like Norwegian, 80 percent of the cost for each of its seven ships on order will be funded through export credit arrangements. The remaining portion will be filled through capital expenditure by the time of the ship’s delivery dates. Royal Caribbean had approximately $7.6 billion of committed financing for ships on order as of the end of 2022.“Our liquidity remains strong, and we are focused on expanding our margins to further enhance EBITDA [earnings before interests, tax, depreciation and amoritization] and free cash flow,” said chief financial officer Naftali Holtz.Holtz hopes to return Royal Caribbean’s balance back to investment grade. “During the fourth quarter, we repaid $600 million of debt maturities and closed on the refinancing of 2 billion of secured and guaranteed debt previously due June 2023.” Holtz adds that $2.3 billion of its existing revolving credit facility has been extended to April 2025. The company closed on a $700 million refinancing deal earlier in February with RCI Holdings to repay principal payments on debt maturing between 2023 and 2024.After seeing better-than-expected results in 2022, Royal Caribbean is focused on improving guest repeat rates and improving margins to enhance cash flows and create more discretionary capital.Unlike Norwegian and Royal Caribbean, Carnival is scaling back on its fleet expansion plans, which is a drastic change from when it was building multiple ships on an annual basis pre-pandemic.“We have just four ships on order through 2025, plus our second incredible Seabourn luxury expedition ship to be delivered in 2023,” said Josh Weinstein, Carnival Corporation president and CEO in the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call. “This is our lowest order book in decades. We don’t expect any new ships in 2026 and anticipate just one or two new builds each year for several years thereafter.”A so-called fleet optimization plan will be prioritized instead, which involves removing smaller, less efficient ships and improving ship operating cost per ALBD [available lower berth day, a standard metric of passenger capacity]. Carnival is also going with a leaner capital expenditure profile to boost efforts for deleveraging, strengthening its balance sheet and achieving better credit ratings. In support of these objectives, a new $2.1 billion multi-currency revolver was also announced to be replacing existing arrangements starting in August 2024.While the cruise line does not have any constructions of its own in the pipeline, Carnival is in a joint venture with China to launch Adora Cruises, which will be the first large Chinese-built cruise ship. The ship’s planning to sail the Maritime Silk Road, which connects the Chinese mainland with Southeast Asia, India, Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula and the Mediterranean, at the end of 2023.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

MCK.5 Smart Beta Dividend Stocks to Buy Now for Steady GainsThe prospect of higher interest rates for longer than anticipated and rising bond yields have diminished the appeal for dividend stocks. Yet, applying some smart beta strategies to the dividend investing world could fetch higher returns.This is because the strategy helps to capture market inefficiencies in a transparent way by adding extra metrics like volatility, revenues, earnings, momentum and other fundamental factors to the market cap or rules-based indices. And nothing seems better than picking the dividend growth strategy.We have selected five dividend growth stocks — The Hershey Company, ParkerHannifin Corp., The Interpublic Group of Companies, Microchip Technology Inc. and McKesson Corp. — that could be solid choices for your portfolio.Why Dividend Growth Strategy?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.Story continuesHere are five of the 24 stocks that fit the bill:Pennsylvania-based Hershey is the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America as well as a global leader in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Microchip Technology has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Monolithic Power has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that MCHP is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.MCHP currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.48, while MPWR has a forward P/E of 36.69. We also note that MCHP has a PEG ratio of 0.80. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. MPWR currently has a PEG ratio of 1.47.Another notable valuation metric for MCHP is its P/B ratio of 7.01. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, MPWR has a P/B of 13.69.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to MCHP's Value grade of B and MPWR's Value grade of C.MCHP has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than MPWR, so it seems like value investors will conclude that MCHP is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&amp;P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&amp;P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 24.Here are five of the 24 stocks that fit the bill:Pennsylvania-based Hershey is the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America as well as a global leader in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery.

They are more rampant in the oil-rich Niger Delta region, where most of the nation's oil facilities are located.The workers at such facilities rarely adhere to safety standards, leading to frequent fires, including one in Imo state last year in which more than 100 people were killed.Nigeria lost at least $3 billion worth of crude oil to theft between January 2021 and February 2022. Shady business operators often avoid regulators by setting up refineries in remote areas such as the one in Imo, the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) said last year.——Associated Press journalist Hilary Uguru in Warri, Nigeria, contributed.]"

High inflation leads to an economic slowdown and, consequently, lower demand for oil and oil products.Meanwhile, a signal from the Fed that it may stop raising interest rates, at least for a while, later this year, added upward pressure to prices.In supply news, OPEC’s total output rose last month as Nigeria ramped up production to the highest in a year, at 1.44 million. This contributed to a total 120,000 bpd increase in total OPEC output in February. The increase more than offset a decline of 49,000 bpd booked for January.China, then, remains the single biggest bullish factor for oil prices, with expectations that the country will see strong economic growth this year. The country’s GDP is forecast to expand by more than 5% year-on-year, which would undoubtedly boost demand for oil significantly.Yet concern about inflation in other parts of the world, notably the EU and the United States, remains substantial and acts as a cap on prices.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:SpaceX Is Leading The Private Space RaceHow Recycling Could Solve The Battery Metals ShortageThese Countries Have The Lowest Inflation In The WorldRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

Despite recent reforms and rising investment, the Andean country’s hydrocarbon sector is struggling to recover from the corruption and malfeasance which occurred during Rafael Correa’s administration. A combination of poorly constructed and corroded infrastructure, natural disasters and frequent civil unrest are causing numerous production outages that are weighing on the economy and fragile government finances. Violent protests have rocked the small South American country of 18 million with worrying frequency over the last eight years. The civil disturbances, sparked by fuel price hikes and a spiraling cost of living, along with environmental incidents in Ecuador’s Amazon are impacting oil industry operations and causing production outages.A landslide in the Amazonian province of Napo, which caused the Marker River Bridge to collapse, forced the shuttering of Ecuador’s two principal oil pipelines five days ago. That saw the state controlled Petroecuador owned 360,000 barrel per day SOTE pipeline and the 450,000 barrel per day privately owned OCP pipeline taken offline as a preventive measure despite neither pipeline being ruptured. With both pipelines shuttered there is no means of transporting the crude oil extracted in Ecuador’s Amazon, where much of the Andean country’s oil production occurs, to the Pacific coast.For this reason, national oil company Petroecuador was compelled to shutter wells and declare force majeure. According to Ecuador’s Energy Ministry, production will be offline for up to three weeks dealing yet another blow to rightwing President Guillermo Lasso’s plans to substantially boost oil output. During 2022, Ecuador pumped an average of 480,299 barrels per day, which while 1.6% higher than a year earlier was still significantly less than pre-pandemic production of 531,000 barrels daily during 2019. This is the second time in less than a year that Petroecuador was obliged to declare force majeure. Energy Ministry data shows by February 26, 2023 (Spanish) Ecuador’s oil production had fallen to 243,678 barrels half the daily average of 489,000 barrels per day pumped for January 2023.Story continuesRelated: Russia Is Intent On Defending Its Oil Market Share In IndiaPetroecuador was previously compelled to declare force majeure during June 2022 as violent protests swept across the impoverished Andean country and protestors stormed oilfields in the oil-rich Amazon. This was responsible for Ecuador’s 2022 oil production being lower than it had been before the pandemic and failing to reach the official annual planned government target. These events are hindering Lasso’s plans to boost Ecuador’s oil production. On taking office during May 2021 the president planned to more than double output to one million barrels per day by the time his term ended in 2025 but because of prevailing headwinds that target has been revised downward to 750,000 barrels per day. There are signs that even the reduced production target is unachievable with production outages remaining as an ongoing problem.Since the completion of the Coca Codo Sinclair Dam on the Coca River in Napo province by the Sinohydro corporation during November 2016 erosion, landslides and flooding have become persistent problems. In the past, those events have led to the SOTE and OCP pipelines rupturing and spilling crude oil into the surrounding environment including the Coca River which flows into the Napo, a tributary of the Amazon River. One of Ecuador’s worst oil spills occurred in April 2020 when landslides ruptured both pipelines seeing an estimated 15,000 barrels of crude flow into the Coca River. That spill affected over 300 miles of river, with petroleum even flowing into the Napo, and local potable water supplies. There were many complaints by local indigenous communities that the spill was not adequately cleaned-up leaving tainted drinking water and a seriously damaged local environment. Another 6,000-barrel spill from the OCP pipeline occurred during January 2022 when it was ruptured by falling rocks. The spill flowed into the Coca and Napo rivers and affected over five acres of the ecologically important Cayambe-Coca national park.The shuttering of the SOTE and OCP pipelines was undertaken to ensure that if the pipelines are ruptured by landslides there will not be another environmentally damaging spill. Devastating erosion appeared along the banks of the Coca River and in the Cayambe-Coca reserve after the Coca Codo Sinclair Hydroelectric plant commenced operating during late-2016. In fact, during 2020 the erosion caused the 492 feet, or 150-meter, high San Rafael waterfall which had existed for thousands of years situated on the Coca River to collapse. This was Ecuador’s tallest waterfall and a major environmental attraction. According to scientists the Coca River is once again suffering from regressive erosion which will eventually alter its course. Increased erosion is attributed by some scientists to the hydroelectric plant’s diversion reservoir which removes sediment from the river water depriving downstream waters of their natural sediment load. That is creating an effect called “hungry waters” where the river water’s erosive capacity increases, seeing its waters aggressively erode the riverbed and banks, as they seek to recover the normal sediment load.Even before the construction of the hydro-plant it was recognized that the SOTE and OCP pipelines pass through highly geological unstable territory which was already increasing the risk of ruptures, oil spills and outages. It is for these reasons that the SOTE and OCP pipelines must be rerouted if the risk of ruptures, related oil spills and outages due to landslides and other erosion related events are to be reduced. This is essential if Ecuador is not only to sustain petroleum production without interruption but for growing output to the desired volume of 750,000 barrels per day. The latest outage, which is expected to last up to three weeks will significantly impact production volumes. This will further effect Ecuador’s oil dependent economy where petroleum is responsible for 58% of exports by value and around 4% of gross domestic production. Any substantial lengthy decline in production will also have a negative effect on Quito’s revenue, placing pressure on an already fiscally fragile economy.By Matthew Smith for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Russia Is Intent On Defending Its Oil Market Share In IndiaOil Trade Is Moving Away From EuropeSmall Nuclear Reactors Get Boost As Western Cities Vote ‘Yes’Read this article on OilPrice.com]"

While the U.S. and many Western governments continue to call on oil firms to pump more, executives at top oil firms say they have a duty to their shareholders to maximize returns for staying invested in an industry which faces an uncertain long-term future.This year's presenters also reflect ongoing clashes over supply and demand between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Europe and the U.S. that have led to some visible vacancies.Instead, Shell's newly-appointed Chief Executive Wael Sawan will join BP's Bernard Looney, Exxon Mobil Corp's Darren Woods, Chevron's Michael Wirth and TotalEnergies' Patrick Pouyanne in prominent roles.""We will get a sense of how companies' strategies have been changed by the events of the last year,"" said Dan Yergin, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author and vice chairman of conference organizer S&amp;P Global, in an interview.Story continuesBP's Looney will share the stage with Hertz car-rental CEO Stephen Scherr, whose firm has become an energy transition champion with plans to buy tens of thousands of electric vehicles from General Motors , Polestar and Tesla .""The industry is on board with the energy transition, ESG and decarbonization, but there is a recognition that we are going to need hydrocarbons from an energy reliability and security standpoint,"" Pat Jelinek, EY Americas oil and gas leader, said of the return to prominence of Big Oil executives.WHERE'S OPEC AND SHALE?Speakers include oil ministers from Africa and Asia, where balancing energy security and the threat of climate change are paramount. There are no officials from Russia, which in the past has sent its energy minister, and much fewer OPEC participants.Noticeably absent from the agenda are oil ministers from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. OPEC's output cut of 2 million barrels per day (bpd) last November led to a bitter row with the U.S., as President Joe Biden was fighting mid-term elections and high gasoline prices - issues that nearly cost him a majority in both houses.Top shale executives also will get less of the limelight. U.S. shale also battled with the Biden administration over oil drilling restrictions and a lower investment in new output. Shale has become less of a factor in global markets, and tensions between OPEC and shale are less intense than they used to be.Executives from shale bigs Hess Corp, EQT Corp and Pioneer Natural Resources last year dined with the late OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo. Barkindo received a gift bottle of ""Genuine Barnett Shale,"" the oilfield that launched the shale revolution.U.S. shale also has been overshadowed by Big Oil as the companies grapple with slower gains and tight-fisted investors. Total U.S. oil production is forecast to rise modestly this year - less than 600,000 bpd - compared with a jump of about 2 million-bpd in 2018.“U.S. exploration and production companies have moderated growth,"" said Andy Hendricks, CEO of U.S. driller Patterson-UTI, leaving OPEC ""in charge of oil prices.""ENERGY INNOVATIONWhile geopolitical strife continues elsewhere, next week's get-together will feature technological innovation in oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) alongside, electric power, hydrogen and carbon capture.""There's never been such a focus on innovation of technologies across the energy industries,"" said S&amp;P's Yergin.Some 225 start-ups will participate, a 60% increase from a last year, many of which got a shot in the arm from Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which provides tax credits and incentives for low-carbon and clean energy technology.U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and White House clean energy advisor John Podesta will lay out implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act, said S&amp;P Global's Yergin.""The amount of renewables that we're going to have to build over the next decade is enormous, and I don't think everybody has really digested the scope of that,"" said Andres Gluski, CEO of energy and utility giant AES Corp.(Reporting by Liz Hampton in DenverEditing by Marguerita Choy)]"

On one hand, there is a growing demand for renewable energy sources, which are rapidly becoming more affordable and accessible. On the other hand, oil and gas will continue to play a crucial role in meeting global energy needs for years to come.Investing in oil and gas transition assets that can help bridge the gap between traditional fossil fuels and renewable energy sources is an essential step toward achieving net-zero emissions. In this article, we will explore what these transition assets are, why they matter, and how investors can get involved.What are Oil and Gas Transition Assets?Oil and gas transition assets refer to investments in technologies or infrastructure that can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels. These include:Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies: Carbon capture and storage involves capturing carbon dioxide emissions from industrial processes or power plants before they are released into the atmosphere. The captured CO2 can then be used for enhanced oil recovery or stored underground.Renewable natural gas (RNG): Renewable natural gas is produced by capturing methane emissions from landfills, wastewater treatment plants, or agricultural waste. It can be used as a low-carbon fuel source for transportation or heating.Green Hydrogen: The production of green hydrogen involves the process of electrolysis, which utilizes electricity generated from renewable sources like solar or wind power to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.Energy efficiency: Investments in energy-efficient technologies or practices can help reduce the amount of energy needed to produce or consume oil and gas.By investing in these transition assets, companies can reduce their carbon footprint while continuing to meet global energy needs.Why Invest in Oil and Gas Transition Assets?There are several reasons why investors should consider investing in oil and gas transition assets:Story continues1. DiversificationInvesting in transition assets allows investors to diversify their portfolios beyond traditional fossil fuels. This can help mitigate risks associated with fluctuations in commodity prices or regulatory changes.2. Long-term growth potentialTransition assets have significant long-term growth potential as demand for low-carbon solutions continues to increase. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), investments in CCS alone could reach $160 billion per year by 2040.3. ESG considerationsInvesting in transition assets aligns with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations. As investors increasingly prioritize ESG factors when making investment decisions, companies that demonstrate a commitment to reducing their carbon footprint may be more attractive investment opportunities.4. Regulatory complianceAs governments around the world implement policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, companies that invest in transition assets may be better positioned to comply with new regulations.How Can Investors Get Involved?There are several ways investors can get involved in investing in oil and gas transition assets:1. Direct investmentsInvestors can make direct investments in companies that develop or operate CCS facilities, RNG production facilities, hydrogen production facilities or other types of transition infrastructure.2. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)ETFs provide exposure to a diversified portfolio of companies involved in developing or operating various types of transition infrastructure.3. Private equity fundsPrivate equity funds provide access to private market investments focused on developing new technologies or infrastructure related to transitioning away from fossil fuels.ConclusionInvesting in oil and gas transition assets on the road to net zero is an essential step toward achieving global climate goals while meeting growing energy demands. By investing directly into companies developing these technologies or through ETFs/private equity funds focused on this area of energy transition investment opportunity - investors have an opportunity not only to diversify their portfolios but also contribute positively towards ESG considerations such as environmental sustainability whilst generating long-term growth potential returns on investment.By Michael Kern for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:These Countries Have The Lowest Inflation In The WorldGreen Hydrogen Will Play A Critical Role In A Net-Zero FutureNatural Gas Flaring Alternatives: Innovative Solutions For A Greener FutureRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

63,6f128717-483f-3ef2-9d8d-413fe5862340,OMC,2023-03-03,5 Top High-Yield Stocks to Sail Through a Choppy March,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-top-high-yield-stocks-130301470.html,1677762181,STORY,"['PRU', 'NI', 'OMC', '^GSPC', 'REG', 'NJR', 'NIMC']","[Traditionally, the broader stock market performed well in March. For instance, the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.5%, on average, in March since 1928. However, the stock market is off to a discouraging start this March, with the S&amp;P 500 closing the month’s first day of trading in the red. This came after the stock market already delivered a lackluster performance in February following strong January gains.Wall Street, predominantly, was spooked by hotter-than-estimated inflation data at the beginning of 2023, which had led to more interest rate hike expectations. In the latter half of 2022, inflation started to gradually ease. But the consumer price index (CPI) advanced 0.5% in January and posted an annual gain of 6.4%, topping expectations of an increase of 0.4% and 6.2%, respectively, added the Labor Department.The producer price index (PPI) also rose by 0.7% in January and increased 6% year over year, exceeding analysts’ estimates of an increase of 0.2% and 5.6%, correspondingly, per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation index too remained stubbornly elevated, and its readings were more than anticipated.Now, with inflation increasing at a faster-than-predicted rate, it’s highly likely that the Fed would continue hiking interest rates to quell persistent inflationary pressure. The Fed may have reduced the size of interest rate hikes from 75 basis points to 50 basis points and now 25 basis points, but the minutes from the central bank’s latest meeting showed that most of the officials remain hell-bent on more interest rate increases to curb inflation.Regrettably, such a hawkish environment doesn’t bode well for the stock market. After all, rate hikes curb consumer outlays, push borrowing costs higher, and deter economic growth. Lest we forget, the labor market remains healthy, leading to upward pressure on prices, and chances of more rate hikes soon. The economy had added almost three times the jobs expected in January, and the unemployment rate at present is at its lowest level in more than 50 years.Story continuesMeanwhile, consumer confidence in the health of the economy dipped for the second successive month in February, which hurt the stock market as well. No doubt, high inflation, along with the looming fears of recession, dented consumers’ sentiment. The Consumer Confidence Index of the Conference Board declined to 102.9 in February from January’s reading of 106.Given such a gloomy scenario, the stock market is undoubtedly expected to remain volatile all through March and beyond.

64,f48d7181-6e46-345a-b8bb-5f44c6c14653,FE,2023-03-03,Householder's claims questioned as corruption testimony ends,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/householders-claims-questioned-corruption-testimony-223822723.html,1677796702,STORY,['FE'],"[CINCINNATI (AP) — Government prosecutors used former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder 's own speeches, photographs and conversations against him on Thursday, as they sought to unravel the Republican's denials of key elements of the secretly funded $60 million racketeering scheme that they allege he carried out on behalf of Akron-based FirstEnergy Corp.Both Householder and co-defendant Matt Borges rested their cases in the pair's corruption trial in U.S. District Court, as did the government, which sends the state’s largest ever corruption trial into its final phase. Closing statements are scheduled to begin Tuesday.On Householder's second day on the stand, Assistant U.S. Attorney Emily Glatfelter questioned the timeline Householder provided on Wednesday of his January 2017 visit to Washington, D.C., for former President Donald Trump's inauguration. She also pushed back against his claims that he never saw early drafts of the legislation that bailed out two FirstEnergy Solutions nuclear plants nor ever got involved in planning attack ads funded by dark money that helped him secure reelection to the House in 2018.Householder, 63, and Borges, 50, a lobbyist and former Ohio Republican Party chair, have been charged with conspiracy to participate in a racketeering enterprise involving bribery and money laundering. Federal prosecutors allege Householder controlled a scheme, secretly funded by FirstEnergy, to elect allies, win the speakership, pass a $1 billion nuclear plant bailout and run a dirty tricks campaign to foil a referendum effort. Borges is accused of offering a bribe for inside information on that campaign. Both have pleaded not guilty and maintain their innocence. Each faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.After appearing relaxed and confident on his first day of testimony, Householder grew testy and argumentative at times Thursday. U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Black scolded him loudly at one point to stop responding to questions with questions. Householder apologized, though he had to be repeatedly reminded.Story continuesAfter presenting jurors in the trial’s fifth week with photographic metadata, documents obtained through search warrants and taped phone calls that contradicted certain details of Householder’s denials, Glatfelter all but accused Householder of lying.Glatfelter walked Householder through one of his required financial disclosure filings, on which he left off many items made public throughout the government's investigation. Those included the name of one of his businesses; tickets worth as much as $2,500 each to a World Series game in Cleveland that he attended with his wife and where he met up with then-FirstEnergy CEO Chuck Jones in his corporate box; large debts on two credit cards; and a languishing unpaid lien.Householder initially testified that he never reviewed the form, until Glatfelter reminded him that his e-signature amounted to a legal promise that it had been “prepared and carefully reviewed"" by him — “just like today, the oath you're under.”On further questioning, Householder said an attorney had advised him that the items she listed were not required to be listed, standing by the form as accurate, legal and thorough.Jurors also heard taped phone calls in which Householder and his late co-defendant, Statehouse superlobbyist Neil Clark, plotted a nasty attack ad and contemplated revenge against two lawmakers who had angered Householder in expletive-laced fashion. “We like war, you know that, Neil,” Householder is heard saying. He asks Clark whether a “movement” should be made against the two legislators, ""Just to sit there and say, ‘If you f—- with me, I’m gonna f—- with your kids.'”Householder persisted to testify that he never retaliated against those who voted counter to his wishes or donated to his rivals. He also told jurors that there was nothing unusual about him deleting off his cellphone the call record between him and Republican Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, who had part of the responsibility of deciding whether the referendum against the energy legislation, known as House Bill 6, made the statewide ballot.“I generally delete as much as I can off my phone, because I don’t like to pay storage costs,” Householder said.A key focus of the day was whether Householder had attended a dinner at the swanky Charlie Palmer's Steakhouse in Washington, at which the government alleges a dark money group accused in the scandal, Generation Now, was hatched during Trump's inaugural weekend. Householder and his son Luke traveled to and from the event on a FirstEnergy plane. Generation Now was charged in the scheme and has pleaded guilty.Householder insisted on the stand that he never attended the dinner and did not see Jones, who was supposed to be in attendance, on that day.FBI Agent Blane Wetzel, who has led the Householder investigation, took the stand after those statements. He described a photograph from Householder associate Jeff Longstreth's phone from that evening, in which Luke Householder and the knee of what looks like the same pants Larry Householder was wearing earlier that day are pictured in a group of men that includes then-FirstEnergy Vice President Michael Dowling.He said it was taken just after 10:30 p.m. the night of the dinner. The metadata located the photo just alongside Charlie Palmer's.The day was interrupted briefly by a spectator's medical emergency. As 911 was called and the jury was briefly dismissed, the defendants and their attorneys worked together to move chairs and a coat rack out of the way for emergency responders and Wetzel, who had been in the middle of testifying, rushed to the person's aid. She walked out on her own and Black assured the jury she was being taken care of and would be fine.]"

After releasing its most recent earnings report, the company abruptly announced it was shuttering its mergers and acquisitions committee and focusing greater attention on profitability going forward. “We're going to have to slow down and mitigate what we've been doing with M&amp;A, and so we disbanded our M&amp;A committee to do that. We created a new Business Transformation Committee to focus on profitability” Benioff said.Tapping the breaks on big bucks acquisitions deals, and to drive profitability in the companies already part of Salesforce, were among the objectives of activist investors. Benioff told Yahoo Finance that some of its biggest acquisitions were key to boosting Salesforce’s bottom line: “We've done some great acquisitions here with MuleSoft and Tableau, both who had great quarters in the fourth quarter.” Salesforce’s recent acquisition spree has been critical to the company’s growth. It bought MuleSoft for $6.5B in 2018, Tableau for $15.7B in 2019, and then Salesforce’s biggest deal ever, Slack, for $27.7B in 2021.Video TranscriptMARC BENIOFF: Well, we've done some great acquisitions here in MuleSoft and Tableau, both who had great quarters in the fourth quarter. Slack, which I know you use at Yahoo very aggressively-- it's a great product. By the way, it'll be a huge part of the AI future because Slack, for so many of our customers, is a critical data set for their AI future, as well as a user interface into AI. Like, a lot of these new AI startups that are emerging in the Bay Area, they're all Slack-first companies, and they use Slack as the primary interface to their AI system. So that's something that we're going to definitely be demonstrating.And when we walk in, we don't have to do the development work for the AI to Slack. It's already done because that's how they've kind of built their whole company. But this is really where the world is moving to. We're having a new kind of world, and our acquisitions have set us up very well for that world. At the same time, for us to deliver these much higher levels of profitability and performance that we're committed to, new levels of prioritization of our core organic products like data cloud, Brian, that's going to mean that we're going to have to slow down and mitigate what we've been doing with M&amp;A.Story continuesAnd so we disbanded our M&amp;A committee to do that. We created a new business transformation committee to focus on profitability. And hey, well, you can see it in the results this quarter-- 29.2% operating margin. We delivered $8.4 billion in revenue, Brian. How many software companies have you reported on that have ever delivered a quarter quite like that?BRIAN SOZZI: Fair point, Marc. So is the big-- is the day of the big acquisition in Salesforce done for the next 24 months?MARC BENIOFF: Well, I certainly think so. I mean, it's impossible to predict the future. You know that. But what I really can say is we're really focused on our profitability, our core performance, these financial metrics. That's why we delivered a great fourth quarter. That's why we're going to deliver a great fiscal year '24. We're now estimating that we're going to deliver almost $35 billion in revenue this year, with 27% operating margin. This is what Salesforce is really focused on today, while also, we just hit an absolute record low in customer attrition because our customer success has never been higher. So all of these things are working together, and they're working very well for us here.]"

Benioff said he welcomed the new board members and said they’ll be great for the company and its shareholders. “We have three great new board members, and that's five new board members in the last 16 months. Incredible” Benioff said. The three new boardroom hires at Salesforce are Sachin Mehra, Mastercard’s Chief Financial Officer; Mason Morfit, ValueAct Capital’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer; and Arnold Donald, the former President and Chief Executive Officer of Carnival Corporation. Benioff had particular praise for Donald: “probably one of my favorite CEOs of all time, one of the top CEOs in the world” he told Yahoo Finance. Benioff however, did not mention the more aggressive activists targeting Salesforce, specifically Elliott Management or Starboard Value. Benioff spoke to Yahoo Finance after the company reported better-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter. Some analysts mused that the blowout results could also help Benioff outflank the activists currently circling his company.Video TranscriptMARC BENIOFF: Well, we've had some great experiences with our board. We've had two board members that we're sadly having to say goodbye to. They've been with us for 20 years. Sandy Robertson and Alan Hassenfeld-- incredible executives who've really guided the last two decades of our performance.And we're saying hello to three great new executives. I mean, one of them has been part of our ecosystem. You might have seen him at Dreamforce when you were there, Brian. Mason Morfit, the CEO of ValueAct Capital. He was not just at Dreamforce and has met with our customers and spent time with all of our executives and employees, but built these incredible decks, showing us new levels of performance that we could get in a distribution strategy and pricing. He was on the board of Microsoft. So he has incredible wisdom from that and from running ValueAct as the CEO.Story continuesSo we said, what, Mason, you should really be on our board. You're really adding value like we've never seen from an outsider. His founder, Jeff Ubben, also was someone who was there at Dreamforce with us. He's an old friend of mine for many years. Incredibly wise and enlightened person as well. And we were like, wow, Mason, come in and help us.And then Sachin Mehra, this-- Mastercard is a great customer of ours. The chief financial officer, he has an incredible financial engineering expertise. We've asked him to join our board. And probably one of my favorite CEOs of all time, one of the top CEOs in the world, Arnold Donald is also joining our board. So we've got-- we have three great new board members. And that's five new board members in the last 16 months. Incredible.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, I've gotten to know Arnold Donald through the years. He's been very informative--MARC BENIOFF: Just great person, isn't it? Just great person.BRIAN SOZZI: Yes. Let me ask you this, Marc. I've been doing this for a while. I know I may appear young, but I have been doing this for a while. I've never seen--MARC BENIOFF: You don't appear that young, Brian.BRIAN SOZZI: Thanks so much. I appreciate it. Thank you so much for the raw honesty. The active situation, I have never seen anything like this. What-- is there a resolution in sight? How does this all end, and how do you move beyond it?MARC BENIOFF: Well, look, I can really learn from anyone. And I enjoy meeting new people, and I enjoy talking to folks. And look, there's lots of different levels of understanding of enterprise software. There's different understandings of our company, who our customers are. But it doesn't matter what grade all these folks are at. I'm trying to ingest and learn and understand their perspectives.I think it's extremely important that I have a beginner's mind. You know I like to practice the Japanese concept of shoshin. How do I have a beginner's mind? In the expert's mind, Brian, there's no possibilities. The beginner's mind, there's every possibility, and that is really my approach with everything that has been going on with Salesforce. And it's been great.And then out of that, wow, I was just really blown away with Mason Morfit and how he was able to just grok what we're doing in Salesforce, but then deliver these, like I said, these decks, which outlined what we thought was just strategic directions for a company that really showed his expertise. And that's why we've added him onto our board.]"

The broad market traded lower throughout the month, and the S&amp;P was down -5%. Tech and the riskier sectors in the market led the way lower, just as they had led it higher.Some technology stocks were still able to outperform the market over this period though. With the assistance of Zacks Rank, I have identified 3 highly ranked stocks for investors to consider buying.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research SalesforceSalesforce CRM announced its Q4 and FY earnings after the market closed on Wednesday. Investors are very happy with the results and as of Thursday midday, the stock was up 12% on the day. Salesforce is the leader in cloud-based, enterprise business relationship software.Q4 sales for CRM came in at $8.4 billion beating estimates of $7.9 billion and adjusted earnings of $1.68 per share smashed expectations of $1.36 per share. Management also provided very strong guidance with Q1 and FY23 sales and earnings above analysts' expectations. CRM also guided higher on operating margins which it expects to reach 30% by 2023 and increased its stock buy-back program.These results didn’t come easily. Salesforce laid off 8,000 people or 10% of its employees over the last few months. After becoming a target for activist investors like Elliot Management and Starboard Value, CRM has made profitability its new priority and shareholders seem to be happy about it. This looks like the early stages of a turnaround as CRM stock has underperformed the market over the last 3 years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEven before the strong earnings announcement CRM held a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), indicating improving earnings expectations. Analysts had been somewhat mixed on earnings expectations, but leaned towards higher, and clearly, they were correct as Salesforce beat even the highest expectations.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFollowing this report CRM has a one-year forward earnings multiple of 28x, well below its median of 63x. It is still a premium valuation, but these new business fundamentals are very promising. Furthermore, at least one of the activist investors, Elliot Management, has signaled it intends to continue to work with CRM management, indicating even more upside in Salesforce stock.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAirbnbAirbnb ABNB, the vacation home rental platform, has thus far been one of the strongest performing stocks in the market up 42% YTD. This impressive performance comes after a -62% correction from its 2021 all-time high.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewThings are looking up for ABNB though, and the stock currently boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating a positive trend in earnings revisions. Airbnb seems to be another tech stock that will be prioritizing profits over growth. Earnings estimates for the current quarter have flipped from negative to positive over the last 60 days.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnalysts are expecting sales growth from ABNB as well. Current quarter sales are expected to grow 19% YoY to $1.8 billion, and current year sales are expected to grow 15% YoY to $9.6 billion. These are strong numbers, but they still mark a considerable deceleration against 40% annual sales growth in FY22, and FY21’s 77%.Premium companies come with premium valuations and ABNB is no exception. Trading at 36x one-year forward earnings, ABNB is below its 3-year median of 38x. It is worth noting that its short history, and extreme swings in valuation make it a harder to pin an accurate historical valuation. Airbnb’s forward earnings ratio has swung from 561x to -761x since IPO.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineAfter getting wrecked in 2022 it seems technology may be having a comeback. It is very important to note that high multiple technology and growth stocks are very sensitive to changes in interest rates. Of course, front and center in this market is the Federal Reserve interest rate policy. Any major shifts in interest rates, or rhetoric from the Fed can rapidly change the direction of these stocks. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

What, is there a resolution in sight? How does this all end, and how do you move beyond it?MARC BENIOFF: Well, look, I can really learn from anyone and I enjoy meeting new people and I enjoy talking to folks and look, there's lots of different levels of understanding of enterprise software. There's different understandings of our company, who our customers are. But it doesn't matter what grade all these folks are at. I'm trying to ingest and learn and understand their perspectives.I think it's extremely important that I have a beginner's mind. You know I like to practice the Japanese concept of Shoshin. How do I have a beginner's mind? In the expert's mind, Brian, there's no possibilities. The beginner's mind, there's every possibility. And that is really my approach with everything that has been going on with Salesforce, and it's been great.And then out of that, wow! I was just really blown away with Mason Morfit and how he was able to just grok what we're doing at Salesforce, but then deliver these, like I said, these decks, which outlined what we thought was just strategic directions for our company that really showed his expertise. And that's why we've added him onto our board.BRIAN SOZZI: Marc, you really, you've long been seen as a pioneer in software, but also in the business community. And you're a co-founder of this really large company. How has this been to go through a situation like this?Story continuesMARC BENIOFF: I'm having the time of my life. I mean, this has been 24 years. You've been along the way for a long time, too. You've been to all our events, you've talked to so many of our customers and our employees.And look, this is great. Who would have thought 24 years ago when I was a few blocks away from here at the top of Telegraph Hill in an apartment overlooking Mount Diablo before it had all this gorgeous snow covering that it has today, I would say, we could never have imagined that we would have delivered one of the very largest and important software companies in the world. I'm very grateful to everyone who's been part of this journey. And I couldn't be happier with where we are today and where we're going.DAVE BRIGGS: Outstanding interview. All right, joining us now to discuss the growing influence of activists is Constellation Research Principal Analyst and Founder, Ray Wang. Ray, good to see you, sir. I love that show Shoshin, the beginner's mind stuff, but is Mr. Benioff really grateful and thankful for all the input of these activist investors? Because that's what I'm hearing there.RAY WANG: You know what? Marc is a great individual and leader in terms of being able to take different perspectives. I think he's making the best of what's going on out there. In the case of that investor, I think they did provide some good value there. But a lot of these investors are what we call, vulture investor firms, and they don't add value. And they're really, they're just designed to actually arbitrage the stock price.And that's when it becomes dangerous. That usually happens, it makes sense when you have a stock or a company that's in decline, they're no longer in growth mode. Salesforce is not one of those companies. In fact, Salesforce is a company that is in growth mode, and that's what made this attack seem very unusual.SEANA SMITH: So Ray, why do you think sometimes they do more harm than good, and the risk there of leaving potentially the company more damage than it was before these activist investors got involved?RAY WANG: Well, I'll take an example right now. I mean, in Salesforce, they disbanded the M&amp;A committee, right. And they're going to put $20 billion back in stock buybacks. Now granted, that Salesforce has gotten to a point where they are one of the top, if not only the number one enterprise software company in the world, but they can still make additional acquisitions. They can use that funding and acquisitions to help them in terms of improving and taking themselves to the next level.You looked at companies that haven't done that in the future and they can't make those types of acquisitions. Returning money back to shareholders is the worst thing you can do if you're trying to grow your company. And if especially you're a founder-led company, like Marc's, that's one of the things where you try to avoid. But there are things that also need some structure, like cost are out of control, sales, marketing expenses are probably on the high end. And that's where PE firms and vulture capitalist come into play.DAVE BRIGGS: You don't seem to have the same reaction as investors do. The stock up more than 11%, almost 12% on the day. You don't seem to be as embracing of those results as investors. Why?RAY WANG: Well, they blew their sales numbers out of the water, right. And they were probably going to do that anyways. And so being able to actually come in at those, at the rate that they came in, I mean, people knew that they had a good quarter. They didn't know how good of a quarter.The activist cloud actually was what was driving down the stock price. They are still down from their highs, right, but we have a price target of them in the 200 range, right. But we expected that. But the activist cloud was really what was clouding the message.SEANA SMITH: Right. When you take a look at these activist activity and numbers here, 36% jump in 2022 compared to 2021. There was 235 activist campaigns here. Technology, the tech sector was the most frequently targeted sector. What do you make of that trend, the opportunistic I guess, thinking here amongst activist investors when it comes to tech? And do you think that trend is going to continue this year?RAY WANG: I think it's going to continue. You follow the capital flows and you look at the amount of money that PE firms, like Thoma Bravo have raised, right, and Vista Equity have in their funds. There has to be an exit somewhere, and there has to be a beginning somewhere, and there's someone always at the end of the deal.For the vulture capitalists, there is someone at the end of the deal, and it's been these PE firms that are willing to take a company back when they're actually battered, take them down, fix them, and then say, hey look, instead of focusing on 17 different things, you should focus on seven things and concentrate your activities here.And that's usually what those firms do. They have a playbook, they put that playbook into play. And of course, the companies become profitable, but they no longer are seen as leaders. It is very rare for a company taken over by any of those firms to come back as a leader in their space.Look at Citrix, it's no longer a leader. You look at what's happening in, what happened to Informatica, longer seen as a leader in the space. All these companies are taking hits. SAP got hit by Elliott Management, same kind of challenge. I mean, they don't have the capital, can't put the capital to put into R&amp;D for them to actually come out of the spin that they're in.]"

76,e9922fdb-0984-3703-8968-ed0a79b53781,PCG,2023-03-03,California reactors win exemption in fight to keep running,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/california-reactors-win-exemption-fight-222247312.html,1677795767,STORY,['PCGU'],"[LOS ANGELES (AP) — Government regulators Thursday granted California’s largest utility an unusual exemption that could allow the state's last nuclear power plant to continue running after the expiration of its federal operating licenses, a key piece of a contentious proposal to keep the reactors producing electricity for years to come.The twin-reactor Diablo Canyon plant is scheduled to shut down by 2025. But the federal exemption will permit operator Pacific Gas &amp; Electric to keep producing power while the Nuclear Regulatory Commission reviews an expected application from the utility to extend the plant's operating run by up to two decades.PG&amp;E senior vice president Paula Gerfen praised the decision as an important step for the company “to extend our operations beyond 2025 to improve statewide electric system reliability.”Environmentalists said the NRC staff contorted its own rules in an attempt to keep the aging plant online in what amounted to an ominous sign for plant safety in a region crisscrossed by earthquake faults.“It’s inconsistent with their own rules,” said Diane Curran, an attorney for the anti-nuclear advocacy group Mothers for Peace, which has long sought to shutter the seaside plant located midway between Los Angeles and San Francisco. “It’s scary.”The decision marks the latest development in a long-running fight over the operation and safety of the decades-old plant, which Gov. Gavin Newsom says should keep running beyond 2025 to ward off possible blackouts as the state transitions to solar and other renewable energy sources.The Newsom administration is pushing to expand solar power and other clean energy, as the state aims to cut emissions by 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. Nuclear power doesn’t produce carbon pollution like fossil fuels. But it leaves behind waste that can remain dangerously radioactive for centuries.Diablo Canyon produces 9% of the state’s electricity.Newsom’s decision last year to support a longer operating run for Diablo Canyon shocked environmentalists and anti-nuclear advocates because he had once been a leading voice for closing the plant.Story continuesThe decision by the NRC staff was critical for PG&amp;E's proposal.The company has said it intends to submit an application to extend the plant's life by the end of this year. However, the current operating licenses would likely expire before the NRC's review could be completed, a process that can take two years or more.Typically, if a nuclear plant files for a license extension at least five years before the expiration of the existing license, the existing license remains in effect until the NRC’s application review is complete, even if it technically passes the expiration date. But PG&amp;E would not meet the usual five-year benchmark.One reactor is scheduled to close in November 2024, and its twin in August 2025, and a state analysis predicted it would take federal regulators until late 2026 to act on the application. With the exemption from the NRC staff, the reactors can keep running while the agency conducts the expected review.In documents submitted to the NRC, the company said the exemption “will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety.”Anti-nuclear activists and national environmental groups earlier urged the federal agency to reject the exemption, saying in a petition that it amounted to a dangerous shortcut that would expose the public to safety risks. They argued critical safety reviews for an extended run would likely be incomplete by the time the current licenses technically expire.PG&amp;E initially was part of a complex 2016 agreement with environmentalists and plant worker unions to close the plant by 2025. But the state changed direction last year, and the Democratic governor and the Legislature voided the 2016 pact and opened the way for PG&amp;E to seek a longer operating run.PG&amp;E officials have said they are eager for certainty about the plant’s future because of the difficulty of reversing course on a plant that was headed for permanent retirement, but now needs to prepare for a potentially longer lifespan.The proposal comes at a time when the nuclear power industry foresees future growth. The Biden administration last year launched a $6 billion effort to rescue nuclear power plants at risk of closing, citing the need to continue nuclear energy as a carbon-free source of power that helps to combat climate change.But critics of a longer run for Diablo Canyon have depicted the plan as a huge financial giveaway for PG&amp;E, while warning it would gut state environmental safeguards. Also unknown is how much it will cost to update the plant for a longer lifespan.]"

Even without the Climate Credit, March natural gas bills, on average, would decrease 40% because of a significant drop in the market prices PG&amp;E pays to buy natural gas to serve its customers, and customers using less gas as colder temperatures moderate. The estimated decrease, which is for natural gas usage in March, is based on customers using 38 therms (a unit of energy) compared to 50 therms in February. Depending on billing cycle, customers may not receive statements for March usage until April.PG&amp;E does not control market prices, nor does it mark up the cost of gas and electricity that it purchases on behalf of its customers.""We supported the California Public Utilities Commission's decision to distribute the statewide Climate Credit earlier than previous years, and we're grateful to pass on that savings to our customers. Even with this bill credit, we know that after three months of sustained high natural gas prices, some customers may have difficulty paying their bills, and we're here to help with individualized customer support, including payment plans,"" said Vincent Davis, PG&amp;E Vice President, Customer Operations and Enablement.The average residential non-CARE customer bill for natural gas service in March is projected to be about $37.00, which includes the gas Climate Credit of $52.78. In February, the average residential non-CARE customer bill was about $150.00.Natural gas prices also affect the cost of electricity since many power plants use natural gas to generate electricity. Customers can expect, on average, a 37% decrease in March electric bills. The average residential non-CARE customer bill for electric service in March is projected to be about $91.00, which includes the Climate Credit of $38.39. That's compared to $145.00 in February.Story continuesPG&amp;E Efforts Save Customers Over $1 BillionIn late January, California average daily prices for natural gas were five times higher than the U.S. benchmark, according to the United States Energy Information Administration. The higher market prices between November and January were driven by market forces including increased natural gas demand due to colder than normal temperatures; increased demand for gas-fired electric generation due to less hydroelectric generation and fewer electric imports; lower Pacific regional natural gas storage inventory; and natural gas pipeline delivery constraints.PG&amp;E customer bills could have been even higher during this time. PG&amp;E's team that purchases natural gas on behalf of its customers was able to save customers well over $1 billion through a series of measures. Among these actions: maintaining a diversified natural gas portfolio that includes interstate pipeline access to three natural gas supply basins, using natural gas storage, which was full at the beginning of the winter, and using financial hedging to protect against rising winter prices.In February, market wholesale prices were well below the January average. Customer natural gas rates for the month are generally set based on wholesale prices at the end of the previous month.Customer Support While March bills are expected to drop, some customers still may have difficulty paying bills from the sustained higher prices this winter. PG&amp;E offers individualized solutions and other ways to save:Customers who need more time to pay can extend their due date or make a payment arrangement through their online account at pge.com.PG&amp;E offers many financial assistance programs that can help customers lower their monthly bills.In addition to the statewide Climate Credit, approximately 300,000 customers who experienced financial hardships during the pandemic also received a one-time automatic bill credit under the California Arrearage Payment Program.Customers who participated in the Power Saver Rewards Program last year and reduced energy use on event days may receive a bill credit on their February or March energy statement, depending on billing cycle. The program is providing over $55 million in bill credits to participating PG&amp;E customers. Over the 10 event days in 2022, the average customer bill credit for participating customers was $35.About PG&amp;EPacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&amp;E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), is a combined natural gas and electric utility serving more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California.

Benioff said he welcomed the new board members and said they’ll be great for the company and its shareholders. “We have three great new board members, and that's five new board members in the last 16 months. Incredible” Benioff said. The three new boardroom hires at Salesforce are Sachin Mehra, Mastercard’s Chief Financial Officer; Mason Morfit, ValueAct Capital’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer; and Arnold Donald, the former President and Chief Executive Officer of Carnival Corporation. Benioff had particular praise for Donald: “probably one of my favorite CEOs of all time, one of the top CEOs in the world” he told Yahoo Finance. Benioff however, did not mention the more aggressive activists targeting Salesforce, specifically Elliott Management or Starboard Value. Benioff spoke to Yahoo Finance after the company reported better-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter. Some analysts mused that the blowout results could also help Benioff outflank the activists currently circling his company.Video TranscriptMARC BENIOFF: Well, we've had some great experiences with our board. We've had two board members that we're sadly having to say goodbye to. They've been with us for 20 years. Sandy Robertson and Alan Hassenfeld-- incredible executives who've really guided the last two decades of our performance.And we're saying hello to three great new executives. I mean, one of them has been part of our ecosystem. You might have seen him at Dreamforce when you were there, Brian. Mason Morfit, the CEO of ValueAct Capital. He was not just at Dreamforce and has met with our customers and spent time with all of our executives and employees, but built these incredible decks, showing us new levels of performance that we could get in a distribution strategy and pricing. He was on the board of Microsoft. So he has incredible wisdom from that and from running ValueAct as the CEO.Story continuesSo we said, what, Mason, you should really be on our board. You're really adding value like we've never seen from an outsider. His founder, Jeff Ubben, also was someone who was there at Dreamforce with us. He's an old friend of mine for many years. Incredibly wise and enlightened person as well. And we were like, wow, Mason, come in and help us.And then Sachin Mehra, this-- Mastercard is a great customer of ours. The chief financial officer, he has an incredible financial engineering expertise. We've asked him to join our board. And probably one of my favorite CEOs of all time, one of the top CEOs in the world, Arnold Donald is also joining our board. So we've got-- we have three great new board members. And that's five new board members in the last 16 months. Incredible.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, I've gotten to know Arnold Donald through the years. He's been very informative--MARC BENIOFF: Just great person, isn't it? Just great person.BRIAN SOZZI: Yes. Let me ask you this, Marc. I've been doing this for a while. I know I may appear young, but I have been doing this for a while. I've never seen--MARC BENIOFF: You don't appear that young, Brian.BRIAN SOZZI: Thanks so much. I appreciate it. Thank you so much for the raw honesty. The active situation, I have never seen anything like this. What-- is there a resolution in sight? How does this all end, and how do you move beyond it?MARC BENIOFF: Well, look, I can really learn from anyone. And I enjoy meeting new people, and I enjoy talking to folks. And look, there's lots of different levels of understanding of enterprise software. There's different understandings of our company, who our customers are. But it doesn't matter what grade all these folks are at. I'm trying to ingest and learn and understand their perspectives.I think it's extremely important that I have a beginner's mind. You know I like to practice the Japanese concept of shoshin. How do I have a beginner's mind? In the expert's mind, Brian, there's no possibilities. The beginner's mind, there's every possibility, and that is really my approach with everything that has been going on with Salesforce. And it's been great.And then out of that, wow, I was just really blown away with Mason Morfit and how he was able to just grok what we're doing in Salesforce, but then deliver these, like I said, these decks, which outlined what we thought was just strategic directions for a company that really showed his expertise. And that's why we've added him onto our board.]"

(AP) — Walgreens on Thursday said it won't sell an abortion pill by mail in 20 conservative-led states.The statement comes after attorneys general in 20 states last month warned Walgreens and CVS that they could face legal consequences if they sell abortion pills by mail in those states.Walgreens spokesperson Fraser Engerman confirmed that the company sent a response to each of the attorneys general saying that it will not dispense mifepristone in their states.Nineteen U.S. states have imposed restrictions on abortion pills, but there’s a court battle over whether they have the power to do so in defiance of U.S. Food and Drug Administration policy. A physician and a company that makes the pill mifepristone filed separate lawsuits earlier this year seeking to strike down bans in North Carolina and West Virginia.The FDA for more than 20 years limited dispensing of the drug to a subset of specialty offices and clinics because of safety concerns. But it eased restrictions since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic by eliminating the in-person requirement for the pill and allowing brick-and-mortar pharmacies to dispense it. At least one lawsuit filed by abortion opponents argues that the FDA has overstepped its authority in approving the abortion drugs.Engerman said the company is not currently dispensing mifepristone, although it is working to become eligible through an FDA-mandated certification process. That process requires pharmacies to meet specific standards in shipping, tracking and confidentially storing drug prescribing records.He said the company “will dispense only in those jurisdictions where it is legal to do so if we are certified.”Walgreens' action was first reported by Politico.]"

They said Walgreens intended to become a certified pharmacy and would only dispense in jurisdictions where it was legal to do so.CVS Health Corp, which also received the letter, did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.News website Politico first reported Walgreens' position on Thursday.Medication abortion, which accounts for more than half of U.S. abortions, has drawn increasing attention since the Supreme Court in June overturned a landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that had recognized abortion as a constitutional right nationwide.Mifepristone, used in combination with another drug, misoprostol, is approved for abortion within the first 10 weeks of pregnancy.

Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry, could be a great candidate to consider.When looking at the last two reports, this largest U.S. drugstore chain has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 1.72%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, Walgreens was expected to post earnings of $1.15 per share, but it reported $1.16 per share instead, representing a surprise of 0.87%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.78 per share, while it actually produced $0.80 per share, a surprise of 2.56%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Walgreens lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Walgreens has an Earnings ESP of +3.60% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

CTAS’ top line increased 10.4% and 13.7% year over year in fiscal 2022 and the first six months of fiscal 2023, respectively.The Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment is benefiting from increased volumes and higher prices. Revenues from the unit rose 9.4% and 12% year over year in fiscal 2022 and the first six months of fiscal 2023, respectively. Strength across the first aid cabinet service business is boosting the First Aid and Safety Services segment’s performance. Revenues from the segment climbed 6.1% and 17.2% in fiscal 2022 and the first six months of fiscal 2023, respectively.Cintas is also seeing strong growth across its uniform direct sale (33.9% organic growth in fiscal second quarter) and fire protection services (18% organic growth in fiscal second quarter) businesses.Cintas Corporation Price and ConsensusCintas Corporation Price and ConsensusCintas Corporation price-consensus-chart | Cintas Corporation QuoteCintas’ improved fiscal 2023 outlook raises optimism in the stock. The company now expects revenues of $8.67-$8.75 billion in fiscal 2023 compared with $8.58-$8.67 billion anticipated earlier. Earnings are estimated to be in the range of $12.50-$12.80 per share compared with $12.30 to $12.65 expected earlier. For fiscal 2023, Cintas expects adjusted operating income between $1.75 billion and $1.79 billion ($1.55 billion reported in fiscal 2022).Cintas' focus on enhancement of its product portfolio, along with investments in technology and existing facilities, should continue to drive its performance. Also, its focus on operational execution, cost-control measures and pricing actions is helping it maintain healthy margin performance. For instance, in the fiscal second quarter, gross margin increased 100 basis points to 47%.Cintas’ measures to consistently reward shareholders through dividends and share repurchases are encouraging. In the first six months of fiscal 2023, the company repurchased shares worth $348.68 million and paid dividends of $215.01 million. In fiscal 2022, the company repurchased shares worth $1.53 billion, up from $554.12 million in the year-ago period. Dividend payments totaled $375.12 million in fiscal 2022. Owing to strong performance in fiscal 2022, the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 21.1% to $1.15 per share in July 2022. Cintas has consistently raised its dividend for 39 straight years.On the flip side, Cintas, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has lately been enduring labor shortages and the adverse impacts of high costs and expenses. In the first six months of fiscal 2023, its cost of sales (comprising costs related to uniform rental and facility services as well as others) increased 12.8% year over year to $2.29 billion. High energy expenses are pushing up costs. In fiscal 2022, cost of sales increased 11.1% year over year to $4.22 billion. High labor and purchasing costs drove expenses. Escalating costs and expenses, if not checked, might negatively impact its profitability in the quarters ahead.Given its vast geographical spread, Cintas is exposed to currency translation risks. A stronger U.S. dollar might depress the company's overseas business results in the quarters ahead.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks within the broader Industrial Products sector are as follows:Deere &amp; Company DE currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

After declining 9.1% over the past four weeks, the stock looks well positioned for a trend reversal as it is now in oversold territory and there is strong agreement among Wall Street analysts that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier.How to Determine if a Stock is OversoldWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Why a Trend Reversal is Due for XELThe heavy selling of XEL shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 25.05. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.This technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering XEL in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 0.1% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, XEL currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises.

This ranks a bit higher than the industrial sector’s average yield of 2.36%. Also, the company commands 17 years of consecutive dividend increases, a status it won’t want to give up. Finally, its payout ratio sits at 21.31%, suggesting a dependable and sustainable yield.Story continuesTurning to Wall Street, covering analysts peg R stock as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $100.56, implying over 4% upside potential. While it’s not the most exciting enterprise, it makes for a trustworthy name among dividend stocks to buy.Cummins (CMI)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large textSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comA multinational corporation, Cummins (NYSE:CMI) designs, manufactures, and distributes engines, filtration, and power generation products. Further, the enterprise also services engines and related equipment, including fuel systems, controls, air handling, filtration, emission control, electrical power generation systems, and trucks. It’s a quiet but extremely relevant performer. Over the trailing year, CMI gained a very impressive 20% of equity value.Looking at its passive income, Cummins carries a forward yield of 2.57%. Again, this ranks a bit higher than the industrial sector’s average yield of 2.36%. Right now, the company’s sitting on an enviable track record of 17 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. So close to becoming a Dividend Aristocrat, management will do whatever it takes to keep this trend going. Also, Cummins features a payout ratio of 32.59%. At the moment, covering analysts peg CMI as a consensus hold. However, their average price target pings at $258.13, implying nearly 6% upside potential. Therefore, it’s one of the steady partners among dividend stocks to buy.Huntington Ingalls (HII)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockA defense contractor, Huntington Ingalls (NYSE:HII) is the largest military shipbuilding company in the U.S. Further, its public profile states that Huntington provides professional services to partners in government and industry. Geopolitically, HII has become one of the most relevant dividend stocks to buy. With tensions rising in the Far East, Huntington’s naval warship-building capacity will likely be put to the test. Naturally, this will suit HII stakeholders just fine.Heading over to the passive income component, Huntington carries a forward yield of 2.25%. To be fair, that’s a bit lower than the industrial sector’s average 2.36% yield. However, the company makes up for this with a low payout ratio of just under 30%. In addition, the defense contractor commands 11 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Also, it’s worth noting that HII ranks among the undervalued dividend stocks to buy. Currently, the market prices HII at a forward multiple of 15.49. As a discount to earnings, Huntington ranks better than 76.67% of the competition. Finally, analysts peg HII as a consensus hold. However, their price target implies upside potential of over 8%.Cisco (CSCO)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockA digital communications technology firm, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) develops, manufactures, and sells networking hardware, software, telecommunications equipment, and other high-technology services and products. Further, it specializes in specific tech segments, such as the Internet of Things and domain security. Admittedly, though, CSCO ranks among the riskier dividend stocks to buy. In the trailing year, shares stumbled over 13%.That said, contract investors will certainly be attracted by the company’s forward yield of 3.22%. In sharp contrast, the tech sector’s average yield sits at 1.37%. Further, the communications enterprise enjoys 13 years of consecutive dividend increases. Relatively speaking, its payout ratio of 38.69% stands higher than other dividend stocks to buy on this list. Nevertheless, against the bigger picture, it’s a reliable yield.Also, like Huntington Ingalls above, Cisco offers a discount. Presently, the market prices CSCO at a forward multiple of 12.91. As a discount to earnings, Cisco ranks better than 63.93% of its peers. Lastly, covering analysts peg CSCO as a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target stands at $56.88, implying over 17% upside potential.Bunge (BG)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, Bunge (NYSE:BG) is an agribusiness and food company. As a result, it features organic relevance and pertinence. No matter how advanced society becomes, people need a minimum amount of calories to survive. Further, when you’re dealing with dividend stocks to buy due to market slowdown risks, it pays to be cynical.Turning to its passive income, Bunge carries a forward yield of 2.55%. Notably, this stat ranks higher than the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. As well, the company’s payout ratio sits at 22.10, which is practically subterranean. However, unlike some of the other dividend stocks to buy, Bunge only carries two consecutive years of dividend increases. Still, it’s an attractive proposition overall. In particular, the market prices BG at a forward multiple of 8.3. As a discount to earnings, Bunge ranks better than nearly 86% of the field. Turning to the Street, covering analysts peg BG as a consensus strong buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $123, implying upside potential of over 25%.Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)image of hands holding small money bag symbolizing dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockWith Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) and rival Bunge above, these ideas represent names I’ve discussed frequently in the past weeks. While I try not to dip into the same well too many times, when discussing dividend stocks to buy, it’s unavoidable. Fundamentally, we’re talking about pertinent and basically indelible enterprises. And with all the wildness that occurred in the world over the past three years, ADM’s poised for greater relevance.Looking at the passive income segment, Archer Daniels features a forward yield of 2.21%. To be fair, it’s not the greatest yield, just beating out the consumer staple sector’s average yield. However, it also commands 51 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. We’re not just talking about a Dividend Aristocrat – it’s a Dividend King. Also, ADM benefits from a low payout ratio of 26.75%.Just like its rival, Archer enjoys a discounted profile. Currently, the market prices ADM at a forward multiple of 12.03. As a discount to earnings, Archer ranks better than 68.89% of the competition. Finally, covering analysts peg ADM as a consensus strong buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $104.20, implying 28% upside potential.CVS Health (CVS)Glass jar of coins marked ""dividends"" to represent dividend stocks. stocks with dividendsSource: ShutterstockA healthcare giant, CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) owns its namesake retail pharmacy and pharmacy benefits manager. In addition, the company bought out Aetna, which represents a health insurance provider. Although enjoying a relevant narrative, CVS just hasn’t panned out so well in the charts. In the trailing year, shares tumbled nearly 18%. Since the Jan. opener, they’re down almost 8%.Nevertheless, for those that want to take a little bit of risk for greater rewards, CVS ranks among the dividend stocks to buy. First, the company carries a forward yield of 2.82%. In contrast, the healthcare sector’s average yield sits at 1.58%. Further, CVS’ payout ratio is only 26.31%, making it a sustainable yield. For full disclosure, the company only has one year of dividend increases.However, contrarians will likely eyeball CVS because of its bargain profile. Right now, the market prices CVS at a forward multiple of 9.76. As a discount to earnings, the company ranks better than 77.78% of the competition. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg CVS as a consensus strong buy. Further, their average price target stands at $113.82, implying nearly 33% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The company achieved record fourth quarter net sales of $1.51 billion in the 2022 fourth quarter, 6.2% higher than net sales of $1.43 billion in the 2021 comparable period and 11.9% higher on a foreign currency adjusted basis. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent global supply chain challenges and disruptions, the company has prioritized product availability for its consumers and customers, despite adversely impacting gross margins and operating income. The company continues to stand by its strategy to ensure product availability and solidify the continued long-term growth of the company's brands. CANarchy was acquired in February 2022 to facilitate the company's entry into the alcohol beverage sector.During 2022, CANarchy sustained margin pressures, cost of acquisition and integration, as well as certain other costs in preparation for the launch of the company's new alcohol product lines. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 fourth quarter was 51.8% compared with 53.9% in the comparative 2021 fourth quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 fourth quarter as compared to the 2021 fourth quarter was primarily the result of: one, increased ingredients and other input costs, including secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees; two, geographical and product sales mix; and three, increased logistical costs. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2022 fourth quarter was partially offset by pricing actions.Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased on a sequential quarterly basis to 51.8% in the 2022 fourth quarter from 51.3% in the 2022 third quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, excluding gross profit for the company's Alcohol Brands segment increased on a sequential quarterly basis to 52.5% in the 2022 fourth quarter from 51.9% in the 2022 third quarter. We continue to believe that some of these increased costs we are experiencing are likely to be transitory. The depletion of our remaining higher cost imported can inventories will continue over the next few quarters and should be fully utilized during 2023. We note that our major promotion in the fourth quarter was executed with lower-cost, locally sourced cans in the United States and globally.We estimate that of the increasing costs of sales in the 2022 fourth quarter, approximately $60 million, was comprised of one, approximately $39.6 million due to increased ingredient and other input costs, including primary and secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees; two, approximately $12.5 million due to geographical and product sales mix; and three, approximately $7.9 million due to increased logistical costs. We continue to experience significant increases in distribution expenses, primarily the result of increased warehousing expenses as well as other logistical expenses, which adversely impacted operating expenses. The company continues to address the challenges in its supply chain as it navigates through the uncertainty of the current global supply chain environment.We are starting to see a reduction in freight rates in the United States. Operating expenses for the 2022 fourth quarter was $390 million compared with $354.7 million in the 2021 fourth quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2022 fourth quarter were 25.8% compared with 24.9% in the 2021 fourth quarter and 28.9% in the 2019 fourth quarter pre-COVID. Distribution expenses for the 2022 fourth quarter increased to $76.1 million which is an increase of 9% or 5% of net sales compared to $69.8 million or 4.9% of net sales in the 2021 fourth quarter and 3.5% of net sales in the 2019 fourth quarter pre-COVID. The $6.3 million increase in distribution expenses was primarily due to higher warehouse expenses of $11.2 million as a result of higher raw materials and finished product inventories in the United States and EMEA, partially offset by decreased freight out expenses of $4.4 million.The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to increased payroll expenses and increased general and administrative expenses. We are now able to purchase aluminum cans from local sources globally. We have seen a reduction in cost of sales through increased use of domestic cans, as we continue to cycle through existing inventories of imported cans over the next few quarters. We have rebuilt finished product inventory levels globally to return to our Orbitz strategy of producing closer proximity to our customers. The cost of repositioning finished products to distribution centers are included in freight-in costs. Operating income for the 2022 fourth quarter decreased 4.5% to $394.4 million from $412.9 million in the 2021 comparative quarter.Net income decreased 6.1% to $301.7 million, as compared to $321.3 million in the 2021 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2022 fourth quarter decreased 4.9% to $0.57 from $0.60 in the fourth quarter of 2021. Diluted earnings per share, exclusive of the Alcohol segment operating losses and the adverse impacts of foreign currency exchange rates, net of tax, was $0.64 in the 2022 fourth quarter. Through pricing actions, the company was able to achieve positive pricing appreciation in the United States and EMEA. Due to continued cost pressures, the company implemented a net sales price increase in the range of 6% market-wide in the United States effective September 1, 2022, and will be implementing a price increase on its 24-ounce line effective April 1, 2023.The company also implemented price increases in the second half of 2022 in certain international markets and will be implementing additional price increases on a phased approach during the first half of 2023 in a number of international markets. The company will continue to review further opportunities for price increases and pricing actions in order to mitigate inflationary pressures.

Monster's market share in value increased 1.7 points to 29.4% against the comparable period the previous year.Sales of Predator increased 106.2%, and its market share increased 2 share points to 5.1%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover a single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico.

We will now provide an update on our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which will be referred to as VPX, the maker of Bang energy drinks. We previously discussed the trademark infringement arbitration in which an arbitrator found against VPX and awarded Monster Energy Company, or MEC and Orange Bank, $175 million in damages, attorney fees and costs and an ongoing 5% royalty on future sales of certain Bang energy products. VPX has appealed the judgment. Additionally, on September 29, 2022, a jury in the United States District Court for the Central District of California returned a verdict awarding MEC approximately $293 million in damages on its claims against VPX for false advertising, misappropriation of trade secrets and interference with Monster's contracts over shelf space with certain key retailers.The parties are briefing post-trial issues. On October 10, 2022, VPX, along with certain of its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the Southern District of Florida. While those proceedings are moving forward, VPX has undertaken to make interim royalty payments subject to potential claw-backs in certain circumstances. On February 14, 2023, VPX made its first royalty payment in the amount of approximately $3.6 million. The company will not recognize either award or the royalty payments until such time as they are realized or realizable. As the litigation and bankruptcy proceedings are subjudicate, we will not be answering further questions on those matters on today's call.

In EMEA, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we launched Monster Nitro, Monster Reserve Watermelon and White Pineapple in a number of countries. In certain countries, we also launched juiced Aussie Lemonade, Ultra Gold, Ultra Rosa and Ultra Watermelon during the 2022 fourth quarter. During the 2022 fourth quarter, we also launched additional SKUs of Burn and Reign in certain countries. In EMEA as part of an ongoing plan, EMEA launch, we commenced distribution of our Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton 44 Zero Sugar Energy drink in select EMEA markets late in the fourth quarter of 2022 to be followed by an additional 25 EMEA markets in the first quarter of 2023.During the fourth quarter of 2022, we launched Monster Rehab Lemon tea in Japan, Monster Ultra Watermelon in Turkey. Monster Ultra Paradise in Vietnam, Predator in Malaysia, and we continued the national rollout of Predator India. We are planning to introduce the Predator brand in additional countries in APAC during the course of 2023. We estimate that on a foreign currency adjusted basis, including CANarchy, January 2023 sales were approximately 16.1% higher than the comparable January 2022 sales and 13.8% higher than January 2022, excluding CANarchy. We estimate January 2023 sales, including CANarchy to be approximately 12.9% higher than in January 2022 and 10.6% higher than in January 2022, excluding CANarchy. January 2023 had the same number of selling days as January 2022.In this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production. In some instances, our bottlers are responsible for production and determine their own production schedules. This affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. Furthermore, our bottling and distribution partner maintained inventory levels according to their own internal requirements, which they may alter from time to time for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period.If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continues in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed. On November 2, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an additional 500 million of the company's outstanding common stock. During the 2022 fourth quarter, the company purchased approximately 2.3 million shares of its common stock for a total amount of $201.6 million, excluding broker commissions under the June 2022 repurchase plan, leaving approximately 682.8 million remaining available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase programs. The company today announced that its Board of Directors has approved and declared a 2-for-1 split of its common stock that will be effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend.Each stockholder of record on March 13, 2023, will receive a dividend of one additional share of common stock for each then held share to be distributed after the close of trading on March 27, 2023. The company anticipates its common stock to begin trading at the split adjusted price on March 28, 2023. In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, the energy category continues to grow globally; two, the company has increased its raw material and finished product inventories to better service customers and ensure availability of its products. Three, we are seeing improvement in our gross profit margins on a quarterly sequential basis due to supply chain normalization; four, our AFF flavor facility in Ireland is now providing a large number of flavors to our EMEA region, enabling better service levels and lower land costs to our EMEA region.Five, we are enthusiastic for only 23 new product innovations notably Monster Energy Zero Sugar, which launched in January 2023 in the United States and Monster Energy Lewis Hamilton 44 Zero sugar energy drink in EMEA. We are also particularly enthusiastic for the planned launches of rainstorm in March 2023 as well as Tour Water in the United States. We are pleased with the early results from the launch of The Beast Unleashed, our first flavored malt beverage alcohol product in six states and the planned rollout to additional states, as well as the additional alcohol opportunities that the CANarchy acquisition presents. Seven, we are planning to launch Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in additional international countries.And finally, we are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury, our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in an additional number of international countries. I would now like to open the floor to questions about the year.

115,8514cf26-070c-3b99-a0b8-8e5eba9a60c1,WU,2023-03-03,Western Union (WU) Ties Up To Boost Mexico's Money Transfers,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/western-union-wu-ties-boost-164504583.html,1677775504,STORY,['WU'],"[The Western Union Company WU recently collaborated with one of the world’s largest retail chains - 7-Eleven Mexico in a bid to ease cross-border money transfers in Mexico.By virtue of the partnership, WU’s enhanced money transfer services can be availed at over 1,800 7-Eleven locations. This facility offers an opportunity for the country’s consumers to seamlessly and safely send as well as receive money across the expansive network of Western Union operating in more than 200 countries and territories.The tie-up enables consumers to send money to the abovementioned locations scattered across 14 states of the country. For receiving remittances, consumers need to visit any 7-Eleven store in Mexico and furnish the Money Transfer Control Number (MTCN) as well as official identification. Upon the authentication of data, the cash and a receipt copy will be handed over to the recipient. The remittance amount can be a maximum figure of $2,000 Mexican Pesos.The latest move also offers accelerated and varied money transfer choices to Mexico’s consumers. Instead of choosing a retail location, the country’s consumers can also send money online through the Western Union app. The alliance marks Western Union’s continuous efforts to bolster its retail service offerings portfolio and fortify its extensive network. 7-Eleven seems the apt partner for complementing WU’s endeavor as the company boasts a solid presence in Mexico. Therefore, consumers visiting 1,800-plus 7-Eleven stores, which is a significant number, will benefit from the increased utilization of WU’s money transfer services. This, in turn, might drive its money transfer revenues (a significant contributor to the top line) in the days ahead.Western Union remains steadfast in establishing a solid footprint in Mexico and the recent partnership only bears testament to the same. Similar to 7-Eleven, Western Union also picked up another retail chain in Mexico - Alsuper, in 2022, for extending the reach of its money transfer services to the latter’s supermarket hubs across Northern Mexico.Story continuesThe reason behind WU’s intensified focus can be substantiated by the January 2023 report of the Bank of Mexico, per which the total amount of remittance income during January-November of 2022 increased 13.5% from the prior-year comparable period. Worthy of mentioning, 99% of the remittance income was earned via electronic transfers, which signifies widespread digital adoption and a rising number of Internet users throughout Mexico.Therefore, Western Union seems well-poised to capitalize on the digital prospects of the country due to its solid digital arm built through several digital tie-ups and substantial investments over the years.Shares of Western Union have lost 6.6% year to date against the industry’s 5% growth.

Shares have lost about 5.4% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Ashland due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Ashland's Earnings Beat Estimates in Q1, Revenues LagAshland recorded profits of $40 million or 73 cents per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 (ending Dec 31, 2022), down from $48 million or 83 cents in the prior-year quarter.Barring one-time items, adjusted earnings came in at 97 cents per share, up from the year-ago quarter’s figure of 88 cents. It topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 95 cents.Sales rose around 3% year over year to $525 million. It missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $525.9 million. The top line was driven mainly by disciplined pricing actions leading to a recovery in costs as well as strong demand for pharmaceutical ingredients, partly offset by demand weakness in China due COVID-19 restrictions and significant inventory destocking particularly in China and Europe.Segment HighlightsLife Sciences: Sales in the segment were up 22% year over year to $207 million in the reported quarter, aided by double-digit growth to pharmaceutical customers reflecting cost recovery and strong demand.Personal Care: Sales in the division fell 6% year over year to $138 million. Disciplined pricing was offset by lower sales in China mainly due to COVID-19 policies and inventory destocking within the distribution channel. Specialty Additives: Sales in the segment fell 8% year over year to $143 million, hurt by the impact of COVID-19 restrictions in China and inventory destocking in China and Europe.Intermediates: Sales in the segment went up 2% year over year to $54 million, led by higher merchant-market prices.Story continuesFinancialsCash and cash equivalents were $532 million at the end of the quarter, up around 174% year over year. Long-term debt was $1,316 million, down around 17% year over year.Cash flows used by operating activities were $29 million in the reported quarter.OutlookAshland continues to expect sales in the range of $2.5-$2.7 billion for fiscal 2023. It also anticipates adjusted EBITDA to be within the $600-$650 million range for the full fiscal.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates review have trended upward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted 5.23% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Ashland has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with a B. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Ashland has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerAshland is part of the Zacks Chemical - Specialty industry. Over the past month, PPG Industries (PPG), a stock from the same industry, has gained 0.9%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended December 2022 more than a month ago.PPG Industries reported revenues of $4.19 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.1%.

119,3101fac3-5f3d-3387-a027-df09651f2e38,GS,2023-03-03,Is Goldman Sachs Emerging Markets Equity A (GEMAX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-emerging-markets-equity-120012997.html,1677844812,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD', '^GSPC']","[If investors are looking at the Mutual Fund Equity Report fund category, make sure to pass over Goldman Sachs Emerging Markets Equity A (GEMAX). GEMAX carries a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 5 (Strong Sell), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerGoldman Sachs is responsible for GEMAX, and the company is based out of New York, NY. The Goldman Sachs Emerging Markets Equity A made its debut in December of 1997 and GEMAX has managed to accumulate roughly $165.16 million in assets, as of the most recently available information. The fund's current manager, Basak Yavuz, has been in charge of the fund since February of 2015.PerformanceObviously, what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers. GEMAX has a 5-year annualized total return of -1.84% and it sits in the bottom third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of 0.2%, which places it in the bottom third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. GEMAX's standard deviation over the past three years is 22.98% compared to the category average of 17.78%. The standard deviation of the fund over the past 5 years is 20.26% compared to the category average of 15.61%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsThe fund has a 5-year beta of 0.77, so investors should note that it is hypothetically less volatile than the market at large. Another factor to consider is alpha, as it reflects a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark-in this case, the S&amp;P 500. GEMAX has generated a negative alpha over the past five years of -8.13, demonstrating that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesExpensesAs competition heats up in the mutual fund market, costs become increasingly important. Compared to its otherwise identical counterpart, a low-cost product will be an outperformer, all other things being equal. Thus, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is vital for investors. In terms of fees, GEMAX is a load fund. It has an expense ratio of 1.31% compared to the category average of 1.14%. From a cost perspective, GEMAX is actually more expensive than its peers.While the minimum initial investment for the product is $1,000, investors should also note that each subsequent investment needs to be at least $50.Bottom LineOverall, Goldman Sachs Emerging Markets Equity A ( GEMAX ) has a low Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively weak performance, average downside risk, and higher fees, Goldman Sachs Emerging Markets Equity A ( GEMAX ) looks like a somewhat weak choice for investors right now.For additional information on the Mutual Fund Equity Report area of the mutual fund world, make sure to check out www.zacks.com/funds/mutual-funds.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Halliburton has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Schlumberger has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that HAL has an improving earnings outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.HAL currently has a forward P/E ratio of 12.17, while SLB has a forward P/E of 18.20. We also note that HAL has a PEG ratio of 0.28. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. SLB currently has a PEG ratio of 0.48.Another notable valuation metric for HAL is its P/B ratio of 4.27. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, SLB has a P/B of 4.33.Based on these metrics and many more, HAL holds a Value grade of B, while SLB has a Value grade of C.Story continuesHAL stands above SLB thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that HAL is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

AN, CNH Industrial N.V. CNHI, Valero Energy Corp. VLO, Hologic, Inc. HOLX and Ryder System, Inc. R.Top 5 Stocks with High ROE as Equity Markets Flop in FebruaryThe U.S. equity markets' downtrend continued in the past few trading sessions as strong economic data and a tight labor market portrayed signs that inflation was still a force to reckon with. Despite a solid start to the year, the equity markets largely remained choppy in February, while the 10-year Treasury yields jumped sharply to hit the highest level since November 2022. Experts widely believe that these will likely force the Fed to continue its aggressive stance against inflationary pressures.Fed had earlier raised the interest rates by 25 basis points – much akin to the broader expectations – and kept the door ajar for future hikes as it indicated that the battle against inflation was far from over. It also expected economic growth to remain subdued in 2023. Average hourly earnings in January fell 0.2% on a sequential basis and were down 1.8% from a year ago. The uncertain business environment failed to paint a clearer picture of the overall economy and led to the cacophony that drove the broader equity market volatility.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. AutoNation, Inc., CNH Industrial N.V., Valero Energy Corp., Hologic, Inc. and Ryder System, Inc. are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityStory continuesROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Here are five of the 22 stocks that qualified the screen:AutoNation: Incorporated in Delaware in 1991, AutoNation is the largest automotive retailer in the United States. Apart from retailing new and used vehicles, the company offers vehicle maintenance and repair services, vehicle parts, extended service contracts, vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products. In addition, it arranges financing for vehicle purchases through third-party sources.It delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.8%, on average. It has a VGM Score of A. Currently, AutoNation carries a Zacks Rank #2.

This change outpaced the S&amp;P 500's 0.76% gain on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 1.05%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.98%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the medical device maker had lost 4.49% over the past month. This has lagged the Medical sector's loss of 4.24% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 3.91% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Hologic as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.88, down 57.49% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $967.05 million, down 32.64% from the year-ago period.HOLX's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $3.74 per share and revenue of $3.97 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of -37.87% and -18.41%, respectively.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Hologic. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 7.02% higher. Hologic is holding a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) right now.Investors should also note Hologic's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 21.17. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 25.99.Story continuesWe can also see that HOLX currently has a PEG ratio of 1.39. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Medical - Instruments industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.21 as of yesterday's close.The Medical - Instruments industry is part of the Medical sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 88, putting it in the top 35% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

On a year-over-year basis, the top line improved 16%.The fiscal fourth-quarter revenues compared with our estimate of $551.6 million.The fiscal fourth-quarter top line was driven by Veeva Systems’ robust segmental performances.Full-year revenues were $2.16 billion, reflecting a 16.4% uptick from fiscal 2022. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.9%.Our projection of full-year revenues was $2.14 billion, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Segmental DetailsVeeva Systems derives revenues from two operating segments — Subscription services, and Professional services and other.In the fiscal fourth quarter, Subscription services revenues improved 16.3% from the year-ago quarter to $460.2 million. This was driven by Veeva Systems’ most established products.This compares to our projection of $452.1 million of revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter.Professional services and other revenues were up 14.9% year over year to $103.2 million, primarily resulting from continued strength in Research and Development (R&amp;D) Solutions services and Veeva Business Consulting.This compares to our projection of $99.5 million of revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter.Story continuesVeeva Systems Inc.

The operating margin in the fiscal fourth quarter contracted a huge 533 bps to 19.3%.We had projected 19.8% of operating margin for the fiscal fourth quarter.Financial PositionThe company exited fiscal 2023 with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $3.10 billion compared with $2.38 billion at the end of fiscal 2022.Cumulative net cash provided by operating activities at the end of fiscal 2023 was $780.5 million compared with $764.5 million in the year-ago period.GuidanceVeeva Systems initiated its financial outlook for the fiscal 2024 and provided its estimates for first-quarter fiscal 2024.For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the company expects total revenues of $514-$516 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $546.1 million.Subscription revenues are estimated to be $405 million in the fiscal first quarter.Adjusted EPS is projected between 79 cents and 80 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at 98 cents.Veeva Systems expects revenues of $2.35-$2.36 billion for fiscal 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $2.40 billion.Subscription revenues are expected to be $1.88 billion. This consists of Commercial Solutions’ subscription revenues of $972 million and R&amp;D Solutions’ subscription revenues of $908 million.Adjusted EPS for the year is expected to be $4.33. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $4.47.Our TakeVeeva Systems exited the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 with better-than-expected results. The uptick in the overall top and bottom lines, and robust performances by both segments during the quarter are impressive. The company continues to benefit from its flagship Vault platform, which is encouraging. Veeva Systems’ continued strength in its Commercial Solutions, with new SMB customer additions, looks promising.Veeva Systems registered great traction in newer areas, including Veeva Vault Safety, Veeva Link and Veeva Compass, which augurs well. The strength in Clinical operations, which grew to more than 470 Vault eTMF and 180 CTMS customers, is also driving the momentum in new areas, including Veeva Site Connect and Study Training, raising our optimism.On the flip side, rising operating costs putting pressure on the margins during the quarter is a headwind. Per management, the advertising environment remains tough, causing slowing down of growth in the near term, which raises apprehension.Zacks Rank and Key PicksVeeva Systems currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX, popularly known as BD, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc.

130,b4064225-bb44-3260-9a35-465e8170e1c5,HOLX,2023-03-03,Top 5 Stocks With High ROE as Equity Markets Flop in February,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-5-stocks-high-roe-132101500.html,1677763261,STORY,['HOLX'],"[The U.S. equity markets' downtrend continued in the past few trading sessions as strong economic data and a tight labor market portrayed signs that inflation was still a force to reckon with. Despite a solid start to the year, the equity markets largely remained choppy in February, while the 10-year Treasury yields jumped sharply to hit the highest level since November 2022. Experts widely believe that these will likely force the Fed to continue its aggressive stance against inflationary pressures.Fed had earlier raised the interest rates by 25 basis points – much akin to the broader expectations – and kept the door ajar for future hikes as it indicated that the battle against inflation was far from over. It also expected economic growth to remain subdued in 2023. Average hourly earnings in January fell 0.2% on a sequential basis and were down 1.8% from a year ago. The uncertain business environment failed to paint a clearer picture of the overall economy and led to the cacophony that drove the broader equity market volatility.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. AutoNation, Inc. AN, CNH Industrial N.V. CNHI, Valero Energy Corporation VLO, Hologic, Inc. HOLX and Ryder System, Inc. R are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Story continuesParameters Used for ScreeningIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 22 stocks that qualified the screen:AutoNation: Incorporated in Delaware in 1991, AutoNation is the largest automotive retailer in the United States.

Shares have lost about 4.2% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Amgen due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Q4 Earnings &amp; Sales TopAmgen reported fourth-quarter 2022 earnings of $4.09 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.04. Earnings declined 7% year over year due to a lower operating margin.Total revenues of $6.84 billion also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.74 billion as well as our estimate of $6.66 billion. Total revenues were flat year over year as higher product sales were offset by lower Other revenues.Total product revenues increased 4% from the year-ago quarter to $6.55 billion (U.S.: $4.79 billion; ex-U.S.: $1.78 billion). Higher volumes were offset by lower selling prices of several drugs and currency headwinds. Volumes rose 10% in the quarter, offset by a 3% lower net selling price. Foreign exchange movement hurt sales by 2% in the quarter.Excluding Fx impact, revenues rose 2% in the quarter.Other revenues were $287 million in the quarter, down 50% year over year due to lower revenues from its COVID-19 manufacturing collaboration with Eli Lilly.Amgen witnessed double-digit volume growth for a number of its key products like Repatha, Prolia and Evenity in the fourth quarter and in the full year. However, pricing pressure and increased competition continued to hurt sales of some drugs as well as biosimilar products.Performance of Key DrugsGeneral MedicineProlia revenues came in at $992 million, up 14% from the year-ago quarter, driven by volume growth. Prolia sales beat our estimates of $941.2 million.Evenity recorded sales of $225.0 million in the quarter, up 57% year over year, driven by strong volume growth both in and outside the United States.Repatha generated revenues of $333.0 million, up 22% year over year, as higher volume was partially offset by lower prices. Increased rebates to support broad Medicare Part D and commercial patient access in the United States and the inclusion of Repatha on China’s National Reimbursement Drug List resulted in lower prices in the quarter. Repatha sales were almost in line with our estimates of $333.4 million.In 2023, Amgen expects less year-over-year U.S. price erosion for Repatha than in 2022.Aimovig recorded sales of $114 million in the quarter, up 27% year over year due to higher net selling price, which offset a decline in volume.Amgen expects Aimovig’s selling price to decline going forward to maintain broad patient access amid rising competition.Hematology-OncologyXgeva delivered revenues of $484 million, down 11% from the year-ago quarter due to lower volumes and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. Xgeva sales missed our estimates of $518.1 million. Increased competitive pressure is hurting Xgeva’s sales, a trend expected to continue in 2023.Kyprolis recorded sales of $325 million, up 14% year over year, driven by volume growth.Vectibix revenues came in at $238 million, down 2% year over due to currency headwinds.Nplate sales rose 66% to $469 million due to a one-time order from the U.S. government. Blincyto sales increased 24% from the year-ago period to $164 million.Amgen’s newly approved drug, Lumakras/ Lumykras recorded sales of $71 million in the quarter compared with $75 million in the previous quarter. Lumakras sales declined sequentially due to lower net selling price and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. Lumakras sales were hurt by a one-time $12 million adjustment from a reimbursement approval decision in France. Lumakras/ Lumykras volumes rose 12% in the quarter. Lumakras/Lumykras sales missed our estimates of $85.6 million.Sales of Amgen’s oncology biosimilars declined 40% year over year in the fourth quarter.In oncology biosimilars, sales of Kanjinti were $63 million, down 55% year over year due to lower pricing as a result of increased competition and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions.Sales of Mvasi were $205 million in the quarter, down 33% year over year due to declines in net selling price.Sales of Kanjinti and Mvasi are expected to continue to decline due to lower prices and volume declines driven by increased competition. However, biosimilar revenues are expected to return to growth with the launch of Amjevita (Humira biosimilar) in 2023 and the next wave of launches of biosimilar versions of Stelara, Eylea and Soliris.InflammationSales of Otezla were $616 million in the quarter, down 2%, due to lower pricing and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. Otezla volumes rose 7% in the quarter benefiting from the label expansion in mild-to-moderate psoriasis. Otezla sales in the United States were hurt by increased competitive pressure with the impact expected to continue in the first quarter of 2023. Otezla sales missed our estimates of $640.2 million.Newly approved asthma drug, Tezspire (tezepelumab) recorded sales of $79 million in the quarter compared with $55 million in the previous quarter as the new drug is being utilized by patients across all types of severe asthma. Amgen expects to launch a prefilled pen version of Tezspire in the first quarter in the United States.Amgevita sales were $119 million in the quarter, up 3% year over year, driven by volume growth, which was partially offset by currency headwinds and lower net selling price due to increased competitive pressureEnbrel revenues of $1.08 billion declined 1% year over year due to lower volumes and price, which were partially offset by higher year-end inventory levels. Enbrel sales slightly missed our estimates of $1.11 billion. Amgen expects further declines in Enbrel’s net selling prices, going forward, due to increased competition.The 2022 acquisition of ChemoCentryx added a newly launched innovative product, Tavneos to Amgen’s portfolio.

It expects a mid-single-digit price decline in 2023.In 2023, Amgen expects Neulasta sales to be less than $700 million.

Product sales are expected to be flat from the prior-year levels while other revenues are expected to be lower on a year-over-year basisSales of Otezla and Enbrel are expected to be lower in the first quarter per historical trends due to the impact of benefit plan changes, insurance reverification and increased co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles.Due to this effect, Amgen believes first-quarter 2023 Otezla sales could be in line with or below first- quarter 2022 sales.Adjusted operating margin is expected to be below 50%, as a percentage of product sales, in the first quarter.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates revision have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -12.34% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Amgen has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/78-institutional-ownership-amgen-inc-140029749.html,1677765629,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Amgen implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price49% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholdersOwnership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stockA look at the shareholders of Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 78% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Amgen. Check out our latest analysis for Amgen ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Amgen?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Amgen already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Amgen's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Amgen is not owned by hedge funds. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.1% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 9.0% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.6% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of AmgenThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Amgen Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$189m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 22% stake in Amgen. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Accordingly, Newmont investors that purchase the stock on or after the 8th of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 23rd of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.40 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.60 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Newmont has a trailing yield of 3.6% on the current stock price of $43.94. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Newmont's dividend is reliable and sustainable. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. Check out our latest analysis for Newmont Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Newmont's dividend is not well covered by earnings, as the company lost money last year. This is not a sustainable state of affairs, so it would be worth investigating if earnings are expected to recover. Given that the company reported a loss last year, we now need to see if it generated enough free cash flow to fund the dividend. If Newmont didn't generate enough cash to pay the dividend, then it must have either paid from cash in the bank or by borrowing money, neither of which is sustainable in the long term. Newmont paid out more free cash flow than it generated - 160%, to be precise - last year, which we think is concerningly high. We're curious about why the company paid out more cash than it generated last year, since this can be one of the early signs that a dividend may be unsustainable.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. Newmont was unprofitable last year, but at least the general trend suggests its earnings have been improving over the past five years. Even so, an unprofitable company whose business does not quickly recover is usually not a good candidate for dividend investors.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Newmont has increased its dividend at approximately 1.3% a year on average. It's good to see both earnings and the dividend have improved - although the former has been rising much quicker than the latter, possibly due to the company reinvesting more of its profits in growth.We update our analysis on Newmont every 24 hours, so you can always get the latest insights on its financial health, here.The Bottom LineShould investors buy Newmont for the upcoming dividend? First, it's not great to see the company paying a dividend despite being loss-making over the last year. Second, the dividend was not well covered by cash flow."" It's not that we think Newmont is a bad company, but these characteristics don't generally lead to outstanding dividend performance.With that being said, if you're still considering Newmont as an investment, you'll find it beneficial to know what risks this stock is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Newmont you should know about.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

In 2022, as consumer behavior rapidly changed, we adjusted our receipts and operations accordingly. At the same time, we fortified our balance sheet and continue to execute our long-term goals. In the fourth quarter, we achieved net sales of $8.3 billion. Beauty, dresses, tailored clothing, luggage and gift giving, outperformed while soft home, active and casual were challenged. We offered freshness in every category and brand, even down trending ones that are still important to customers.Peak holiday selling periods mirrored pre-pandemic patterns, but lulls were longer and deeper. Post-holiday demand for remaining winter and early spring product was stronger than expected and markdowns were shallower than contemplated when we provided our updated guidance in early January. End-of-year inventories declined 3% to 2021 and were down 18% to 2019. Looking back on 2022, we began to see signs of consumer weakness and a shift in category demand late in the first quarter. We adjusted the timing, amount and composition of receipts by channel, category and brand. As macro pressures mounted and industry-wide inventory built on easing supply chain constraints, we bought closer to me, held open-to-buy reserves and bought into areas of strength. We were measured with promotions and markdowns and did not chase unprofitable sales. These actions benefited fourth quarter results. We had our ninth consecutive quarter of AUR improvement and a better-than-expected gross margin rate of 34.1%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin rate was 11% and adjusted diluted EPS was $1.88, including a $0.17 discrete benefit related to the favorable resolution of a state income tax litigation. Our financial health and stability enabled us to navigate uncertainties while continuing to invest in growth drivers. At the end of the year, we had $862 million of cash, $1.2 billion less debt than 2019 and no material debt maturities until 2027.Turning to 2023. There is conflicting data regarding the U.S. consumer as a modern department store operating from off-price to luxury, we have a full view of income tiers, aided by our high penetration of loyalty members and robust credit card portfolio. On the surface, the consumer is in better shape than 2019. Jobs and wages are strong and savings levels are elevated relative to historic levels. But prices for services and goods are higher. Inflation has surpassed wage growth and revolving credit is rising.Adrian will provide specifics on our 2023 outlook, but we believe discretionary spend will be under pressure across income tiers and expect the allocation of disposable income to continue shifting towards services and essential goods. Even as consumers reprioritize spend, there is opportunity. With the continued expansion of a hybrid work model, there are more in-person meetings and flexibility for personal travel. We believe the desire to be with loved ones, go on vacation and attend events has not diminished and expect gift giving and occasion-based demand to continue.Reflecting on the last 3 years, 2020 was a year of crisis management. 2021 was stabilization. And in 2022, we laid the foundation for a sustainable low double-digit adjusted EBITDA margin and longer-term sales growth. So let's discuss our progress. At Macy's, we reevaluated our approach to merchandising. Since the pandemic, we have materially reduced markdown allowances and made a strong pivot to an upfront cost negotiation model, changed how we incentivize merchants. So bonuses are based on Macy's, Inc. sales versus functional responsibilities, allowing us to shift receipts and markdown dollars. Increased open-to-buy reserves, enabling us to read and react to customer signals intra-quarter and begin to work more closely with strategic brand partners to mutually grow brands in a healthier way. Beyond merchandising in 2022, Macy's also launched Own Your Style, an omnichannel brand platform, encouraging customers to celebrate their personal style. Introduced a marketplace on macys.com, ending the year with 20 new categories and 500 new brands that our customers have been signaling demand for and introduce Toys ""R"" Us store within stores in every Macy's, more than doubling toy sales for the year and attracting over 0.5 million new customers.In 2022, we continue to embed data and analytics across the enterprise. We added and refined pricing science capabilities such as competitive pricing and enhanced channel and location level markdowns, and there is opportunity to further maximize profitability and drive even more productive sell-throughs. We also introduced Mission Every One, our social purpose platform designed to advance Macy's long-term brand relevancy for all stakeholders. We look forward to reporting on our year 1 progress in the coming weeks.And we invested in our #1 resource, our colleagues. We completed a $15 per hour minimum wage increase nationwide and introduced our Guild Education partnership with approximately 3,000 colleagues taking advantage of free education benefits. These actions helped reduce overall turnover by roughly 3% since 2019, excluding reductions in force and seasonal employees.We have entered 2023 in a position of financial and operational strength with a proven track record of executing our strategic priorities even in periods of uncertainty. This year, we will be testing, investing and scaling for sales and margin expansion. In addition to our existing initiatives, including pricing science and data and analytics, we will focus on our 5 primary growth vectors. Number one, Macy's private brand Reimagination; two, Market by Macy's and Bloomie's off-mall stores; three, marketplace; four, Luxury; and five, personalized offers and communication, which we have broadly described as personalization in the past.These vectors were contemplated when we introduced our long-term low single-digit annual growth sales CAGR goal in the fourth quarter of 2021. Since then, we have steadily invested even as macro pressures have intensified. We are currently targeting low single-digit annual net sales and comparable owned plus license sales growth beginning in 2024, off an assumption for a low single-digit decline in both metrics this year. Our target is based on the timing and anticipated impact of several rollouts and does not assume a dramatic improvement in consumer health. We are making strategic investments to fuel future profitable growth, and these investments are reflected in our 2023 SG&amp;A and CapEx assumptions, which Adrian will discuss shortly.This morning, we will provide an overview of the 5 vectors, including proof points that give us confidence in their viability. So let's start with Macy's Private Brands. When our Chief Merchandising Officer, was promoted to her role roughly 2 years ago, private brands became one of her top priorities. Since then, we have built the capabilities and infrastructure to reimagine, strengthen and grow the portfolio. We've created a dedicated private brand team with new design, sourcing and merchandising roles and broad cross-functional support. The team is now executing our vision for a differentiated, defendable and durable portfolio.Our approach is rooted in consumer insights. Our team has conducted over 80,000 online surveys, 35 days of digital community engagement and hundreds of hours of in-store fit research and shop-alongs. This data has informed our go-forward strategy, which is focused on 5 key pillars: brand identity, original design, strategic sourcing, relevant size and fit and compelling value. The role of private brands is to drive customer loyalty, be a differentiator for our business, complement our matrix of national brands and benefit our gross margin.We currently have 24 private label brands in the Macy's portfolio, which combined represented roughly 16% of Macy's 2022 sales. Over the next 3 years, we will rigorously evaluate all of them and will refresh, reimagine and replace brands. As part of our commitment to inclusivity, our new portfolio will reflect customers across every life stage, style preference and price point. We started with an initial update of INC in mid-2022. Early results have been favorable with fourth quarter sales up 28% to last year.So turning to our second growth vector, our off-mall smaller format stores. These stores play an integral role in supporting our omnichannel ecosystem. We currently have 8 market by Macy's and 2 Bloomie's. These average about 30,000 to 40,000 square feet or roughly 1/5 the size of our on-mall locations.Looking at the 5 Market by Macy's and the 1 Bloomie's that have been open for over a year, fourth quarter comparable owned plus licensed sales increased by 8% and 12%, respectively. Of-mall conversion is significantly above mall locations and customer experience scores on layout and neatness of the store, ease of the checkout process and availability of colleagues are 25 to 30 points higher.According to Placer.AI data, off-mall centers have 2.5x more visits than on-mall. Thus far, we are most successful in centers that include high-traffic concepts like off-price or grocery, where our unique products and brands provide a differentiated option. When opening in existing markets, cannibalization is lower than anticipated and new customer acquisition rates are higher than on-mall. In 2023, we plan on opening 4 market by Macy's and 1 Bloomie's and if new locations continue to outperform, we will look to incrementally accelerate off-mall openings beginning in 2024. With our strong liquidity position, we are prepared to take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves.We are currently evaluating the right number and mix of on- and off-mall locations, our ecosystem and customer are dramatically different today than when we announced our 125 Macy's store closure plan in February of 2020. Since then, we have closed approximately 80 Macy's locations and plan to close another 5 this fiscal year. We have shuttered our most significant underperformers, exited dine centers and improved the existing store experience, while delaying closures of others that are cash flow positive. Today, roughly 99% of our mall base is profitable on a 4-wall basis.Our third growth vector is our online marketplace. Over the last year, we have built a team focused on identifying, recruiting, onboarding and supporting sellers. Since its launch last September, we had found that over 90% of our total marketplace customer base are Macy's Cross shoppers. Additionally, Marketplace number one, captures incremental sales opportunity in categories and brands where we have historically limited offers such as video games and electronics. Two, drives a larger average order value and higher units per order. Three, allows us to quickly move into new and adjacent categories without inventory risk. Four, gives our customers more choice at scale. Five, enables us to ship channels for certain customer wanted brands that do not have a high velocity of sell-throughs; and six, attracts a new younger customer. We have plans to add 2,000 brands on Macy's marketplace this year and to launch on Bloomingdale's marketplace in the back half. Luxury is our fourth growth vector. In 2022, both Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury achieved their highest annual sales volume in history. Congratulations to the teams. At Bloomingdale's, which just celebrated its 150th anniversary, loyalist members accounted for over 70% of owned plus licensed comparable sales and spent 7% more year-over-year. Our top of the list loyalty customer defined as loyalists who spend at least $5,000 annually spent 9% more year-over-year.Over the past several years, we have used data and analytics to allocate assortments on a store level, including an elevated mix of brands and categories at our top locations. And across our base, we have been refreshing and remodeling our center core areas. Response from customers and partners has been positive, and we plan on accelerating this program in 2023. Bluemercury has been under new leadership since mid-2021. Over the past year, our active customer base grew by 12%, and our loyalty customer, which represents over 80% of sales spent roughly twice as much as normal. Outstanding service, exclusive events and cutting-edge national and proprietary brands continue to be top priorities.At Macy's, our focus on luxury beauty continues to strengthen our presence with great brands. Over the past 5 years, we have been actively updating our beauty departments and plan to renovate roughly 8 to 10 per year over the next several years. These are full beauty floor remodels where we will add new brands, rightsize some existing brands and focus on adjacencies and services. A key piece has been upgrading our luxury omnichannel beauty experience with brands like Armani, Chanel, Creed, Dior, Jo Malone, La Mer, Tom Ford and Wiesel Beauty. We are also working with our luxury brand partners to create memorable events such as our Dior made with love experience at this year's upcoming Flower Show.The fifth growth vector is personalized offers and communication. By targeting at the customer level, we can build loyalty, grow customer lifetime value and further protect margins. This year, we have run tests with tens of millions of Macy's customers, including our Star Rewards members who represent roughly 70% of our Macy's owned plus licensed comparable sales. The test to focus on individualized promotions and consistent cross-channel experiences. We're pleased with early learnings, and we will continue to refine offers and communication to make the experience more tailored and intimate.It's an exciting time to be here at Macy's. We have exited 2022 more relevant, flexible and disciplined with a firm understanding of what it means to be a successful modern department store. We are committed to freshness across categories. Our model allows us to pivot product, promotions and messaging. We will buy conservatively, preserve liquidity and open to buy and not chase unprofitable sales. we are confident in the amount, composition and mix of inventories, and we will continue to evaluate macro indicators and customer data to respond to signals positioning us to compete and win regardless of the environment.So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Adrian for more detail on our fourth quarter and forward outlook.Adrian V. MitchellThanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. 2022 was a year of volatility and uncertainty and provided further proof that the disciplines we have built into our business are driving us forward and strengthening our modern department store positioning. Our diversified model allows us to respond to shifting demands of our customers across categories, brands and the value spectrum.As we look ahead, we are confident that the investments we are making today in our 5 vectors will drive long-term profitable growth. We will balance testing and iterating to ensure that we scale these critical initiatives with an educated perspective on their ability to contribute a high return to our business. Now I'll take a few moments to walk through the fourth quarter results of our 5 value creation levers before providing additional details on our expectations for 2023 and beyond. First, omnichannel sales. We generated net sales of $8.3 billion for the fourth quarter, a decline of 4.6% versus the prior year and down 0.9% to 2019. Comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis decreased 2.7%. Moving to the second value creation lever, gross margin. Our gross margin rate was 34.1%, down 240 basis points from the prior year and down 270 basis points versus 2019. Of the year-over-year decline, 300 basis points was due to lower merchandise margin, primarily driven by higher markdowns and promotions relative to last year when inventory constraints in the industry led to low promotions and robust full price sell-throughs. This year's higher level of markdowns and promotions reflected our commitment to N22 at the right level and composition of inventory and our response to the competitive retail environment, both of which were contemplated when we provided our fourth quarter outlook. While markdowns and promotions were elevated versus last year, they were better than our expectations. However, inventory shortage was above plan and prior year due to increased step consistent with trends seen throughout retail. Despite merchandise margin degradation, Macy's, Inc. owned AUR rose 2% in the fourth quarter, driven by ticket increases and category mix. For the year, owned AUR increased over 4%. Delivery expense was 60 basis points below last year on a 2-point decline in digital penetration and lower peak delivery surcharges. Compared to 2019, gross margin degradation was primarily due to a 7-point increase in digital penetration.The third value creation lever is inventory productivity. Inventory declined 3% year-over-year and 18% compared to 2019. Inventory turnover was down 4% for last year and improved 15% to 2019. We made significant progress in leveraging data and analytics to better forecast sales demand, receipt timing and flow across the supply chain. In 2023, we will focus on more advanced inventory productivity initiatives, including improved automation and more flexible inventory allocation to drive higher sell-throughs and ultimately, more sales.Expense discipline is the fourth value creation lever. SG&amp;A decreased $30 million or 1.2% to $2.4 billion. SG&amp;A as a percent of net sales was 29%, 100 basis points higher than last year. Compared to 2019, SG&amp;A improved by 110 basis points. The year-over-year rate increase was primarily driven by continued investments in colleagues across competitive pay, incentives and benefits. Retaining and hiring the best talent is imperative to operate at a caliber needed to deliver our low single-digit sales CAGR target and a sustainable low double-digit adjusted EBITDA margin. We remain focused on increasing our productivity and managing controllable costs to align with our expense disciplines.However, as a result of the investments we have made and will continue to make in our people, we expect our 2023 SG&amp;A rate to delever. I will discuss this further in a few minutes. Within SG&amp;A, Macy's Media Network had net revenue of $57 million in the quarter and $144 million for the year, up 34% to 2021.Credit card revenues were $262 million, down $2 million from last year, but above our expectations. As a percent of net sales, credit card revenues were 3.2% or 20 basis points higher than the prior year, primarily benefiting from higher balances in the portfolio and better-than-expected bad debt levels. As Jeff mentioned, we expect the consumer to continue to be under pressure in 2023. Within our portfolio, we see higher credit usage trends, slower repayment rates and increasing bad debt levels. While not at 2019 levels, we are watching these metrics closely to get perspective on the consumer and the potential impact on credit card revenues, particularly profit share, which is the largest component of the credit revenue stream.In addition, we are reviewing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's proposed rule relating to late fees and are evaluating the implications that the proposed changes may have on the credit card program. Due to the uncertainty around the proposed rule, our outlook for 2023 does not reflect any estimate for potential impact.Fourth quarter diluted EPS was $1.88 versus $2.45 in 2021 and $2.12 in 2019. Adjusted EPS exceeded our expectations, even excluding benefits from the better-than-expected interest income due to higher interest rates and a lower effective tax rate, largely due to a favorable state income tax settlement. Lastly, the fifth value creation lever is capital allocation. We continue to take a balanced approach to capital allocation with an ongoing focus on maintaining a healthy balance sheet, investing in our business and returning capital to shareholders.In 2022, we generated $1.6 billion of operating cash flow compared to $2.7 billion last year. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to lower earnings and last year's receipt of the $582 million CARES Act refund in the fourth quarter. During the year, we invested $1.3 billion in capital expenditures, upwards roughly 2/3 related to enhanced omnichannel capabilities, digital and technology, data and analytics and supply chain modernization.Free cash flow inclusive of proceeds from real estate was an inflow of $457 million in 2022. Our focus and discipline around balance sheet health has contributed to strong leverage with an adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 2.0x, in line with our target. We have paid down over $1.8 billion of long-term debt since August 2021, inclusive of the $1.3 billion secured note we issued during COVID in June 2020, and have no material debt maturities until 2027.Additionally, we benefit from having fixed rate debt in a rising interest rate environment. Our balance sheet gives us the capacity to invest in initiatives that drive long-term profitable growth. We expect approximately $1 billion of capital spend in 2023. Over the next 3 years through 2025, we expect to spend up to $3 billion in total capital expenditures focused on digital and technology investments, data and analytics, supply chain modernization and omnichannel capabilities, including our growth vectors. We expect to continue returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and are pleased to have recently announced a 5% increase in our annual dividend, resulting in a quarterly dividend of $0.165 per share. We will continue to apply a thoughtful approach to excess cash with our remaining $1.4 billion share repurchase authorization. Next, I'll spend some time discussing 2023 guidance and expectations. Our 2023 outlook reflects heightened uncertainty surrounding both the consumer and the macro environment. We believe allocation of spend between goods and services and essentials and nonessentials will continue to shift away from discretionary categories. The low and high end of our guidance reflects various scenarios regarding the severity and duration of headwinds, offset by how we can and will respond. To pause on that, we believe our tools and processes give us the ability to navigate dynamic environments. We have the flexibility to respond to changing demand and the freshness customers are looking for. This is supported by financial and operational health.Before discussing our outlook, I have 2 housekeeping items. First, fiscal 2023 is a 53-week year. This is reflected in our guidance unless otherwise noted. Second, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we are planning to combine credit card revenues net and Macy's Media Networks net monetization revenue as part of our other revenue line item in our income statement to provide increased transparency. Historically, monetization revenue has been reported as an offset within SG&amp;A, while credit card revenue has been reported as its own net revenue line item.In conjunction with this change, we will begin presenting SG&amp;A and adjusted EBITDA as a percent of total revenues rather than net sales. Total revenues will include net sales and other revenue. Additional information on this presentation change, a reconciliation to prior years and full details of our 2023 guidance are available at the back of our earnings presentation on our website.For the full year, our expectations for Macy's, Inc. are as follows: Net sales of $23.7 billion to $24.2 billion, representing a low single-digit year-over-year decline, reflecting our view that the consumer will be more challenged in 2023 relative to 2022. Comparable sales on a 52-week owned plus licensed basis to be down approximately 2% to 4% year-over-year; digital as a percent of net sales to be roughly 32% to 34%; other revenue to be about 3.7% of net sales with credit card revenues accounting for approximately 84% of that. Our credit card revenue outlook assumes increased bad debt compared to 2022, reflecting recent credit card portfolio trends, a gross margin rate of 38.7% to 39.2%.Our disciplined approach to inventory management and pricing signs should result in lower markdowns and promotions year-over-year. We will continue to refine location-level pricing and expand machine learning pricing capabilities to automate strategic promotions from vendor direct inventory to owned inventory. Partially offsetting these benefits is the lapping of ticket increases in 2022 that we do not anticipate repeating.SG&amp;A as a percent of total revenue is expected to be about 35%, reflecting ongoing investments in our colleagues and infrastructure consistent with our focus on long-term profitable growth. On payroll, we see these investments in 3 ways: first, customer experience. Store productivity has increased over 20% since 2019. Our innovative selling model has improved productivity while providing a convenience and experiential in-store shopping journey. Second, we must pay competitively to recruit and retain the best talent. The strength of our colleagues is on full display with recent performance, where we achieved a 10.8% annual adjusted EBITDA margin rate despite a volatile macro environment.And third, the new capabilities we have and are continuing to build require different skill sets than we have historically needed. We have thoughtfully added dedicated teams to support growth, resulting in over 100 new colleagues. The capabilities we've added have helped support our operational strength and control and are critical to the success of our growth initiatives.For non-payroll expenses, which account for approximately 55% of our SG&amp;A, we managed well against inflation in 2022, achieving low single-digit growth despite roughly 6% increase in the consumer price index. We will continue to be disciplined with our expense management in 2023 and beyond. We expect asset sale gains of $60 million to $75 million, reflecting anticipated headwinds from rising interest rates. Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of total revenue of roughly 10% to 10.4% or 10.3% to 10.8% as a percent of net sales and interest expense of $165 million. After interest and taxes, we are estimating annual adjusted earnings per share of $3.67 to $4.11. Our adjusted EPS guidance does not assume any impact for potential share repurchases.As we think about the first half versus second half of 2023, we expect year-over-year sales performance to be softer in the first half. As a reminder, in the first half of 2022, the consumer was still benefiting from stimulus as well as they return to travel, occasions and events. This was particularly evident in the first quarter of 2022 when we posted a 13.6% year-over-year net sales increase, making it our strongest sales growth quarter of the year.In the second quarter, starting around Father's Day, we began to see a slowdown in pandemic-related categories, increasing inflationary pressures and savings rate declines, which impacted sales and gross margin. These pressures built through the year. In the second half, we are anniversarying an accelerated weakening of the consumer a shift in spend to services and essential goods and excess industry-wide inventories and composition misalignments, which subsequently led to heightened markdowns and promotions beginning in fall of 2022. For the first quarter of 2023, we expect net sales of $5 billion to $5.1 billion. Adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.42 to $0.48. In addition to the quarterly sales comparison I just discussed, our net sales outlook assumes that the stronger sales we experienced in the peak holiday season and into January do not continue as the consumer further depletes their savings and becomes even more selective in their spend across goods and services.Gross margin rate is expected to be down no more than 20 basis points for the first quarter of 2022, and our outlook also includes a $7 million asset sale gain we expect to recognize. End of quarter inventories are expected to be down mid-single digits to last year on a percentage basis. We have made great progress transforming our business. We have achieved financial and operational stability while navigating the past 3 years of global uncertainty. Now more than ever, we believe we are poised for long-term profitable growth, leading to additional shareholder value creation.With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.Jeffrey GennetteThanks, Adrian. So as we look to 2023 and beyond, we have the capabilities, infrastructure and discipline in place, supported by a highly engaged team that is incentivized to win. We are taking a prudent approach to our capital allocation to protect our financial health, which provides us with significant flexibility to respond to changing trends while also prioritizing our 5 growth vectors. This provides the fuel to achieve sales growth beginning in 2024. We look forward to sharing more on our progress in the coming quarters. And operator, we are now ready for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) The first question is coming from Brooke Roach of Goldman Sachs.Brooke Siler RoachJeff, can you elaborate a bit more on the inflection to positive sales and comp growth that you're expecting beginning in 2024. What gives you the confidence in that inflection against a choppy macro? And what are the key drivers there? And then perhaps for Adrian, can you also provide some additional context on how you're approaching sales guidance for 2023 and in particular, 1Q? Have you seen a deceleration in the consumer recently that's driving that conservatism?Jeffrey GennetteSo Brooke, and I'll take the first part to your question about -- so our growth outlook is really supported by the 5 growth vectors that we spoke to on the call. We're not ready to size each growth vector individually, but -- will definitely give everybody an update on that in the future. We're in the early innings of these growth vectors, but we've been building them for a couple of years, and we have a lot of confidence in them. So let me just kind of check through them.I think the first one is the private brands reimagination. So this is -- when you think about we are -- we started touching the private brands about 2 years ago with new talent that we brought in. We looked at existing brands that we wanted to reburnish, INC is a good example of that. And you saw in the fourth quarter, INC is our biggest and most powerful Macy brand, picked up 28% in the fourth quarter.The new brands start to launch in the back half of '23, and we have a very aggressive schedule going through all -- through 2025. Right now, private brands is about 16% of our business and we know that can grow. But it's lots of refreshed content replacement of existing brands and adding new brands.The second one is really off-price or off-mall expansion. And we're just really focused on unlocking the full potential of our off-mall fleet, knowing that what a storage base does to our overall omnichannel business. So I think the headline here is that the ones that we've opened, we have 8 on the Macy's side, 2 on the Bloomingdale side, when you look at those that have been opened more than a year and you look at the fourth quarter business, on the Macy's side, it picked up 8% in the fourth quarter, and the Bloomingdale side had picked up 12%. It's attracting a new raft of customers. It's helping the digital business in those ZIP codes. We are looking for -- we're going to be launching new ones in '23. And by the end of the year, we are hoping for a scalable model.If we look at the digital marketplace, so this is one that we launched in September of 2022. We ended the year with 500 brands and also 20 new categories. So aggressive schedule there. We're looking to add 2,000 more brands in '23 and importantly, we're launching the Bloomingdale's marketplace in the back half of this year. We talked about luxury brands. And so as we mentioned, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury as well as Macy's Beauty, where we have a lot of luxury offerings. But the Bloomingdale and Bluemercury had a record year in 2022. And Macy's Beauty with great strength in fragrance and skincare and color, we've added a number of brands with a lot more coming.So we're investing in both the online and the in-store remodels and experiences to really bolster that. I mean the last is really personalized offers and communications, which has so many benefits when you talk about relevancy of communication that goes to customers reducing -- giving value -- very specific targeted value to certain customers. And so we are running lots of tests. We're reaching tens of millions of customers. We've been -- we've always got something going on each week and we are very encouraged by the early results, but we're not expecting on this particular one to see meaningful benefit until the end of 2024.So all these initiatives are really intended to drive long-term profitable sales growth, which we're targeting to achieve in 2024 and beyond. So I'll -- we'll give you more updates as we get into all of our earnings calls, but I'll turn it over to Adrian for the second part of your question.Adrian V. MitchellThe first thing I would say is that we do enter 2023 in a position of strength. When you think about our disciplined inventories down 3% to last year, down 18% to 2019, our data-driven decisions, our financial and operational health, which from an execution standpoint, has been on display in 2022, we really step into 2023 with confidence. But we also recognize that the consumer remains under heightened pressure. So as we think about the sales guide path for 2023, let me just kind of walk through kind of how we thought about it, which will provide a bit more context on the improved trajectory that we see for 2023.So in the first quarter, if you reflect on 2022, the first quarter was our strongest quarterly year-over-year compare. We're up 13.6% last year in the first quarter. And this was a point in time when we were effectively -- government stimulus was still out there. There was a clear resurgence in terms of return to work, occasion, travel, and there was inventory constraints that we're really beginning to loosen but still a little bit tight at that point in time.As we got into the second quarter, the consumer was still relatively healthy, and inflationary pressures began to intensify as consumers begin to reallocate from goods to services. So we saw that pivot begin to kind of pick up and as the supply chains loosened and inventory really flowed into the retail context, the promotional landscape began to intensify.Now as we think about the third and fourth quarters, the macro pressures, the excess inventory surpluses, the continued inflation really created a lot of challenges that you're very aware of as we think about the third and fourth quarters. So as we think about the compare to last year, you have an intensifying period over the course of last year. And what we're saying is that we expect to have more of a recovery as we think about our trajectory from the first quarter to the second quarter as well as targeting sales growth in 2024.And we assume that this growth that we expect in 2024 will remain in a situation where the consumer remains under pressure. But given the growth vectors that we've discussed, we have confidence that we can achieve that growth by 2024 from an annual basis. So that gives you a little bit of a sense of the composition. Now as we think about the fourth quarter, the only thing I would add is we learned a lot about gifting in 2022. That was a real strength for us and we're excited about what we're actually positioning ourselves to do in the fourth quarter of 2023. So that certainly gives us confidence in addition to the 53rd week, which we'll benefit from in the fourth quarter.OperatorThe next question is coming from Oliver Chen of TD Cowen.Oliver ChenYou gave a lot of helpful comments on a cautious consumer. What's in your control as you think about the product assortment and the switch of the consumer demand? And as we model forward, what are you embedding for traffic? Do you expect traffic to continue to be fairly volatile. And lastly, the younger customer, as you intersect the brand renovation and private brands, what's top of mind for captivating and getting the younger customer into the store.Jeffrey GennetteSo let's talk about it. When you think about Oliver and your 3 questions on product assortment, we see similar trends to what we're seeing right now. So you basically have occasion-based categories that are still strong. And so when you look at what's going on in dress up, when you look at luggage categories like that, those will continue. We do have those models, the pace to start to abate as you get into the back half of the year, but still strong.When you look at the businesses right now that have been quite challenged for us, the pandemic categories, we do actually expect them to start to pick up as we get into the back half. I think the big thing when you look at our disciplines and what we've done with inventory control is that we're ready to be able to pivot where the customer goes on this. We're watching this very carefully, we look at our trend curves, we look at what's going on in Bloomingdale's, which is, in many cases, early warning for us about things that are really doing well or will do well and those that are starting to taper off. The liquidity that we built into our open to buy is really gives us the flexibility what we call dry powder to be able to respond to where the customer is going. So we have done that well. We controlled our inventories, and we are very disciplined about how we're allocating receipts.With respect to traffic, traffic has been relatively good. We expect that to continue. The consumer is still healthy. And we're looking at conversions across both online and in-store to ensure that we are maximizing all that traffic that we're getting. But the consumer is under pressure. And so -- and we expect what we saw, particularly with self-purchase that we quoted in the beginning of January, but that's going to continue all the way through 2023. So our guidance anticipates that.And then to your question about the younger customer, clearly, there are categories right now that we're winning very much with the younger customer. We expect those to continue, where we have market share strength there. And then there's categories when we look at apparel. So the comment about private brand reimagination is really going to respond to all the life stages, which includes kind of the Gen Z and the alpha customer. And so looking forward to sharing those opportunities in the future as well as this younger customer and how we can take care of them with other offerings, particularly marketplace. So that is very much in our mind when you look at the new categories that we're adding, the new brands that we're adding and look at this younger consumer and the opportunity to address them that way. And what we're seeing for marketplace is categories that are doing well, we have the opportunity to bring them into our own format in the future. We're evaluating that right now based on early learnings we're getting from successes on marketplace. So the younger consumer is clearly in our sights.OperatorThe next question is coming from Chuck Grom of Gordon Haskett.Charles P. GromGreat execution, guys. Curious what you're seeing on spend across some of your different income cohorts, the low end and at the high end. And then, Adrian, I think the real surprise here this morning is a gross margin guide, which obviously demonstrates a lot of confidence. So just wondering if you can dive into that, particularly things that you can control in terms of pricing on a localization level and other factors that give you that confidence that you can hit 38.7% to 39.2% in this year?Jeffrey GennetteChuck, it's Jeff. So I'll start with your question about income tiers, and then I'll throw it to Adrian to talk about gross margins. So what I'd say is that all income tiers are going to be pressured in '23. As we've seen since the second quarter, we've actually seen very similar trends across income tiers of Macy's. So really, for the last 2 quarters. I guess the good news on this is that we have a broad range of categories and price points that we get a lean into, the inventory discipline, the open to buy. I think the big thing to remember is what we did in really the beginning of 2020 when we went to kind of an upfront net cost model with most of our suppliers and massively reduced the reliance on markdown allowances.The other thing that we did at the same time was that we based our incentives for our merchants on the enterprise sales versus their functional sales. That really made receipt and markdowns to be an enterprise opportunity. And it gave us then the opportunity particularly what you're going to see in '23 to layer in these open-to-buy reserves on top of a more conservative view and a more cautious view of where the consumer is going. So that is -- we've been able to respond to that.I think when you look at it from off-price to luxury, when you look at our nameplates and our brands, what we're seeing is that the consumer is pressured. I would like to comment about luxury. So luxury just continues to have strength. When you look at the loyalist program at Bloomingdale's, that spend was up 7% in the fourth quarter. And the top of the list, which is the top of that, which is a big chunk of the overall business and very profitable business, that was up 9%. So we expect -- when you think about share of wallet, we have opportunity to capture more and particularly that top of the list in that luxury consumer. They're really spending where they're scarcity and where they're specialness. So while we're doing at Bluemercury, what we're doing at Bloomingdale's and what we're doing in the beauty area of Macy's, is really helping our customers see us as a place where they can buy these categories because they're so discerning in their purchases. So where we see (inaudible) Macy's strengths, we've got a model that is ready to respond to all income types.Adrian V. MitchellChuck, so as it relates to our gross margin outlook for 2023, I think one of the things that's been very consistent that you've heard from us is our commitment to margin expansion as well as our commitment to inventory productivity. And so overall, as you look at 2023, we're looking to have lower markdowns, more effective promotions to offset partially by lower ticket price increases. But let me just kind of give you a little bit of a complexion of the 3 things that we're focused on.The first is healthy inventories. So when you think about inventory being down 3% to 2021, which 2021 was a year of inventory scarcity, our inventory composition as well as our levels are actually quite healthy. So the strength of freshness and to be able to sell through the items that we put in front of the customer, that's something that we're pretty excited about and we have the flexibility in our open to buy reserve to respond to sales demand signals to be able to get and maintain the right composition throughout the season.The second thing is really more focused on compelling promotional events and reducing our broad-based promotions while levering up our personalized offers and communications so that we can have more regular priced sell-throughs. We've already tested with millions of customers, our personalized offered communications thus far this year. We're pleased with the results that we're seeing. And in combination with that, we're really committed to not chasing unprofitable sales. That served us well in the fourth quarter, and that will also continue to be a principle as we get into the new year.The third is really the mix of categories. We've been very disciplined operationally in terms of how we think about the pivot of the customer and where he or she is spending. And so we're going to continue to do that. But we feel that freshness, fashion and newness is going to allow us to have more full price sell-through, which is going to be able to help our gross margin. So when you think about opportunities like dresses, and men's tailored that's not offered at scale and value retailers. We're just very well positioned for that kind of mix around the full price sell-through to really enhance our gross margin throughout the year.So those are the things that we're excited about. We're continuing to look at things like freight and raw material costs and opportunities there. We feel good about the progress that we've made there. But fundamentally, we've just been very disciplined on all the levers around gross margin and already have the momentum and traction to bring that into 2023.OperatorThe next question is coming from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan.Matthew Robert BossSo maybe 2-part question. Jeff, when you think beyond this year about the sustainable topline model moving forward, where do you see white space market share opportunity? And do you see expansion opportunity given the lateral store closures that appear to be picking back up? And then Adrian, is it high 30s for gross margin in terms of the profile multiyear? And can you leverage the expense base at low single digit -- at low single-digit sales growth.Jeffrey GennetteMatt, so I think the white space question is related to how many categories or customers signaling interest in Macy's. I think we're learning a lot from marketplace. And categories that when you think about video games, you think about electronics that were the most popular categories on marketplace during the fourth quarter. We're learning a lot about some of the apparel businesses and categories that we have added or brands that we have added. So there is big opportunity with that.When you look at some of our lease opportunities and what we've been able to do, Pandora is a great example of that, that has immediately energized our entire jewelry floor at big productivity level increases from what we had previously. We're going to be expanding that. So we're looking at all of the categories where we are -- we play in and what's our opportunity to narrow our assortment on the most important things and expand in areas that are not. We're looking at it by customer type. So to Oliver's earlier question about when you look at Gen Z and alpha, what are those categories that they want to traffic in. And what's the best way for us to bring that to market. From an owned model, it may not be profitably -- we may not get the ROI on that, but on marketplace, it makes a great deal of sense.So expect us to look at the full portfolio. We have a big tent, we do when you think about opening price, if you think about our off-price business is going out below $20, you look at Macy's going out in the $40 range across the same categories and Bloomingdale's is more than double that. So depending on where those income tiers are and where those customers are, we're looking at our full arsenal between VDF, hybrid marketplace and owned to be able to respond to that. And we now have the tools to be able to do that. When we look at it in the context of market share gains and new customers, we're really looking at, and white space for us would also be customers that would consider our brands, but don't go to data on them because they don't find or brick-and-mortar, particularly convenient. So there may be places -- even though we're in 49 of the top 50 markets, there's many ZIP codes where we don't penetrate because customers are going to off-mall and that's how they're satisfying their needs. That's why we're so excited about what we're looking at in terms of Market by Macy's and Bloomie's. So expect us to continue to fortify that. When we do that, the digital flywheel and the omnichannel business, starts humming. So that's how we're looking at where we're going to go with white space and new customer opportunities.Adrian V. MitchellMatt, so to answer your question very simply on gross margin, we remain very focused on high 30s in terms of our gross margin rate. The thing to keep in mind is as we continue to scale Macy's media network, continue to scale marketplace, those are additional profit pools that will certainly strengthen our margin profile. But you also raised an important question about SG&amp;A. So let me spend a little bit of time on that because I think it's important to mention for us to understand. The first thing is, in 2020, we were very committed through Polaris to reset our cost base, and we actually did that. So if you look at 2019 versus today, we have about 30,000 colleagues less in the workforce, that's about 27% less colleagues on sales in 2022 that's relatively comparable to 2019 levels.But the important thing we have to keep in mind is that we cannot fuel growth without investing in our talent. And this was on display in 2022 when you think about the quality of execution and the success that we've had with the priorities that we've committed to over the course of the last couple of years. So that really was on display last year. But let me just dimensionalize our payroll investments and speak to our successes on the non-payroll side. On the payroll side, as we make investments in talent, the first and foremost thing is around the customer experience. And what we've done in terms of in-store and supply chain is as of May, we've actually have nationwide $15 minimum pay, but the important thing is that we're continuing to see productivity, for example, in our stores, above 20% relative to 2019. The second piece is really around competitive pay. We have to retain and attract the top talent to execute at the level that we need to, to really think about growth in 2024 and beyond. And so you are very familiar with our growth vectors, but it's about having the right team to deliver the kind of execution that we need to really win.The last piece is really around the capabilities, and we've talked about this quite a bit over the years and really excited about the traction that we've been getting. You're seeing data and analytics as a new capability, not a capability we had several years ago, and our pricing science has really served us well. Marketplace is now officially launched that didn't exist 6 months ago. Private brands, we've made investments, and as we've talked about, we see growth opportunity there. Personalization is another dimension, Macy's media network. So building new capabilities requires talented individuals from the industry and we've been able to attract and retain those individuals.We do consider the way that we've managed non-payroll expense is a win for us. When we look at the data, the consumer price index is in the range of about 6%, some indices seem to be a little bit higher, but we were low single digits during that period. So we've been very disciplined on that side. That being said, we remain committed to a double-digit -- low double-digit EBITDA profile on net sales and total revenue, and that's about discipline as we move forward.OperatorThe next question is coming from Alex Straton of Morgan Stanley.Alexandra Ann StratonReally 2 pieces. First is that you're already hitting this low double-digit adjusted EBITDA margin target. And I think that was your kind of longer-term, so a nice outcome there. So maybe is that still the right long-term target? Or what are some puts and takes there? And then secondly, just following up on the luxury piece and the questions earlier. I just wanted to zoom out, it sounds like you're incrementally positive on Bloomie's and Bluemercury as a part of the bigger luxury strategy. And I know some of the competitors in this space are struggling. So maybe you could help us understand how that opportunity has changed in the market broadly compared to, say, pre-COVID? Or if you're thinking about it any differently than you did then?Jeffrey GennetteAlexa, so let me start with luxury and then I'll throw it to Adrian to talk about the double-digit EBITDA profile and how we're kind of thinking about that in the future. So -- we are bullish on luxury. And this is a share gain for us in terms of going after the luxury opportunities. You have a customer that remains healthy. They have the resources. As I mentioned, they're really spending where there is scarcity and specialness. So the full omnichannel experience is quite important. What is the experience like online, what is it in stores, what it is, in many cases, there is a colleague, customer relationship that is quite developed. And they're very discerning our customers on their purchases. So how do we think about that? So we are definitely committed to additional market share in -- particularly when you think about Bloomingdale's and you look at Bluemercury. So when you think about how that manifests when you look at Bloomingdale's. So we have really want to be that customer's consideration for a multi-brand upscale retail option. We just finished our 150th anniversary at Bloomingdale's and spent a lot of time on content -- exclusive content and really developing strong mutually productive relationships with established luxury brands. And this can be approachable to aspirational, a real curated expansion of luxury labels that our customers love. And those are adding new content, not only on the website, but in individual stores is -- and these can have huge effects on overall comps. So we're very focused on that. We're using data and analytics. We're leaning into the breadth of offering to ensure that we have the right content. I pointed to a couple of areas that we're really focused on would be the luxury offerings as well as the advanced contemporary offerings so that when you walk into a Bloomingdale, so you go on to the website, you know clearly what we stand for and to -- and that we believe is going to yield as it has in 2022, continued market share gains.I think when you think about Bluemercury, and that had an outstanding year. And when you look at that new management team is doing a great job on their -- a lot of work on the horizon now. And so when you think about the strength that we have in proprietary brands there, it's a big chunk of the business. When you look at what they're doing, they got a 12% increase in active customers in 2022. So we are definitely focused on reinvigoring the client experience, refreshing the assortment and services because of the spy element of that to really cement us as a beauty authority in those price ranges. We're adding a rotation of brands in the cachet discovering platform, which is similar to what Bloomingdale's is doing with their carousel program. And we're expanding our footprint in high-potential markets and neighborhoods. And as I mentioned, when you think about Macy's, when we're having a strong year as well as it's been for a while in terms of the beauty area. So we're actively renovating our beauty departments as well as refreshing our website. We're renovating roughly 8 to 10 stores a year, and we're really doing that by sizing down our existing offers and then expanding it with great brands that we're adding. So I mentioned them in the call about what those are.I think just -- for those of you that who are in New York, come to the Flower Show that we're coming, which is going to be in a couple of weeks, this Dior Made with Love is a massive collaboration we've done with a very important luxury brand that is really showing us as a fragrance destination, but married with the assets of what a true luxury brand can do with a retailer like Macy's Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury. So just -- that I think will give you the spirit of what we're looking to continue to expand at scale.Adrian V. MitchellAlex, I'll be very sustained on your question. So first and foremost, look, we are certainly focused on long-term sustainable growth. And that's really around low single-digit growth on owned plus licensed sales as well as total revenue. And as Jeff shared, there are clear a number of vectors that we're excited about at different levels of scale and maturity. But the most important thing is we've actually built that foundation in 2021 and 2022. We'll continue to complete a lot of our testing in pilot in 2023, but we're excited about the growth profile in 2024 and beyond. From a low double-digit EBITDA standpoint, we view that in terms of percent of revenue go forward. Starting in the first quarter, we will begin to report on a total revenue basis, but we are committed to that. We're committed to the growth vectors and the margin expansion vectors that will get us there.OperatorThe next question is coming from Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group.Dana Lauren TelseyAs you think about the merchandise margin, which I believe was down around 300 basis points, how are you thinking about that going forward and especially the cadence as we move through the year? And on the data science journey, which seems to be very effective, how far along are you on that data science journey? Is there more to capture? And then just lastly, what are you seeing in shrink? How is that impact and how you're planning?Adrian V. MitchellTerrific. So with regards to merchandise margin, we feel good coming into the year. So much of our merchandise margin is dependent on our inventory position, not just the level of inventory, but the composition and where we tend to win as having fresh inventory where we can get full price sell-through and our multi-category flexibility helps us quite a bit as well.As you can imagine, over the last year, we pivoted into occasion base and away from casual and that has served us well. But when the customer comes back, we'll be able to respond well. I think the disciplines around the open to buy to really respond to demand signals in local markets is going to serve us quite well. So we feel very good about that. We're in the, I would say, mid to late innings on data science. The reality is, given what we're learning, it seems like the journey is not done. We continue to find more and more opportunities to expand margin profile through our data science. So it's really fascinating to see the insights that are coming through the learnings we saw in 2022, but we'll definitely take the opportunity to lean into the data at a much more granular level to make sure that we're finding even more margin opportunity. So there's more upside for us, and we'll be very clear about that as we continue to progress. As we think about our shrink levels, I'll have Jeff speak to that briefly.Jeffrey GennetteDana, so shortage was worse than anticipated. And I think as you're hearing from other posts, it's an industry-wide trend. We definitely had an uptick since last year. Two factors. One is the shift -- the channel shift that you have going from digital back to stores. So obviously, you have more porous forgers in your stores than you do in your warehouses that are fulfilling most of your digital orders. So that was anticipated. And then you do have heightened fact in particular pockets of the country and we are working aggressively with our teams and local officials on how we can better protect our assets in the future.OperatorThe next question is coming from Paul Lejuez of Citigroup.Tracy Jill KoganIt's Tracy Kogan filling in for Paul. I just wanted to ask a quick follow-up on the last question on shrink. I was just wondering how much it pressured your margins this quarter? And then separately, you guys talked about changing the way you incentivize buyers. And I'm wondering if you've had enough time, I'm not sure if you put that in place just in 4Q or a little bit earlier, but if you had enough time to see if it's actually changing behaviors.Jeffrey GennetteLet's talk about shrink first. So as we reported it as when we talked about it at ICR, whereas we built that into our reserve. And so recognizing the trends have RFID on virtually everything that we do. So we're doing daily counts on our content. So we really know what's going on in the course of our buildings. And so we build that into our shortage reserve and whereas that went higher, we built that into our expectations when we revised our posts or our guidance in the end of January. As it relates to your conversation about higher incentives. About higher incentives, that's been in place really since the beginning of 2020. So when we went to the net cash cost model, we basically then looked at not only our bonuses, but also how we incent our colleagues based on what they get in their annual reviews. So that is not a temporary and was not a recent action. It's been in place now for over 2 years.Tracy Jill KoganAnd has it changed buying behavior? Has it -- I assume if it's continuing, it's kind of having the effect that you want.Jeffrey GennetteYes. When you think about it, a plan is on the second -- the new season starts because of all -- we're making adjustments on our plans constantly based on customers. So to be able to react in real time to where customers are signaling interest with what you do with receipts and what you do with markdowns, and how you pull that back into, you might have somebody that is planning a business at a particular level, and it's much stronger than that. You want to make sure you're giving them the receipts and according markdowns to be able to fuel that business. And somebody that is slowing down from an original plan, you want to be able to do that. If you've got those buyers that are owning those particular relationships and they're incented on the original plan, that's going to incent bad behavior. And what you really want to do is make sure that you've got behavior that is incenting where the customer is going. So I think it absolutely has changed the way that our teams are approaching being much more customer-centric and using the assets that we have to respond to that in real time.OperatorThe next question is coming from Bob Drbul of Guggenheim Partners.Robert Scott DrbulJust a couple of questions just around pricing and AURs. When you look at what's happening with the consumer, a number of your vendors have worked to take prices higher and AURs higher. I'm just wondering, do you see -- any reason to believe that some of the prices will need to come down? Or do you feel good about some of these initiatives that have taken place. I just wonder if you can maybe comment on that, that would be helpful.Jeffrey GennetteSo let me talk a little bit about AUR and then have Adrian kind of reinforce what we're doing with pricing to support that. I think what we're expecting is when you looked at 2022, we had an increase of about 4% in overall AUR. And that was largely ticket increases. I think what you're going to see in 2023 is there is going to be an increase in ticket prices but not near the level that it was in '22.And so when you look at the big change for us in terms of AUR is just having less and lower clearance markdowns that is moving through in the degradation of your overall AUR. We're going to have targeted promotions versus as broad-based as they used to be. And with a rightsized inventory that is really tied to sales demand in real time to customers, it's never perfect, but we're getting better at allocation. We're getting much better at really understanding where the customer is going in terms of potential trends and we're getting better with pricing science, which I'll turn it over to Adrian to give you some feedback on that.Adrian V. MitchellAbsolutely. And Bob, I would just reinforce the thesis that Jeff described, which is inventory health is the gift that keeps on giving. The reality is that it spills into allocation, it spills into full price sell-through. And our discipline was initially the level, then we pivoted to the level of composition and now we're into things like the appropriate allocation by market, by store by channel, so it's really a discipline that we continue to mine for additional benefits.The pricing science is highly linked to that. We talked a couple of years ago about location-level pricing that is fairly scaled at this point where we're able to really look at style, by location to be able to understand what is the optimal price to maximize margin. We've added the dimension of dynamic pricing, which allows us to really understand depending on a moment in time, what's happening in the industry and how we need to respond, but also, I think the next lever that we're thinking through quite a bit is this notion of personalized customer-centric offers and communication, which really allows us to begin to go after a reduced broad-based promotional platform. And that's a tremendous opportunity. We're very excited about what we've seen in our tests. So overall, I would say there is more to come, but the pricing science capabilities continue to grow, to continue to expand and continue to get more sophisticated. And with that will come even more margin health.OperatorThe next question is coming from Ashley Helgans of Jefferies.Ashley Elizabeth HelgansMost of our questions have been answered. Just wanted to ask one on digital versus stores. So stores obviously had a really strong year this year. A year ago, you talked about achieving low to mid-40s digital penetration by 2024. Just was wondering if you could provide -- or are you providing any update on that target, looks like it will be around 32% to 34% this year. I know you have marketplace scaling for both Macy's and Bloomie's. So just how focused are you on still scaling digital to that level? And then Adrian, maybe how does that digital target impact to your long-term margin goals?Jeffrey GennetteLet's talk about, so digital obviously grew significantly over 2019. And when you look at our business in 2022, it was up 31% versus 2019, with traffic up 7% and conversion up 11%, but definitely a drop off from where we were in '21. So kind of going through digital penetration through the years, it was at 25% in '19. In the pandemic, it was -- it hit the 40% level. In 2021, it abated and went to 35%. 2022, it went to 33%. And into your comment, we do see it stabilizing right now at the 32% to 34% range. So that reset has really now occurred post pandemic, and we have a new baseline for digital penetration in '23. But we do believe that digital will grow in the future. And you mentioned in one of the big ones for us is not only getting better with functionality and experience but also what we can do with Marketplace. So we have a lot of work for us -- ahead for us on that, but we're quite excited about the early learnings in that. We've done a lot on our website. We've done a lot of our mobile app. I mentioned marketplace but we're leaving no stone unturned in terms of our opportunities in digital because part of the omnichannel flywheel is our presence there and how that basically addresses all the customer needs.Adrian V. MitchellAs we think about the destination for us, it's really -- as Jeff described, a digitally connected omnichannel ecosystem. The stores matter, the digital matter, but how do you really integrate that in a very seamless way that's what the customer is looking for. When we think about our margin profile, we are focused on the low double-digit EBITDA as a percent of total revenue going forward. And that's something that -- we have a lot of conviction around. When you think about the growth of the digital channel, it's important to keep in mind that even though there may be an expense dimension, for example, parcel expense on the gross margin line, you do get a lot of SG&amp;A leverage. So as we think about the composition of our digital penetration versus store penetration, we're obviously very focused on the impact of the different line items, but ultimately, what is the bottom line margin profile that, that delivers for us. The other benefit as we think about digital is the expansion of capabilities that we've added. So when you think about margin health and you think about the flexibility of selling products on the own platform versus the vendor direct platform versus the marketplace platform, that's an additional opportunity for us to optimize our profit profile. So we tend to look at a metric called dead net profit. So as you can imagine, as we think about our marketplace profitability, there may be owned items that are more profitable on marketplace and so that's an opportunity for additional margin expansion. So those are the kinds of operational things that we're going after. But from a digital standpoint, we have many, many vectors to protect our margin expansion goals with various levels of digital penetration.OperatorAt this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Gennette for closing comments.Jeffrey GennetteSo thank you, everybody, for your interest in Macy's, Inc. brands, and we look forward to updating you on our 5 growth vectors on our first quarter earnings call.

M reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein both the top and the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but declined from the respective year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figures. Comparable sales fell on an owned basis and an owned-plus-licensed basis.Management believes that the Polaris Strategy positions M well to navigate the dynamic retail landscape. Also, both Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury brands outperformed in the said quarter.Shares of Macy’s have increased 19.4% over the past three months compared with the industry’s 13.7% gain.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSales &amp; Earnings PictureMacy’s, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), reported adjusted earnings of $1.88 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57 and our estimate of $1.56. However, the bottom line declined from the adjusted earnings of $2.45 reported in the year-ago fiscal period.Net sales of $8,264 million came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,222 million and our estimate of $8,190.2 million. However, the top line dipped 4.6% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure. Comparable sales fell 3.3% on an owned basis and 2.7% on an owned-plus-licensed basis from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s tally. The metric fared better than our estimate of a 4.2% fall on an owned basis and a 4% decline on an owned-plus-licensed basis.Macy’s’ digital sales dropped 9% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s level. Approximately 68% of digital sales came from mobile devices. Stores fulfilled 33% of digital sales in the quarter. Brick-and-mortar sales dipped 2% year over year.Digital penetration was 37%, 40% and 23% at Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury brands, respectively, during the quarter under discussion.Net credit card revenues were $262 million, down 0.8% from the year-ago fiscal period’s level, mainly benefiting from increased balances in the portfolio and better-than-anticipated bad debt levels. The metric represented 3.2% of sales, up 20 basis points from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level.Story continuesBrand-Wise DetailsComparable sales across Macy’s declined 3.9% on an owned basis and 3.3% on an owned-plus-licensed basis. On a trailing 12-month basis, 42.7 million active customers shopped the Macy’s brand, down 4% from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level. Star Rewards program members accounted for roughly 70% of the overall Macy's brand owned-plus-licensed sales, up about 1 percentage point year over year.At the Bloomingdale brand, comparable sales increased 1.2% on an owned basis and 0.6% on an owned-plus-licensed basis. Management informed that 4.1 million active customers shopped the Bloomingdale’s brand on a trailing 12-month basis, reflecting an increase of 5% from the year-ago fiscal period’s level. Under the Bloomingdale banner, strength in luxury along with its 150th Anniversary activation and robust customer engagement aided growth.Comparable sales at the Bluemercury brand were up 7.2% on an owned basis. About 662,000 active customers shopped the Bluemercury brand on a trailing 12-month basis, representing a 12% increase from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s level.MarginsThe gross margin came in at 34.1%, down from 36.5% in the prior-year fiscal quarter’s level. The decline from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s level was due to a 300-basis point contraction in the merchandise margin as a result of planned markdowns and promotions that were higher year over year. Delivery expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 60 basis points lower from the year-ago fiscal period due to a contraction of 200 basis points in digital penetration coupled with reduced peak delivery surcharges.SG&amp;A expenses dipped 1.2% from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s reported figure to $2,399 million. As a percentage of net sales, SG&amp;A expenses increased 100 basis points year over year to 29%.Macy’s reported an adjusted EBITDA of $910 million, down from an adjusted EBITDA of $1,247 million in the year-ago fiscal quarter. We note that the adjusted EBITDA margin shriveled 340 basis points to 11% from the prior-year fiscal period’s level.Other Financial AspectsMacy’s ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $862 million, a long-term debt of $2,996 million and shareholders' equity of $4,082 million. M’s inventories were 3% lower than fiscal 2021.During fiscal 2022, M repurchased 24 million shares worth $600 million and paid out $173 million as dividends. Macy’s had $1.4 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorization.During fiscal 2022, Macy’s generated cash flow from operating activities of $1,615 million and incurred capital expenditures of $1.3 billion. It generated a free cash flow of $457 million. Management expects capital expenditures of $1 billion for fiscal 2023.A Sneak Peek of GuidanceManagement highlighted that the highly volatile macroeconomic environment will persist in 2023. The outlook for 2023 is presented on a 53-week basis. Net sales are projected to be $23.7-$24.2 billion, down 1-3% from 2022. Comparable owned plus licensed sales on a 52-week basis are expected to decline 2-4% year over year. Digital sales are likely to be roughly 32-34% of net sales.Other revenues are likely to be nearly 3.7% of net sales (credit card revenues make up for roughly 84% of the other revenues). The gross margin is anticipated to be 38.7-39.2% for the fiscal year. SG&amp;A expense rate is expected to be roughly 35% of the total revenues, while adjusted EBITDA margin is estimated to be nearly 10-10.4% of the total revenues. Adjusted earnings per share are envisioned in the bracket of $3.67-$4.11 for the fiscal year, down from $4.48 earned last fiscal.For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, management anticipates net sales between $5 and$5.1 billion versus $5.4 billion delivered last fiscal. It projected adjusted earnings of 42-48 cents a share for the first quarter, suggesting a decrease from $1.08 reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Macy’s expects the gross margin rate to shrivel not more than 20 basis points from the prior-year fiscal period’s level, implying the impacts of lower markdowns and promotions, partly offset by the lapping of higher tickets. Ending first-quarter inventories are likely to be down mid-single digits versus the prior-year period on a percentage basis.Three Top Retail StocksWe have highlighted three top-ranked stocks, namely Abercrombie &amp; Fitch ANF, American Eagle Outfitters AEO and Boot Barn BOOT.Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, a leading casual apparel retailer, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Now I'd like to hand the call over to Don Zurbay.Story continuesDonald J. ZurbayThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter fiscal 2023 results. We appreciate your interest in Patterson Companies. We had a very good third quarter, reflecting the successful execution of our strategy to create value for both our customers and our shareholders. Overall, for our fiscal third quarter, we delivered internal sales growth of 2% year-over-year as a modest decline in our Dental segment was more than offset by growth in our Animal Health segment. We achieved adjusted operating margin expansion for the overall business and within both our Dental and Animal Health segments, demonstrating our ongoing strategic focus on operational excellence, improved mix and disciplined expense management. And ultimately, we generated adjusted earnings of $0.62 per diluted share, an increase of 13% over last year's third quarter. As a result of our progress through the first 3 quarters and our expectations for the final months of our fiscal year, we remain on track to achieve the internal sales growth and adjusted operating margin expansion goals we outlined at the beginning of the year. And we narrowed our fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings guidance to $2.25 to $2.30 per diluted share. Our continued strong performance reflects the resolute commitment to our proven strategy and its key areas of focus. In the third quarter, we continued to deepen the value proposition we offer our customers. This included completing 2 strategic acquisitions in the Animal Health segment that enhance our offerings, investing in a cutting-edge, highly sustainable warehouse facility in the U.K. to expand our presence in that region, rolling out improvements to our Dental customer loyalty program, Patterson Advantage and strengthening our supply chain through onshoring collaborations with our manufacturing partners. This ongoing work to deepen the value we provide Dental and Animal Health customers differentiates Patterson and makes us an indispensable partner, not just a distributor. We also made progress enhancing our margin performance with a focus on operational excellence, improved mix and thoughtful planning with our strategic manufacturer partners. This is evident in our operating margin expansion within each of our 2 segments and enterprise-wide. And finally, we remain committed to managing the organization with a keen focus on cost discipline. We continue to focus on running a rigorous process for this discipline and return on our investments. Before I move on to a more detailed discussion of our segment performance, I want to highlight 2 important leadership appointments we made in the third quarter. First, Kevin Barry was named our Chief Financial Officer. Kevin's career demonstrates a successful track record of creating more efficient cost structures, driving cash flow and generating value for shareholders. Kevin has been an integral member of the finance organization of Patterson for several years, and I'm confident in the direction of the finance organization under his leadership. Kevin (inaudible) on maintaining Patterson's balanced capital allocation approach to drive long-term value creation. Second, we created the new role of Chief Operating Officer to enhance our accountability and focus on leveraging the value of our total enterprise to drive efficiency and improve performance. Our Dental and Animal Health segments cater to different end users that share key characteristics across their operations and end markets. I believe there is considerable opportunity to drive increased synergy to build upon the competitive advantages we have across those markets. None is better suited to lead this initiative than Kevin Pohlman, most recently President of Patterson Animal Health. Kevin is a proven operator with a strong track record of performance improvement and serving customers. In this new role, Kevin has been working to identify opportunities to improve operations and optimize performance. He has also established a Patterson operating leadership team comprised of key leaders in both segments to further strengthen alignment and adoption of best practices across the organization. The businesses that comprise Patterson's Animal Health segment will be overseen by their existing leaders: George Henriques, President of Companion Animal; and Steve Cunningham, President of Production Animal. Tim Rogan will continue to lead the Dental segment as its President. Patterson has a deep bench of highly capable executive leaders who are instrumental in developing and implementing Patterson's strategy. I believe these enhancements to the executive leadership team best position Patterson to achieve our goals and drive long-term shareholder value. Now I'll turn to our segment performance, starting with Dental. Our third quarter Dental segment internal sales decreased about 4% year-over-year primarily driven by a decline in digital and CAD/CAM technology products and deflationary impacts on our infection control consumables category. Nonetheless, outstanding execution by our teams enabled our Dental segment to maintain double-digit operating margins and deliver year-over-year operating margin expansion. We remain focused on advancing and strengthening key margin enhancement initiatives. In consumables, our internal sales in the third quarter declined low single digits year-over-year due to the persistent deflationary impact of certain infection control products. However, excluding infection control products, our consumables category grew approximately 5% in the fiscal third quarter. We provide a broad range of infection control products, and demand for these offerings remain strong in comparison to pre-COVID levels as dentists have adapted to meet a higher standard of care. As we have previously discussed, improvements in the global supply chain for certain infection control products have resulted in considerable pricing declines from the pandemic highs for certain products in this category. While we believe pricing has largely stabilized, the comparison to elevated pricing is expected to continue throughout fiscal 2024. Our non-infection control portfolio continues to perform well as our broad offering, including private label products, appeals to customers across the dental market from independent private practices to regional and national DSOs. The combined power of our offering and our tenured knowledgeable sales force enabled Patterson to outperform the market in this category. We're proud of our standout culture and talented team, and we'll continue to invest in this area to deliver sustained organic growth. In our equipment category, third quarter internal sales declined in the high single digits year-over-year driven by a decline in digital and CAD/CAM technology products. Equipment sales can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter largely due to a variety of external factors that influence the timing of sales, including the timing of new innovation, promotional programs and upgrade cycles as well as product quality and availability. In our 2023 third quarter, we lapped the execution of a major upgrade program in the CAD/CAM category, which had a notable impact on the year-over-year comparison. What's important to recognize are the longer-term trends. The growing use of digital technology enables dentists to offer improved patient experience with a higher level of oral health care. That improved experience drives demand for innovation among both dentists and patients and supports a long runway of growth over time. When there's new technology in the marketplace, Patterson is best positioned to sell, finance, install and service that technology with a complete life cycle of those investments. Our long-term results support that. Over the last 8 quarters, our average year-over-year growth in dental equipment is over 13%. This substantial growth reflects the value proposition Patterson offers our customers in the dental equipment category and our market-leading capability to deliver and support new technology innovation from our manufacturer partners for dental customers. Importantly, we drove double-digit growth in core equipment in the third quarter as we continue to execute on and sustain a backlog of core equipment orders. Performance in this category demonstrates that dentists are making equipment investments to keep their practices fresh and running well. During the third quarter, our dental value-added services category delivered solid mid-single-digit growth driven by broader adoption of our desktop and cloud-based practice management software solutions, the foundation of a modern dental practice and demand for our field technical service offering, which we have enhanced with new productivity tools.Looking ahead, the Dental business is poised to benefit from resilient secular tailwinds, including an aging population, demand for practice modernization and a growing appreciation for oral health as a key link to overall health. Given these underlying fundamentals and the market stability they create, we are confident in our ability to acheive our goals in fiscal 2023 and beyond. Let's now turn to the Animal Health segment. During the third quarter of fiscal '23, our internal sales increased 5% year-over-year as our teams delivered growth that we believe outperformed the market in both production and companion animal. We continue to benefit from the depth of our offering and omnichannel presence that spans a wide range of animal species and offers comprehensive solutions for diverse customers. We also demonstrated successful margin performance with initiatives including effective cost management, improved product mix, including growth in our value-added services segment and partnership with strategic manufacturing partners that reward us for the value we provide. In companion, our internal sales in the third quarter increased by over 7%. This performance is particularly impressive considering a double-digit sales growth in the prior year period. Our sustained growth is a testament to the strong execution of our plan, including excellent performance from our experienced internal and external sales teams, operational discipline and our value-add consultative approach. Our differentiated approach creates deep relationships with our preferred manufacturing partners and customers. And we're seeing the results of those efforts. We've also benefited from the strong growth in our private label portfolio within the companion category. Our expanding private label portfolio includes the collection of owned brands with strong equity in the market. We are continuing to invest in this important category. As I mentioned before, during the quarter, we closed our acquisition of RSVP and ACT, which stands for Relief Services for Veterinary Practitioners and Animal Care Technologies. This transaction provides innovative solutions to veterinary practices through data extraction and conversion, staffing and video-based training services. The early days of our integration have reinforced the opportunity to deepen our value proposition, expand our companion animal capabilities and address critical customer needs. We remain confident in the resiliency and growth of the companion animal market. We believe pet parents are increasingly dedicated to the health of their pets and making necessary investments when it comes to the longevity of those pets. On the production animal side, third quarter internal sales increased by 1% year-over-year, which we believe outpaces the market based on industry data. This continued outperformance is attributable to the outstanding execution of our team, our differentiated model of hands-on service, delivery options and a comprehensive product and services portfolio. I'm particularly proud of our internal sales growth considering the industry-wide headwinds in the production animal market, including pricing pressure on (inaudible), the broadly used product that now faces generic competition as well as drought conditions that have impacted the beef herd. Despite these external challenges, we continue to drive growth and invest in our future. We successfully closed our acquisition of Dairy Tech, which expands our portfolio of owned brands. Dairy Tech provides pasteurizing equipment in single-use bags to safely produce, store and feed colostrum, the necessary nutrients for newborn calves. This is a critical capability for a cattle producer customers, and we are excited to efficiently and effectively support the health of the producers' herds. This acquisition expands our value-added platform within the production animal business and aligns well with several trends that we have been observing in the market, including producers looking for more efficient ways to manage costs and improve profitability and continued market emphasis on biosecurity and herd health and strong global demand for protein and dairy. Across the Animal Health segment, our value-added services category delivered significant growth during the quarter. This strong performance can be largely attributed to our suite of software solutions, which is an important focus area for us going forward as well as our equipment service offering. Similar to our Dental segment, our equipment service offering is a differentiator for Patterson and enables us to support the full life cycle of equipment for our customers. As we look ahead, we believe our Animal Health business is positioned for continued success amid a dynamic end market. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin Barry to provide more detail on our financial performance.Kevin BarryThank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. In my prepared remarks this morning, I will cover the financial results for our third quarter of fiscal '23, which ended on January 28, 2023, and then conclude with our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. So let's begin by covering the results for our third quarter of fiscal '23. Consolidated reported sales for Patterson Companies in our fiscal '23 third quarter were $1.6 billion, an increase of 0.3% versus the third quarter 1 year ago. Internal sales, which are adjusted for the effects of currency translation and contributions from recent acquisitions, increased 1.8% compared to the same period last year. Our third quarter fiscal '23 gross margin was 21.4%, an increase of 30 basis points compared to the prior year. Our gross margin was positively impacted by 10 basis points this quarter by the mark-to-market accounting adjustment on our equipment financing portfolio. As we have mentioned in prior earnings calls, a positive or negative impact related to this mark-to-market accounting adjustment is nearly offset by our corresponding hedging instrument, which is reflected in the interest and other expense line on our P&amp;L. So the net result has a minimal impact on our adjusted earnings per share. This dynamic also occurred in the third fiscal quarter of last year when the negative impact of the mark-to-market accounting calculation was 20 basis points. Normalizing for the 10 basis points of positive impact this quarter and the 20 basis points of negative impact in the year-ago period, our gross margin rate is flat compared to prior year. Remember, the accounting impact of the mark-to-market adjustment impacts our total company gross margin but not the gross margin within our business segments. Importantly, during the fiscal third quarter, each of our business units posted a year-over-year increase to their respective gross margins in the prior year period. Across the company, we continue to focus on gross margin expansion initiatives such as pricing and cost execution and driving an improved mix with the higher growth of margin-accretive product categories. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the third quarter of fiscal '23 were 16.1% and favorable by 60 basis points compared to 1 year ago. In the fiscal '23 third quarter, our consolidated adjusted operating margin was 5.3%, an increase of 90 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year. Again, when normalizing for the accounting impact of the mark-to-market adjustment in both periods related to gross margin, our consolidated adjusted operating margin in the fiscal third quarter expanded by 60 basis points over the prior year. We remain focused on driving operating margin expansion through our efforts to improve gross margin with pricing and cost execution, working more closely with strategic vendors who reward us for our sales performance, driving improved mix as well as exercising expense discipline and leveraging our cost structure as we grow the top line. With these collective efforts, we intend to deliver adjusted operating margin expansion in both of our business segments and for the total business in fiscal '23. Our adjusted tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal '23 was 22.5%, a decrease of 220 basis points compared to the prior year. For the full year, we expect our tax rate to be in line with the prior year. Reported net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. for the third quarter of fiscal '23 was $53.9 million or $0.55 per diluted share. This compares to reported net income in the third quarter of last year of $57 million or $0.58 per diluted share. The year-over-year decrease is related to the investment gain we recorded in the third quarter of last year. Adjusted net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. in the third quarter of fiscal '23 was $61.1 million or $0.62 per diluted share. This compares to $54.2 million or $0.55 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal '22. This 13% increase in adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fiscal third quarter is primarily due to the operating margin expansion in both of our business segments. Now let's turn to our business segments, starting with the Dental business. In the third quarter of fiscal '23, internal sales for our Dental business decreased 3.8% compared to the third quarter of fiscal '22. Internal sales of dental consumables declined 1.5% compared to 1 year ago. As Don mentioned earlier, we continue to experience the deflationary impact of infection control products compared to the prior year. Internal sales of non-infection control products increased 4.6% in the fiscal third quarter compared to the year-ago period. We expect the year-over-year deflationary impact of infection control products to continue for the remainder of fiscal '23 and throughout fiscal '24. Internal sales of dental equipment and software decreased 9.7% compared to 1 year ago. In core equipment, our double-digit sales increase in the quarter reflects our ongoing efforts to effectively manage the supply chain in this category to deliver and install the equipment our dental customers have ordered to update their practices or open new dental offices. However, sales of technology products declined in the quarter primarily due to the comparison to a CAD/CAM upgrade program in the prior year period. Internal sales of value-added services in the third quarter of fiscal '23 increased 4.5% over the prior year period led by the solid year-over-year performance of our technical service team and continued growth of our software business. Value-added services represent the entire suite of offerings we provide to our customers to help make us an indispensable partner to their practice, and these available offerings are also mixed favorable to our P&amp;L. Adjusted operating margins in Dental were 10.2% in the fiscal third quarter and a 10 basis point improvement over the prior year period. This operating margin performance reflects the efforts of our dental team to improve gross margins through effective pricing and mix management and continued expense discipline to deliver operating margin expansion for fiscal '23. Now let's move on to our Animal Health segment. In the third quarter of fiscal '23, internal sales for our Animal Health business increased 4.6% compared to the third quarter of fiscal '22. Internal sales for our companion animal business increased 7.4% versus the third quarter 1 year ago. Internal sales for our production animal business increased 1.4% in the quarter compared to the prior year. The entire production animal market has been affected by a deflationary impact of a key branded product that recently came off patent and as Don mentioned, is experiencing generic competition. Excluding this deflationary impact, internal sales for production animal increased by 2.4%. Industry data would indicate that our sales teams in both companion animal and production continued to outperform the overall market during the fiscal third quarter. Adjusted operating margins in our Animal Health segment were 4.2% in the fiscal third quarter, an increase of 80 basis points from the prior year. Our Animal Health team continues to drive business with strategic manufacturing partners who value our ability to deliver sales while also exercising expense discipline as they seek to expand operating margin for fiscal '23. Now let me cover cash flow and balance sheet items. During the first 9 months of fiscal '23, our free cash flow declined by $70.4 million compared to the same period 1 year ago. This was primarily due to an increased level of working capital in the first 9 months of fiscal '23 driven by strategic inventory purchases and timing of accounts payable. Turning now to capital allocation. We continue to execute on our strategy to return cash to our shareholders. In the third quarter of fiscal '23, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per diluted share, which was then paid at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal '23. On a year-to-date basis in fiscal '23, Patterson has returned $91 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Let me conclude with our outlook for the remainder of fiscal '23. Today, we are narrowing our fiscal '23 GAAP earnings guidance range to $1.96 to $2.01 per diluted share and our adjusted earnings guidance range to $2.25 to $2.30 per diluted share. We intend to deliver internal sales growth and adjusted operating margin expansion for fiscal '23 for the total business and within both of our business segments. And we remain committed to achieving our goals for the fiscal year. And now I will turn this call back over to Don for some additional comments.Donald J. ZurbayThanks, Kevin. Before we open it up for Q&amp;A, I want to thank the entire Patterson team. Our people differentiate Patterson, driving our results and our long-term success. I'm excited by the momentum we are carrying into the final stretch of fiscal 2023. We are well positioned to achieve our financial and operational goals and to continue to deliver for all of our stakeholders. That concludes our prepared remarks. Kevin and I will be glad to take questions. Operator, please open the line.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler.Jason M. BednarI wanted to touch on some of the larger deltas or surprises in the quarter. Maybe starting first with margins. This is a pretty impressive year with company-wide in particular within Animal Health. You've been on a multiyear journey here with margin improvement that probably doesn't get enough attention or credit, but maybe can you elaborate further on the source and sustainability of the margin improvement? Appreciate the color that you gave, but just any additional, again, details you can provide there, especially as we look forward to fiscal '24.Donald J. ZurbayYes, Jason, thanks for the comment and for the appreciation of our margin. I think like we said, I think we feel like we have sustainable programs in place. We outlined some of them in the prepared remarks, and I'll see if Kevin Barry has anything he wants to add to that. But this is really, like you said, a multi-period journey. The things that we've put in place, we think, are sustainable, that they're long term. And I think we've said before, we're aiming to continue that trend. And not going to get too specific on guidance, but I think if you look back over the last couple of years, year-over-year, you've seen the operating margins improve 20 to 30 basis points on average, which we think is reasonable and sustainable. So all good from our end. I really applaud the team -- the teams, particularly, as you mentioned, in Animal Health. In a lower-margin business, they've done a great job with increasing those margins. And maybe I'll ask Kevin Barry if there's anything else he'd like to add on specifics in terms of some of the examples we have.Kevin BarryYes. The -- yes, again, appreciate the question. The -- both business units, like you said, have expanded op margin this quarter continue to trend. And it's really been a holistic approach for both. We've -- Don and I mentioned a couple of examples of how we're approaching our pricing and costing initiatives, how we're managing the mix within those. Both businesses had a big impact on our margins and driving those higher -- large, higher-value product lines and mix service lines that we have. And then the other one I'd highlight is we've done some very good work on our operations side and looking at our logistics network and distribution network and how efficient are we being getting those products and services to our customers. And we've had some good wins there with our businesses, partner with our logistics team here at Patterson. So again, it's a very holistic approach, which, again, is -- we think is a muscle we keep building here, and that's going to keep paying off in the future.Donald J. ZurbayJason, maybe I'd add as well that you saw the announcement -- or I mentioned today on the call that we've added a Chief Operating Officer position at Patterson, and Kevin Pohlman is in that position. I think that this is -- he's in a position to address an underserved part of this margin story, which is really getting after some of the synergies that we've looked at, we've worked on, but maybe not with the focus we're going to have in terms of things across the enterprise. So both business units have done a great job with our margin improvement. But -- and there's more there. But I think one of the untapped pieces of this is really how do you look at the company holistically, and there's a lot of opportunity there.Jason M. BednarOkay. That's really helpful and definitely still some room there to run on margins. Maybe in core dental consumables, mid-single-digit growth there is pretty darn solid. But I'll actually ask on infection control. I appreciate the comments here, the early comments on deflationary pressures continuing for the next several quarters. Do you want to take it a step further on quantifying what impact this might have? Does it get less bad or less of a headwind or stay at its current rate or the delta relative to the core business? And then should we be contemplating any shift in company profitability or decremental margins as a result of these ongoing pressures?Donald J. ZurbayYes. So just so we're clear, Jason, on kind of how this plays out, we're expecting the deflationary pressure in the sense that the pricing keeps coming down. It's largely where we think it's going to be. I think there's probably a little bit more to come here in our fourth quarter, where we think it bottoms out, if you will. I think the point is that on a year-over-year basis then, just because it's been coming down all of this fiscal year when you look into next fiscal year, it's going to be a headwind when you think about it on a year-over-year comparison basis. So that's what we're kind of looking at. We're not probably going to give commentary on the impact on this call. I would say that as we look toward the fourth quarter call and our guidance for next fiscal year, this will definitely be a topic. And we'll probably give some good color on the call next quarter in terms of how the year-over-year impact on our earnings looks.OperatorAnd we will take our next question from Michael Cherny with Bank of America.Michael Aaron ChernySo it might be tough one to ask, but I know you talked about some of the deflationary dynamics on infection control heading into fiscal '24. Are there any other things we should be thinking about that would skew towards the abnormal in terms of what you'd expect for the run rate baseline into '24? Especially just given where we are in the year, is there any way to interpret how to think about both the 3Q numbers and the 4Q implied guidance in terms of the appropriate jumping-off point for your fiscal '24 trajectory?Donald J. ZurbayI want to try to be helpful, Michael, here, but we're going to really stay away, I think, from too much commentary on this call. Again, I think the discipline here we're going to maintain of giving guidance on the next call and putting a lot of color around that. I mean, the deflationary impact is something we've talked about. I think that's a fair point. Interest rate environment obviously is hard to call for all of us. So that's another, I'd say, wildcard in the mix. But otherwise, we like the momentum in our businesses. I think you saw this quarter, absent the dental equipment, the dental equipment issue this quarter really has more to do with timing and upgrade cycles and technology cycles than it does anything else. And again, I've said this before, the -- looking at equipment sales performance in 3-month increments is really a difficult proposition. You want to look at it over longer periods of time. But we expect -- in spite of macroeconomic headwinds, we're expecting that to hold up well. We have good momentum in core equipment and timing issue in the other categories. But otherwise, really business as usual.Kevin BarryMichael, maybe the one thing I'd add as you think about the jumping-off point here as we reiterated guidance today, we are also reiterating that we still expect and project that we're going to grow our internal sales on the company this year. And we're going to deliver the operating margin expansion for the individual business units and overall company. So as you're thinking about how do you think about the rest of this year, I think those are important considerations to kind of put your model together.Michael Aaron ChernyAnd I appreciate you humoring me on a question I know it's hard to answer at this point in time. But maybe just to pick a little bit, Don, on a comment you made related to the equipment side and the dynamics of interest rates. Have you seen any changes in your order book either in terms of any potential delays or cancellations and/or from a leading indicator perspective, mix in terms of the type of products, type of equipment that people are looking for beyond what you've already placed and sold?Donald J. ZurbayNo, we haven't. And in fact, I'd tell you, and of course, this has some element of timing in it as well, but deposits on hand for our equipment and for pending equipment installations are robust. And they're up from last quarter and where they've been.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.Erin Elizabeth Wilson WrightSo first on Animal Health. What are you seeing in terms of price realization, given the level of price increases at the pharma manufacturer level, particularly in companion animal? So that's excluding obviously some of the price dynamics that we're seeing on the production animal side. And are there any changes in buy-sell versus agency relationships embedded in your guidance at this point that we should be aware of as we think about calendar 2023?Donald J. ZurbayIn terms of the companion animal market, we're really not seeing anything too significant in terms of pricing there. It's really been kind of business as usual. Traffic is moderate, it's kind of steadily moderating. I think what we're seeing is that the spend per visit right now is -- the traffic is down slightly, but the spend per visit is up. But in terms of pricing itself, really not anything there. On the buy-sell, we don't expect anything too significant in the upcoming year. I'll let Kevin Barry chime in if he wants on this topic.Kevin BarryNo. We're not projecting anything changing right now.Erin Elizabeth Wilson WrightOkay. That's helpful. And then on the Dental side, what are you seeing now in terms of the monthly demand trends across kind of the quarter and how we should be thinking about that? I know we are lapping Omicron and other dynamics, but how are you thinking about just underlying demand across Dental, excluding some of the variables across the equipment side?Donald J. ZurbayYes. Well, we saw -- I mean, patient traffic is -- we would characterize it as generally stable. But we did see an increase in traffic throughout the quarter. So if you look -- if you really broke it down monthly, which we typically don't give this kind of guidance, but I would tell you that monthly traffic improved as the quarter went on.OperatorWe will take our next question from Jeff Johnson with Baird.Jeffrey D. JohnsonDon, maybe I'll follow up on that last point there. I think our checks and some of our survey work has clearly shown kind of that January and even February rebound on the Dental demand side. We're kind of hearing it more from a mix standpoint and a little bit of price more so than patient volumes. I just love any color you can provide around kind of what kind of pricing dynamics you're seeing right now and kind of those improvements you're pointing to throughout the quarter that sync pretty well with what we're seeing. I know you don't give too much color. I'm not asking you to (inaudible) different product lines, but hygiene and preventative was the improvement there? Was it in some of the higher end (inaudible) and other kind of consumable products that would go more mix than volumes? Just trying to understand what's kind of driving maybe some of that improved spend we heard about in January and February so far in the dental world.Donald J. ZurbayYes, Jeff. Appreciate the question. Yes, try to be as helpful as possible. I think it was kind of steady improvement, particularly notable, I guess, in January. I don't have a breakdown right here of exactly how that looked in terms of traffic, pricing, et cetera. I think it was a mix of both really. And so generally, I'd call it kind of a mix. And I think that we're not probably going to be able to break it down too much further than that on this call.Jeffrey D. JohnsonAll right. That's fair. Let me push you, I guess, on one other point you made on equipment and a lot of it being timing and all that. Historically, I know section179 and that doesn't have as much pull anymore as those write-offs have been pretty stable now for the last few years, (inaudible) are those write-off limits. But typically, I think in the 5 years prior to this year going through 2Q to 3Q in your fiscal year, you get about a 20% sequential lift in equation. You got basically none this quarter. 20 points feels like it's more than timing, and I understand the technology timing stuff you're talking about, basic equipment improving also was against some supply constraints last year in the quarter. So there was some push and pull on both those fronts. So I mean, just what's your outlook for equipment maybe over the next 6 to 12 months with inflation and interest rates where they are in that -- just what's your look of the lay of the land on equipment?Donald J. ZurbayYes. Well, I think we've said for a while that we -- over time, we think the equipment business for us is a mid-single-digit growth piece of the portfolio. Obviously, over the last 8 quarters, we've averaged 13% growth in that category. So -- but I would revert back to what we think is slightly above market, which is the 5%. And we expect that to happen. I think when you look at this quarter, and I say timing, but I also would tell you we had a difficult comp. Again, I don't -- the upgrade cycle in CAD/CAM was a significant factor. And so again, looking at it in isolation, I think, is difficult. But I would kind of revert you back to that mid-single-digit growth as a good proxy for the long-term kind of health of that business.OperatorWe will take our next question from Brandon Vazquez with William Blair.Brandon VazquezI wanted to try to talk a little bit about kind of forward expectations again, but I appreciate we won't get any hard numbers here for a little bit. So maybe there's a lot of kind of moving pieces, whether they're macro or company-specific. Can you just kind of walk through expectations for some of those dynamics, right? There's generic headwinds in animal. There's CAD/CAM kind of upgrade cycle anniversary-ing in this quarter. So how do some of those things impact the business and the P&amp;L over, call it, the next 12 quarters?Donald J. Zurbay12 quarters? Again, yes, I mean, be helpful here. I think, obviously, that's a long time frame for us and for giving guidance, but we're also not going to talk too much about next year. I think the way I would think about it, I think you've hit on 2 aspects of the -- that are going to impact next year. But the thing I'm looking at right now that I think is important is just patient traffic has been stable in spite of what's happening in the overall macroeconomic markets. We're really encouraged by that in all the businesses, the margin improvement, which we expect to continue. Again, if you dig through and look at what's driving that, it's largely things that are -- we believe are sustainable, that are going to be helpful next year and into the future. And so stable markets, encouraging stable markets, margin improvement. There are -- there's the issue that you brought up. But otherwise, I think we're in a good spot here as we move into next year and beyond.Brandon VazquezOkay. I apologize. I meant 12 months, not 12 quarters, but helpful color.Donald J. ZurbayNo problem.Brandon VazquezAnd maybe for next question, you had mentioned you made an acquisition of a warehouse. I think that was for the animal health side in the U.K. Maybe just expand on any other additional plans to expand internationally, maybe even in dental if any of that is on the books for upcoming year?Donald J. ZurbayNo...Kevin BarryI think...Donald J. ZurbayGo ahead, Kevin.Kevin BarryYes. I think what you're referring to, we're doing an internal capital project on our warehouse operations and our U.K. NVS business. It wasn't an acquisition. But it's a -- so it's an internal investment we're making. It's a really good investment to help the operations of that business in the U.K. that services the veterinary market over there. But it wasn't an acquisition. It was an internal capital spend.Brandon VazquezOkay. And then any future plans to continue investing in international, the expectations that, that becomes a bigger part of the business over the coming years?Donald J. ZurbayYes. I think we'll look at opportunities to continue to bolster and improve the operations we have internationally. We wouldn't comment on any plans beyond that.OperatorWe will take our next question from Jon Block with Stifel.Jonathan David BlockMaybe I'll just follow up on a couple of other things. But I'll focus on the 4.6% internal dental consumables ex PPE. So a good number, it was up, call it, a real comp, I think, a 3.6 comp. So -- and a nice step up from a kinda couple of prior quarters. Don, do you want to just maybe elaborate on it a little bit? Can you talk to -- is that sustainable? Or should we be thinking about this 3% to 5% range again ex PPE has been normal? And then maybe just to close the loop on some other questions. The past couple of quarters, I think there's been almost like a 600 basis point delta between your internal dental consumables and not specific to the number ex PPE. And when we think about fiscal '24, what I'm getting is when you take into the jump-off -- taking into account the jump-off point on pricing, it's still a headwind in fiscal '24, but that 600 basis point delta, call it, tightens in fiscal '24. And maybe if you can address that, and then I've got a follow-up.Donald J. ZurbayYes, I think that's a fair way to look at it in terms of the delta. The big impact here is as the pricing has come down so significantly throughout the year and then as you get into next year, it's a little bit more of a year-over-year comparison issue. Again, I think we're excited about our consumables growth. I mean, that's moved around a little bit. But I think over the last couple of years, that's improved each quarter. And we're really executing well with our dental customers. I think when you look at the portfolio outside of PPE, we've done a good job of putting that together. And again, [For sorry] to not try to be helpful here. But I think you can look at kind of maybe our growth rates here in the last year ex PPE, and that's probably a decent proxy for how we're executing in the market and what we think could happen moving forward.Jonathan David BlockOkay. Perfect. And then just second question to shift gears a little bit. Some of the initiatives are in dental specialties have been quiet in my opinion. So just thoughts on that pace picking up. You got any job on, we believe, coming in the U.S. shortly and maybe they would direct ortho. I would think they did want a partner in a really fragmented GP segment. (inaudible) talked about trying to do white label or private label. So it seems like there's a couple of opportunities or call it capital-light opportunities to get involved in faster growth areas of dental specialties, notably clear aligners. Maybe just your thoughts, Don, when you look forward with the organization being a player in that segment going forward in fiscal '24 and beyond.Donald J. ZurbayYes. Well, we're really focused, and we've said this. I mean, we're starting to do some smaller acquisitions, but we've been really focused on a number of different opportunities for our M&amp;A strategy and capital allocation. Obviously, those are attractive markets. And so they're not -- they're on our radar, and we continue to look at the opportunities to see if they fit our criteria, fit our strategy. And if there's something that is going to be good for Patterson, that's definitely something we'd be looking at and more to come on M&amp;A.OperatorWe will take our next question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.Nathan Allen RichJust wanted to go back to the dental equipment performance in 3Q. I guess is there any more detail you could provide on kind of the magnitude of that cycling that upgrade program from the prior year? And I guess I asked because you face another tough comparison in equipment in 4Q that I think was also kind of driven by double-digit growth in CAD/CAM and digital last year. So do we see the sort of near-term softness continue through the balance of this year before maybe getting back to growth in fiscal '24?Donald J. ZurbayWell, obviously, any of that's built into the guidance we gave. But maybe I'll see if Kevin's got some thoughts on what he wants to share relative to that.Kevin BarryYes. I think what I'd say is we did see clients in those technology categories this quarter. Like Don had mentioned, it was somewhat promotional-related to prior periods. But we are also seeing good growth in our core equipment year-over-year. And so I think as you look at our total equipment category, it's obviously -- the technology piece is a good chunk of it, but we've got some really solid momentum on our core equipment that kind of continues to help offset -- it certainly helped offset some of the softness in this quarter. So I think that's maybe the additional color I'd give on how we're thinking about that category. And again, like Don said, that's obviously built into our forecast for what we expect here for (inaudible).Nathan Allen RichOkay. And then maybe, Kevin, if I could just ask a follow-up on the free cash flow performance, obviously, negative year-to-date. You talked about the working capital and build and I think mainly related to inventory. Do we see some of that reverse in 4Q? And can you maybe help us think about what a more maybe normalized run rate for free cash flow is going forward?Kevin BarryYes. So we do have some seasonality in our free cash flow, where we typically see inventories coming out of Q3 is a bit higher, and then we typically draw down in Q4 and have favorable cash flow in Q4. And we expect that to happen again this year. I think what happened in Q3 is we had some opportunities to strategically buy in some inventory and ensure some service levels, and we did that. And we didn't see as much of an increase in our accounts payable to offset that. So there's some timing of when the bills got paid that impacted us here in Q3 that we'll also expect to unwind a bit here in Q4. Yes. I mean, over time, I think what I'd say is that I think we have opportunity to -- I think our balance sheet is in a pretty good place. And I think we can leverage -- get some leverage on our cash flow as we grow the top line. Our teams have done a good job internally, particularly on the inventory side, looking at how do we get better at forecasting, how do we make sure we've got the right products in the right locations to optimize inventory levels and the cost we spend moving products around. And so over time, I would think that we've got the opportunity to -- we'll be able to grow our top line faster than we need to grow our inventories.OperatorWe'll take our final question from Kevin Caliendo with UBS.Kevin CaliendoSpeaking of inventories, one of your primary manufacturing suppliers talked about putting inventory into the channel in 1Q, just -- in their 1Q, the March quarter. Just wondering how that if it in any way has impacted you guys?Donald J. ZurbayNo, I think that there's a lot of timing involved in how the equipment moves, but really not in terms of -- that hasn't impacted us in terms of our ability to install equipment and really our sales cycle, et cetera.Kevin CaliendoOkay. So it's not necessarily meaningful or it doesn't explain any of the sort of results that we've seen or expectations that we have for next quarter?Donald J. ZurbayNo, no.Kevin CaliendoOkay. Helpful. What are you guys expecting in terms of manufacturer price increases for '23? Obviously, last year -- for calendar '23. Last year, obviously, there were a lot more price increases, maybe more acute price increases than you normally see. Are you expecting the next cycle to be more normal? Or do you still expect elevated price increases for manufacturers?Kevin BarryI think what I'd say is I think our portfolio is pretty broad. We do a lot of manufacturers at different places in the pricing cycle. But I think as a general comment, we'd expect a slight slowing from certainly what you saw sort of immediately post pandemic going forward. But as we look internally, we see there's a pretty big mess. And as we've been talking about in this call, there are some products as the supply chains have normalized or competition comes in, that the prices go the other way. So -- but in general, I think if you're just talking about price advances for the manufacturers, it's -- I'd expect it still to be positive but not quite at the rate we saw in the past year or 2.Kevin CaliendoGot it. And I apologize if I missed this, but can you just -- can you talk about the impact from the completed M&amp;A on expectations for your fiscal '23? Was there any incremental impact to the top line or to earnings from the deal you completed?Kevin BarryYes. We've got some revenue benefit here in Q3. I think that's in the tables in our press release, you can see that. From an EPS standpoint, it's relatively de minimis here in this fiscal year as part of our guidance. But here in Q3, with those deals, we got about 1 month, 1.5 months of impact from.Donald J. ZurbayThat's all the questions for today. I really appreciate everybody's time. Thanks for your time and your interest in Patterson Companies. And we'll talk to you next quarter.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call, and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

The company’s Dental segment reflected improvements while the Animal Health segment showed continuous decline in the quarter under review. Sales of both the segments were hurt by unfavorable currency movement. A prudent cost-savings approach and solid sales execution worked in favor of the stock, expanding gross margin.

154,cd74bc76-1cee-3d22-88a2-440cbb7d62ef,MAS,2023-03-03,Masco (NYSE:MAS) Is Very Good At Capital Allocation,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/masco-nyse-mas-very-good-103602455.html,1677839762,STORY,['MAS'],"[What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Masco's (NYSE:MAS) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Masco, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.40 = US$1.3b ÷ (US$5.2b - US$1.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Thus, Masco has an ROCE of 40%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 14% earned by companies in a similar industry. See our latest analysis for Masco roceIn the above chart we have measured Masco's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Masco here  for free.So How Is Masco's ROCE Trending?Masco is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 53% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.Story continuesOur Take On Masco's ROCETo sum it up, Masco is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. Considering the stock has delivered 32% to its stockholders over the last five years, it may be fair to think that investors aren't fully aware of the promising trends yet. So exploring more about this stock could uncover a good opportunity, if the valuation and other metrics stack up.Since virtually every company faces some risks, it's worth knowing what they are, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for Masco   (of which 1 shouldn't be ignored!) that you should know about.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

157,cc457aa0-f5de-33d6-b7df-a50e9daf5f14,MA,2023-03-03,Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) Shares Could Be 21% Above Their Intrinsic Value Estimate,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mastercard-incorporated-nyse-ma-shares-120032912.html,1677844832,STORY,['MA'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Mastercard is US$294 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityMastercard is estimated to be 21% overvalued based on current share price of US$356Our fair value estimate is 44% higher than Mastercard's analyst price target of US$424How far off is Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Mastercard Step By Step Through The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$11.2bUS$13.6bUS$15.2bUS$16.8bUS$18.0bUS$19.0bUS$19.8bUS$20.5bUS$21.2bUS$21.8bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x4Analyst x1Est @ 6.94%Est @ 5.48%Est @ 4.46%Est @ 3.74%Est @ 3.24%Est @ 2.89% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$10.4kUS$11.6kUS$12.0kUS$12.3kUS$12.1kUS$11.8kUS$11.4kUS$11.0kUS$10.5kUS$10.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$113bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$22b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.1%) = US$366bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$366b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$167bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$280b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$356, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Mastercard as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.025. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for MastercardStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the IT market.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price? For Mastercard, there are three pertinent factors you should further research:Risks: Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Mastercard   you should know about.Future Earnings: How does MA's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

Those minerals will need to be extracted from the ground, processed into purer forms, and turned into batteries and magnets to power things like electric vehicles.So if the battery in an electric vehicle, or EV, demands so much mining and manufacturing, are they really so much cleaner than gas-fueled internal combustion engines?Read moreHere's how 10 industries are experimenting with ChatGPTMillennials are just as wealthy as their parentsWhat can you do when your company reverses on remote work?The answer is yes. Are electric vehicles better for the environment?Comparing greenhouse gas emissions of internal combustion vehicles and EVs throughout their entire life cycles, an EV can emit about a quarter the carbon dioxide as its gas-powered counterpart, according to calculations (PDF) by the International Energy Agency, US Environmental Protection Agency studies, and academic research (PDF).While mining the material inputs required for an EV battery — and the process of making it — emit more carbon dioxide, the direct emissions from driving an internal combustion engine vehicle over its lifetime far outstrips the total lifecycle emissions of an EV.A gas-powered vehicle emits about 68 tons of CO2 in its lifetime compared to around 15 tons of CO2 an EV emits in its lifetime.A typical passenger vehicle like the Toyota Camry emits about 68 tons of CO2 in its lifetime, compared to 15 tons of CO2 emitted for an electric Tesla Model 3 — which includes CO2 emitted during the extraction of materials, the manufacturing of the battery, and power supply, which are the emissions made through charging the battery and operating the vehicle.Quartz used data from the EPA and the International Energy Agency for these calculations, which were made with the help of Auke Hoekstra, a senior advisor on smart mobility at the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands.Life-cycle carbon emissions of gas-powered cars (411 grams of CO2 per mile) vs. electric cars (32 grams of CO2 per mile).Minimizing the environmental impacts of mining for battery mineralsWhile EVs are undeniably lower-emission than gas-powered cars, it is also true that surging demand for EVs and batteries will require a significant expansion in mining—and the environmental disturbances and waste that come with it.Story continuesThat’s why it will be important to develop and deploy mining and processing innovations that reduce mining waste and toxicity, as researchers from Australia’s University of Queensland outlined in a recent journal article.According to the researchers, waste generated by copper, nickel, manganese, and lithium extraction will total nearly one trillion tons over the next 30 years. But there are ways to dramatically reduce that waste, which includes waste rock resulting from mining and excavation, as well as byproducts known as tailings that are left behind after the target mineral is extracted.The researchers proposed several alternative extractive methods. One involves reprocessing waste rock and tailings to extract residual amounts of valuable minerals. Another is known as environmental desulphurization, a process that separates sulphide minerals to reduce the toxicity of tailings.The repurposing of byproducts from one mining activity to economize another mining process is already a well established method. For example, the Chinese state-owned iron and steel giant Baotou Steel mines iron ore that contains rare earth metals, then provides the critical metals to its rare earths subsidiary. Similarly, a US-EU rare earth supply chain takes advantage of monazite sands left behind from mining heavy minerals for titanium and zirconium.Insuring against human rights violations in EV productionAnother major concern is the high human cost associated with mining projects in some countries. The Democratic Republic of Congo’s cobalt mining industry, for example, has been linked with worker exploitation, child labor, and other human rights violations.There are also indications of forced labor in the Chinese EV battery supply chain. Just last month, a company backed by Chinese battery giant CATL won a bid for exploration rights to a lithium mine in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, where the Chinese Communist Party is accused of waging a systematic campaign of human rights abuses against the Uyghur ethnic minority.More from QuartzWhat higher H-1B fees will mean for Indians hoping to work in the USMore than half of US nursing homes are unprofitable—and it's about to get a lot worseSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

Still, metal markets took their comments in stride, extending earlier gains seen this week.Spot gold rose 0.2% to $1,838.42 an ounce, while gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,844.25 an ounce by 19:40 ET (00:40 GMT). Both instruments were set to add about 1.5% this week, their first positive week since mid-January.But the yellow metal was still nursing sharp losses in February, following signs of stubborn U.S. inflation and a strong labor market. Treasury yields also rose overnight, while the dollar firmed as data showed U.S. jobless claims fell further in the past week.Focus on Friday is on a reading on U.S. service sector activity, with any signs of economic resilience giving the Fed more room to raise interest rates.Rising U.S. interest rates bode poorly for metal markets, given that they drive up the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. Gold and its peers had logged steep losses through 2022 as the Fed began aggressively raising interest rates.But the prospect of an eventual pause in rate hikes helped metal markets recover from recent losses this week. Platinum futures were set for a nearly 7% weekly gain, snapping a seven-week losing streak, while silver futures were set to rise 1.2% after six straight weeks of losses.Industrial metals also advanced this week, as stronger-than-expected Chinese business activity data spurred bets on a recovery in the world’s largest commodity importer.Story continuesCopper futures rose 0.2% to $4.0800 a pound, and were set to add more than 3% this week.But the red metal logged steep losses on Thursday amid growing fears of a U.S. recession this year, which could significantly dent industrial activity. Data also showed this week that U.S. manufacturing activity has consistently declined over the past few months.Related ArticlesGold prices rise on some Fed clarity, set to snap 4-week losing spreeOil prices head for weekly gain on China growth hopesBig Oil to take centerstage at Houston meet as markets, alliances shift]"

Secure your seat todayFormer National Basketball Association player Baron Davis still sees a silver lining for celebrities who endorse crypto even though the U.S. Securities and Commission is cracking down on celebrity and athlete-endorsed projects.He told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Thursday that celebrities are now likely to focus on projects that can give users real utility and rewards.“Going forward, you're gonna see more creative projects out of celebrities and athletes bringing you directly to their fanbase, to their ecosystem,” he said.Davis, a serial entrepreneur who spent 13 years playing for seven teams in the NBA, is turning to blockchain technology as he creates his own NFT-based platform called SLiC Images, which will manage digital copyrights and databases for sports photographers.The project, which is still under development, will live on non-fungible-token platform Mintbase. By using blockchain technology, the platform is “building out a core database and a publishing back end that allows these photographers to be able to license their photos” on social-media websites and in magazines, Davis said.A lack of education and attention to detail may in part be why some celebrities fell short of finding their place in crypto in the past, Davis said.

""You need to understand that the challenges are multiplied and are multipolar.""Biden last week nominated Banga, 63, to head the World Bank, betting the India-born executive's ties to the private sector and decades of experience in emerging markets will bring fresh momentum to a U.S.-led push to overhaul the 77-year-old institution to better address climate change.Banga, now a U.S. citizen, would replace outgoing president David Malpass, who announced his resignation last month after months of controversy after he fumbled an answer on whether he accepted the scientific consensus on climate change, and escalating pressure by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen for him to adopt ""bolder and more imaginative"" reforms at the bank.Banga said he had already won support from India, Ghana and Kenya, but hoped to visit as many countries around the world ""as logistically possible"" over the next three weeks to understand their priorities and concerns so he could ""hit the ground running"" if he was elected.While the bank will accept nominations from other countries until March 29, Biden's nomination all but assures that Banga will assume a job that oversees billions of dollars of funding for developing countries. The World Bank has been headed by someone from the U.S., the lender's dominant shareholder, since its founding at the end of World War Two.Story continuesAsked about a U.S.-led push to stretch the bank's balance sheet and boost its lending capacity, Banga said the bank must ""do all it can"" to work through recommendations prepared for the Group of 20 major economies by an independent commission last year, while still protecting the bank's AAA credit rating.Banga, who oversaw the expansion of Mastercard's market capitalization to $360 billion from $20 billion during his 12-year tenure there, said it was imperative to secure private sector investment to generate the trillions of dollars needed to combat climate change and eradicate extreme poverty.His work on the Partnership for Central America, which has generated over $4 billion in private funds, showed the power of public-private partnerships, and would help inform his work at the bank, he said.Reflecting on criticism that the Biden administration had not picked a woman to lead the bank for the first time in its history, Banga highlighted his upbringing, education and early career in India, and said Washington's objective was to bring ""a different way of thinking to leadership at the bank.""He said he was convinced that ""giving people a level playing field is our job ... and that means whether you're a woman, your color, your sexual orientation, growing up on the wrong side of the tracks, it doesn't matter,"" he said.""This is not about gender. It's about a fair opportunity to everyone."" (Reporting by Andrea Shalal; editing by Diane Craft)]"

Currencies in the region inched 0.1% lower against a resilient greenback, with a fall in U.S. jobless claims adding to evidence of a strong economy which could keep the Fed firmly on an aggressive rate hiking path. ""In the near term, we are expecting Latin American assets to be rangebound as markets further digest the fact that rates are going to be higher for longer in the U.S.,"" said Pedro Quintanilla Dieck, senior emerging markets strategist for UBS Global Wealth Management. ""That being said, over the course of the year, we are fairly constructive. Around the second half (of the year), according to markets, the Fed will be pausing its rate hiking cycle and this coupled with the high carry in Latin American currencies will also be supportive."" The Brazilian real dipped 0.5% as data showed the economy shrank in the fourth quarter, affected by industry weakness, casting a shadow over the 2023 outlook amid higher borrowing costs. Finance Minister Fernando Haddad said he does not expect a technical recession, ruling out another contraction in the current quarter, but said Brazil's interest rate of 13.75% was hurting the country. MSCI's index of Latin American stocks had slipped 0.3% by 1825 GMT with Brazil's Bovespa flat after four straight sessions of losses. Shares of Brazil's Petrobras fell 1% after the state-run oil company on Wednesday posted upbeat quarterly earnings but proposed trimming its usually robust dividend. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva criticized the payouts and said the company should have invested more in the country's growth. Colombia's peso bucked the trend, rising 0.4% to 4809.1 against the dollar. The currency has fallen marginally this year after dropping nearly 16% against the greenback in 2022. The peso is poised to outperform other major emerging market currencies over the next few years, as elevated crude prices in 2024 support the oil exporter's trade and with monetary policy likely remaining restrictive for longer, Jonathan Peterson, senior markets economist at Capital Economics wrote in a note. Mexico's peso edged 0.1% lower. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he will launch a plan to tame inflation with other Latin American governments. Chile's peso slipped 0.2% as copper prices retreated on a firmer dollar and the prospect of more U.S. sanctions on top metals consumer China.

The CHIPS Act promises to distribute $50 billion for semiconductor manufacturing and research, which businesses are now able to apply for through the Commerce Department.Proponents say boosting U.S. chipmaking will wean companies away from fragile supply chains, trade disputes, and even foreign government policy.“It’s untenable to be dependent on technology that’s beholden to Chinese government policy,” Adam Bry, co-founder and CEO of Skydio, told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). Bry noted that Skydio, which designs and assembles drones in the U.S., relies on suppliers like Nvidia (NVDA) and Qualcomm (QCOM) for chips.“Both of those are directly impacted and benefiting from the CHIPS Act,” he added.U.S. military personnel operating Skydio drones, which rely on semiconductors. (Photo: Skydio)How chip supply chains affect ‘U.S. underdog’ companiesDrone manufacturing was hit hard by supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.Skydio was unable to sell its “Beacon GPS” remote control in 2020, according to reports from industry publication DRONELIFE, as the disruptions highlighted U.S. dependence on foreign chip suppliers for a wide range of products.“The best semiconductors in the world right now are made in Taiwan, very close to China, supply chain on the other side of an ocean,” Senator Mark Kelly (D-AZ), an early proponent of the CHIPS legislation, said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. “We rely on these chips for pretty much everything — anything that has an on-off switch, but more importantly than that, sophisticated weapons and weapons systems.”This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.While the CHIPS Act is ultimately a protectionist policy similar to those enacted by Asian countries to help boost homegrown businesses, experts say the security and geopolitical concerns outweigh the impact it will have on free trade.Story continues“Building drones in the U.S. for the customers that we’re serving is critical for data security, cybersecurity, and national security,” Bry said. “It’s kind of come on-trend, but it’s something we’ve actually been doing for a very long time.”The CHIPS Act is just one of several policy initiatives put in place by the U.S. government aimed at hobbling foreign semiconductor manufacturing, particularly in China. For instance, the U.S., Japan, and the Netherlands recently agreed to comply with export restrictions of chipmaking tools to China, Reuters reported.These policies have benefitted Skydio, which makes drones designed for military use and supplies units to the U.S. Army and other parts of the Department of Defense.For instance, Skydio's biggest competitor, Shenzhen-based drone manufacturer DJI, is currently sanctioned by the Treasury Department over its ties to China's military and is unable to sell its products to local, state, and federal governments in the U.S.“We have the great joy of being the U.S. underdog, which doesn’t always happen,” Bry explained. “We’re the leading U.S. company, but we’re still small relative to DJI.”Skydio has been carving out other advantages against players like DJI, the CEO added. The drone maker is focused on enhancing self-flying and autonomous capabilities – all of which rely on semiconductors.“The market as it's defined today is predominantly manually flown,” Bry said. “We think the future is AI, autonomy, drones become basic infrastructure, and that's what we're most focused on.”Click here for the latest technology business news, reviews, and useful articles on tech and gadgetsRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. With that in mind, the ROCE of Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Lockheed Martin is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.20 = US$7.5b ÷ (US$53b - US$16b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Thus, Lockheed Martin has an ROCE of 20%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry average of 9.4%. View our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin roceIn the above chart we have measured Lockheed Martin's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.How Are Returns Trending?Lockheed Martin's ROCE growth is quite impressive. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 22% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.The Bottom Line On Lockheed Martin's ROCEAs discussed above, Lockheed Martin appears to be getting more proficient at generating returns since capital employed has remained flat but earnings (before interest and tax) are up. Since the stock has returned a solid 60% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.Story continuesLike most companies, Lockheed Martin does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this aerospace and defense company have returned +2.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry, which Lockheed falls in, has lost 0.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Lockheed is expected to post earnings of $6.18 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.9%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $26.84 points to a change of -1.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.6%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.12 indicates a change of +4.8% from what Lockheed is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Lockheed is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for LMT _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Lockheed, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.95 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -0.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $65.8 billion and $67.74 billion estimates indicate -0.3% and +3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryLockheed reported revenues of $18.99 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.1%. EPS of $7.79 for the same period compares with $7.24 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.25 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.06%. The EPS surprise was +5.13%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Lockheed is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers.

Revenue missed estimates, coming in at $22.4 billion against expectations for $22.7 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Comparable-store sales at Lowe's were down 0.7% for the fourth quarter, which ended February 3.

Shares have lost about 7.2% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is PulteGroup due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.PulteGroup Q4 Earnings &amp; Revenues Beat, Margins RisePulteGroup Inc. reported impressive results in fourth-quarter 2022, where earnings and revenues surpassed their respective Zacks Consensus Estimates and increased year over year.Pertaining to the result, Ryan Marshall, PulteGroup’s president and CEO, stated, “Our strong fourth quarter results allowed PulteGroup to lower its debt-to-capital ratio to 18.7% and deliver a full year return on equity of 32.9%.”Inside the HeadlinesAdjusted earnings per share came in at $3.63, which topped the consensus mark of $2.88 by 26% and increased 45% from $2.51 per share a year ago. The upside was driven by gains in revenues, improved gross margins and overhead leverage.Total revenues of $5.17 billion also beat the consensus mark of $4.6 billion by 12.3% and increased 13.4% from the year-ago figure of $4.36 billion.Segment DiscussionPulteGroup primarily operates through two business segments — Homebuilding and Financial Services.Revenues from the Homebuilding segment were up 19.8% year over year to $5.1 billion. Home sale revenues of $5.05 billion increased 19.7% year over year, mainly due to the higher average price of homes closed. Land sale revenues also rose 22.3% from a year ago to $45.5 million.The number of homes closed increased 3% from the year-ago level to 8,848 units. The average selling price of homes delivered was $571,000, up 17% year over year.Most importantly, its backlog, which represents orders yet to be closed, was 12,169 units, down 32.4% year over year. In addition, potential housing revenues from backlog decreased 22.2% from the prior-year quarter to $7.67 billion.However, new home orders dropped 41% year over year to 3,964 units for the quarter, owing to several headwinds like rising mortgage rates, lower affordability, lower consumer confidence and slowed demand. This resulted in a cancellation rate of 32%, up from 11% in the prior year period and 24% in the third quarter of 2022. Home orders were down across all operating regions served. The value of new orders also declined 43.1% from a year ago to $2.15 billion.Home sales gross margin was up 200 bps year over year to 28.8% for the reported quarter. Adjusted SG&amp;A expenses (as a percentage of home sales revenues) improved 50 bps to 8.2% from 8.7% a year ago. Adjusted operating margin increased by 250 bps year over year to 20.6%.Revenues from the Financial Services segment declined 28.6% year over year to $72.1 million. Pretax income for the segment decreased to $24 million from $55 million a year ago. The decline was due to a reduction in loan volumes owing to a fall in capture rate to 75% compared with 85% last year and the more competitive pricing environment.Story continuesFinancialsAt the end of 2022, cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $1.09 billion, down from $1.83 billion in 2021-end. Net debt-to-capital was 9.6% at 2022-end, significantly up from 2.5% at 2021-end. Net cash provided by operating activities was $668.5 million in 2022 versus $1,004 million in 2021.In fourth-quarter 2022, the company repurchased 2.4 million common shares for $100 million at an average price of $41.81 per share. For 2022, PHM repurchased 24.2 million common shares for $1.1 billion at an average price of $44.48 per share.GuidancePulteGroup expects home deliveries to be within 5,400-5,700 homes, indicating a decline from 6,039 homes delivered a year ago. It expects ASP within $565,000-$575,000, indicating an increase of 12% from a year ago. PHM expects homebuilding gross margins to contract 200 bps to 27% for first-quarter 2023 from the year-ago period. The company anticipates SG&amp;A (as a percentage of home sales revenues) to be in the range of 10.5-11% versus 10.7% in the prior year. Tax rate in the first quarter of 2023 is likely to be 25%.The average community count in the first quarter is likely to be flat sequentially (approximately 850 communities). For the remainder of 2023, it expects the quarterly community count to be up 5-10% over the comparable prior-year quarter.PHM assumed its current cycle time of 6-plus months will remain the headwind for the next several months. With 18,000 homes currently in production, it expects to close approximately 25,000 homes in 2023, down from 29,111 units reported in 2022.Given the slowdown in overall housing activity, PHM plans to dramatically lower its land spend in 2023. It expects total land investment to be approximately $3.3 billion, including 65% of the investment in the development of owned land positions.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended upward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted 5.97% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, PulteGroup has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a C. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, PulteGroup has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Medtronic The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$5.56bUS$5.12bUS$5.67bUS$5.81bUS$6.16bUS$6.43bUS$6.66bUS$6.88bUS$7.07bUS$7.26bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 4.36%Est @ 3.67%Est @ 3.19%Est @ 2.86%Est @ 2.62% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.2% US$5.1kUS$4.3kUS$4.4kUS$4.1kUS$4.0kUS$3.8kUS$3.6kUS$3.4kUS$3.2kUS$3.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$39bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.3b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.2%– 2.1%) = US$104bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$104b÷ ( 1 + 9.2%)10= US$43bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$82b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$82.3, the company appears reasonably expensive at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Medtronic as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.998. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for MedtronicStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Medical Equipment market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

""Part of the reason is that historically, clinical heart research mainly studied men. So detection, treatment and standards of care are often biased in their favor.""For example, even though men and women generally have differing physiology, several heart disease tests are geared more toward the male anatomy, often leading to missed diagnosis in women.1""For instance, angiograms are currently the gold standard of care in detecting obstruction of the main coronary arteries,"" said Dr. Jordan Baechler. ""But angiograms alone sometimes can't see the smaller vessels and intracoronary imaging during angiogram or an MRI may be the best way to diagnose small vessel disease in women.""Research is also finding that certain conditions specific to women impact their hearts, 2,3 and that symptoms of heart problems can be significantly different for women than men.4But even doctors aren't always aware of the differences, and the reasons lie in the data. Research has found that women patients are included in less than 40 percent of clinical studies.5""The majority of the medical literature is based on evidence collected from just one part of the population-predominantly white males,"" said Dr. Alan Cheng, chief medical officer of the Cardiac Rhythm Management operating unit at Medtronic. ""The assumption has been that the information can be entirely extrapolated to the rest of the population, but we're beginning to appreciate that's not always the case.""Story continuesAccording to Dr. Cheng, Medtronic is diversifying the clinical research it does on its medical devices to be more inclusive. One such clinical study, involving heart valve replacement, is enrolling primarily women.""The results from this trial will provide important clinical insight into a currently underrepresented patient population in TAVR literature,"" said Dr. Jeffrey Popma, Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of the Coronary, Renal Denervation and Structural Heart operating unit at Medtronic. ""As we generate new evidence, physicians will have better guidance on how to treat patient groups not included in prior clinical studies, and that will be better for all patients.""""It's very exciting to see healthcare looking at this issue through a more inclusive lens,"" added Dr. Jordan Baechler. ""We're moving in the right direction. We need to quickly get to a place where the science standard reflects the populations that we're serving.""Did you know?

186,4c306c98-d1a1-33ac-885b-4990629c612a,CCI,2023-03-03,3 High-Yield Dividend Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-high-yield-dividend-stocks-134226694.html,1677505346,STORY,"['CCI', 'ABBV']","[High-yield dividend stocks offer relatively high dividend yields compared to the average dividend stock. Generally, I view a high-yield dividend to be above the 4-5% range. Investors can calculate a dividend yield by taking the dividend distribution of a company as a percentage of a given stock’s share price.Importantly, high-yield dividend stocks offer an attractive source of passive income. The companies that provide high yields tend to have solid long-term earnings and cash flow generation, allowing a more significant portion of their profits to be returned to shareholders.However, higher yields also correlate with higher risks. Companies that offer very high dividends often do so to attract investor capital in the face of broader business issues. The result is that such dividends can be cut, and may therefore be somewhat less stable.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith that said, let’s dive into three high-yield dividend stocks I’d put in the “buy now and hold forever” bucket.ABBVAbbVie$152.71BIPBrookfield Renewable Partners$34.16CCICrown Castle$131.16AbbVie (ABBV) Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USASource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comFirst on this list of high-yield dividend stocks is AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV). AbbVie is a pharmaceutical giant that focuses on the development and commercialization of therapeutics. AbbVie has a strong portfolio of drugs, which includes its blockbuster drug Humira. As Humira approaches patent expiry, investors have become increasingly hesitant to direct their capital toward AbbVie shares. However, plenty of evidence supports the investment thesis in this stock over the long term, including its dividend yielding 3.9%.AbbVie stock has been on the decline of late, after posting mixed results earlier in February. The firm’s $3.60 earnings per share were slightly better than expected, while $14.89 billion in sales were somewhat below expectations. Additionally, Humira’s global sales grew by 4.6% in the fourth quarter, but the company expects overall sales to decline by 37% in 2023 as it continues to lose patent protections. The good news is that a 37% decline hovers around the low end of previous expectations that sales would decline 35-55% this year.Story continuesAbbVie’s overall 2022 revenues increased 3.3% to $58.05 billion, with Skyrizi’s growth bolstering the firm’s immunology business which Humira leads.Brookfield Renewable Partners (BIP) Environmental protection, renewable, sustainable energy sources. Plant growing in the bulb conceptSource: Proxima Studio / Shutterstock.comBrookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BIP) invests in infrastructure assets such as utilities, transportation, energy, and data infrastructure. The company’s strategy centers on acquiring high-quality assets with stable cash flows that provide long-term value for shareholders. BIP is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for infrastructure investments, and is one of few pure-play global infrastructure options for investors.Brookfield Renewable Partners’ dividend boasts a 4.5% forward yield. That is relatively high, but investors should also note that the company reduced its dividend in 2020 at the onset of the pandemic. However, this was a modest reduction, and I would categorize the company’s dividend as stable.BIP shares have increased over the past decade, with an average annual return of 19.48%. That means capital invested in the stock would have grown by nearly 6-times, excluding dividends.The company has done exceptionally well recently with a 3-year revenue growth rate of 28.3%, outpacing 95% of industry peers.Crown Castle (CCI) Antenna Telephone and communication towers have a sunset background. American Tower (AMT) is one of the largest 4G tower operators in the U.S.Source: SERDTHONGCHAI / Shutterstock.comCrown Castle (NYSE:CCI) is a real estate investment trust that owns and operates cell towers, fiber networks, and other wireless infrastructure. Its stock also yields an impressive 4.8%. Crown Castle benefits from the increasing demand for wireless connectivity, boasting a strong portfolio of high-quality assets that generate stable cash flows.Crown Castle operates over 40,000 cell towers, 115,000 small cell nodes, and 85,000 miles of fiber. The company became a REIT in 2014 and has aligned its business with U.S. wireless carriers to take advantage of the 5G transition.CCI is a real estate investment trust or REIT. While the term real estate might suggest volatility as the housing market remains unstable, the company is not. Cell tower REITs, including CCI essentially rent infrastructure to wireless providers like Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS). The sector’s relatively centralized and consolidated nature has historically resulted in strong earnings growth over time. Thus, this is a company that isn’t necessarily subject to the same factors as the housing market.The company’s revenues grew by 10% in 2022, with Crown Castle increasing its dividend by 9%. CCI stock represents a remarkably dependable dividend payer within a REIT industry that could face serious obstacles soon due to a downturn in the housing market.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Also corrects paragraph 3 to say the Lynparza combination is compared to placebo with two other drugs, not just placebo)March 2 (Reuters) - Merck &amp; Co Inc and British drugmaker AstraZeneca PLC said on Thursday that an independent committee of advisers to the U.S. health regulator will review the companies' application for the expanded use of their drug Lynparza to treat an advanced form of prostate cancer.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) committee is scheduled to meet on April 28. The companies' are seeking approval of the drug Lynparza in combination with other medications – abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone – for the treatment of a type of treatment-resistant prostate cancer in adult patients.The application is based on data from a late-stage study in which the Lynparza combination improved overall survival compared to the placebo in combination with abiraterone and prednisone/prednisolone, in patients who had not received prior chemotherapy.Lynparza was approved in March last year by the FDA as a treatment for patients with early-stage breast cancer with certain mutations. The drug is also approved in the United States as a standalone treatment for another form of prostate cancer.Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer among men in the United States with about 288,300 new cases of prostate cancer in 2023, according to the American Cancer Society’s estimates.Merck on Tuesday scrapped a late-stage trial involving its blockbuster immunotherapy Keytruda for prostate cancer, after interim data showed it was unlikely to meet the main goals, making it the drugmaker's third trial for the disease to be abandoned.

The ODAC provides the FDA with independent, expert advice and recommendations on marketed and investigational medicines for use in the treatment of cancer. The FDA is not bound by the committee’s guidance but takes its advice into consideration.The ODAC Meeting is scheduled for April 28, 2023. AstraZeneca and Merck are committed to working with the FDA to bring LYNPARZA in combination with abi/pred to patients diagnosed with mCRPC.The sNDA is based on the results of the Phase 3 PROpel trial. Results from PROpel, including the primary endpoint of radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), were first presented at the 2022 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Genitourinary Cancers (GU) Symposium and subsequently published in NEJM Evidence. Results from the final pre-specified overall survival (OS) analysis were presented at ASCO GU 2023.LYNPARZA in combination with abi/pred is approved in the European Union and several other countries for the treatment of adult patients with mCRPC, based on the PROpel trial.About PROpelPROpel is a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial testing the efficacy, safety and tolerability of LYNPARZA versus placebo when given in addition to abi/pred in patients with mCRPC who had not received prior chemotherapy or new hormonal agents in the mCRPC setting. The major efficacy outcome was rPFS as assessed by investigator per RECIST v1.1 and Prostate Cancer Working Group (bone) criteria. OS was an additional efficacy outcome measure.Story continuesIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONCONTRAINDICATIONSThere are no contraindications for LYNPARZA.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSMyelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML): Occurred in approximately 1.5% of patients exposed to LYNPARZA monotherapy, and the majority of events had a fatal outcome. The median duration of therapy in patients who developed MDS/AML was 2 years (range: &lt;6 months to &gt;10 years). All of these patients had previous chemotherapy with platinum agents and/or other DNA-damaging agents, including radiotherapy.Do not start LYNPARZA until patients have recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous chemotherapy (≤Grade 1). Monitor complete blood count for cytopenia at baseline and monthly thereafter for clinically significant changes during treatment. For prolonged hematological toxicities, interrupt LYNPARZA and monitor blood count weekly until recovery.If the levels have not recovered to Grade 1 or less after 4 weeks, refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations, including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics. Discontinue LYNPARZA if MDS/AML is confirmed.Pneumonitis: Occurred in 0.8% of patients exposed to LYNPARZA monotherapy, and some cases were fatal. If patients present with new or worsening respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and fever, or a radiological abnormality occurs, interrupt LYNPARZA treatment and initiate prompt investigation. Discontinue LYNPARZA if pneumonitis is confirmed and treat patient appropriately.Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTE): Including severe or fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) occurred in patients treated with LYNPARZA. VTE occurred in 7% of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who received LYNPARZA plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) compared to 3.1% of patients receiving enzalutamide or abiraterone plus ADT in the PROfound study.

Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for LYNPARZA.Please see complete Prescribing Information, including Medication Guide.About LYNPARZA® (olaparib)LYNPARZA is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor and the first targeted treatment to potentially exploit DNA damage response (DDR) pathway deficiencies, such as BRCA mutations, to preferentially kill cancer cells. Inhibition of PARP with LYNPARZA leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. LYNPARZA is being tested in a range of tumor types with defects and dependencies in the DDR.LYNPARZA, which is being jointly developed and commercialized by AstraZeneca and Merck, has a broad clinical trial development program, and AstraZeneca and Merck are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumors as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types.About metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancerProstate cancer is the second most common cancer in male patients globally and is associated with a significant mortality rate. Development of prostate cancer is often driven by male sex hormones called androgens, including testosterone. In patients with mCRPC, their prostate cancer grows and spreads to other parts of the body, despite the use of androgen-deprivation therapy to block the action of male sex hormones. Approximately 10-20% of patients with prostate cancer are estimated to develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) within five years, with at least 84% of these patients presenting with metastases at the time of CRPC diagnosis. Of patients with no metastases at CRPC diagnosis, 33% are likely to develop metastases within two years.About the AstraZeneca and Merck strategic oncology collaborationIn July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialize certain oncology products including LYNPARZA, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop these products in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop these oncology products in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.Merck’s focus on cancerOur goal is to translate breakthrough science into innovative oncology medicines to help people with cancer worldwide.

Then, about 4000 years ago, the last mammoth died.Enough of their remains were preserved in the icy tundra to reveal a somber truth: On a generational time scale, the creatures disappeared suddenly and catastrophically. The jury is out on whether a changing climate, hunting by humans, or something else is most to blame-but we do know that the mammoth's closest relative, the elephant, is undergoing a similar population crash today, driven by similar threats.The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) estimates that in just the past century, the number of living African savanna elephants has been reduced by 60%. Their sister species, African forest elephants, have dwindled by an astonishing 86% and are now listed as ""critically endangered.""Humans have the power to halt this collapse into extinction. But to do it, we need more data. ""At the moment, we actually have more genomic data for woolly mammoths than we do for living elephants,"" says Patrícia Pečnerová, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Copenhagen. ""And that should change.""Pečnerová wrote her PhD thesis on mammoth paleogenomics and is now a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions Fellow at the university's Department of Biology and a National Geographic Explorer. She got in touch with Mrinalini Erkenswick Watsa, a conservation scientist with the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance (SDZWA), to begin forming a partnership. Its vision: To create an atlas of elephant genome diversity across Africa, which could be used to make field conservation tools for the people and communities who come into direct contact with the animals, and thus have the most power to help them.Such a partnership would require several players: someone to gather biological samples, someone to sequence them, someone to analyze the data and develop the atlas, and someone to deploy tools based on it in the field-and everyone involved must understand the challenges at hand.Story continuesThe challenges at handSavanna elephants are the world's largest land animal. They can weigh up to 6.5 tons-that's more than two Hummers-and live up to 70 years. So they need a vast amount of space to roam, looking for food and water, and they return to the same routes year after year. Unfortunately, humans often don't know when they're building over those routes, and when wild elephants find their migration interrupted by humans, it often leads to confrontation and gives the animals a bad rap.Dr. Stephen Chege, a wildlife veterinarian who provides management oversight for SDZWA conservation projects in northern Kenya, thinks that's unfair. ""When everybody congregates to the only available water source, for example, there's a high chance for conflict,"" he says. ""People have the misconception that wildlife is there to bring chaos. But we need to change that thinking. For the health of wildlife populations and individual animals, we must say that they have a right to access what they need. We shouldn't be selfish.""If biologists could positively identify elephants based on their DNA and match them against records of where that herd has been before, it could reveal their migration patterns and help people make decisions about where to build with coexistence in mind, making sure the animals have room to pass by peacefully.Another threat facing elephants is the loss of genetic diversity. Elephant herds are matriarchal; the females stay with the herd, and the males often leave or are forced out until they're old enough to mate. When reproductive males can mix between herds, the gene pool remains diverse and the population retains more robust defenses against disease, pests, changes in climate, and other environmental stresses. But current field observations have shown that about 70% of male elephants die by the time they reach reproductive age, and as herds become more isolated from one another, they exchange fewer individuals, and older males end up dominating reproduction. When this happens, the population's genetic diversity withers, leaving each new generation more vulnerable.Identifying how closely related each herd is through genomic sequencing would help people determine which herds to prioritize for conservation, and even select individual animals for translocation.And of course, even though it was banned internationally in 1989, the illegal poaching of elephants has only risen since. According to the IUCN, it's the principal cause of death for forest elephants. But forensic sequencing of recovered ivory could help authorities track where they're being hunted, and step in to protect them.Step one: Gather the samplesTo create a genomic atlas, you first need a vast collection of samples from across the animal's habitat range. Luckily, the partnership didn't have to start from scratch.Back in the 1990s, while he was director of the Mpala Research Centre in Nanyuki, Kenya, Nicholas Georgiadis gathered over 400 biological samples from elephants across Africa. For the entire 20th century, forest elephants were thought to be merely a subspecies of savanna elephants-but Georgiadis, Alfred Roca, and other collaborators used these samples to demonstrate that they diverged into separate species millions of years ago.""They're as different as chimps and humans, more different than lions are from tigers,"" says Roca, who's now a professor with the Animal Sciences Laboratory at the University of Illinois. The distinction has real implications for conservation efforts: The two species have adapted to different habitats; they form different migration patterns and social structures. Roca's research was central to the decision by conservation agencies to formally recognize African elephants as two distinct species. As a single species, African elephants had been considered merely ""vulnerable"" rather than ""endangered"" by the IUCN Red List. When the two species were assessed separately, the savanna elephant was determined to be endangered, while the forest elephant was found to be ""critically endangered,"" a category reserved for species at highest risk of extinction.Roca was eager to join the partnership and contribute this landmark sample collection to it. A research scientist on his team, Yasuko Ishida, will be responsible for selecting a diversity of populations from the collection and will conduct several of the analyses on them. The fact that the samples are now decades old doesn't matter-DNA can still be extracted from them, sequenced, and mapped; and field biologists can use that information to examine elephants who are still living in these populations.Step two: Sequence the samplesPrevious genetic studies of elephants have looked only at a few selected markers, such as microsatellites-short sections of DNA that repeat multiple times and are useful for tracing family inheritance. The problem with this method is that different labs look at different sites, and their results can't necessarily be compared against one another.A project this big needs to sequence the whole genome-which is why it welcomed the Illumina iConserve partnership, whose mandate is to accelerate environmental and wildlife conservation using genomics. This year, the iConserve team will use Illumina sequencers to plumb the depths of Roca's 400 samples, to the tune of 40x coverage. Once they've created the genome sequence data, they'll send it to Pečnerová in Denmark, where she can begin mapping it.""Studying the whole genomes provides a lot more information at a much better resolution,"" she says. ""We can answer some questions that were really difficult or almost impossible to answer with the traditional markers.""Step three: Develop the atlasTo map the genomic variation of elephants in Africa, the partnership needs to first read the whole genetic code, then pare it down to the parts that provide the most information.Harnessing the power of the whole genetic code provides unprecedented resolution to study genetic variation. An individual's DNA comes together from pieces taken from both of its parents. Through these, Pečnerová explains, ""we can reconstruct the whole population's demographic history, its changes in size through time, from one single individual's genome.""Her task will be to process terabytes of genomic data to sieve through the genomes-each more than three billion ""letters"" long-and identify the most informative positions. Known as single-nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs (pronounced ""snips""), these are places in an individual's genetic code where a single letter varies from most others of its species. Instead of studying a dozen or two genetic markers, like researchers used to do in the past, whole genomes offer them millions. By analyzing 400 elephants from across the continent, the team will identify which of the millions of SNPs are key to revealing local patterns and individual differences.Equipped with this data, the partnership should be able to map how elephant genetic diversity varies across their habitat range, see how connected or isolated different populations are across Africa, and explain what factors are contributing to a loss of that diversity.In turn, conservationists could select potential conservation corridors and candidate populations for translocation. The data could be used to create a practical, low-cost genotyping tool for field teams, using SNPs that correlate with geography, species, sex, and individuals. Such a tool could help them build pedigrees for known individuals, assess population numbers and dispersal in the landscape, and facilitate the rehabilitation of rescued animals to the wild.Step four: Deploy the atlasField genotyping technology has come a long way since the 1990s, when Georgiadis had to gather his samples using dart biopsy-a close-up, disruptive, and often dangerous method (a defensive elephant once overturned his vehicle).Now, viable samples can be taken from a safer, less invasive (if less glamorous) source: dung. Modern sequencers can peer through the static of any other molecules present-from gut microbes, digested plants, and so on-to pluck out just the elephant DNA.""Technology is key to conservation,"" Chege says, but he notes that taking these samples in the savanna presents another challenge: DNA quickly degrades with exposure to heat and ultraviolet light, especially if there's limited electricity available to freeze it. Even liquid nitrogen evaporates every time you open the container, and biologists are often in the field for weeks at a time. They can no longer afford to wait and ship their samples overseas for analysis-so the partnership has a plan for that, too.The top priority that everyone in the partnership mentions is empowering conservationists on the ground to do this work themselves, where they are-even if they're not geneticists. Roca has always made it a point to involve local researchers in his work, but Watsa explains that, historically, members of the scientific community have often used samples imported from other countries: ""Today we work to flip that script. We won't bring samples to a lab; we will bring the lab to the samples."" Building up the infrastructure on the ground, in training, ingredients, and equipment, means that those collecting future samples can participate in a wider portion of the analysis and lead the research themselves.As a proof of concept, the team hopes to first test a new genotyping tool by building a pedigree for the population monitored by Save the Elephants in Samburu, Kenya, as early as this year, before releasing all the data and trial results publicly. ""Besides making the atlas freely available,"" Pečnerová says, ""we hope that by implementing pilot runs in collaboration with colleagues in Kenya and Uganda, we will motivate and facilitate future research by conservationists across the range countries."" After all, elephants know no borders.As Chege admits, field kits are essential to this work, but ""a lot of innovation research is based on developed countries. I understand that there is no market for such things; it's not something that makes a quick return of investment. But wildlife conservation has bigger benefits.""Why bother?Presented with such alarming statistics about population decline, the temptation is to wonder whether the investment is worth it. At a time when a million fires are burning, why does this one deserve our attention?""There are two ways of looking at it,"" Watsa says. ""One is that elephants are huge ecosystem engineers. When you remove them and no one's eating what they ate, everything about the rest of that ecosystem-and ultimately, humans-changes. Because we're all connected. Right?"" As she says this, a half-smile crosses her face, as if her next words should be obvious. ""But the simplest answer is that we all have a right to live on this planet.""Chege adds: ""There's a message I would like to share with everybody. Elephants are wise, brilliant animals. They're very intelligent, and they have emotions just like we do. They cuddle their little ones, and they mourn their family members for days. You find them using their trunk and tusks to investigate the carcass and turn it over. They must be asking so many questions. ‘What happened? Could we have done anything to not let you die?'""Extinction is not inevitable. We have the resources to do what's necessary to keep elephants from dying out-we need only the willpower.Patrícia Pečnerová's project STAMPEDE: Spatial and Temporal Analysis of Modern and Past Elephant DivErsity has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 892446.Illumina, Thursday, March 2, 2023, Press release pictureIn just the past century, the number of living African forest elephants has been reduced by 86%. | Photo: San Diego Zoo Wildlife AllianceView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Illumina on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IlluminaWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/illuminaEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IlluminaView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/741683/A-New-Genomic-Atlas-Could-Help-Save-Endangered-Elephants]"

(NASDAQ: MYGN), a leader in genetic testing and precision medicine, and Illumina Inc. (NASDAQ: ILMN), a global leader in DNA sequencing and array-based technologies, today announced the expansion of a strategic partnership to broaden access to and availability of oncology homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) testing in the United States. Under the agreement, Illumina TruSight™ Oncology 500 HRD (TSO 500 HRD), a research-use-only test, is now available in the US. The expanded partnership also establishes a unique companion diagnostic (CDx) alliance for the pharmaceutical industry, which will enable more clinical research for gene-based, targeted therapies.Expanding access to HRD research testThe TSO 500 HRD research test aligns Myriad’s gold standard MyChoice® CDx HRD technology with Illumina’s pan-cancer test, TSO 500. The test was codeveloped with Merck (known as MSD outside the US and Canada) and Myriad Genetics. Myriad and Illumina’s initial partnership led to Illumina’s combined HRD and TSO 500 offering launch worldwide—excluding the US and Japan—in June 2022.TSO 500 HRD offers a single, comprehensive pan-cancer test to identify key genetic variants and homologous recombination deficiency critical for understanding cancer development and progression. HRD status is an important biomarker in tumors that harbor high levels of DNA damage, such as those present in ovarian, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers.“Research continues to reveal the growing relevance of HRD status across multiple cancers,” said Kevin Keegan, vice president and general manager, Oncology Business Unit, at Illumina. “Now with this test, we are empowering labs in the US to unlock the most comprehensive tumor analysis from a single sample.”Story continues“Our partnership with Illumina brings together best-in-class HRD technology and next-generation sequencing to create a comprehensive testing solution that supports the advancement of clinical research which should ultimately lead to an improvement for patients,” said Michael Lyons, general manager of Oncology, Myriad Genetics. “The availability of TSO 500 HRD in the US furthers our ability to partner with leading pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions, broadens access to clinical trials, and accelerates the pace of research and scientific innovation.”The product is available to order now and ready to ship in the US. Illumina and Myriad are offering distributable kits and centralized laboratory service, respectively. TSO 500 customers, such as Florida Cancer Specialists &amp; Research Institute, one of the largest independent medical oncology/hematology practices in the US, are anticipating access to the kit.“We are excited for the opportunity to provide Illumina’s TSO 500 genomic profiling pan-cancer test with HRD assessment in a single workflow,” said Dr. Lucio N. Gordan, president and managing physician at Florida Cancer Specialists &amp; Research Institute. “Leveraging technology from Myriad’s MyChoice CDx, our physician’s first choice among HRD tests, will help to unlock comprehensive understanding of the tumor genome and maintain laboratory efficiency. We look forward to expanding and building upon our relationships with both Illumina and Myriad Genetics.”New CDx alliance Under this strategic alliance, Illumina and Myriad will seek joint HRD companion diagnostics partnerships with pharmaceutical companies worldwide (excluding Japan). The joint HRD CDx alliance will aim to pursue HRD regulatory approvals for both the MyChoice HRD Assay companion diagnostic and a future clinical in vitro diagnostic test based off the TSO 500 HRD Assay.“This CDx alliance aims to further enable clinical research for HRD testing and therapeutics, globally. Which could lead to greater access to clinical trials for precision, gene-based therapies,” said Keegan.About TruSight Oncology 500 and TSO 500 HRDTSO 500 is a research-use-only pan-cancer assay that enables comprehensive genomic profiling. Designed to identify known and emerging tumor biomarkers across 523 genes, TSO 500 utilizes both DNA and RNA from tumor samples to identify key variants critical for cancer development and progression, such as small DNA variants, fusions, and splice variants. In addition, it assesses key genomic signatures, such as tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, and HRD.TSO 500 HRD enables researchers to unlock deeper insights about the tumor genome by identifying genetic mutations used in the evaluation of HRD. HRD is a genomic signature used to describe when cells are unable to effectively repair double-stranded DNA breaks. When this occurs, cells rely on alternative, error-prone DNA repair mechanisms, which may lead to genomic instability and, eventually, tumor formation.

Nike (NKE), which belongs to the Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel industry, could be a great candidate to consider.When looking at the last two reports, this athletic apparel maker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 16.48%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, Nike was expected to post earnings of $0.65 per share, but it reported $0.85 per share instead, representing a surprise of 30.77%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.91 per share, while it actually produced $0.93 per share, a surprise of 2.20%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Nike lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Nike has an Earnings ESP of +15.69% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on March 21, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

It’s also the most profitable short among biotechs since the stock hit a peak at the height of the outbreak, according to Matthew Unterman, a director with S3.Novavax’s dramatic rout is emblematic of the dwindling demand for pandemic protection.The over 30-year-old biotech soared amid the lucrative race to develop a vaccine, which gave it an opportunity to quickly get a product on the market, but fell behind other jab developers. The US market would come to be dominated by the shots developed by Moderna Inc. and the partnership of Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE. Novavax finally won emergency use authorization from US regulators last year, and has since faced disappointing uptake.“It’s a very difficult moment for the company even after a much needed change of leadership,” says Max Nisen, senior associate analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “They have significant expenses after attempting to build global manufacturing capacity and keep up with Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, a dwindling cash pile and highly uncertain revenue prospects.”In 2021, the pandemic and a frothy biotech-sector rally drove the Gaithersburg, Maryland-based company’s market value over $20 billion.

US Treasury yields are soaring. Take a look at the 10-year yield, getting a lot of attention this week, breaking back above 4%. Joining us now for more on that, we want to bring in Theo Trade chief market technician, Jeff Bierman. Jeff, great to have you again. So you look at this from a technical perspective. We're back above that 4% threshold. What do you think the bond market is signaling to you? And what do you think that that means, just in terms of the trading action we could potentially see?JEFF BIERMAN: Well, there's this fulcrum going on between the Fed raising rates and the Fed-- people thinking the Fed is going to hold off rates. And I am more leaning towards what the bond market says than the narrative that comes out from the Fed weekly. I just go by the facts, Seana. And the facts are labor markets are tight. Prices are not coming down. We've stabilized. We've come from an 8 and 1/2 handle on the inflation rate, on the CPI and PPI to about 6. But we bounced back up. So we overshot to the upside. We've stabilized here, somewhere between 5%, maybe 7% for the time being. And I don't think that fits with the Fed's mandate of that 2%.So the bond market is taking the lead away from the Fed and saying, listen, we're just going to ratchet up rates just in case here. And even if there's a 50 basis point hike that's baked in, the Fed funds futures rate that's priced in is telling you 4.75. So if we're at a 4 handle now, you may actually see us go up another 75 basis points before we pause once again. But don't think just because we pause, we're going to pivot. We may stay there for a lot longer than most people suspect.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, we heard Kashkari well into '24 was his guidance there. You mentioned the 10-year there. Any different indicators when it comes to the two-year now pushing 4.9?Story continuesJEFF BIERMAN: Yeah, listen. Dave, look at the 10 against the 2. That's the benchmark that the Fed looks at. Now I look at the 10 against the 30. That's just me because I look longer term. But the 2 is accelerating at a faster pace on the yield than the 10. Definition, translation, you're in an inverted yield curve, which signals a recession. And we're accelerating into that recession because the delta or the divide between the 2 and the 10 is getting wider and wider by the day. That's why the market's on its heels. It's backing off because it's saying, are we in a recession? Are we not? We're accelerating faster into one based upon the inverted yield curve. That's what I'm seeing.SEANA SMITH: So, Jeff, what does that then mean for portfolio allocation? Should investors be allocating more towards bonds? And that 60/40 that we all know so well hasn't really necessarily been working last year. But should that new narrative be maybe 40-60 in favor of bonds?JEFF BIERMAN: You actually might want to up the ante on that, Seana. The 60/40 is the traditional model portfolio of 60% equity, concentration 40% fixed income. But if you're getting a 4 to a 5 handle on a fixed income product that has half as much standard deviation or even half as much systematic beta as, let's say, the stocks, now you're competing for a yield that offers you twice as much, actually almost three times as much as the S&amp;P 500, with half the risk. So the mean variance criterion is to simply get the highest yield at the lowest possible risk or maintain the lowest possible risk that offers you the highest yields.And so bonds are now standing, you looking in their face, begging you to buy them. And I think that's a good move. I think investors should actually start to up the ante on perhaps even 55, 45, simply because if we take out 3,800, you won't have a hedge to the downside once interest rates start moving up. And so I think investors should start to overweight into bonds right now until we get the all clear signal that the Fed is done raising rates, and we're not even close.DAVE BRIGGS: Wow, buckle up. OK, before we let you go, we understand you have something significant to point out with overlaying hospitality giant Hyatt and biopharma giant Pfizer. What are you seeing, Jeff?JEFF BIERMAN: Dave, this is the Seinfeld market.DAVE BRIGGS: Oh, yes.JEFF BIERMAN: It's the Seinfeld market. If we're going into recession, what's the playbook, everybody? You got to rotate to low beta, defensive stocks with high yields to kind of fight off the downdraft. What's happening here is just the opposite. This is what I call investors who are in the bizarro world. It's the Seinfield world. They don't even know what they're doing. They're just, hey, let's chase Hyatt all the way up. And if we're going to a recession, what makes people think that Hyatt is going to be the beneficiary of a recession, and let's shun and avoid Pfizer altogether with an 8 PE multiple, a 4% yield, and cash flow that defends in a recession?So like I said, this bifurcation is telling me that investors are chasing performance, both up and down and doing very little research. And that type of confusion is being played out because of the narrative that the Fed's kind of hemming and hawing day in and day out. So until value stocks start to make a comeback and until these growth stocks, which are-- and the leadership of the markets leisure and airlines, we don't have a market that has any type of what I call, like, basis to move that much higher until the financials, technology, and industrials take the lead, which they're not.DAVE BRIGGS: It is essentially George Costanza telling a woman, my name is George, I'm unemployed, and I live with my parents, and it worked, Jeff. It's that Seinfeld market. You are a genius. Jeff Bierman, appreciate it, brother.]"

It voted Tuesday to recommend a first shot, 7–4.Both jabs would be available for adults 60 and older—and they could be ready as soon as this summer, Dr. Ali Alhassani, head of clinical at Summer Health, tells Fortune.The panel’s recommendations are usually adopted by the FDA. Final approval would come from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Pfizer is also seeking approval for an RSV vaccine for pregnant individuals, to provide protection for infants from birth through the first six months of life. It showed 82% effectiveness through 90 days of life, and 69% effectiveness through six months, Pfizer announced in November, citing Phase III clinical trial data. The FDA is set to review the vaccine by August, according to the company.RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus infection, is a common illness that usually presents as a mild cold. Almost everyone has been infected with it by age 2, according to the CDC.But RSV isn’t mild for everyone. The virus hospitalizes tens of thousands of infants, young children, and elderly adults each year in the U.S. And it kills between 6,000 and 10,000 elderly adults in the U.S. each year, according to the national public health agency.Story continuesSymptoms can range from cold-like ailments such as sneezing, sore throat, fever, and stuffy nose, to bronchiolitis and pneumonia, the latter of which can prove fatal. What’s more, patients can quickly take a turn for the worse.RSV can also exacerbate the symptoms of people with chronic health problems like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or congestive heart failure, according to the CDC.Those at highest risk of a severe outcome from RSV, according to the CDC, include:Older adults 65+Infants 6 months and youngerPrematurely born infantsOlder adults and children younger than 2 with chronic heart or lung diseaseOlder adults and children with weakened immune systemsChildren with neuromuscular disorders, such as those who have difficulty swallowing or clearing mucusCases of RSV are leveling out after a spike in November. The virus, along with COVID and flu, was part of what some public health officials called a “tripledemic” late last year that put hospital capacity in jeopardy as viral circulation spiked, likely as a result of the lifting of pandemic restrictions. While the impact on the U.S. health system was significant, other factors like general hospital bed availability and a shortage of health care workers contributed, and levels of RSV were not unusually high, experts say.While RSV is a common winter virus, it can occur at any time of year. COVID disrupted the seasonal patterns of many viruses, resulting in oddly elevated RSV levels spring through fall of 2021.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeHow to save $750 a month, according to financial advisersThe 10 best high yield savings accounts for March 2023This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home]"

Shares have lost about 8.6% in that time frame, underperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Pfizer due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Q4 Earnings Top, 2023 Sales to DeclinePfizer’s fourth-quarter results were better than expected as it beat estimates for both earnings and sales.Pfizer reported fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $1.14, which significantly beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.03 per share as well as our estimate of $1.01 per share. Earnings rose 45% year over year.Revenues came in at $24.3 billion, which slightly beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.20 billion. Sales rose 2% from the year-ago quarter on a reported basis, reflecting an operational increase of 13% and currency headwinds of 11%. More than half of Pfizer’s revenues comprised direct sales and alliance revenues from its partner, BioNTech for the COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty, and revenues from Pfizer’s oral antiviral pill for COVID, Paxlovid.Excluding revenues from Comirnaty and Paxlovid, sales rose 5% operationally. Higher sales of key brands like Vyndaqel/Vyndamax, globally and Eliquis and Prevnar family in the United States were partially offset by weaker sales of Xeljanz and Ibrance globally.International revenues rose 14% to $15.81 billion. U.S. revenues rose 10% to $8.48 billion.Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI&amp;A) expenses rose 17% (operationally) in the quarter to $4.41 billion due to increased spending for Paxlovid and Comirnaty and recently acquired and new products. Adjusted R&amp;D expenses rose 7% to $3.61 billion due to costs related to oncology and non-COVID-19 vaccine programs and costs to develop recently acquired programs.Story continuesSegment DiscussionBeginning the third quarter of 2022, Pfizer has started reporting its revenues under three broad sub-segments of its Biopharma operating segment, Primary Care, Specialty Care and Oncology. Sales in the Primary Care segment rose 20% operationally to $17.35 billion. The Specialty Care unit recorded sales of $3.6 billion, down 3%. Sales of Oncology declined 3% to $3.0 billion.Primary CareIn Primary Care, direct sales and alliance revenues from BioNTech for Comirnaty were $11.33 billion in the quarter, up 3% year over year. Comirnaty sales rose 15% in the United States. Comirnaty sales rose 1% outside U.S. markets as strong growth in developed markets like Europe and Japan following the slowdown in deliveries in the third quarter was offset by lower demand for Comirnaty in emerging markets. Comirnaty sales were significantly better than our estimate of $7.57 billion.Paxlovid contributed $1.83 billion to sales in the fourth quarter, compared with $7.5 billion in the previous quarter. Paxlovid sales significantly missed our estimate of $4.959 billion for the drug.Alliance revenues from Bristol-Myers (for Eliquis) and direct sales rose 5% to $1.48 billion. Continued oral anti-coagulant adoption and market share gains in non-valvular atrial fibrillation benefited alliance revenues for Eliquis sales in the United States. However, growth in the United States was offset by declines in certain emerging markets.Global Prevnar family revenues rose 40% to $1.74 billion. The Prevnar family includes revenues from Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 (pediatric and adult) and Prevnar 20 (adult). Prevnar revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57 billion.Prevnar sales rose 79% in the United States due to strong demand for Prevnar 20 for the adult indication and favorable timing of government purchases for the pediatric indication. Prevnar revenues rose 10% in international markets.Pfizer acquired Biohaven in 2022 that added Nurtec ODT/Vydura for migraine to its portfolio. Nurtec ODT/Vydura generated sales of $211 million in the fourth quarter.Specialty CareRare disease drug, Vyndaqel/Vyndamax recorded sales of $680 million in the quarter, up 31% year over year, driven by continued strong uptake of the transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy indication in the United States and developed Europe, which was partially offset by a price decrease in Japan. Vyndaqel/Vyndamax sales were better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $633 million.Xeljanz sales declined 28% to $493 million due to lower prices and prescription volumes as doctors’ prescribing patterns shifted away from JAK inhibitors following label warnings.Enbrel revenues declined 8% to $236 million due to continued biosimilar competition in key European markets and Japan.Pfizer acquired Global Blood Therapeutics in 2022, adding Oxbryta for hemolytic anemia due to sickle cell disease to its portfolio. Oxbryta generated sales of $73 million, in the fourth quarter.OncologyIn Oncology, Ibrance revenues declined 4% year over year to $1.28 billion due to planned price decreases in some international developed markets and a continued increase in the proportion of patients accessing Ibrance through the U.S. Patient Assistance Program. Sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.29 billion.Xtandi recorded alliance revenues of $320 million in the quarter, up 5% year over year. Inlyta revenues were $243 million in the quarter, down 2%.Full-Year 2022 ResultsFull-year 2022 sales rose 23% to $100.3 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $100.24 billion. Sales were within the guided range of $99.5 to $102.0 billion. On an operational basis, sales rose 30% in the year. Excluding COVID-19 products, Paxlovid and Comirnaty, revenues grew 2% operationally.Adjusted earnings for 2022 were $6.58 per share, 62% year over year. Earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.47 per share as well as the guided range of $6.40 to $6.50.2023 GuidancePfizer issued its financial guidance for 2023.Revenues are expected in the range of $67.0 to $71.0 billion, indicating an operational decline of 29 from the 2022 level. Revenues were lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $74.5 billion.The revenue guidance includes approximately $13.5 billion in sales from Comirnaty, down 64% from the 2022 level and Paxlovid sales of approximately $8 billion, down 58%. Pfizer expects to launch both products in traditional commercial markets in the United States in the second half of 2023 as the company transitions away from the government market due to lower demand.Pfizer’s 2023 revenues are expected to decline due to steep expected declines in revenues from its COVID-19 products on lower demand. Pfizer expects sales of its COVID products to reach the lowest point in 2023, before potentially rising again in 2024.Pfizer expects about 102 million total vaccine doses administered in 2023 of which Pfizer is expected to maintain 64% market share. This means about 65 million doses of Comirnaty are expected to be administered in 2023.Excluding COVID-19 products, Pfizer expects its revenues to rise 7% to 9% on an operational basis in 2023.Albert Bourla, Pfizer’s chairman and chief executive officer, said that the company has the largest number of new product and indication launches planned for 2023.The operational revenue growth in 2023 is expected to be driven by Pfizer’s in-line products, potential new launches like RSV vaccine for older adults as well as newly acquired products, including etrasimod for ulcerative colitis, Nurtec and zavegepant for migraine, and Oxbryta for sickle cell disease.The expected decline in adjusted earnings is due to lower revenues from COVID products coupled with higher spending for near-term launches and late-stage pipeline candidates.Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.45, implying an operational decline of 48 from the 2022 level. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $4.41 per share.Adjusted cost of sales, as a percentage of sales, is expected in the range of 28 of total revenues. Research and development expense is expected in the range of $12.4-$13.4 billion. SI&amp;A spending is expected in the range of $13.8-$14.8 billion. Both SI&amp;A and R&amp;D expenses are expected to be significantly higher in 2023 versus 2022 to support the launch of potential new products as well as recently acquired assets.Acquired IPR&amp;D expenses are expected to be approximately $0.1 billion. The adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 15.0% in 2023. Adjusted Other (Income)/Deductions are expected to be approximately $1.5 billion of income.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted -13.52% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Pfizer has an average Growth Score of C, however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a B. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Pfizer has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

At the same time, the Dow added 1.05%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.98%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the technology platform and digital payments company had lost 10.96% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 3.99% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 3.91% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Paypal as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Paypal to post earnings of $1.07 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 21.59%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $6.97 billion, up 7.54% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $4.87 per share and revenue of $29.23 billion, which would represent changes of +17.92% and +6.23%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Paypal.

However, there are certain aspects of AI that major players such as Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI may not want the general public to be aware of.According to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Real Vision Group, the current AI boom is comparable to the biggest bubbles in history. Pal believes that the explosive growth of AI applications is going to create a huge bubble that will be impossible to ignore. He suggests that investing in semiconductor companies such as Nvidia is the best way for individuals to take advantage of this trend, as these companies provide the necessary processing power for AI systems.Microsoft and Google are currently the easiest ways for investors to gain exposure to AI. These companies have massive networks that will undoubtedly benefit from the growth of AI applications. Furthermore, both companies are pivoting their business models to incorporate AI, which will likely result in further growth and profitability.Pal also highlights the fact that AI is still in its early stages, and there are likely to be many more opportunities for investors to profit from this technology in the future. He notes that other major players such as Apple and Amazon are also developing their own AI technologies, and the Chinese have their own AI systems.However, Pal points out that the most significant game-changer in the AI industry is Stability AI. This open-source AI platform is available to everyone and is not restricted by any corporate interests or regulations. Pal suggests that this technology could be difficult to control and could lead to unforeseen consequences as it develops.Finally, Pal warns of the potential dangers of AI-generated fake content. With the development of chat, text-to-audio, and text-to-video AI technologies, the creation of fake content at an unprecedented scale is now possible. This poses a significant risk to society, and regulators will need to address this issue as AI technology continues to advance.Story continuesIn conclusion, while the growth of AI applications presents many opportunities for investors and businesses alike, there are also risks and challenges that need to be addressed. It is important for investors to stay informed and cautious as they navigate the rapidly changing AI landscape.Video Transcript- Look, I think it's fascinating. And it's fascinating because of Stability AI. So the AI is basically held with two giant corporations, Microsoft and Google. Now we know Apple is developing their own, not released yet beyond Siri. And I'm sure Amazon are in the race. And there will probably be others. The Chinese obviously have. So these guys, even if it's called Open AI, it's not open. They're heavily restricting.If you listen to Sam Altman, it was a shocking speech he gave when this started rolling out. He's like, you could see his face of fear, which is like the technology that we have we can't roll out. Society is not ready for the speed at which we could release this technology. So we are purposely going slow and cautiously.I spoke to the Google team yesterday-- same story. It's like you have no understanding what we have, and we can't really expose it to the world. And there's a lot of societal and terrifying things that they taught me through some of the scenarios that they're concerned over. Meanwhile, Stability AI is open source. Everybody's got it. Now regulators have taken 10 years and they can't even regulate crypto. How on Earth are they going to deal with this?So Stability AI is the game changer because there's somebody who can't be held back, and they're global. So that means that anybody can innovate there. So it's going to be very difficult. It's very difficult to keep the genie in the bottle. And it may come faster than we can even deal with.]"

Combining data protection, cyber resilience, and data management capabilities from both companies, IBM will launch its new IBM Storage Defender solution which will include Cohesity's data protection as an integral part of the offering. IBM Storage Defender is being designed to leverage AI and event monitoring across multiple storage platforms through a single pane of glass to help protect organizations' data layer from risks like ransomware, human error, and sabotage. Additionally, it will feature cyber vault and clean room features with automated recovery functions to help companies restore business-critical data in hours or minutes from what used to take days.The most recent Cost of a Data Breach Report released by IBM Security revealed costlier and higher-impact data breaches than ever before, with the global average cost of a data breach reaching an all-time high of $4.35 million for studied organizations and increasing nearly 13% over the last two years of the report.1 The report also showcased hybrid cloud environments as the most prevalent (45%) infrastructure amongst organizations studied. Averaging $3.8 million in breach costs, businesses that adopted a hybrid cloud model observed lower breach costs compared to businesses with a solely public or private cloud model, which experienced $5.02 million and $4.24 million on average respectively.IBM Storage Defender is being architected to give clients the ability to rapidly find their most recent clean copy of data. It is IBM's first offering to bring together multiple IBM and third-party solutions unifying primary, secondary replication, and backup management. Leveraging advanced storage capabilities, such as IBM Storage FlashSystem Safeguarded Copy for logical air gap, can help companies recover their most mission critical data within hours in the event of an attack. The first of such ecosystem integrations, Cohesity brings world class virtual machine protection managed in the hybrid cloud. Cohesity on-premises cluster managed with a cloud-based control plane supports a multi-vendor strategy optimized for data recovery to improve business continuity.Story continuesIBM Storage Defender will include:IBM Storage Protect (formerly IBM Spectrum Protect): comprehensive data resilience for physical file servers, virtual environments, and a wide range of applications (including SaaS-based workloads), where organizations can scale up to manage billions of objects per backup server.IBM Storage FlashSystem: a cyber-resilient, all-flash and hybrid storage platform for performance and capacity-intensive workloads.IBM Storage Fusion: container-native storage and data orchestration for Red Hat OpenShift for modern and next generation applications.Cohesity DataProtect: comprehensive protection for both traditional and modern data sources on a multicloud platform.

Cohesity DataProtect positions clients to copy and store data in multiple locations in onsite or offsite servers, or in multiple clouds. This helps to ensure that an up to date and accurate copy of data is available in case of cyber security breach or disaster - whether naturally occurring or through human error.""Data protection solutions like IBM Storage Defender are designed to support the deployment diversity, virtualization, containerization, and self-service that are among the requirements of the modern data center,"" said Phil Goodwin, Research Vice President, IDC. ""Together, IBM and Cohesity are combining their capabilities to build a foundation to reduce data fragmentation, maximize availability, and improve business resiliency for companies' hybrid cloud environments.""By integrating Cohesity with IBM Storage Defender, IBM clients gain new modern scale out architecture secured-by-design, as well as easy SaaS-based cyber vaulting capabilities. IBM Storage Defender will allow companies to take advantage of their existing IBM investments while significantly simplifying operations and reducing operating expenses.""Protecting against ransomware and other forms of malware requires a layered approach to data resiliency that involves early detection, automated protection, and rapid recovery,"" said Denis Kennelly, General Manager, IBM Storage. ""Fighting sophisticated threats to data is a team sport. When we looked at the overall market, we were impressed by the Cohesity platform and team's differentiated focus on scalability, simplicity, and security. By integrating our leading software-defined technologies, I am excited to bring essential cyber resiliency capabilities to IBM clients. Cyberattacks are on the rise, but data can be protected and restored when you are prepared.""A client's data is a uniquely valuable resource and can be a significant competitive advantage. But with more data, the more complex it is to manage. With rapidly increasing ransomware and other cyber threats, data is more valuable than ever. The combination of IBM and Cohesity brings a transformational, yet radically simple approach to cyber resilient data security and management. This includes the ability to manage everything in one place, leveraging a zero trust approach built to help detect, protect, and rapidly recover from ransomware attacks, and using built-in, AI-powered decision-making to facilitate action.""We have deep respect for IBM's brand and reputation in the market. Cohesity's technology leadership position in data security and management, combined with IBM's impressive storage portfolio, forward-looking vision, global reach, and client intimacy will allow clients to benefit from the best of Cohesity and IBM brought together,"" said Sanjay Poonen, CEO and President, Cohesity. ""We're honored and pleased to work with IBM to help organizations strengthen their cyber resilience in the face of evolving sophisticated adversaries, and look forward to building the relationship to benefit many clients across the world.""IBM plans to make the new IBM Storage Defender solution available in the second calendar quarter of 2023 beginning with IBM Storage Protect and Cohesity DataProtect.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Schlumberger Limited (SLB), Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Schlumberger shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry over the past year (+42.5% vs. +24.3%), reflecting the company's status as the largest oilfield services player, with a presence in every energy market across the globe. Being the leading provider of technology for complex oilfields, the firm is well-poised to take up new offshore projects in international markets.Higher oil prices is aiding its overall business. SLB reported strong fourth-quarter results driven by strong activities in land and offshore resources in North America and Latin America. It made significant progress in its sustainability initiatives in 2022. SLB expects its Transition Technologies portfolio to cross the $1 billion revenue mark in 2023.  However, the company’s balance sheet has massive debt exposure compared with the composite stocks in the industry. Also, the aggressive capital budget remains a headwind for the company. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on Schlumberger here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Becton, Dickinson have underperformed the Zacks Medical - Dental Supplies industry over the past year (-14.9% vs. -9.3%). The company has reported year-over-year fall in revenues, BD Life Sciences and international revenues were worrying. Lower COVID-only testing revenues are discouraging from a business perspective. BD’s operations in a highly consolidated medical technology industry and a stiff competitive space are worrying. Forex woes prevail.Nevertheless, BD’s improvement in the overall base revenues and the year-over-year uptick in bottom-line results in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 were impressive. Robust results by majority arms and in the United States were promising. The expansion of both margins bodes well.Regulatory approvals and launches were encouraging. BD’s strategic deals augur well. A strong solvency position is an added plus. BD’s results in fiscal fourth quarter were better than expected.(You can read the full research report on Becton, Dickinson here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Marathon Petroleum shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry over the past year (+67.0% vs. +23.5%). The company’s sale of its Speedway retail business for $21 billion provided the downstream operator with a much-needed cash infusion. The deal also comes with a 15-year fuel supply agreement per which Marathon Petroleum will supply 7.7 billion gallons of gasoline per year to 7-Eleven, thus ensuring a steady revenue stream.But while refining fundamentals have certainly brightened from the covid lows, the sector is not out of the woods yet in terms of cash flows that remain anaemic and well below the pre-crisis levels. In particular, the weakness in business travel demand remains a complicating factor.The continued increase in costs and expenses over the past few quarters and execution risks related to renewables foray are other negatives in the Marathon Petroleum story.

Shares have added about 5.1% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Marathon Petroleum due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Marathon Petroleum Posts Better-Than-Expected Q4 EarningsIndependent oil refiner and marketer Marathon Petroleum reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.65, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.54 and compared with a profit of merely $1.30 per share in the year-ago period.The company’s bottom line was favorably impacted by the stronger-than-expected performance of its key Refining &amp; Marketing segment. Operating income of the segment totaled $3.9 billion, ahead of its Zacks Consensus Estimate by 38%.Marathon Petroleum reported revenues of $40.1 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $32 billion and improved 12.6% year over year.In October 2022, the company completed its target of buying back $15 billion in common stock. This was after Marathon Petroleum concluded the sale of its Speedway business, comprising approximately 3,900 c-stores in 35 states to Japan-based retail group Seven &amp;i Holdings — the owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain — for $21 billion.In the fourth quarter, MPC repurchased $1.8 billion of shares and a further $700 million worth of shares this year till Jan 27. The company, which gave an additional $5 billion share repurchase approval, currently has a remaining authorization of $7.6 billion.Marathon Petroleum plans to spend $1.3 billion in capital expenditure this year. Of this, some $360 million is earmarked for low-carbon opportunities.Inside MPC’s SegmentsRefining &amp; Marketing: The Refining &amp; Marketing segment reported an operating income of $3.9 billion, which soared from the year-ago profit of just $881 million. The jump primarily reflects higher year-over-year margins that more than offset lower throughputs and refined product sales.Specifically, the refining margin of $28.82 per barrel improved significantly from $15.88 a year ago. Capacity utilization during the quarter was 94% — same as last year. However, total refined product sales volumes were 3,532 thousand barrels per day (mbpd), down from 3,600 mbpd in the year-ago quarter. Throughput also fell from 2,936 mbpd in the year-ago quarter to 2,895 mbpd and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 2,926 mbpd.Further, operating costs per barrel increased 4.9% year over year to $4.62. The cost escalation was blamed on higher energy-related outgo, more turnaround activity, as well as a special compensation expense.Midstream: This unit mainly reflects Marathon Petroleum’s general partner and majority limited partner interests in MPLX LP — a publicly traded master limited partnership that owns, operates, develops and acquires pipelines and other midstream assets.Segment profitability was $1.1 billion, edging up 1.7% from the fourth quarter of 2021. Earnings were supported by higher tariff rates and the stable, fee-based revenues from MPLX’s wide range of midstream energy services.Story continuesCosts, Capex &amp; Balance SheetMarathon Petroleum reported expenses of $35.4 billion in fourth-quarter 2022, rising 4.5% from the year-ago quarter.In the reported quarter, Marathon Petroleum spent $849 million on capital programs (59% on Refining &amp; Marketing and 35% on the Midstream segment) compared to $651 million in the year-ago period. As of Dec 31, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $8.6 billion and total debt, including that of MPLX, of $26.7 billion, with a debt-to-capitalization of 43.9%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted 26.12% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Marathon Petroleum has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise Marathon Petroleum has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

After price increases and ""really complicated"" weather in the month of December, CEO Michel Doukeris called the Q4 results in the U.S. a ""one-off, complicated quarter"" in a call with investors.Last quarter, the average price of a 24-pack of 12 oz. beer went up nearly 8%, per NielsenIQ data that was cited by Bump Williams Consulting. AB InBev's brands saw some of the highest price increases.Under its portfolio, the price of Bud Light went up 8.9% year-over-year in Q4, followed by Budweiser, up 8.7%, Stella Artois up 8.2%, and Michelob UItra, up 6.7%.That's compared to other leaders in the industry like Molson Coors' (TAP) Coors Banquet, which saw the largest jump, up 9.1%, Miller Lite &amp; Coors Light beer, up 8.6%, and Corona Extra (owned by Constellation Brands (STZ) ), up 6.5%.AB InBev CEO Michel Doukeris said the company needed to take a price hike because it was ""lagging behind inflation throughout most of the year, but catching up toward the end of the year,"" and encourages investors to ""think about the positive carry-over that this price will have in 2023.""The cost of beer, ale and other malt beverages at home was up 9% year-over-year, per January's CPI data.When asked how consumers have been responding to higher prices, he said, ""We know that beer is a resilient category."" He also anticipates that consumers ""will see their [consumers] purchase power coming back."" Reassuring investors, he said, ""the balance of volume and price will be very positive.""Cans of Budweiser and Bud Light sit on a shelf for sale at a convenience store, July 26, 2018 in New York City. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Bill Newlands, Constellation Brands CEO, told Yahoo Finance people will be back for beer.Following price increases in October, the company saw ""some short-term sensitivity,"" but says beer is pretty recession-proof.Story continues""It's fairly recession resistant,"" Newlands said. Consumers see beer as an ""affordable luxury.""""It's a critical piece of what they do for enjoyment, so I think we are going to continue to see this be an important category that does well and certainly, our brands will be at the forefront of that because of their sheer strength in the marketplace.""In Constellation Brands' latest quarterly results, which ended November 30, 2022, beer sales increased by 8%, while the number of cases sold to retailers by a distributor were flat year-over-year.—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Focus on consumer-friendly innovations is a key driver for the leading snacks company. In addition, the company’s robust pricing actions are yielding well.Let’s discuss this in detail.Acquisitions Driving GrowthThe Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is on track with prudent buyouts to drive growth. In December 2021, Hershey acquired Dot’s Pretzels LLC — the owner of Dot’s Homestyle Pretzels, a leading brand in the pretzel category. The addition of Dot’s Pretzels is a perfect match for Hershey’s growing salty snacking portfolio. The company also purchased Pretzels Inc. from an affiliate of Peak Rock Capital. The acquisition further expands Hershey’s snacking and production capabilities. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Hershey’s net sales included a 3.6-point benefit from the Pretzels and Dot's buyouts.On Jun 25, 2021, Hershey concluded the acquisition of Lily's, a leading better-for-you (BFY) confectionery brand. The buyout is in tandem with Hershey’s focus on creating an impressive BFY confection portfolio as part of its multi-pronged, better-for-you snacking strategy.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSeveral other companies in the food space, like The Kraft Heinz Company KHC, Hormel Foods Corporation HRL and McCormick &amp; Company, Incorporated MKC, are benefiting from acquisitions.In April 2022, Kraft Heinz acquired a majority stake in a Brazil-based condiments and sauces company — Companhia Hemmer Indústria e Comércio (""Hemmer""). The buyout has widened Kraft Heinz's International Taste Elevation platform and enhanced its presence across emerging markets. In January 2022, KHC acquired an 85% stake in Germany-based Just Spices GmbH (“Just Spices”). The buyout enhanced its direct-to-consumer operations and go-to-market expansion.Hormel Foods is strengthening its business through strategic acquisitions. In June, HRL acquired the Planters snacking portfolio from Kraft Heinz. HRL acquired Texas-based pit-smoked meats company Sadler's Smokehouse in March 2020. The buyout was in sync with Hormel Foods’ initiatives to strengthen its position in the foodservice space.McCormick has strategically increased its presence through acquisitions and strengthened its portfolio. In December 2020, MKC bought a 100% stake in FONA International, LLC and some affiliates. FONA’s diverse portfolio helps McCormick bolster its value-add offerings and expand the flavor solutions segment into attractive categories. In November 2020, McCormick acquired the parent company of Cholula Hot Sauce — a premium Mexico-based hot sauce brand.Story continuesBrand Strength &amp; Focus on InnovationHershey’s core brands — Hershey’s, Reese’s, Hershey’s Kisses, Jolly Rancher, Brookside, Sofit and Ice Breakers — have been growing strongly on the back of advertising investments, in-store merchandising and programming and innovation. In its last earnings call, management highlighted that its Reese’s retail sales grew 10.5% for 2022 despite capacity constraints. In fact, retail sales for Skinny Pop, Pirate’s Booty and Dot’s have more than doubled over the last three years.Hershey regularly brings innovation to its core brands to meet consumer demand and needs that are not addressed by its current portfolio. An important strategy of the company is to create a unique and holistic portfolio for every season, which can meet consumers’ seasonal shopping needs.Pricing Efforts: Key DriverHershey is undertaking strategic pricing initiatives to improve its performance. In fourth-quarter 2022, net price realization contributed 8.5 points to organic net sales growth. The company’s net price realization increased across the North America Confectionery, North America Salty Snacks and International units. In its last earnings call, management highlighted that net price realization and greater levels of productivity are likely to keep offsetting the persistent cost of goods, labor, packaging and logistics inflation through 2023.All said, we believe that HSY’s focus on effective pricing actions and the aforementioned upsides are likely to keep it well placed.The company’s stock has increased 13.7% in the past year, in line with the industry’s performance.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

SAF is being made from used cooking oil and agricultural waste, and, in the future, could be made from other feedstocks including household trash or forest waste.† To date, United has invested in the future production of over three billion gallons of SAF - the most of any airline in the world.*Consumers can take action too - in a first among U.S. airlines, United now shows an estimate of each flight's carbon footprint on a per economy seat passenger basis on its app and website, and travelers have the option to contribute to supplement United's investment in the UAV Sustainable Flight Fund, a first-of-its-kind investment vehicle designed to support start-ups focused on decarbonizing air travel by accelerating the research, production and technologies associated with SAF.Story continues""United has invested in more sustainable aviation fuel production than any airline in the world, by far,"" said United Chief Communications Officer Josh Earnest.

A number of retailers reporting earnings this week. Many warning of consumer weakness for the year ahead.Yahoo Finance's Brad Smith works all the time. Fortunate he just hangs around for our show as well, buddy. We appreciate that. You're working a little OT for us, brother.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, I'm going to be ready to take a nap in a little bit Steph Curry style, you know, at the end of this day. But for right now, we've got to focus on these retailers here. And happy birthday, by the way, Seana, as well.SEANA SMITH: Thank you.BRAD SMITH: Well, retail, it certainly has been a challenging quarter for the retail sector. Jharonne Martis told Yahoo Finance this week that the value proposition is key to the consumer, and the consumer will only up their wallets if they feel that they're getting a good price or a good discount. And data from the firm in collaboration with Centraprise revealed that average promotions, they rose in the month of January, which, even if helpful in churning inventory, can compress profit margins.So who among the retail environment is best positioned to weather economic uncertainty, and which companies carry the most risk? And the answers, they've been apparent in many of these sector earnings reports as results and forecasts have poured in from companies like Kohl's, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target even, just to name a few.So we've got two businesses, and two of them are outliers, and two of them not so much here. So the outliers to the positive side, you've got Kroger and Dollar Tree. Kroger shares, they're rising today after beating on earnings and issuing a strong forecast despite some macro headwinds.Let's linger there for a second on Kroger here particularly because that strength that you've been able to see in the grocery category, that's even as some of those items that are getting placed in the cart, they're still costing more. But at the same time, this is such a necessity and Kroger plays a critical role in that.Story continuesAnd given what Walmart, one of the other if not the major grocery categorical leader or at least market-share leader here in the US, has said, they still see strength in grocery. It's just about where consumers might be trading down to some of the homegrown brands that Walmart or that Target may be citing strength in their grocery departments and aisles as well. And so within that, they still have a little bit more of that exposure to discretionary than a Kroger here.So Kroger one of those companies that's an outlier. Dollar Tree is down despite reporting strong earnings. But beyond the share-price action, dollar stores continue to undergo some of the store expansion plans, increasing their footprint at a time when a lot of the other retailers are reevaluating their cost structure. We had discussed this earlier this week as well. Dollar/value stores, they have shown some strength in same-store sales even compared to prepandemic periods here.So let's shift from two of the outliers to the positive side to some companies that are not doing so great, and we'll start things off with the earnings from Best Buy and Home Depot here. First things first, Best Buy falling today after reporting a downbeat full-year outlook here and zeroing in on some of the comments that came over the course of the earnings call. Corie Barry, the chief executive officer at Best Buy, said that they are expecting most comparable sales pressure in the first quarter as the year-over-year compares ease through the year.But based on what they can see right now, they believe that calendar 2023 is going to be the bottom for the decline in tech demand. That certainly impacts them because if there's anything that we've heard from other retailers, it's weakness in the discretionary categories, and Best Buy has got a whole store of discretionary purchases there.And let's talk about Home Depot. Home Depot shares, they fell off after reporting earnings last week. Now, the retailer offering some flat sales guidance for the year here. And one thing that was also called out by the Home Depot chairman, president, and CEO, Ted Decker, was saying that ""while we expect this to be a year of moderation in demand for home improvement, we believe that the long-term underpinnings of our market remains strong"" and that they're well positioned to leverage distinct competitive advantages in capitalizing on compelling growth opportunities in their space. But it still comes back to where those DIY projects are taking place within the home and then additionally how they're impacted by the broader housing market as well even among some of those larger contractor purchases too.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly it will be interesting to see what exactly we hear from Home Depot or see from Home Depot, I should say, in the coming quarters. Brad, what stuck out to me was some of the Kroger results and specifically what we saw with some of their private-label brands, and it's very consistent to what we have seen or what we have heard from the company in the past. Once again, that was an outperformer, really showing that people are trading down. They're very cost conscious. They're figuring out. They're trying to save in every single way they can, and a lot of times they're trading down to those private labels, trading down-- a lot of times those private labels are actually what I prefer, but trading down, technically speaking, in terms of some of those cheaper options. And it's paying off, or at least Kroger is able to navigate what is certainly a very challenging time.DAVE BRIGGS: I chuckled only because it was the number-one thing that stood out to me--SEANA SMITH: There we go. We agree.DAVE BRIGGS: --among all these earnings reports because when you go back even earlier in the week, that's what stood out to me when you look at overall private-label earnings are up 11% in 2022. And Target saw 18% increase in the private label, and what did Kroger see? 10% increase among their private-label goods. So that is where I think all of these companies are focusing.The one thing I can never figure out here, Brad, is, look, we know there's a shift away from goods to services, but how do we explain the insane travel people are doing and able to afford when they're making cutbacks at Walmart and Kroger and Target? And I know we're not going to talk about travel, but it's a strange dichotomy happening in this economy at the moment.Let me ask you this. What does what we learn today mean as we get Nordstrom today and Costco? Because Costco certainly heavy on the groceries but also, I don't know about you, but Costco's discretionary, man. I mean, people go buy there and buy golf balls and--BRAD SMITH: Yes, Kirkland.DAVE BRIGGS: --tequila and sweatshirts. So it's not all essentials there. What do you think it means for those two?BRAD SMITH: I'm going to attempt to tackle everything. So you mentioned travel. You mentioned buying in bulk.DAVE BRIGGS: I mentioned way too much. Sorry, dude.BRAD SMITH: And you mentioned a very affluent consumer. So first on the travel front. Countercyclical recovery, right? And so if some of those dollars that they typically would have spent on goods on the lavish tech that they may have been putting into their home, any time you hear on a call like Best Buy's where people may already be well positioned in the number of smart speakers or need-based tech that they already have, then there's more of a cycle turnover that we're still waiting to come. So that's on the travel side.And then you think about the buying in bulk, which we're going to be talking about with Costco as well. Of course people are looking for those deals, looking to offset some of the price increases on a per unit basis. And what does that mean? That means buying in bulk. And particularly for Costco given the fact that they do have grocery and so closely annexed to all of the other discretionary items-- which also dovetails into how they're getting some of those discretionary things. They're going out and bidding against for inventory-- that is Banana Republic even to try and get that into their stores, and they're able to discount that that much more.And so all of that considered-- and I didn't even get to the last thing, which is the more affluent consumer. Just keep an eye on how they're showing up in the consumer confidence data as well going forward from here.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly. Well, you made your first Costco trip recently, didn't you?DAVE BRIGGS: It blew my mind.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. You were very impressed.DAVE BRIGGS: I'm going back this weekend.SEANA SMITH: Are you?DAVE BRIGGS: That place is incredible.BRAD SMITH: Have you been to the liquor department there?DAVE BRIGGS: It's like an amusement park, man.BRAD SMITH: It's great.DAVE BRIGGS: What?BRAD SMITH: Really solid liquor department there and most Costcos.SEANA SMITH: I have a feeling Dave visited it on his first trip. You didn't?DAVE BRIGGS: I actually didn't see it.SEANA SMITH: What? Wow. I never would have guessed that. You know, you never cease--DAVE BRIGGS: We talk about that Uber order.SEANA SMITH: --to surprise me. Brad, thanks so much.And also a quick programming note. Be sure to stick around for Yahoo Finance's ""After the Call"" where Brad Smith and myself, we will be breaking down Costco's biggest takeaways from their earnings report and also the company's call.

(ISRG) closed the most recent trading day at $228.90, moving +0.69% from the previous trading session. This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.76%. At the same time, the Dow added 1.05%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.98%.Heading into today, shares of the company had lost 9.5% over the past month, lagging the Medical sector's loss of 4.24% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 3.91% in that time.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. On that day, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is projected to report earnings of $1.17 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 3.54%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $1.58 billion, up 6.23% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $5.27 per share and revenue of $6.88 billion, which would represent changes of +12.61% and +10.6%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Intuitive Surgical, Inc.Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.32% lower within the past month. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell).Investors should also note Intuitive Surgical, Inc.'s current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 43.17. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 25.99, so we one might conclude that Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is trading at a premium comparatively.Story continuesAlso, we should mention that ISRG has a PEG ratio of 3.62.

Robotics are creeping their ways into our lives in both obvious and unexpected ways. From home robots designed to bring us drinks and tell us the weather, to robots filling orders in warehouses and drones flying packages to our houses, robots are proliferating. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to further fuel the proliferation of robotics in the years ahead. According to market research firm Statista, revenue from the worldwide robotics market is projected to reach just under $35 billion in 2023 and swell to nearly $45 billion over the next four years. In the future, robots will perform more work and tasks for humans as the world we live in becomes increasingly automated. Here are three top robotics growth stocks for investors to consider buying.AMZNAmazon$94.40LMTLockheed Martin$473.45ISRGIntuitive Surgical$230.60Amazon (AMZN)An image of pills surrounding the Amazon (AMZN( logo representing ONEM stock.Source: MACH Photos / Shutterstock.comE-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) might not be the first company that comes to mind when one thinks of robotic stocks. However, the Seattle-based giant is rapidly growing its presence in the robotics space. Currently, Amazon is in the process of acquiring iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) for $1.7 billion, or $61 per share in cash. With its robotic Roomba vacuum cleaners, iRobot is arguably one of the best-known robotics companies in the world among consumers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAmazon’s purchase of iRobot  is currently running a gauntlet of regulatory approvals.  The acquisition comes after the company introduced its “Astro” smart home robot that is designed to help people with small chores and tasks. The Astro robot can map out floor plans, respond to basic commands, and recognize human faces. The home robot can also answer questions, play music, and display the weather for people. Beyond home robots, Amazon is also developing and deploying an army of delivery drones to get its products to homes and businesses worldwide.Story continuesThe company’s increasing focus on robotics might help boost its growth, which has been flagging coming out of the pandemic. Over the past 12 months, AMZN stock has declined 37% to trade at $93. However, so far in 2023, its share price has recovered 12.5%, providing a glimmer of hope to investors.Lockheed Martin (LMT)Close top view of a Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35C Lightning II with afterburner onSource: ranchorunner / Shutterstock.comLike Amazon, defense contractor Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is not a pure-play robotics company. However, LMT remains a major player in the field.This is because robots are increasingly becoming the norm in military and combat operations around the world. Robots today are used in military operations to perform dangerous tasks ranging from reconnaissance missions behind enemy lines and dismantling mines and explosive devices to flying unmanned fighter jets. Robots are the future of warfare.And Lockheed Martin is leading the race when it comes to developing robots for use in military operations. The company has even developed a robotic mule, at a cost of $500,000 each, that carries soldiers’ equipment for them while on missions, taking heavy gear off the backs of human soldiers. The use of robots by the U.S. military has grown so much that robotic dogs are now being used to patrol the base at Cape Canaveral, Florida,  though another company makes those robot dogs.Still, when it comes to building military robots of the future, few companies can touch Lockheed Martin. The company is even taking its robots into outer space.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comLooking to the world of medicine, we come to Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG). The  California-based company makes robots that are used by doctors to carry out minimally invasive surgeries. Its main robotics product is the “da Vinci Surgical System” that is used to carry out operations on body parts, incluing prostates and hearts. Controlled by a surgeon, the robotic surgical system can repair damaged heart valves in patients.Intuitive Surgical sells the da Vinci Surgical System for $1.5 million. The company also makes money through maintenance contracts and expenditures on instruments that are used during surgeries, many of which can only be used once. The company is a global leader when it comes to employing robotics in surgical procedures.Intuitive Surgical continues to grow at a brisk clip, earning $1.3 billion of net income during 2022, double the amount that it generated  in 2017. Analysts, on average, expect its earnings to grow as much as 16% in 2023.ISRG stock has fallen 21% over the past 12 months.

We estimated the same to be $2.91 billion.Quarter in detailBoston Properties’ rental revenues (excluding termination income) for the office portfolio came in at $697.3 million, rising 2.5% year over year. The same for the hotel &amp; residential segment aggregated $22.6 million, indicating a jump of 39.6% year over year.  BXP’s share of same property NOI on a cash basis (excluding termination income) totaled $474.1 million, up 6.8% year over year.Its share of EBITDAre (on a cash basis) as of Dec 31, 2022, was $440.3 million, up from $429.5 million as of Sep 30, 2022.BXP’s in-service properties’ occupancy fell 30 basis points sequentially to 88.6%. We estimated the same to be 88.8%.Story continuesPortfolio ActivityAs of Dec 31, 2022, Boston Properties’ portfolio comprised 194 properties, encompassing 54.1 million square feet of space. This included 13 properties under construction/redevelopment.During the fourth quarter, the company executed 1.1 million square feet of leases with a weighted average lease term of 7.8 years.BXP closed the acquisition of around 27% interest in the joint venture that owns 200 Fifth Avenue, a 14-story, 855,000 square feet, LEED Gold-certified premier workplace in the Midtown South submarket of Manhattan, NY, for roughly $280.1 million. This includes $120.1 million of cash and $160 million of BXP’s pro rata share of the outstanding loan secured by the property. At present, the property is around 93% leased.BXP commenced the redevelopment of 105 Carnegie Center, a 70,000 square feet property in Princeton, NJ. The property will be redeveloped into a laboratory/life sciences space encompassing around 73,000 square feet.In the quarter, the company disposed of the residential component of The Avant at Reston Town Center, a 15-story, 359-unit luxury multifamily building spanning roughly 329,000 square feet in Reston, VA, for $141 million.

Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

Michal Mrozek / UnsplashCruise companies are still continuing with their new vessel orders despite choppy waters in an uncertain consumer spending environment — and face the risks of piling on more debt.Take Norwegian Cruise Lines, which is planning to invest $2.4 billion in ship construction-related capital expenditures for 2023, and anticipates the figure to be $500 million and $1.8 billion for 2024 and 2025, respectively. Royal Caribbean Group also sees approximately $4.1 billion in ship construction costs in 2023 and an aggregate total of $9.8 billion for all existing ship orders. Carnival Corporation expects contracted new-builds to be $1.8 billion for 2023, and is reshaping its investment spending outlook to scale back on capital expenditures.The three major cruise lines, with $74 billion of debt combined, according to Bloomberg, face incoming competition from billionaires and hotels hoping to start their own fleets. Betting on the luxury tier and existing customer loyalty bases, these new entrants will be vying for a chunk of the premium market.After scrambling to renegotiate credit terms and grabbing lifelines from governments and banks to stay afloat during the pandemic, cruise companies are now in a balancing act between paying off debt and rebuilding profit streams.The industry was exposed for its wasteful practices and detrimental environmental impact, no more so than during the height of the pandemic. Facing significant backlash and pressure to address carbon footprints, cruise lines will likely take on even heftier costs to reduce food waste and implement additional sustainability measures. Some are unwilling to give up new-build pipelines, but all are reevaluating operational structures and strategic priorities to sail back to profitable growth.“You’ve likely seen some of the actions we’ve already taken to improve our cost structure,” said Frank del Rio, president and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line, during the company’s most recent earnings call. “Normalization of marketing spend, corporate overhead reductions, itinerary optimization, supply chain initiatives, and thoughtful rationalization of product delivery. We will continue to leave no stone unturned as we identify and evaluate incremental opportunities.”Story continuesWhat Norwegian Cruise’s Mounting Costs Tell UsAdjusted net cruise costs based on passenger capacity compared to pre-pandemic levels. Source: Morgan Stanley ResearchNorwegian served 1.7 million guests in 2022, and expects its full-year book position in 2023 to top pre-pandemic levels. It is optimistic that it can continue to ride 2022 tailwinds from marketing, pricing and service strategies despite plans for trimming down costs.The cruise line operates through three brands, including Norwegian, Regent and Oceania Cruises, and foresees one new build per brand for a total of three new ships to join its fleet in 2023. At least one new ship is scheduled to be delivered each year through 2028. According to its recent annual report, around 80 percent of each ship’s contract price will be funded through export credit financing, which it is working to secure.Export credit financing is a typical loan arrangement to finance cruise ship constructions. This is often negotiated with export credit facilities of countries where the shipyards are located, allowing cruise companies to place ship orders without having to pay much in advance. The main portion of the cost will be due on each ship’s delivery date, which could be years later.Measuring Cruise Lines DebtAverage cost of debt financing for three major cruise lines. Source: Morgan Stanley ResearchRoyal Caribbean Group has the same approach and expects 2023 capacity to increase by approximately 14 percent from 2019 levels. Its wholly-owned brands will also each welcome a new ship in 2023, with Silversea debuting the first of the Evolution class, Celebrity Cruises welcoming the fourth ship in its Edge series and Royal Caribbean International marking its first new ship class in nine years.Like Norwegian, 80 percent of the cost for each of its seven ships on order will be funded through export credit arrangements. The remaining portion will be filled through capital expenditure by the time of the ship’s delivery dates. Royal Caribbean had approximately $7.6 billion of committed financing for ships on order as of the end of 2022.“Our liquidity remains strong, and we are focused on expanding our margins to further enhance EBITDA [earnings before interests, tax, depreciation and amoritization] and free cash flow,” said chief financial officer Naftali Holtz.Holtz hopes to return Royal Caribbean’s balance back to investment grade. “During the fourth quarter, we repaid $600 million of debt maturities and closed on the refinancing of 2 billion of secured and guaranteed debt previously due June 2023.” Holtz adds that $2.3 billion of its existing revolving credit facility has been extended to April 2025. The company closed on a $700 million refinancing deal earlier in February with RCI Holdings to repay principal payments on debt maturing between 2023 and 2024.After seeing better-than-expected results in 2022, Royal Caribbean is focused on improving guest repeat rates and improving margins to enhance cash flows and create more discretionary capital.Unlike Norwegian and Royal Caribbean, Carnival is scaling back on its fleet expansion plans, which is a drastic change from when it was building multiple ships on an annual basis pre-pandemic.“We have just four ships on order through 2025, plus our second incredible Seabourn luxury expedition ship to be delivered in 2023,” said Josh Weinstein, Carnival Corporation president and CEO in the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call. “This is our lowest order book in decades. We don’t expect any new ships in 2026 and anticipate just one or two new builds each year for several years thereafter.”A so-called fleet optimization plan will be prioritized instead, which involves removing smaller, less efficient ships and improving ship operating cost per ALBD [available lower berth day, a standard metric of passenger capacity]. Carnival is also going with a leaner capital expenditure profile to boost efforts for deleveraging, strengthening its balance sheet and achieving better credit ratings. In support of these objectives, a new $2.1 billion multi-currency revolver was also announced to be replacing existing arrangements starting in August 2024.While the cruise line does not have any constructions of its own in the pipeline, Carnival is in a joint venture with China to launch Adora Cruises, which will be the first large Chinese-built cruise ship. The ship’s planning to sail the Maritime Silk Road, which connects the Chinese mainland with Southeast Asia, India, Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula and the Mediterranean, at the end of 2023.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

(NASDAQ:ROST) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript February 28, 2023Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Ross Stores Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. The call will begin with prepared comments by management followed by a question-and-answer session. Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts, new store openings and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations.Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2021 Form 10-K and fiscal 2022 Form 10-Qs and 8-Ks on file with the SEC. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer.Barbara Rentler: Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2022 performance, followed by our outlook for 2023. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. As noted in today's press release, during a very competitive holiday season, our fourth quarter sales and earnings results exceeded our guidance due to customer's positive response to our improved assortment and stronger value offerings. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.31 on net income of $447 million.These results compare to earnings per share of $1.04 on net earnings of $367 million for the 13 weeks ended January 29, 2022. Sales for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $5.2 billion with comparable store sales up 1% on top of a 9% increase for the same period in 2021. For the 2022 fiscal year, earnings per share were $4.38 on net income of $1.5 billion compared to $4.87 per share on net earnings of $1.7 billion in 2021. Sales for 2022 were $18.7 billion, with comparable store sales down 4% versus a robust 13% increase in the prior year. Fourth quarter operating margin was 10.7% compared to 9.8% in 2021. This improvement was mainly driven by lower freight and incentive costs that were partially offset by unfavorable timing of packaway-related expenses.Story continuesDepartment store, shopping, centerPhoto by Carl Raw on UnsplashNow, let's turn to additional details on our fourth quarter results. For the holiday selling season, shoes was the best-performing merchandise area, while Florida was the strongest region. Similar to Ross, dd's DISCOUNTS sales trends improved compared to the prior quarter but continue to trail Ross' results, primarily due to ongoing inflationary pressures that are continuing to have a larger impact on dd's lower income customers. Inventory levels moderated significantly from the first half of 2022 with consolidated inventories down 11% versus last year. Average store inventories during the quarter were down slightly compared to 2021 holiday period, while packway merchandise represented 40% of total inventories similar to last year. We also believe, we are well positioned to take advantage of the numerous buying opportunities in the marketplace.As noted in today's release, the company repurchased a total of 2.1 million and 10.3 million shares of common stock, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price of $231 million in the quarter and $950 million for the fiscal year. These purchases were made pursuant to the 2-year $1.9 billion program announced in March of 2022. We expect to complete the $950 million remaining under this authorization in fiscal 2023. Our Board also recently increased our quarterly cash dividend by 8% to $0.335 per share to be payable on March 31, 2023 to stockholders of record as of March 14, 2023. Our stock repurchase and increased dividend program reflects our continued commitment to enhancing stockholder value and returns, as well as our confidence in the strength of our balance sheet and projected future cash flows.Now Adam will provide further details on our fourth quarter results and additional color on our outlook for fiscal 2023.Adam Orvos: Thank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, comparable store sales rose 1% for the quarter on top of a 9% gain in the prior year. This slight increase was due to growth in the size of the average basket as traffic was relatively flat compared to last year. As Barbara discussed earlier, fourth quarter operating margin of 10.7% was up 90 basis points from 9.8% in 2021. Cost of goods sold grew 15 basis points versus last year due to a combination of factors. Distribution expenses rose 90 basis points primarily due to timing of packaway-related costs and deleverage from the opening of our Houston distribution center earlier in the year, while domestic freight and occupancy delevered by 20 and 5 basis points, respectively.Partially offsetting these costs with higher merchandise margin, which grew by 15 basis points as the benefit from lower ocean freight costs more than offset somewhat higher markdowns. Buying expenses also improved by 85 basis points due to lower incentive compensation. SG&amp;A for the period levered by 105 basis points again, primarily due to lower incentive expense. Now let's discuss our outlook for fiscal 2023. As Barbara noted in our press release, the macroeconomic and geopolitical environments remain highly uncertain. As a result, we believe it is prudent to remain conservative when planning our business. While we hope to do better for the 52 weeks ending January 27, 2024, we are planning comparable store sales to be relatively flat. If sales perform in line with this plan, we expect earnings per share for 2023 to be in the range of $4.65 to $4.95 compared to $4.38 in fiscal 2022.It is important to note that fiscal 2023 is a 53 week year. Incorporated in this guidance range is an estimated benefit to earnings per share of approximately $0.15 from the extra week. Our guidance assumptions for the 2023 year include the following, total sales are planned to grow by 2% to 5% for the 53 weeks ending February 3rd, 2024. Comparable store sales for the 52 weeks ending January 27, 2024 are planned to be relatively flat. Based on these sales plans, operating margin for the full year is expected to be in the range of 10.3% to 10.7%. This reflects the resetting of the baseline for incentive compensation, higher wages, the deleveraging effect on flattish same-store sales and lower freight costs. Also incorporated in this operating margin guidance is an estimated benefit of about 20 basis points from the 53rd week.For 2023, we expect to open approximately 100 new locations comprised of about 75 Ross and 25 dd's DISCOUNTS. As usual, these openings do not include our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores. Net interest income is estimated to be $115 million. Depreciation amortization expense inclusive of stock-based amortization is forecast to be about $570 million for the year. The tax rate is projected to be about 24% to 25% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $339 million. In addition, capital expenditures for 2023 are planned to be approximately $810 million as we make further investments in our stores, supply chain and merchant processes to support our long-term growth and to increase efficiencies throughout the business.Let's turn now to our guidance for the first quarter. Elevated inflation continues to impact our low to moderate income customer. As such, we are also planning comparable store sales to be relatively flat for the 13 weeks ending April 29, 2023. This compares to a 7% decrease and a 13% gain in the first quarters of 2022 and 2021, respectively. If sales perform in line with this plan, we expect earnings per share for the first quarter of 2023 to be $0.99 to $1.05 versus $0.97 last year. The operating statement assumptions that support our first quarter guidance include the following. Total sales are planned to be up 1% to 4% versus last year's first quarter. We would then expect first quarter operating margin to be 9.6% to 9.9% compared to 10.8% last year.The expected decline reflects the deleveraging effect of same-store sales perform in line with our plan, unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs and higher wages. Further, merchandise margin is forecast to benefit from lower freight costs. We plan to add 19 new stores consisting of 11 Ross and 8 dd's DISCOUNTS during the period. Net interest income is estimated to be $28 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% to 25% and diluted shares are forecast to be about $341 million. Now, I will turn the call back to Barbara Rentler for closing comments.Barbara Rentler: Thank you, Adam. To sum up, over the past three years, we have faced a wide range of unprecedented challenges from the COVID pandemic, supply chain disruptions as well as ongoing inflationary headwinds. These factors have not only negatively impacted our own business, but also our customer's household budgets, their discretionary income and their shopping behaviors. As a result, our shoppers today are seeking even stronger values when visiting our stores. In response, our merchants are fine-tuning our assortments with an increased focus on delivering the most competitive bargains available, while continuing to adjust our product mix based on our customers evolving preferences. Looking ahead, we have significantly increased our focus on strictly controlling inventory and operating expenses throughout the company.We strongly believe that these measures will enable us to maximize our potential for both sales and profit growth in 2023 and beyond. At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have.Lorraine Hutchinson: Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask about freight, both of the components within gross margin. How much recovery do you have baked into your guidance for this year versus pre-COVID levels? And then how much opportunity remains for the next year and the year after?See also 12 High Growth SaaS Stocks that are Profitable and 15 Best Short-Term Stocks to Buy.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

AEO posted fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results, wherein the top and bottom lines came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate, and the latter increased year over year. Results were backed by better demand and robust margins. The company’s shares jumped 6.9% in the after-market trading session on Mar 1 following better-than-expected results.Management entered fiscal 2023 with solid brands and healthy inventory status. AEO stated that the global supply chain continues to normalize, which is enhancing its cost structure. The company is also focused on curtailing expenses. That being said, an uncertain macro landscape and the overall consumer spending pattern caused management to offer cautious guidance for fiscal 2023.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have rallied 26.7% in the past six months compared with the industry’s growth of 13.2%.Quarterly DetailsAmerican Eagle posted adjusted earnings of 37 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 30 cents. Our estimate for the bottom line was 25 cents a share. The bottom line increased 5.7% from adjusted earnings of 35 cents reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.American Eagle Outfitters, Inc.

QuoteTotal net revenues of $1,496.1 million dipped nearly 1% year over year, while it beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,470 million. Our estimate for the top line was $1,438.3 million.Brand revenues declined 2% in the quarter but were better than AEO’s expectation of a mid-single-digit decline. However, revenues were partly aided by a nearly one-percentage-point contribution from the supply-chain business and Quiet Platforms.Brand-wise, revenues fell 8% to $962 million for AE but surpassed our estimate of $946.5 million. Comparable sales (comps) for the AE brand dropped 9% year over year. Revenues rose 8% to $464 million for Aerie and beat our estimate of $430.1 million. Comps for the Aerie brand declined 2% from the fourth-quarter fiscal 2021 level.Consolidated store revenues were flat year over year, though the same rose 5% from the pre-pandemic levels (the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019). American Eagle’s total digital revenues were down 9% year over year, while the same advanced 19% from the pre-pandemic levels. Digital revenues accounted for 36% of the total revenues.The gross profit ascended around 4% year over year to $507 million, and the gross margin expanded 150 basis points (bps) to 33.9%. The gross margin came ahead of management’s expectations due to lower-than-expected promotions.Further, AEO’s merchandise margin was solid, backed by reduced product and transportation costs, somewhat negated by increased markdowns. The gross margin benefited from reduced compensations and delivery costs, partly countered by increased distribution and warehousing costs and elevated rent. The gross margin also bore an 80-bps adverse impact of the scaling of the Quiet Platforms business.SG&amp;A expenses remained flat year over year at $351 million. As a percentage of sales, S&amp;A expenses increased 30 bps to 23.5%.The company’s adjusted operating income came in at approximately $96 million, which increased from the year-ago period’s tally of roughly $92 million. The adjusted operating margin was 6.4%, up 30 bps year over year.The GAAP operating income was nearly $74 million in the quarter, down from around $80 million in the year-ago period. The GAAP operating income included a $17-million loss from Quiet Platforms. The operating margin of 4.9% contracted 40 bps year over year.For the Aerie brand, the adjusted operating income of $56.7 million increased significantly from the year-ago quarter’s $22.7 million. The AE brand’s operating income declined from $182.1 million to $153.6 million in the quarter under review. The adjusted operating income margin increased 690 bps to 12.2% for the Aerie brand, while it shrank 150 bps to 16% for the AE brand.Story continuesOther Financial DetailsAmerican Eagle ended the reported quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $170.2 million.

Following a temporary pause (in September), management reinstated a quarterly cash dividend of 10 cents per share on Feb 28, 2023, which is payable on Apr 21, 2023 to shareholders of record as of Apr 6.AEO’s closing inventory improved 6% from the year-ago quarter’s reading to $585 million. Inventory units were up 4%. The increase in inventory resulted from earlier-than-anticipated deliveries (thanks to the continued normalization of the supply chain) and increases associated with Mexico and the Todd Snyder brand.GuidanceFor the fiscal first quarter, American Eagle expects revenue growth in the range of flat to an increase of low single digits. The operating income is likely to remain flat year over year.For fiscal 2023, revenue growth is likely to be in the range of flat to an increase of low single digits.

He knows he has Jobs Partnership Peoria to thank for it. And he's doing the hard work to keep it going.We're calling him ""John R."" to help protect his privacy. Getting back on your feet after incarceration can be tough. Very tough.Still, John R. wanted Regions Bank to help share his story - because he wants people everywhere to know second chances are for real.The Saving Grace:""John is a legitimate go-getter,"" said Vicky Eckhardt, a financial opportunities coach who's worked with John to build his credit - and his finances - since 2021. ""He follows up. If you talk about something, John actually goes and does it.""Eckhardt and her Jobs Partnership Peoria colleagues are there not just for John, but for hundreds of other people in Illinois through their organization's effective Reentry Program.

260,0de91f2a-ccc9-35fb-8b25-4a8d3b6296fe,SNA,2023-03-03,Those who invested in Snap-on (NYSE:SNA) three years ago are up 90%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-snap-nyse-sna-103052813.html,1677839452,STORY,['SNA'],"[One simple way to benefit from the stock market is to buy an index fund. But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. Just take a look at Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE:SNA), which is up 76%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 32% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 23% , including dividends .So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 3 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Snap-on There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During three years of share price growth, Snap-on achieved compound earnings per share growth of 11% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 21% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that, as the business progressed over the last few years, it gained the confidence of market participants. It's not unusual to see the market 're-rate' a stock, after a few years of growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Snap-on has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Snap-on, it has a TSR of 90% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Snap-on shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 23% over one year. That's including the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 13% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Snap-on better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Snap-on (1 is significant!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Of course Snap-on may not be the best stock to buy.

(AWS) that allows customers to combine Dynamic Quality of Service (QoS) from Verizon with AWS edge services. This combination delivers the ability for customers to deploy low latency, high bandwidth applications across a variety of emerging use cases.For years, technologists have wanted the flexibility to choose network attributes and optimize the back-end architecture based on application requirements. Today’s innovative applications such as computer vision, internet of things (IoT), robotics, autonomous vehicles, and enhanced sports and stadium experiences, are heavily dependent on specific network attributes. The capability to select Quality of Service with minimal latency, edge discovery, and location attributes will help developers build performance sensitive applications, map to, and operate from the closest AWS Wavelength Zone, AWS infrastructure deployments that embed AWS compute and storage services at the edge of the Verizon 5G network.“Developers &amp; Enterprises who utilize our 5G Network and Edge Services are able to orient their applications to deliver low latency use cases for their customers,” said Anil Guntupalli Vice President of Technology and Strategy Planning for Verizon. “As part of this evolution, network APIs represent a change in the way network resources are consumed, so that network capabilities can be incorporated into applications in a programmatic way, favoring a much more agile environment for innovation and co-creation of services. We aim to transform &amp; abstract our network into platforms, redefining the way developers can co-create services, and are exploring ways to provide more capabilities as we get more feedback from our developer community.”Story continues“We hear from customers about their need to build emerging use cases like IoT and robotics, which require consistent low-latency for an uninterrupted end customer experience,” said Jan Hofmeyr, vice president, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) at AWS. “By working with Verizon to bring together their Network APIs with AWS Wavelength, we are demonstrating for the industry and developers the ability to drive these emerging use cases easily and seamlessly.”The new APIs are available in a beta version for select customers and can be accessed through Verizon or AWS API portals.Customers taking advantage of Edge Discovery &amp; Quality of Service (QoS) APIsOne customer positioned to take advantage of this advancing technology is Holo-Light. Holo-Light specializes in unlocking the full potential of augmented and virtual reality in the enterprise market by providing advanced visualization and performance through XR streaming technology. “Quality of service and low latency are critical in ensuring a seamless experience for Holo-Light’s customers. By leveraging AWS Wavelength and Verizon’s Dynamic Quality of Service, we can ensure that our customers receive the highest level of quality and reliability for their XR experiences, allowing higher quality graphics, more realistic interactions, and a better overall experience,” said Florian Haspinger, CEO of Holo-Light.Another customer focused on high throughput and low latency use cases is HarperDB, a distributed global application. The ability to dynamically route workloads based on geography through AWS Wavelength on Verizon will continue to allow HarperDB to improve application performance while dramatically reducing cost and improving customer experiences. This flexibility is critical for HarperDB customers like Edison Interactive, whose platform relies on the work HarperDB, Verizon, and AWS are doing to reduce latency by up to 250x in Edison’s digital out-of-home Golf Cart experience across 30,000 golf carts nationwide.Verizon’s Mobile Edge ComputeVerizon 5G Edge brings together Verizon’s ultrafast, low latency 5G Ultra Wideband network and AWS’s cloud services to enable the creation of next-generation applications. Applications are deployed to AWS Wavelength Zones and seamlessly access the breadth of AWS services in the region. That means developers can build applications that are experientially immersive, with fast response requirements, such as game and live video streaming, machine learning inference at the edge, and augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR).AWS Wavelength offers numerous features and options—AWS Graviton processor-based, memory-optimized, and general-purpose Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS) volumes—to help customers choose the most suitable compute and storage respectively for their workloads. Additionally, Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) help customers deploy applications on AWS Wavelength Zones and across broader AWS Regions and the edge.Verizon 5G Edge with AWS Wavelength is currently available in 19 locations including Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, Nashville, New York City, Phoenix, the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Tampa, and Washington DC.

Not only was the bear market brutal from a duration and magnitude standpoint, it was not a smooth downward trend either. Because of the vicious countertrend “bear market” rallies, the market was difficult to short and even more difficult to find a bottom.During the 2000-2003 bear market, the Dow Jones mounted three significant rallies that ultimately failed prior to the market bottoming. Below, the rallies 2000-2003 Dow rallies are illustrated on the SPDR Dow Jones ETF:Is 2023 Setting Up for a Repeat?The war in Ukraine drags on, inflation is stubbornly high, and equities gave up gains in February to finish lower. For these reasons, even after the rally the U.S. equity market has had off the lows so far in 2023, many investors are still on guard.However, below, we will list 6 pieces of evidence as to why this time is different, including:1.   Fed Pivot Potential: While the Fed has remained hawkish, U.S. investment banks believe the Fed may pivot at some point. For example, Morgan Stanley is in the camp that the Fed may cut rates in December of 2023 (and slow rate hikes before that). The Fed controls the market’s liquidity and is the most vital factor to follow.2.   200-day Moving Average Historical Evidence: The S&amp;P 500 Index has exceeded its 200-day moving average for more than 25 days. Over the past 73 years, the index has never reached bear market territory (20% correction off highs), cleared the 200-day for this amount of time, and made fresh lows.3.   Entering a Seasonally Strong Period: Equity markets are entering the strongest quarter of the four-year presidential cycle.Story continues4.   Positive Earnings Reactions Are Becoming Common: Despite the market pullback early on Wednesday, several stocks shot higher on massive volume after strong earnings reports, including First Solar.Nvidia, which gapped up on earnings last week, barely budged on Wednesday after the company announced a $10 billion mixed securities shelf offering Tuesday night – a bullish sign.5.   The “Wall of Worry is Back”: Seldom does the market crash when the crowd expects it. After a small pullback in February, the number of bulls (38.4%) in the Investor’s Intelligence Survey hit their lowest levels of the year.6.   International Strength has Arrived: We live in a world economy now. As such, it is a bullish sign to see strength in world markets. The iShares MSCI EAFE ETF, which tracks a mix of mid to large-cap equities in developed markets, is trending higher and has retaken its 200-day moving average. China, the world’s largest economic influence outside the United States, is reopening after covid lockdowns. Meanwhile, Latin American countries such as Mexico and Argentina show surprising strength.TakeawayThe weight of evidence suggests that the market is not heading for another 2000 rewind. Unfortunately, there are no certainties in the market. However, investors must play the odds. Regardless, if you keep an open mind, manage risk, and stay flexible; in the long run you will achieve strong investing results no matter what.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

However, there are certain aspects of AI that major players such as Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI may not want the general public to be aware of.According to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Real Vision Group, the current AI boom is comparable to the biggest bubbles in history. Pal believes that the explosive growth of AI applications is going to create a huge bubble that will be impossible to ignore. He suggests that investing in semiconductor companies such as Nvidia is the best way for individuals to take advantage of this trend, as these companies provide the necessary processing power for AI systems.Microsoft and Google are currently the easiest ways for investors to gain exposure to AI. These companies have massive networks that will undoubtedly benefit from the growth of AI applications. Furthermore, both companies are pivoting their business models to incorporate AI, which will likely result in further growth and profitability.Pal also highlights the fact that AI is still in its early stages, and there are likely to be many more opportunities for investors to profit from this technology in the future. He notes that other major players such as Apple and Amazon are also developing their own AI technologies, and the Chinese have their own AI systems.However, Pal points out that the most significant game-changer in the AI industry is Stability AI. This open-source AI platform is available to everyone and is not restricted by any corporate interests or regulations. Pal suggests that this technology could be difficult to control and could lead to unforeseen consequences as it develops.Finally, Pal warns of the potential dangers of AI-generated fake content. With the development of chat, text-to-audio, and text-to-video AI technologies, the creation of fake content at an unprecedented scale is now possible. This poses a significant risk to society, and regulators will need to address this issue as AI technology continues to advance.Story continuesIn conclusion, while the growth of AI applications presents many opportunities for investors and businesses alike, there are also risks and challenges that need to be addressed. It is important for investors to stay informed and cautious as they navigate the rapidly changing AI landscape.Video Transcript- Look, I think it's fascinating. And it's fascinating because of Stability AI. So the AI is basically held with two giant corporations, Microsoft and Google. Now we know Apple is developing their own, not released yet beyond Siri. And I'm sure Amazon are in the race. And there will probably be others. The Chinese obviously have. So these guys, even if it's called Open AI, it's not open. They're heavily restricting.If you listen to Sam Altman, it was a shocking speech he gave when this started rolling out. He's like, you could see his face of fear, which is like the technology that we have we can't roll out. Society is not ready for the speed at which we could release this technology. So we are purposely going slow and cautiously.I spoke to the Google team yesterday-- same story. It's like you have no understanding what we have, and we can't really expose it to the world. And there's a lot of societal and terrifying things that they taught me through some of the scenarios that they're concerned over. Meanwhile, Stability AI is open source. Everybody's got it. Now regulators have taken 10 years and they can't even regulate crypto. How on Earth are they going to deal with this?So Stability AI is the game changer because there's somebody who can't be held back, and they're global. So that means that anybody can innovate there. So it's going to be very difficult. It's very difficult to keep the genie in the bottle. And it may come faster than we can even deal with.]"

The CHIPS Act promises to distribute $50 billion for semiconductor manufacturing and research, which businesses are now able to apply for through the Commerce Department.Proponents say boosting U.S. chipmaking will wean companies away from fragile supply chains, trade disputes, and even foreign government policy.“It’s untenable to be dependent on technology that’s beholden to Chinese government policy,” Adam Bry, co-founder and CEO of Skydio, told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). Bry noted that Skydio, which designs and assembles drones in the U.S., relies on suppliers like Nvidia (NVDA) and Qualcomm (QCOM) for chips.“Both of those are directly impacted and benefiting from the CHIPS Act,” he added.U.S. military personnel operating Skydio drones, which rely on semiconductors. (Photo: Skydio)How chip supply chains affect ‘U.S. underdog’ companiesDrone manufacturing was hit hard by supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.Skydio was unable to sell its “Beacon GPS” remote control in 2020, according to reports from industry publication DRONELIFE, as the disruptions highlighted U.S. dependence on foreign chip suppliers for a wide range of products.“The best semiconductors in the world right now are made in Taiwan, very close to China, supply chain on the other side of an ocean,” Senator Mark Kelly (D-AZ), an early proponent of the CHIPS legislation, said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. “We rely on these chips for pretty much everything — anything that has an on-off switch, but more importantly than that, sophisticated weapons and weapons systems.”This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.While the CHIPS Act is ultimately a protectionist policy similar to those enacted by Asian countries to help boost homegrown businesses, experts say the security and geopolitical concerns outweigh the impact it will have on free trade.Story continues“Building drones in the U.S. for the customers that we’re serving is critical for data security, cybersecurity, and national security,” Bry said. “It’s kind of come on-trend, but it’s something we’ve actually been doing for a very long time.”The CHIPS Act is just one of several policy initiatives put in place by the U.S. government aimed at hobbling foreign semiconductor manufacturing, particularly in China. For instance, the U.S., Japan, and the Netherlands recently agreed to comply with export restrictions of chipmaking tools to China, Reuters reported.These policies have benefitted Skydio, which makes drones designed for military use and supplies units to the U.S. Army and other parts of the Department of Defense.For instance, Skydio's biggest competitor, Shenzhen-based drone manufacturer DJI, is currently sanctioned by the Treasury Department over its ties to China's military and is unable to sell its products to local, state, and federal governments in the U.S.“We have the great joy of being the U.S. underdog, which doesn’t always happen,” Bry explained. “We’re the leading U.S. company, but we’re still small relative to DJI.”Skydio has been carving out other advantages against players like DJI, the CEO added. The drone maker is focused on enhancing self-flying and autonomous capabilities – all of which rely on semiconductors.“The market as it's defined today is predominantly manually flown,” Bry said. “We think the future is AI, autonomy, drones become basic infrastructure, and that's what we're most focused on.”Click here for the latest technology business news, reviews, and useful articles on tech and gadgetsRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

According to Reuters, the European Union’s European Commission will likely approve the blockbuster deal after Microsoft made concessions to both Nvidia (NVDA) and Nintendo (NTDOY).In February, Microsoft announced it reached agreements with Nintendo and Nvidia to bring its games, including the wildly popular “Call of Duty” to the competitors’ platforms for the next 10 years.For Nintendo that means Activision Blizzard games like “Call of Duty” will be available on its Switch and future consoles. Nvidia, meanwhile, will be able to offer “Call of Duty” and other Activision Blizzard titles via its Nvidia Geforce Now cloud gaming platform. Nvidia opposed the acquisition until the last-minute deal with Microsoft.Sony (SONY) is still fighting the deal, which is opposed by the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. and under review by the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority.The crux of the deal is “Call of Duty,” one of the most popular game franchises in the world. The most recent edition of the series, “Call of Duty Modern Warfare II,” reached $1 billion in sales in its first 10 days on the market.Microsoft President Brad Smith addresses a media conference regarding Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard and the future of gaming in Brussels, Tuesday, Feb. 21, 2023. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo)Sony contends that Microsoft plans to make Activision Blizzard’s titles Microsoft exclusives, in an attempt to get PlayStation users to switch to Microsoft’s Xbox platform. Even if Microsoft enters a 10-year sharing agreement with Sony, the gaming giant fears Microsoft will just pull its games back after the arrangement expires.After Microsoft acquired Zenimax, the parent company of “Fallout” and “The Elder Scrolls” developer Bethesda in 2021, the company announced that Bethesda’s first new franchise in more than 20 years, “Starfield” will be an Xbox and PC exclusive.Given the massive popularity of “Fallout” and “The Elder Scrolls,” it’s little wonder why Sony is more than wary of Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard acquisition.Story continuesIf Microsoft manages to get past both the FTC and CMA, it will add Activision Blizzard’s arsenal of games to not only its Xbox console and PC lineup, but its Xbox Game Pass cloud gaming platform.Cloud gaming, which allows you to stream and play games to everything from your smartphone and smart TV to your tablet and Chromebook, is still in its early stages. But with its enormous cloud computing capabilities, Microsoft has an edge over the likes of Sony, Nvidia, Nintendo, and Amazon (AMZN), which operates its own Luna cloud gaming service.Microsoft also has the financial muscle to undercut competitors on pricing by subsidizing its cloud gaming service via the cash it brings in through its business products.The company still has to get past major roadblocks, and even the E.U.’s approval still isn’t guaranteed. But if it does break through, it could upend the gaming industry for years to come.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's tech newsletter.More from DanMeta can’t keep people interested in its headsets: ReportThe U.S. needs more than the CHIPS Act to stay ahead of China: MIT reportMicrosoft is bringing ChatGPT-powered Bing to Windows 11 in latest updateNvidia is tying its future to AI at just the right timeGot a tip?

PH, The Interpublic Group of Companies IPG, Microchip Technology Inc. MCHP and McKesson Corp. MCK.5 Smart Beta Dividend Stocks to Buy Now for Steady GainsThe prospect of higher interest rates for longer than anticipated and rising bond yields have diminished the appeal for dividend stocks. Yet, applying some smart beta strategies to the dividend investing world could fetch higher returns.This is because the strategy helps to capture market inefficiencies in a transparent way by adding extra metrics like volatility, revenues, earnings, momentum and other fundamental factors to the market cap or rules-based indices. And nothing seems better than picking the dividend growth strategy.We have selected five dividend growth stocks — The Hershey Company, ParkerHannifin Corp., The Interpublic Group of Companies, Microchip Technology Inc. and McKesson Corp. — that could be solid choices for your portfolio.Why Dividend Growth Strategy?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.Story continuesHere are five of the 24 stocks that fit the bill:Pennsylvania-based Hershey is the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America as well as a global leader in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $4.47.Our TakeVeeva Systems exited the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 with better-than-expected results. The uptick in the overall top and bottom lines, and robust performances by both segments during the quarter are impressive. The company continues to benefit from its flagship Vault platform, which is encouraging. Veeva Systems’ continued strength in its Commercial Solutions, with new SMB customer additions, looks promising.Veeva Systems registered great traction in newer areas, including Veeva Vault Safety, Veeva Link and Veeva Compass, which augurs well. The strength in Clinical operations, which grew to more than 470 Vault eTMF and 180 CTMS customers, is also driving the momentum in new areas, including Veeva Site Connect and Study Training, raising our optimism.On the flip side, rising operating costs putting pressure on the margins during the quarter is a headwind. Per management, the advertising environment remains tough, causing slowing down of growth in the near term, which raises apprehension.Zacks Rank and Key PicksVeeva Systems currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX, popularly known as BD, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc.

As a percentage of revenues, the gross margin of 21.4% expanded approximately 32 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis.Operating expenses in the reported quarter amounted to $267 million, down 3.2% from the prior-year quarter.The company reported an operating income of $75.9 million, up 24.8% from the year-ago quarter.Financial PositionThe company exited the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $147.3 million, compared with $140.3 million on a sequential basis.Cumulative net cash used in operating activities at the end of the quarter was $728.2 million compared with the year-ago period’s $834.1 million.Fiscal 2023 Earnings OutlookPatterson Companies updated its earnings outlook for fiscal 2023. The company projects adjusted EPS in the $2.25-$2.30 range, compared with the prior $2.25-$2.35 range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $2.28 per share.Our TakePatterson Companies ended third-quarter fiscal 2023 on a mixed note, wherein earnings beat the consensus mark but revenues missed the same. The company’s Dental segment reflected improvements while the Animal Health segment showed continuous decline in the quarter under review. Sales of both the segments were hurt by unfavorable currency movement. A prudent cost-savings approach and solid sales execution worked in favor of the stock, expanding gross margin. Sustained momentum in the Animal Health business bodes well.A broad spectrum of products cushions the company against economic downturns in the MedTech space. We believe that a diverse product portfolio, strong veterinary business prospects, accretive acquisitions and strategic partnerships are the key catalysts.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderPatterson Companies currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some other stocks in the medical space that have announced quarterly results are AmerisourceBergen ABC, McKesson Corporation MCK and Hologic, Inc.

283,178e1131-46e4-3267-b27a-c0bb4000693b,MCK,2023-03-03,5 Smart Beta Dividend Stocks to Buy Now for Steady Gains,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-smart-beta-dividend-stocks-122012022.html,1677759612,STORY,"['IPG', 'MCHP', 'HSY', 'MCK']","[The prospect of higher interest rates for longer than anticipated and rising bond yields have diminished the appeal for dividend stocks. Yet, applying some smart beta strategies to the dividend investing world could fetch higher returns.This is because the strategy helps to capture market inefficiencies in a transparent way by adding extra metrics like volatility, revenues, earnings, momentum and other fundamental factors to the market cap or rules-based indices. And nothing seems better than picking the dividend growth strategy.We have selected five dividend growth stocks — The Hershey Company HSY, ParkerHannifin Corporation PH, The Interpublic Group of Companies IPG, Microchip Technology Incorporated MCHP, and McKesson Corporation MCK — that could be solid choices for your portfolio.Why Dividend Growth Strategy?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3-5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&amp;P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&amp;P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 24.Here are five of the 24 stocks that fit the bill:Pennsylvania-based Hershey is the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America as well as a global leader in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery. The company saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 42 cents over the past 30 days for this year, with estimated growth of 10.2%.At present, HSY has a Zacks Rank #1 and Growth Score of B. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Ohio-based ParkerHannifin is a global diversified manufacturer of motion &amp; control technologies and systems. It provides precision-engineered solutions for a wide variety of mobile, industrial and aerospace markets. The stock saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 44 cents over the past 30 days for the fiscal year (ending June 2023) and has an estimated earnings growth rate of 4.5%.ParkerHannifin has a Zacks Rank #2 and Growth Score of B.New York-based Interpublic Group of Companies provides advertising and marketing services worldwide. The company specializes in consumer advertising, digital marketing, public relations, communications planning and media buying, and specialized communications disciplines. Interpublic Group of Companies saw a solid positive estimate revision of 7 cents over the past 30 days for this year, with an estimated growth rate of 0.7%.Interpublic Group of Companies has a Zacks Rank #1 and Growth Score of B.Arizona-based Microchip Technology is engaged in developing and manufacturing of microcontrollers, memory and analog and interface products for embedded control systems, which are small, low-power computers designed to perform specific tasks. The company has seen a positive earnings estimate revision of 7 cents for the fiscal year (ending March 2023) over the past month and has an expected earnings growth rate of 29.9%.Microchip Technology has a Zacks Rank #2 and Growth Score of A.California-based McKesson is a healthcare services and information technology company. The stock has seen a robust earnings estimate revision of $1.15 over the past 30 days for the fiscal year (ending March 2023) and has an expected earnings growth rate of 9.5%.McKesson has a Zacks Rank #2 and Growth Score of B.You can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

288,080452ff-ad98-3907-9178-6ac8ac0a46fe,CMI,2023-03-03,7 Rock-Solid Dividend Stocks to Buy as the Market Slows,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-rock-solid-dividend-stocks-232855864.html,1677540535,STORY,"['HII', 'ADM', 'CVS', 'CMI', 'CSCO', 'BG', 'R']","[It’s time for investors to consider rock-solid dividend stocks to buy. Generally speaking, passive-income-providing companies enjoy relatively stable businesses. And stability and dependability will become core attributes heading into an ambiguous market cycle.Dominating business headlines recently stand inflation concerns. As InvestorPlace contributor Dana Blankenhorn mentioned, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index came in higher than economists anticipated. Therefore, fears spiked that the Federal Reserve may take this data as confirmation for greater monetary tightening. Because of the volatile implications of such a move, dividend stocks to buy became much more interesting.To better the odds in your favor, every one of these entities features a low payout ratio. Most sit below 30%. All sit below 40%. But investors can’t live off dividends alone. Each of these companies also features upside capital returns potential based on analysts’ price targets. With that, below are the dividend stocks to buy as the market slows.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRRyder System$97.55CMICummins$243.20HIIHuntington Ingalls$217.38CSCOCisco$48.73BGBunge$97.19ADMArcher Daniels Midland$81.19CVSCVS Health$84.84Ryder System (R)A photo of a paper with a chart and the word ""Dividends"" written on it, with a pen and calculator resting on top of it.Source: jittawit21/Shutterstock.comA transportation and logistics firm, Ryder Systems (NYSE:R) specializes in fleet management, supply chain management, and transportation management. Although it might seem like a risky enterprise, R stock delivered big time in the charts. Over the trailing year, shares gained over 24% in equity value. And since the January opener, R soared nearly 17%. Regarding its passive income potential, Ryder features a forward yield of 2.57%. This ranks a bit higher than the industrial sector’s average yield of 2.36%. Also, the company commands 17 years of consecutive dividend increases, a status it won’t want to give up. Finally, its payout ratio sits at 21.31%, suggesting a dependable and sustainable yield.Story continuesTurning to Wall Street, covering analysts peg R stock as a consensus moderate buy. Further, their average price target stands at $100.56, implying over 4% upside potential. While it’s not the most exciting enterprise, it makes for a trustworthy name among dividend stocks to buy.Cummins (CMI)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large textSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comA multinational corporation, Cummins (NYSE:CMI) designs, manufactures, and distributes engines, filtration, and power generation products. Further, the enterprise also services engines and related equipment, including fuel systems, controls, air handling, filtration, emission control, electrical power generation systems, and trucks. It’s a quiet but extremely relevant performer. Over the trailing year, CMI gained a very impressive 20% of equity value.Looking at its passive income, Cummins carries a forward yield of 2.57%. Again, this ranks a bit higher than the industrial sector’s average yield of 2.36%. Right now, the company’s sitting on an enviable track record of 17 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. So close to becoming a Dividend Aristocrat, management will do whatever it takes to keep this trend going. Also, Cummins features a payout ratio of 32.59%. At the moment, covering analysts peg CMI as a consensus hold. However, their average price target pings at $258.13, implying nearly 6% upside potential. Therefore, it’s one of the steady partners among dividend stocks to buy.Huntington Ingalls (HII)A hand reaches out of a mailbox holding a wad of cash.Source: ShutterstockA defense contractor, Huntington Ingalls (NYSE:HII) is the largest military shipbuilding company in the U.S. Further, its public profile states that Huntington provides professional services to partners in government and industry. Geopolitically, HII has become one of the most relevant dividend stocks to buy. With tensions rising in the Far East, Huntington’s naval warship-building capacity will likely be put to the test. Naturally, this will suit HII stakeholders just fine.Heading over to the passive income component, Huntington carries a forward yield of 2.25%. To be fair, that’s a bit lower than the industrial sector’s average 2.36% yield. However, the company makes up for this with a low payout ratio of just under 30%. In addition, the defense contractor commands 11 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. Also, it’s worth noting that HII ranks among the undervalued dividend stocks to buy. Currently, the market prices HII at a forward multiple of 15.49. As a discount to earnings, Huntington ranks better than 76.67% of the competition. Finally, analysts peg HII as a consensus hold. However, their price target implies upside potential of over 8%.Cisco (CSCO)The word ""dividend"" highlighted in a dictionary.Source: ShutterstockA digital communications technology firm, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) develops, manufactures, and sells networking hardware, software, telecommunications equipment, and other high-technology services and products. Further, it specializes in specific tech segments, such as the Internet of Things and domain security. Admittedly, though, CSCO ranks among the riskier dividend stocks to buy. In the trailing year, shares stumbled over 13%.That said, contract investors will certainly be attracted by the company’s forward yield of 3.22%. In sharp contrast, the tech sector’s average yield sits at 1.37%. Further, the communications enterprise enjoys 13 years of consecutive dividend increases. Relatively speaking, its payout ratio of 38.69% stands higher than other dividend stocks to buy on this list. Nevertheless, against the bigger picture, it’s a reliable yield.Also, like Huntington Ingalls above, Cisco offers a discount. Presently, the market prices CSCO at a forward multiple of 12.91. As a discount to earnings, Cisco ranks better than 63.93% of its peers. Lastly, covering analysts peg CSCO as a consensus moderate buy. Also, their average price target stands at $56.88, implying over 17% upside potential.Bunge (BG)dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, Bunge (NYSE:BG) is an agribusiness and food company. As a result, it features organic relevance and pertinence. No matter how advanced society becomes, people need a minimum amount of calories to survive. Further, when you’re dealing with dividend stocks to buy due to market slowdown risks, it pays to be cynical.Turning to its passive income, Bunge carries a forward yield of 2.55%. Notably, this stat ranks higher than the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. As well, the company’s payout ratio sits at 22.10, which is practically subterranean. However, unlike some of the other dividend stocks to buy, Bunge only carries two consecutive years of dividend increases. Still, it’s an attractive proposition overall. In particular, the market prices BG at a forward multiple of 8.3. As a discount to earnings, Bunge ranks better than nearly 86% of the field. Turning to the Street, covering analysts peg BG as a consensus strong buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $123, implying upside potential of over 25%.Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)image of hands holding small money bag symbolizing dividend stocksSource: ShutterstockWith Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) and rival Bunge above, these ideas represent names I’ve discussed frequently in the past weeks. While I try not to dip into the same well too many times, when discussing dividend stocks to buy, it’s unavoidable. Fundamentally, we’re talking about pertinent and basically indelible enterprises. And with all the wildness that occurred in the world over the past three years, ADM’s poised for greater relevance.Looking at the passive income segment, Archer Daniels features a forward yield of 2.21%. To be fair, it’s not the greatest yield, just beating out the consumer staple sector’s average yield. However, it also commands 51 years of consecutive annual dividend increases. We’re not just talking about a Dividend Aristocrat – it’s a Dividend King. Also, ADM benefits from a low payout ratio of 26.75%.Just like its rival, Archer enjoys a discounted profile. Currently, the market prices ADM at a forward multiple of 12.03. As a discount to earnings, Archer ranks better than 68.89% of the competition. Finally, covering analysts peg ADM as a consensus strong buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $104.20, implying 28% upside potential.CVS Health (CVS)Glass jar of coins marked ""dividends"" to represent dividend stocks. stocks with dividendsSource: ShutterstockA healthcare giant, CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) owns its namesake retail pharmacy and pharmacy benefits manager. In addition, the company bought out Aetna, which represents a health insurance provider. Although enjoying a relevant narrative, CVS just hasn’t panned out so well in the charts. In the trailing year, shares tumbled nearly 18%. Since the Jan. opener, they’re down almost 8%.Nevertheless, for those that want to take a little bit of risk for greater rewards, CVS ranks among the dividend stocks to buy. First, the company carries a forward yield of 2.82%. In contrast, the healthcare sector’s average yield sits at 1.58%. Further, CVS’ payout ratio is only 26.31%, making it a sustainable yield. For full disclosure, the company only has one year of dividend increases.However, contrarians will likely eyeball CVS because of its bargain profile. Right now, the market prices CVS at a forward multiple of 9.76. As a discount to earnings, the company ranks better than 77.78% of the competition. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg CVS as a consensus strong buy. Further, their average price target stands at $113.82, implying nearly 33% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

289,23ae9d16-8c0b-4580-b486-b8381ca7bad0,DIS,2023-03-03,Disney could sell its 67% stake in Hulu to buy up more Marvel rights: Citi,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-could-sell-its-67-stake-in-hulu-to-buy-up-more-marvel-rights-citi-123021962.html,1677846621,STORY,['DIS'],"[Disney (DIS) might let go of Hulu in favor of the Hulk, at least according to one media analyst.""We believe Disney may sell its 67% stake in Hulu,"" Citi analyst Jason Bazinet wrote in a new note to clients on Wednesday. ""In parallel, we suspect Disney may secure the distribution rights to two Marvel characters held by Comcast (Hulk and Namor).""Although Disney owns all of the Marvel intellectual property, Comcast's Universal (CMCSA) maintains the distribution rights to those two characters; consequently, the studio would be able to distribute any Hulk or Namor-centric films to its various NBCU media platforms, like Peacock.""While the cost of securing these rights is likely small relative to the value of Hulu (we estimate the value at only $0.3 billion), it would fit with Mr. Iger’s desire to focus on core brands and franchises,"" the analyst said.Bazinet, who previously thought Disney would either raise Hulu's subscription prices or combine the streamer with Disney+, now believes ""the company is less interested in a mass market DTC offering"" after CEO Bob Iger told investors the company will focus more on its core franchises and ""aggressively curate our general entertainment content.""""This raises the possibility that Disney may sell its Hulu stake,"" Bazinet surmised.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Disney currently owns two-thirds of Hulu with Comcast’s Universal (CMCSA) controlling the rest.Under the terms of the joint ownership agreement, Comcast could require Disney to buy out its stake in Hulu as early as January 2024 at a guaranteed minimum equity value of $27.5 billion (or about $9.2 billion for the 33% stake.)Bazinet estimated Hulu's price tag could be valued anywhere from $19.8 billion to $27.5 billion.""Based on Hulu’s level of profitability, the sale price and Disney’s use of proceeds, we see a wide range of outcomes from ~$3 downside to ~$13 of upside per Disney share,"" the analyst said, adding: ""For Comcast, we see a balanced risk-reward of $2-3 per share in each direction, while the strategic and financial merits supports a positive move for the equity, in our view.""Story continuesDisney shares have climbed more than 10% since the start of the year, and are up nearly 8% since Bob Iger's surprise return to the company in November of last year.The Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger attends the Nominees Luncheon for the 95th Oscars in Beverly Hills, California, U.S. February 13, 2023. REUTERS/Mario AnzuoniDuring Disney's latest earnings call, Iger doubled-down on the view streaming was his ""top priority"" for the company, but told CNBC ""everything was on the table"" in regards to Hulu’s future.""I’ve talked about general entertainment being undifferentiated. I'm not going to speculate if we're a buyer or a seller of it,"" Iger said. ""But I'm concerned about undifferentiated general entertainment. We're going to look at it very objectively.""Hulu boasts around 48 million subscribers and hosts top-rated shows including ""Only Murders in the Building,"" ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" and ""The Dropout."" Hulu's subscribers grew by 2% in Disney's latest quarter.At the time of the original arrangement between Comcast and Disney, Iger maintained the purchase would allow Disney the opportunity to offer an alternative, more mature viewing experience to consumers, in addition to providing more flexibility with bundling.Flash forward to today and streaming economics are vastly different as investors focus on profitability amid increased competition.Disney's direct-to-consumer division reported a $1.1 billion loss in its fiscal first quarter — an improvement compared to the $1.5 billion loss seen in Q4, but still a significant drag on profits.Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Media Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Both artists later removed the ableist slur after her tweets went viral and recorded the songs again.Cerebral palsy affects a person's ability to move and maintain posture, affecting around 0.1% of Australia's near 26 million population. The most common type is spastic diplegia, which Diviney is diagnosed with.""'Spaz' has been popularised as a sort of slur or cultural shorthand to mean like someone losing control or being unintelligent or having no control of their emotions ... it was definitely a word that kids use in the playground, sometimes at me, sometimes around me,"" she said.(Reporting by Cordelia Hsu; Writing by Renju Jose; Editing by Stephen Coates)]"

Ron DeSantis’ stance against Disney could be a roadmap for presidential run,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/florida-gov-ron-desantis-stance-220408486.html,1677794645,VIDEO,['DIS'],"[Yahoo Finance political columnist Rick Newman joins the Live show to discuss the relationship between Disney and Florida's governor.Video TranscriptDAVE BRIGGS: Florida Governor Ron DeSantis's beef with Disney could cause a financial storm for the Sunshine State, but it may be the first shot in a potential war against what he calls woke capitalism. For more, we're joined by culture warrior Yahoo Finance senior columnist Rick Newman. What do you make of this battle with the house mouse? I thought he was going to let it go. Clearly not the case.RICK NEWMAN: No, no, no. So, I mean, this is kind of last year's story, but what has happened recently is a couple of things. First, the state of Florida has taken over that municipal district from Disney, and it's now a five-person board of directors that Disney has to answer to. Those are mostly DeSantis allies. But from my perspective, this matters because DeSantis is clearly teeing up a '24 presidential run. His book just came out. He wrote-- I bought the book, and he's got one chapter in there on the whole Disney saga. You know, here's how I took on woke America-- woke corporate America. The Wall Street Journal ran an excerpt from that chapter.So this is-- what happened with Disney and Florida is kind of like his template for how he wants to take on corporate America in this whole thing he calls woke capitalism. Hard to define what woke capitalism is. I think DeSantis himself has struggled to do that.DAVE BRIGGS: Everyone has.RICK NEWMAN: Yeah. I mean, suffice to say, it's liberal ideas filtering into corporate decision-making. But I think he's misreading what's going on in corporate America and where this pressure is coming from in the first place. So in his book and in the Journal article, he characterized this as a small group of-- and he uses the adjectives-- ""loud and militant liberals,"" as if it's this small cabal of liberals that's just strong arming Disney into taking these positions.Story continuesAnd it's not. It's cultural points of view, cultural attitudes that have changed a lot over time. It relates to LGBT issues, where there clearly is much more tolerance than there used to be. And even a majority of Americans, in some way, say let's normalize LGBTQ issues. That is one of the things DeSantis is kind of pushing back against. This gets into so-called ESG investing, environmentally friendly companies. That is somewhat fraught, but if you just go to the fundamental issue, majorities of Americans want more action on global warming, especially young people. And guess who companies obsess over? 18 to 35-year-olds--DAVE BRIGGS: They don't vote.RICK NEWMAN: Well, they did. And that's-- so they do vote eventually. Number one, they vote eventually.DAVE BRIGGS: Sure.RICK NEWMAN: And if they do get energized to vote, they can make a momentous difference. I mean--DAVE BRIGGS: The Republican base is older voters. You say DeSantis is misreading corporate America. My question is, do you think he cares, or does he care what resonates with the Republican base?RICK NEWMAN: I think it's both. So that's what I think everyone's trying to suss out at this point. So you're right. This idea of woke capitalism, because it has these cultural touchstones-- don't shove liberal culture down our throats-- so that does, I think, resonate with the-- I think you call it the MAGA base, the Trump groups. It does not necessarily resonate with what you might call traditional business oriented Republicans.In fact, some of them have said, let's leave companies alone. Fine to go after the culture issues, but don't punish-- Ken Griffin, the billionaire founder of Citadel, has said, I support Ron DeSantis. I wish he'd leave Disney alone. In other words, keep the businesses out of it. So let's say it works, and he can win a primary among Republicans. Does that then translate into, can you get traction on this with swing voters? There's absolutely no evidence that swing voters will take up this issue. And in fact, a lot of voters have no idea what this is even about.DAVE BRIGGS: Nor do they really care--RICK NEWMAN: They don't really care.DAVE BRIGGS: --I think the vast majority of them.RICK NEWMAN: They might care about some particular issue, but they don't even recognize this umbrella phrase of wokeness or wokeism or woke capitalism as a thing.DAVE BRIGGS: What about the impact on the all-important donors? Because corporations are the Republican Party's biggest donors. If you're taking on corporate America, how are you going to raise-- and you're going to need hundreds of millions of dollars--RICK NEWMAN: They are not--DAVE BRIGGS: --to run for president.RICK NEWMAN: They are not as important to Republicans as they used to be or as many people think they are. And this has to do with all the shifts we've seen in politics during the last 10 to 20 years. One big one is the ability to raise political funds on the internet through small donor donations.And guess what? Republicans have gotten very good at using the outrage factor to get millions and millions of dollars in donations. Trump has excelled at this, and he has continued to be a fundraising juggernaut, even as he's under investigation everywhere. He fomented the January 6 riots. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the bomb thrower from South Carolina, she raises tons of money. And these are extreme politicians.DAVE BRIGGS: And those are not corporate dollars.RICK NEWMAN: And they are not corporations supporting those people. So they don't need big business as much as they used to.DAVE BRIGGS: Prediction-- DeSantis is going to be taking on Hershey any minute now. I don't know if you've seen that whole story, but this is right up--RICK NEWMAN: I guess that's my next column.DAVE BRIGGS: It might be ripe for the next Rick Newman column. Good to see you, sir. Thank you.RICK NEWMAN: Thanks, Dave.]"

That's my triple play today. Rough transition there, Disney. Citi analyst Jason Bazinet out with a new note suggesting Disney may want to sell its stake in Hulu after Bob Iger said the company is less focused on general entertainment content.Bazinet did suggest that Disney could leverage the sale to secure the rights of two Marvel characters, Hulk and Namor, which are currently controlled by Comcast. The analyst said Hulu's price tag could range anywhere from $19.8 billion to $27.5 billion.Comcast currently owns a 33% stake in Hulu, with Disney controlling the rest. So, guys, I'm curious what you make of this. Bazinet does have a buy rating on Disney, and he did suggest that this could maybe be a win-win for both companies.DAVE BRIGGS: I think so. And Brian Roberts said back in September, if, in fact, they are for sale, he does want to buy out the remaining portion. He called it a phenomenal asset. My only caution with this strategy of Iger is, look what happened with ""Ant-Man"" last weekend.It made $32 million, it was number one. It was the largest decline in week two in Marvel history. And the question is, are we getting sick and tired of Marvel characters? I don't know if the film is great, I didn't see it. But a 70% drop-off in one week tells you maybe there is a point at which those franchises don't sell so well after the first week.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, and I also think that another concern here for Disney, if, in fact, they do decide to sell their stake in Hulu, is some of the caution out there on the street that maybe they could actually see a reduction in subscribers because of that bundle package that they do have right now with Hulu, ESPN+ and Disney+.They no longer have Hulu, maybe some people then will also cut Disney+ and ESPN+ just because they simply don't see the value of those as standalones given the prices that we are seeing, and how much people are paying really across the board in subscriptions now.]"

He looks at my plate and tells me it's a good thing the desserts weren't made to his specifications. If it had been up to him, my pie would be filled with mini metal keys.That's because Jacques is a robot. Or, rather, an actor playing a robot in a costume made of random clamps, clasps and metal hands, with leather overalls in various shades of cocoa and a bowler cap. His voice, filtered through an unseen distortion device, sounds a little tinny. If the innards of a vintage timepiece had been blown up, fashioned into human form and given a workman's coating, it'd probably look something like Jacques. Ask to take his picture, and he'll likely apologize for blinking, though he has no pupils or eyelids. His eyes are constructed out of metal cups.When he's not making the rounds from table to table, often with his female pal Penelope, the purported proprietor of Toothsome, Jacques is seen on screens — meant to be windows — in the back of the restaurant, hovering over the action amid oversized gears and tubes.One's tolerance for being interrupted by a fake robot while dining out is likely dependent on a few factors. The presence of children in the party likely helps, as does one's feelings about formative trips to theme parks. But prime weekend reservations tend to fill quickly at Toothsome, the new steampunk-themed restaurant in CityWalk at Universal Studios Hollywood. Is it an indication that there’s a dearth of family-friendly theatricality around the dinner table? Or a sign that the themed restaurant, which enjoyed an era of expansion throughout the 1980s and ’90s with the Hard Rock Cafe, Planet Hollywood and many more, is ready for a proper comeback?Well, that depends how one defines a themed restaurant.""A themed restaurant would be an artifice of another place brought artificially to life,"" says Craig Hanna, chief creative officer of themed entertainment firm the Thinkwell Group, which has worked with clients across the entertainment business. ""This goes all the way back to when immigrants started coming to the United States and were trying to relive the place they left behind. You could go back further.""Story continuesHanna does, discussing the World's Fairs of the 1890s and their European-inspired façades and interiors. Even earlier, at the start of the 12th century, China had restaurants with singing waiters. And, of course, there was the theatrical restaurant culture of Paris in the 18th and 19th centuries.Eddie Sotto, formerly of Walt Disney Imagineering, the company's arm devoted to theme park experiences, and a designer who worked on numerous L.A. restaurants including John Sedlar's shuttered but acclaimed Rivera, takes us to the Parisian countryside in the mid to late 1880s, where there were treehouse-themed restaurants inspired by the novel ""Robinson Crusoe.""""I have an engraving in my home, from the magazine L'Illustration, of people having Champagne cocktails in this Robinson family treehouse,"" Sotto says. ""In places like Paris, they would have themed events in the catacombs and people would dine there. Theater and dining go back a long way together.""Southern California has its own storied history when it comes to themed establishments.There’s our penchant for food-shaped eateries, of course — see our giant doughnuts or the return of Tail o’ the Pup — but dinner with a side of story is a Los Angeles-area staple that predates any corporate chains such as Rainforest Cafe or Chuck E. Cheese. Imagine, for instance, a night out in the Roaring ‘20s. Forget Gatsby-inspired elegance. How about being led by staff in prison garb to a table inside what’s designed to be a makeshift lockup? Such was the conceit of Sunset Boulevard's Jail Cafe. In downtown L.A., one could order a steak in a restaurant outfitted with cow stalls at Ye Bull Pen Inn, and from the midcentury to today our region has long had a love affair with tropical, Polynesian-inspired culture.Then the 1980s and ’90s gave birth to a themed restaurant renaissance, when even Steven Spielberg got into the action with the submarine-focused DIVE! in Century City.""It's a really nuanced subject,"" says designer Phil Hettema of the themed restaurant conversation. Hettema runs a namesake themed-entertainment firm in Pasadena and contributed to the creation of DIVE!. ""I think a themed restaurant is where the experience is of equal or greater value to the dining experience. That's a tricky balance. DIVE! was one of my favorite experiences to work on, and the owners gave us carte blanche to do whatever we wanted to do.""Toothsome is an import — a version is open at Universal's version of CityWalk in Orlando — but it's just weird enough to feel a part of SoCal's themed-restaurant lineage with an elaborate, borderline melancholic backstory.Professor Dr. Penelope Tibeaux-Tinker Toothsome has been traveling the world in a Zeppelin with Jacques, her robot companion. But upon returning home, she finds her family missing. Mom and Dad, apparently longing for their daughter, have set off to reunite with her. Penelope begins opening chocolate-themed restaurants — a hearty, gooey chocolate bread is available as an appetizer, and an Old-Fashioned comes with candied chocolate pieces — in the hopes that someday they will stumble in.But fear not, the atmosphere — a domed mural of flying blimps and hot air balloons graces the ceiling — is not one of a search party.""Having character development as part of the story is important because it helps engage the guest further emotionally into the space,"" says Su-Fei Sakamoto, a senior designer with Universal Creative. ""If it were just a generic steampunk decorated restaurant theme, anyone can do that.""A themed restaurant, then, is the difference between interior design and narrative design.***DIVE! was a submarine-themed restaurant at the Century City mall. (Luis Sinco / For The Times)""Prepare to dive."" One could hear such an advisement hourly at ""DIVE!,"" the restaurant Spielberg opened and conceptualized with fellow Hollywood player Jeffrey Katzenberg. An exaggerated yellow submarine heralded its presence at the Century City mall, and inside one could find a periscope looking outward onto Santa Monica Boulevard, barstools fashioned out of makeshift torpedoes and video displays that could conjure a submarine dive or the depths of the ocean.It was a restaurant-meets-theme-park experience that signaled the height of the ’90s themed-restaurant movement in Southern California. DIVE!, which opened in 1994, and its upscale submarine sandwiches lasted about five years, with some wondering if its menu was too casual or if local residents had their fill after one visit, not needing to be subjected to a red-alert-like warning multiple times during dinner.""A lot of times, outside of a theme park, experiential ideas kind of have a lifespan,"" Hettema says. ""They may tap into the zeitgeist at a particular moment, and it's a thing everybody does, but a year later it's kind of old news.""""Humans,"" adds Brent Bushnell, who oversees downtown's Big Top-themed Two Bit Circus, a game-focused restaurant and bar, ""really like novelty in their entertainment."" Bushnell grew up in themed and fantasy environments, the son of Atari and Chuck E. Cheese mastermind Nolan Bushnell. ""You don't go back and see the same movie, generally. You see a different movie. You can change the bits. You didn't have to change the atoms. Atoms are hard. People will love the novelty of DIVE! the first time. The decor will get them there, but does it get them back the second, third or fourth?""There's another hurdle. ""The old joke is people don't expect the food to be any good in an immersive environment,"" Sotto says. ""'They're not coming for that. They're coming for the artifacts on the wall.' Well, I don't believe in that. I believe it all should be good.""When it comes to our area's earliest themed restaurants, they were praised mightily, at least in this paper. The Jail Cafe's first location in Silver Lake — now home to El Cid — had a stone façade with a guard's watchtower, complete with a guard, out front. This paper in 1928 declared it ""one of the finest eating houses in the city,"" noting that though it was designed to mimic a prison, it had ""all the modern comforts one could wish for. Each table is a private cell, separated from the others by bars.""Ye Bull Pen Inn was the site of many banquets and feasts for winning sports teams, with The Times writing lovingly of its design, where the main dining room was divided into stables and stalls, and interior woodwork was ""especially aged and rough hewn."" The 1928-published ""Los Angeles Trip Book"" by Katherine Ames Taylor excitedly writes, ""Los Angeles affects the bizarre in many of her cafes,"" singling out the famed Brown Derby and its signature walk-in hat as well as the problematic Zulu Hut, where caricatures of African culture were the off-menu entertainment.Venice's Ship Cafe was considered a treasure, said to be inspired by the sailing exploits of Spanish explorer Juan Cabrillo, and home to gaming, dancing and a clientele that included ""everybody who was anybody,"" according to this paper. Halibut would be caught off the Venice Pier and soon be ready to serve. And that says nothing of our region's contributions to tiki bar and restaurant culture, anchored by Don the Beachcomber in the mid-1930s, originator of many of today's still fashionable rum-filled concoctions and the initiator of a trend that has come colorfully in and out of style over the decades.Establishments would try to one-up one another with volcano effects and hula shows, while Rosemead's Bahooka centered its entertainment around flaming drinks and live fish, creating a restaurant that felt more like a national aquarium, albeit one with ""exotic Polynesian ribs"" on the menu. The trend seems to be thriving again today, with news in February of the Beachcomber brand being resurrected and local institutions newish and old — see Silver Lake's traditional Tiki-Ti and the fantastical pirate theme of Anaheim's Strong Water — thriving.A young couple enjoy a flaming honey bowl in 1997 at the now-closed Bahooka Ribs &amp; Grog in Rosemead. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)""Bahooka was probably one of the greatest, most proto-Polynesian restaurants in L.A.,"" says Thinkwell's Hanna. ""There's so many great examples in Southern California alone. Toothsome could be the next extension, you could say. L.A. has always been a place for dreamers. We've always been called weird by everyone, including ourselves, so it comes to no surprise to me that if you look at the apex of all those things, and the end of Route 66, that you see this entrepreneurial weirdness.""While dining in a prison cell may feel like a novelty, the best themed restaurants tend to have a few common traits. There's a tinge of romanticism, a longing for a different era or a fantastical environment, be it the high seas, a fairy tale or the chocolate-meets-travel decor of Toothsome. And there's joy that comes from being inside a creative space, a sense of adventure at piecing together a story as well as the calming sensation of stepping out of the chaos of our daily lives.But for themed restaurants to truly make an impact, says Sotto, there's also a harder-to-define quality they must possess: ""There is a graveyard of these things, from just having the accounting department hire an architect."" The necessary ingredient? ""I believe this comes from sincere passion. It comes from over-the-top insanity of an obsessed person. People want to see that. People want to feel that.""Locally, Sotto cites the long-standing Tam O'Shanter, one of L.A.'s first and most stable themed restaurants, as an example of a themed restaurant that's built to last. Designed by Harry Oliver, an artisan trained in Hollywood art direction, storybook houses and corporate whimsy (see the fancifully European windmills of Van de Kamp bakeries), the Tam, earlier known as Montgomery's Country Inn, has a hand-built, bedtime-story charm.""I would argue that Harry Oliver, who also designed the western town of the 1935 [World's Fair] exposition in San Diego that Walter Knott visited, was the bridge between Walter Knott theming Knott's Berry Farm and Walt Disney theming Disneyland,"" Sotto says. ""Walt Disney was eating in a themed environment at the Tam O'Shanter, which was far more Expressionist back then. It was more fantasy-oriented.""That makes the lasting impact of the themed restaurant hard to track. Chuck E. Cheese founder Nolan Bushnell cites Disneyland's Enchanted Tiki Room as the inspiration behind his game-focused pizza joints, as well as the ’70s-era trend of Wurlitzer organ-centered pizza parlors.But themed restaurants also impacted fine dining. Sotto took lessons from Disney and elsewhere and applied them to his interior work at at downtown L.A.’s Rivera, which stood from 2009 through 2014. The Times' review praised the design, namely ""a 40-foot electronic mural of evocative and poetic images (Maya ruins, agave, lizards, abstract forms) that dissolve into one another throughout the evening.""""I thought, 'What would happen if I could not do something visually literal, and just mine Sedlar's imagination?'"" says Sotto, noting that the restaurant had custom-designed tequila bottles with their own unique key. ""What if his food looked like a room?""These are lessons that Universal has sought to apply to its latest themed endeavor in Toothsome. CityWalk is no stranger to themed restaurants, home briefly to a Marvel-themed eatery, and Toothsome itself is taking over a space once occupied by a Hard Rock Cafe.But for all of the chocolate art and steampunk touches — try to spot the brass snails making their way to the second story — Toothsome doesn't overpower guests with its theme. The actor dressed as Penelope visited our table only when drinks were being delivered, and attempted to guess who ordered what before being on her way. And though there is a video wall at the back, most of the images are static, placing the emphasis on decadent theme-park concoctions like oversized milkshakes and a menu that mashes together burgers, meatloaf, pasta, flatbreads and more. Chocolate figures heavily, from the chocolate stout wings to the chocolate-crusted pork tenderloin.Don't expect something as busy as a restaurant in the actual theme park, such as the always-packed Toadstool Cafe in Super Nintendo World. Toothsome aims to offer just a bite of the theme-park experience. And grounding the restaurant in the characters of Penelope and Jacques, says Universal's Sakamoto, was done in the hopes of creating a more ""authentic fantasy,"" to give Toothsome a bit of a lived-in feel.""I think humans need to get away, in general, from our everyday life,"" says Sakamoto. ""A themed restaurant is just a restaurant. Going to a theme park is a production. You have to plan ahead and spend the whole day. A themed restaurant is easier, more casual.""Just be prepared for a pun-slinging robot.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

(NASDAQ:FFIV) over the last few years, earnings growth has been disappointing, which suggests something is amiss. Some of these issues will occupy shareholders' minds as the AGM rolls around on 9th of March. One way that shareholders can influence managerial decisions is through voting on CEO and executive remuneration packages, which studies show could impact company performance. From what we gathered, we think shareholders should be wary of raising CEO compensation until the company shows some marked improvement. Check out our latest analysis for F5 Comparing F5, Inc.'s CEO Compensation With The IndustryAt the time of writing, our data shows that F5, Inc. has a market capitalization of US$8.7b, and reported total annual CEO compensation of US$13m for the year to September 2022. Notably, that's an increase of 12% over the year before. While we always look at total compensation first, our analysis shows that the salary component is less, at US$925k.In comparison with other companies in the American Communications industry with market capitalizations ranging from US$4.0b to US$12b, the reported median CEO total compensation was US$1.2m. Accordingly, our analysis reveals that F5, Inc. pays Francois Locoh-Donou north of the industry median. Furthermore, Francois Locoh-Donou directly owns US$16m worth of shares in the company, implying that they are deeply invested in the company's success.Component20222021Proportion (2022)SalaryUS$925kUS$875k7%OtherUS$12mUS$11m93%Total CompensationUS$13mUS$11m100%Speaking on an industry level, nearly 19% of total compensation represents salary, while the remainder of 81% is other remuneration. It's interesting to note that F5 allocates a smaller portion of compensation to salary in comparison to the broader industry. If non-salary compensation dominates total pay, it's an indicator that the executive's salary is tied to company performance.Story continuesceo-compensationA Look at F5, Inc.'s Growth NumbersOver the last three years, F5, Inc. has shrunk its earnings per share by 8.7% per year. Its revenue is up 1.6% over the last year.The decline in EPS is a bit concerning. The fairly low revenue growth fails to impress given that the EPS is down. It's hard to argue the company is firing on all cylinders, so shareholders might be averse to high CEO remuneration. Moving away from current form for a second, it could be important to check this free visual depiction of what analysts expect for the future.Has F5, Inc. Been A Good Investment?F5, Inc. has served shareholders reasonably well, with a total return of 21% over three years. But they would probably prefer not to see CEO compensation far in excess of the median.In Summary...While it's true that shareholders have owned decent returns, it's hard to overlook the lack of earnings growth and this makes us question whether these returns will continue. In the upcoming AGM, shareholders will get the opportunity to discuss any concerns with the board, including those related to CEO remuneration and assess if the board's plan will likely improve performance in the future.Whatever your view on compensation, you might want to check if insiders are buying or selling F5 shares (free trial).Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a different set of stocks.

Shares have lost about 1.5% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Juniper due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Juniper Q4 Earnings Meet Estimates as Revenues SurgeJuniper reported mixed fourth-quarter 2022 results with the bottom line matching the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the top line missing the same. The company witnessed a strong business momentum in the December quarter. The double-digit year-over-year revenue upside was mostly driven by the cloud and enterprise business growth. Despite facing supply chain headwinds, it expects this healthy growth momentum to continue in 2023.Net IncomeOn a GAAP basis, net income in the fourth quarter improved to $180.4 million or 55 cents per share from $132.9 million or 40 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. Double-digit revenue growth fuelled by a solid performance in the cloud and enterprise business resulted in higher net income.Non-GAAP net income was $213.8 million or 65 cents per share compared with $184.7 million or 56 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line matches the Zacks Consensus Estimate.For full-year 2022, GAAP net income stands at $471.0 million or $1.43 per share, significantly higher $252.7 million or 76 cents per share recorded in 2021. A staggering 86% year-over-year increase can be attributed to higher revenues and one-time debt extinguishment costs in 2021.Non-GAAP net income for 2022 rose to $642.6 million or $1.95 per share from $576.2 million or $1.74 per share in 2021.RevenuesJuniper’s quarterly revenues increased to $1,448.8 million from $1,299.9 million in the prior-year quarter. High growth in Cloud and Enterprise business boosted top-line performance. However, the company witnessed a year-over-year decline in Service Provider vertical. The top line missed the consensus estimate of $1,482 million. To enhance the end-user experience, JNPR resorts to the first networking strategy focused on AI and cloud-delivered automation that generated higher net sales. Full-year 2022 net sales amounted to $5,301 million, up 12% from the 2021 figure.Product revenues totaled $988.3 million in the reported quarter, up 13% year over year. Compared to the same quarter last year, service revenue climbed to $460.5 million from $425.3 million.By vertical, revenues in cloud increased to $380.3 million from $333.4 million. It was the company’s second-highest cloud revenue quarter. Enterprise business also performed exceptionally well as revenue rose to $599.2 million from $455.1 million. However, revenues from Service Provider declined to $469.3 million from $511.4 million in the year-ago quarter.By region, revenues from Europe, the Middle East and Africa increased to $378.5 million from $343.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Revenues in the Americas increased to $857.4 million from $748.6 million. In the Asia Pacific, revenues were up 2.3% to $212.9 million.Story continuesOther DetailsGross profit was $827 million compared with $750.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Total operating expenses increased to $623.5 million from $596.5 million. Operating income was $203.5 million compared with $153.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $276.5 million, up from $238.1 million, with respective margins of 19.1% and 18.3%.Cash Flow &amp; LiquidityIn 2022, Juniper generated $97.6 million of cash from operating activities compared with $689.7 million in 2021. The huge difference is primarily due to significantly higher prepaid expenses and deferred income taxes. As of Dec 31, 2022, the company had $880.1 million in cash and cash equivalents with $1,601.3 million of long-term debt vs 2021 figure of $1,686.8 million.OutlookJuniper is experiencing supply chain headwinds induced by shortages and high component and freight costs. Supply chain woes are expected to continue in 2023 as well. The company also anticipates that a normalized software mix and seasonality will likely affect first-quarter gross margin.For the first quarter, the company approximates revenues of $1340 million (+/- $50 million). Non-GAAP gross margin is estimated at 57% (+/- 1%). Juniper expects non-GAAP operating expenses to be $580 million (+/- $5 million). It anticipates the non-GAAP operating margin to be 13.7% at the mid-point of revenue guidance. The non-GAAP tax rate is approximated at 19% ( +/- 1%). Assuming a share count of close to 330 million, non-GAAP net income is anticipated to be 42 cents per share (plus or minus 5 cents).How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, estimates revision have trended upward during the past month.The consensus estimate has shifted 18.1% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Juniper has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with a B. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise Juniper has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Comcast's generous commitment will help Heights create a pipeline of diverse talent for technology-related workforce opportunities for Black, Brown, and first-generation-to-college students in Philadelphia. The launch of Heights and Comcast's partnership was commemorated on February 28, 2023 with an in-depth educational tour and career panel discussion for more than 35 Philadelphia high school students visiting the Comcast Technology Center.

Vereen, Ed.D., co-president, Heights. ""When partners like Comcast join our network and invest in our young people, we make a stronger and more equitable city. With this grant, our students will not only be able to see themselves in computer and tech related careers, but they will also be able to take advantage of opportunities created by Heights to find them. We need other companies to follow Comcast's lead and invest in pathways to economic mobility for the city's young people.""Story continues""As a media and technology company that is committed to diversity, equity and inclusion, we understand the inequities and barriers students of color face when pursuing an education and career in an increasingly digital workforce,"" said Dalila Wilson-Scott, EVP and Chief Diversity Officer, Comcast Corporation and President, Comcast NBCUniversal Foundation. ""Through this partnership with Heights, we will help to equip Philadelphia students with the digital skills and readiness needed to be successful and have a future of unlimited possibilities.""As the Founding Inveniam Equity Technology Partner, Comcast's $1 million commitment in funding over three years to Heights supports the creation of a delivery system to technology-related workforce opportunities for Black, Brown, and first-generation-to-college students. Specifically, with Comcast's support Heights will:Expand its workforce team to enhance individualized career advising capacity related to technology and computer sciences pathways.Strengthen its career advising program within each of Height's current partner schools, including 19 high schools and four middle schools in Philadelphia.Create stackable college credits and certifications for high school students tied to computer science and technology career tracks. These dual enrollment offerings (college courses and certifications taken while in high school) will help lower college degree and certification costs.Create tech-related internship and credentialing opportunities for high school and college students.The special tour for the over 35 students who joined Heights to kick-off the Comcast partnership is just one example of the opportunities created through Heights' workforce program. The cohort of 9th grade students from George Washington High School are a part of a pilot program that Heights is supporting at their school to expand access to computer science/tech career pathways among Black and Latinx Philadelphia students. While visiting the Comcast Technology Center, the students received a behind-the-scenes tour, heard presentations and discussions from Comcast's BENgineers and TECHWomen, which are employee resource groups supporting Black and women technologists and engineers. Students were also gifted with laptops as a surprise to further bolster their studies and interest in technology.Comcast's commitment to Heights is part of $4.3 million in grants awarded in 2022 to 30 nonprofit organizations across Philadelphia to support digital adoption and skills training for residents. These grants were distributed through Project UP, Comcast's $1 billion commitment to advance digital equity through programs and community partnerships that connect people to the Internet, advance economic mobility, and open doors for the next generation of innovators, entrepreneurs, storytellers, and creators.Comcast joins the growing network of corporations that supports Heights' work to create pathways to college and workforce opportunities in underrepresented industries. In 2022, Hirtle, Callaghan &amp; Co.

307,6f128717-483f-3ef2-9d8d-413fe5862340,PRU,2023-03-03,5 Top High-Yield Stocks to Sail Through a Choppy March,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-top-high-yield-stocks-130301470.html,1677762181,STORY,"['PRU', 'NI', 'OMC', '^GSPC', 'REG', 'NJR', 'NIMC']","[Traditionally, the broader stock market performed well in March. For instance, the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.5%, on average, in March since 1928. However, the stock market is off to a discouraging start this March, with the S&amp;P 500 closing the month’s first day of trading in the red. This came after the stock market already delivered a lackluster performance in February following strong January gains.Wall Street, predominantly, was spooked by hotter-than-estimated inflation data at the beginning of 2023, which had led to more interest rate hike expectations. In the latter half of 2022, inflation started to gradually ease. But the consumer price index (CPI) advanced 0.5% in January and posted an annual gain of 6.4%, topping expectations of an increase of 0.4% and 6.2%, respectively, added the Labor Department.The producer price index (PPI) also rose by 0.7% in January and increased 6% year over year, exceeding analysts’ estimates of an increase of 0.2% and 5.6%, correspondingly, per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation index too remained stubbornly elevated, and its readings were more than anticipated.Now, with inflation increasing at a faster-than-predicted rate, it’s highly likely that the Fed would continue hiking interest rates to quell persistent inflationary pressure. The Fed may have reduced the size of interest rate hikes from 75 basis points to 50 basis points and now 25 basis points, but the minutes from the central bank’s latest meeting showed that most of the officials remain hell-bent on more interest rate increases to curb inflation.Regrettably, such a hawkish environment doesn’t bode well for the stock market. After all, rate hikes curb consumer outlays, push borrowing costs higher, and deter economic growth. Lest we forget, the labor market remains healthy, leading to upward pressure on prices, and chances of more rate hikes soon. The economy had added almost three times the jobs expected in January, and the unemployment rate at present is at its lowest level in more than 50 years.Story continuesMeanwhile, consumer confidence in the health of the economy dipped for the second successive month in February, which hurt the stock market as well. No doubt, high inflation, along with the looming fears of recession, dented consumers’ sentiment. The Consumer Confidence Index of the Conference Board declined to 102.9 in February from January’s reading of 106.Given such a gloomy scenario, the stock market is undoubtedly expected to remain volatile all through March and beyond. Therefore, it’s prudent for investors to look out for steady income at the moment by investing in dividend-paying stocks. This is because such stocks are known to have sound business models that help them remain unperturbed toward market upheavals.We have, thus, highlighted five such stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and provide high yields.

Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves.

It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

309,89bb4003-8cc9-3f08-879c-aa3dd69996f2,URI,2023-03-03,United Rentals (URI) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-rentals-uri-incredible-growth-174505595.html,1677779105,STORY,['URI'],"[Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.United Rentals (URI) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this equipment rental company a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for United Rentals is 16.5%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 28.3% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 0.6%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for United Rentals is 25.9%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 17.3%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 14.6% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 11%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for United Rentals. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.1% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made United Rentals a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions United Rentals well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is United Rentals (URI). URI is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 11.07 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 13.80. Over the last 12 months, URI's Forward P/E has been as high as 12.69 and as low as 7.49, with a median of 9.67.Finally, investors will want to recognize that URI has a P/CF ratio of 7.54. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. URI's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 17.57. Over the past 52 weeks, URI's P/CF has been as high as 7.87 and as low as 4.44, with a median of 5.94.These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at, but they help show that United Rentals is likely being undervalued right now. Considering this, as well as the strength of its earnings outlook, URI feels like a great value stock at the moment.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Benioff said he welcomed the new board members and said they’ll be great for the company and its shareholders. “We have three great new board members, and that's five new board members in the last 16 months. Incredible” Benioff said. The three new boardroom hires at Salesforce are Sachin Mehra, Mastercard’s Chief Financial Officer; Mason Morfit, ValueAct Capital’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer; and Arnold Donald, the former President and Chief Executive Officer of Carnival Corporation. Benioff had particular praise for Donald: “probably one of my favorite CEOs of all time, one of the top CEOs in the world” he told Yahoo Finance. Benioff however, did not mention the more aggressive activists targeting Salesforce, specifically Elliott Management or Starboard Value. Benioff spoke to Yahoo Finance after the company reported better-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter. Some analysts mused that the blowout results could also help Benioff outflank the activists currently circling his company.Video TranscriptMARC BENIOFF: Well, we've had some great experiences with our board. We've had two board members that we're sadly having to say goodbye to. They've been with us for 20 years. Sandy Robertson and Alan Hassenfeld-- incredible executives who've really guided the last two decades of our performance.And we're saying hello to three great new executives. I mean, one of them has been part of our ecosystem. You might have seen him at Dreamforce when you were there, Brian. Mason Morfit, the CEO of ValueAct Capital. He was not just at Dreamforce and has met with our customers and spent time with all of our executives and employees, but built these incredible decks, showing us new levels of performance that we could get in a distribution strategy and pricing. He was on the board of Microsoft. So he has incredible wisdom from that and from running ValueAct as the CEO.Story continuesSo we said, what, Mason, you should really be on our board. You're really adding value like we've never seen from an outsider. His founder, Jeff Ubben, also was someone who was there at Dreamforce with us. He's an old friend of mine for many years. Incredibly wise and enlightened person as well. And we were like, wow, Mason, come in and help us.And then Sachin Mehra, this-- Mastercard is a great customer of ours. The chief financial officer, he has an incredible financial engineering expertise. We've asked him to join our board. And probably one of my favorite CEOs of all time, one of the top CEOs in the world, Arnold Donald is also joining our board. So we've got-- we have three great new board members. And that's five new board members in the last 16 months. Incredible.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, I've gotten to know Arnold Donald through the years. He's been very informative--MARC BENIOFF: Just great person, isn't it? Just great person.BRIAN SOZZI: Yes. Let me ask you this, Marc. I've been doing this for a while. I know I may appear young, but I have been doing this for a while. I've never seen--MARC BENIOFF: You don't appear that young, Brian.BRIAN SOZZI: Thanks so much. I appreciate it. Thank you so much for the raw honesty. The active situation, I have never seen anything like this. What-- is there a resolution in sight? How does this all end, and how do you move beyond it?MARC BENIOFF: Well, look, I can really learn from anyone. And I enjoy meeting new people, and I enjoy talking to folks. And look, there's lots of different levels of understanding of enterprise software. There's different understandings of our company, who our customers are. But it doesn't matter what grade all these folks are at. I'm trying to ingest and learn and understand their perspectives.I think it's extremely important that I have a beginner's mind. You know I like to practice the Japanese concept of shoshin. How do I have a beginner's mind? In the expert's mind, Brian, there's no possibilities. The beginner's mind, there's every possibility, and that is really my approach with everything that has been going on with Salesforce. And it's been great.And then out of that, wow, I was just really blown away with Mason Morfit and how he was able to just grok what we're doing in Salesforce, but then deliver these, like I said, these decks, which outlined what we thought was just strategic directions for a company that really showed his expertise. And that's why we've added him onto our board.]"

313,d3a14cf9-9574-3554-81a2-61ca75430810,ORCL,2023-03-03,Oracle (ORCL) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-orcl-earnings-expected-grow-150003810.html,1677769203,STORY,"['ORCL', 'OPRX']","[Oracle (ORCL) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended February 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis software maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.19 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +5.3%.Revenues are expected to be $12.39 billion, up 17.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.37% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Oracle?For Oracle, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.28%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Oracle will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Oracle would post earnings of $1.17 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.21, delivering a surprise of +3.42%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Oracle doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Computer - Software industry, OptimizeRx Corp. (OPRX), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.24 per share for the quarter ended February 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +9.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $21.84 million, up 7.6% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for OptimizeRx Corp. has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 2.13%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that OptimizeRx Corp. will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Pierce believes BLNK's recent growth in hardware sales validates this cleaner approach.Lastly, the analyst's EV charger field checks in Northern California and BLNK findings left him with more questions than answers.Specifically, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Maps pointed Pierce towards BLNK chargers installed at multiple McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD) locations. Still, after visiting these locations and speaking with McDonald's employees, it appears they removed the chargers, making him question BLNK's product momentum and its ability to generate charging revenues by selling power to EV drivers.The analyst believes the McDonald's relationship is still intact, as BLNK referenced it as a partner on its 4Q22 earnings call. Still, overall his finding left him less optimistic on the margin.Pierce tracked Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) App store rankings, ratings, and reviews for BLNK and its peers and found BLNK's rankings, ratings, and reviews inferior to its competitors.Price Action: BLNK shares traded lower by 5.37% at $8.63 on the last check Thursday.Photo Via CompanyLatest Ratings for BLNKDateFirmActionFromToFeb 2022NeedhamMaintainsBuyNov 2021Cowen &amp; Co.DowngradesOutperformMarket PerformNov 2021HC Wainwright &amp; Co.UpgradesNeutralBuyView More Analyst Ratings for BLNKView the Latest Analyst RatingsDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

This marks the 10th consecutive quarter of comps growth for the segment. McDonald’s’ comps for the quarter benefited from a menu price increase, positive guest counts and marketing initiatives. This and continued digital and delivery growth contributed to the upside.International Operated Markets: Comps in the segment increased 12.6% year over year compared with a gain of 16.8% reported in the year-ago quarter. MCD gained from strong comparable sales in Germany, the U.K. and France.International Developmental Licensed Segment: During the quarter, the segment’s comparable sales increased 16.5% year over year compared with a gain of 14.2% reported in the year-ago quarter. McDonald's gained from robust performance in Japan and Brazil. However, this was partially offset by negative comps in China due to COVID-19-related government restrictions.Story continuesOperating Highlights &amp; ExpensesDuring the fourth quarter, McDonald’s total operating costs and expenses came in at $3,343.8 million, down 7% from the prior-year quarter’s levels.During the quarter, operating income increased 8% year over year to $2,582.7 million.

Shares have lost about 1% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is UPS due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Earnings Beat at UPS in Q4United Parcel Service reported mixed fourth-quarter 2022 results, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missed the same.Quarterly earnings of $3.62 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.58 and improved 0.8% year over year. Revenues of $27,033 million fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $27,946.6 million and decreased 2.7% year over year.The overall adjusted operating profit fell 3.3% year over year to $3,822 million in the fourth quarter.UPS generated $3,332 million of cash from operating activities in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditure was $2,491 million. Free cash flow was $566 million.Segmental DetailsU.S. Domestic Package revenues increased 3.1% year over year to $18,252 million in the fourth quarter, driven by a 7.2% increase in revenue per piece. Segmental operating profit (adjusted) jumped 7.5% year over year to $2,328 million in the quarter. The adjusted operating margin for the segment was 12.8% in the fourth quarter.Revenues at the International Package division summed $4,950 million, down 8.3% year over year. The downfall was due to an 8.6% reduction in average daily volume (owing to lower domestic volume and softness in China trade lanes). Segmental operating profit (adjusted) totaled $1,091 million in the reported quarter, down 18% year over year. The adjusted operating margin for the segment was 22% in the fourth quarter.Supply Chain and Freight revenues declined 18.1% to $3,831 million due to volume and market rate declines in air and ocean freight forwarding, partially offset by growth in the company’s healthcare business. Operating profit (on an adjusted basis) fell 11.6% to $403 million in the fourth quarter. The adjusted operating margin for the segment was 10.5% in the fourth quarter.Story continuesShareholder-Friendly MoveUPS’ board of directors has raised its quarterly cash dividend to $1.62 per share, effective from the first quarter of 2023. This marks the 14th consecutive year of a dividend increase. The raised dividend will be paid out on Mar 10, 2023, to all its shareholders of record as of Feb 21, 2023.Additionally, UPS has approved a $5-billion share repurchase authorization, replacing the company’s existing authorization.2023 OutlookFor 2023, United Parcel anticipates revenues between $97.0 billion and $99.4 billion. The consolidated adjusted operating margin is expected to be between 12.8% and 13.6%. Capital expenditure is anticipated to be $5.3 billion. UPS expects making dividend payments of $5.4 billion and share repurchases of $3 billion. The effective tax rate is likely to be 23.5%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.The consensus estimate has shifted -20.03% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, UPS has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F.

If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

UPS is benefiting from its shareholder-friendly initiatives.

Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseUnited Parcel Service, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseUnited Parcel Service, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | United Parcel Service, Inc. QuoteHow is United Parcel Placed?UPS’ strong free cash flow-generating ability is encouraging, supporting its shareholder-friendly activities. In 2022, UPS generated a free cash flow of $9,038 million. Robust free cash flow generation by UPS is a major positive, leading to an uptick in shareholder-friendly activities. Notably, UPS paid dividends worth $5,114 million and repurchased shares worth $3,500 million in 2022. In 2023, UPS expects to make dividend payments of $5.4 billion and repurchase shares worth $3 billion.Concurrent with the fourth-quarter 2022 earnings release, UPS’ board of directors raised its quarterly cash dividend to $1.62 per share, effective from the first quarter of 2023. This marked the 14th consecutive year of a dividend increase. The raised dividend will be paid out on Mar 10, 2023, to all its shareholders of record as of Feb 21, 2023. Additionally, UPS has approved a $5-billion share repurchase authorization, replacing the company’s existing authorization.On the flip side, increase in operating expenses is a concern. Due to the 56.4% rise in fuel expenses, operating costs increased 3.3% in 2022.Rising capital expenses further add to its woes. In 2022, UPS incuured $4,769 million of capital expenditures, up 13.7% year over year. The company now expects current-year capital expenditures to be $5.3 billion, well above 2022 level. The increased capex guidance, even though aimed at long-term benefits, may dent current-year profit margins.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, United Parcel carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the broader Zacks Transportation sector are Copa Holdings, S.A.

For instance, the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.5%, on average, in March since 1928. However, the stock market is off to a discouraging start this March, with the S&amp;P 500 closing the month’s first day of trading in the red. This came after the stock market already delivered a lackluster performance in February following strong January gains.Wall Street, predominantly, was spooked by hotter-than-estimated inflation data at the beginning of 2023, which had led to more interest rate hike expectations. In the latter half of 2022, inflation started to gradually ease. But the consumer price index (CPI) advanced 0.5% in January and posted an annual gain of 6.4%, topping expectations of an increase of 0.4% and 6.2%, respectively, added the Labor Department.The producer price index (PPI) also rose by 0.7% in January and increased 6% year over year, exceeding analysts’ estimates of an increase of 0.2% and 5.6%, correspondingly, per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation index too remained stubbornly elevated, and its readings were more than anticipated.Now, with inflation increasing at a faster-than-predicted rate, it’s highly likely that the Fed would continue hiking interest rates to quell persistent inflationary pressure. The Fed may have reduced the size of interest rate hikes from 75 basis points to 50 basis points and now 25 basis points, but the minutes from the central bank’s latest meeting showed that most of the officials remain hell-bent on more interest rate increases to curb inflation.Regrettably, such a hawkish environment doesn’t bode well for the stock market. After all, rate hikes curb consumer outlays, push borrowing costs higher, and deter economic growth. Lest we forget, the labor market remains healthy, leading to upward pressure on prices, and chances of more rate hikes soon. The economy had added almost three times the jobs expected in January, and the unemployment rate at present is at its lowest level in more than 50 years.Story continuesMeanwhile, consumer confidence in the health of the economy dipped for the second successive month in February, which hurt the stock market as well. No doubt, high inflation, along with the looming fears of recession, dented consumers’ sentiment. The Consumer Confidence Index of the Conference Board declined to 102.9 in February from January’s reading of 106.Given such a gloomy scenario, the stock market is undoubtedly expected to remain volatile all through March and beyond. Therefore, it’s prudent for investors to look out for steady income at the moment by investing in dividend-paying stocks. This is because such stocks are known to have sound business models that help them remain unperturbed toward market upheavals.We have, thus, highlighted five such stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and provide high yields. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Regency Centers REG is one of the leading publicly traded retail REITs in the United States. The company has a Zacks Rank #2.

Shares have lost about 3.8% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Mondelez due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Mondelez Q4 Earnings &amp; Sales Beat on Brand StrengthMondelez International posted impressive fourth-quarter 2022 numbers. The top and bottom lines increased year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results gained from the resilience of its snacking products, brand strength, broad-based growth across regions, categories and brands, continued strength in emerging and developed markets, and gains from its recent acquisitions.During the quarter, the company announced the sale of its developed market gum business to Perfetti Van Melle. This move will help fund its recent buyouts and streamline its portfolio. Also, it intends to sell the Halls business in the near future.Adjusted earnings were 73 cents per share, which increased 2.8% year over year and 9.9% on a constant-currency (cc) basis. The metric surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 71 cents per share. The year-over-year upside was backed by reduced outstanding shares, and solid operating gains. This was partly countered by the increased taxes, elevated interest expenses and lower income from equity method investments.Net revenues advanced 13.5% to $8,695 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,373 million. The uptick was driven by strong organic net revenue growth of 15.4%, and increased sales from the Chipita, Clif Bar and Ricolino buyout, somewhat negated by currency headwinds. Favorable volumes and pricing contributed to organic net revenues.Revenues from emerging markets increased 23.3% to $3,320 million, while rising 24.7% on an organic basis. Revenues from developed markets moved up 8.2% to $5,375 million, while increasing 10.5% on an organic basis.Region-wise, revenues in Latin America; Asia, the Middle East &amp; Africa; Europe; and North America increased 43.2%, 1.3%, 2.9% and 28.3% year over year, respectively. On an organic basis, revenues increased 37.1%, 13.6%, 8.7% and 19.5% in the above-mentioned regions, respectively.The adjusted gross profit ascended to $473 million at cc. The adjusted gross profit margin contracted by 120 basis points (bps) to 36% due to increased raw material and transportation costs, and an adverse mix. These were somewhat negated by favorable pricing. Mondelez’s adjusted operating income rose $201 million at cc. The adjusted operating income margin contracted by 30 bps to 15% due to inflated input costs and an adverse mix, largely countered by SG&amp;A leverage and favorable pricing.Story continuesOther Financials &amp; GuidanceThe company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,923 million, long-term debt of $20,251 million, and total equity of $26,920 million.

The hub, which is expected to be operational in 2026, will provide for CO2 captured off-site to be securely stored in saline formations that are not associated with oil and gas production.1PointFive has completed drilling a stratigraphic test well and subsurface assessment to characterize the site’s ability to securely store CO2 and expects to apply for two Class VI permits in 2023. 1PointFive and a subsidiary of Enterprise Products Partners L.P. are furthering the development of a CO2 transportation solution to gather CO2 from regional emitters and deliver to 1PointFive’s hub.“We are progressing our plans to build sequestration hubs that will provide a solution for carbon intensive industries to help reduce their emissions,” said Jeff Alvarez, President, 1PointFive Sequestration. “This hub is located between two of the largest industrial corridors in Texas so captured CO2 can be efficiently transported and safely sequestered. Rather than starting from scratch with individual capture and sequestration projects, companies can plug into this hub for access to shared carbon infrastructure.”About 1PointFive1PointFive is a Carbon Capture, Utilization and Sequestration (CCUS) platform that is working to help curb global temperature rise to 1.5°C by 2050 through the deployment of decarbonization solutions, including Carbon Engineering's Direct Air Capture (DAC) and AIR TO FUELS™ technologies alongside geologic sequestration hubs.

342,19bde79c-af42-3bd7-82cc-a6bc9cfeac68,ULTA,2023-03-03,Ulta Beauty (ULTA) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ulta-beauty-ulta-reports-next-150003759.html,1677769203,STORY,"['ULTA', 'DKS']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Ulta Beauty (ULTA) reports results for the quarter ended January 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on March 9, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis beauty products retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.53 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +2.2%.Revenues are expected to be $3.01 billion, up 10.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.36% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ulta?For Ulta, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +8.53%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Ulta will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Ulta would post earnings of $4.09 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.34, delivering a surprise of +30.56%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Ulta appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry, Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) is soon expected to post earnings of $2.86 per share for the quarter ended January 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -21.4%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $3.41 billion, up 1.7% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Dick's has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 1.67%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Dick's will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) earns a Zacks Rank #3 five days from its next quarterly earnings release on March 7, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.91 a share.Dick's Sporting Goods' Earnings ESP sits at 1.67%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.91 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.86.DKS is part of a big group of Retail-Wholesale stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Ulta Beauty (ULTA) as well.Slated to report earnings on March 9, 2023, Ulta Beauty holds a #2 (Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $6 a share seven days from its next quarterly update.For Ulta Beauty, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.53 is 8.53%.DKS and ULTA's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Story continuesFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.62bUS$4.28bUS$4.79bUS$5.23bUS$5.56bUS$5.82bUS$6.04bUS$6.24bUS$6.42bUS$6.59bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x4Analyst x6Analyst x4Analyst x4Analyst x4Est @ 4.58%Est @ 3.83%Est @ 3.30%Est @ 2.93%Est @ 2.67% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% US$3.4kUS$3.8kUS$3.9kUS$4.0kUS$4.0kUS$3.9kUS$3.8kUS$3.7kUS$3.5kUS$3.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$37bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.6b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.1%) = US$142bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$142b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$73bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$111b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$291, the company appears quite good value at a 32% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Vertex Pharmaceuticals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Vertex PharmaceuticalsStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Currently debt free.WeaknessNo major weaknesses identified for VRTX.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

The total organic volume dipped 0.6%, with a 0.9% decline in the own-beer volume and 1.9% growth in the non-beer volume.AB InBev remains keen on making the most of investments in its portfolio over the years, as well as rapidly growing its digital platform, including BEES and Zé Delivery. The company’s digital transformation initiatives have been on track, with B2B digital platforms generating about 63% of its revenues at the end of the fourth quarter. The company noted that the monthly active user base of BEES reached 3.1 million users as of Dec 31, 2022. The company’s direct-to-consumer ecosystem generated more than $450 million in revenues and approximately 69 million e-commerce orders in 2022.The company remains focused on expanding its Beyond Beer portfolio, which has also been aiding the top line.

The company expects organic growth for total revenues to be 7-8.5% compared with 2022. It expects the good momentum to continue into 2023.

360,62bd4878-60a6-3ccb-987b-d0da5473a957,VLO,2023-03-03,"‘Energy Stocks Look Golden,’ Says Kevin O’Leary; Here Are 3 Names That Analysts Like",TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-stocks-look-golden-says-000406525.html,1677801846,STORY,"['VLO', 'LNG', 'MGY']","[Everybody knows now, the energy sector was the place to be last year as the segment was an outlier and one of the few to sidestep 2022’s market carnage. Fueled by rising energy prices amidst Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, overall, energy stocks significantly beat the market.For those mourning a missed opportunity, ‘Shark Tank’ star Kevin O’Leary thinks opportunities in the segment are still abundant.“I love energy. Everybody hates energy… Go where people hate it. Energy is the driving pivot.” O’Leary said. “The cash flow, the distribution… that sector is looking golden right now.”O’Leary is not the only one thinking energy stocks are primed for more success. Taking a cue from O’Leary, we dipped into the TipRanks database and got the lowdown on three names for which the Street has big hopes – all are rated as Strong Buys by the analyst consensus. Let’s see what makes them appealing investment choices in the current climate.Valero Energy Corporation (VLO)With a market-cap over $50 billion, Valero Energy is the world’s largest independent refiner. The San Antonio, Texas-based player operates 15 refineries in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. and boasts a total throughput capacity of around 3.2 million barrels per day. Not only that, but it is also the second largest renewable fuels producer in the world.All this adds up to a recipe for success in the current climate, as was evident in the latest fourth-quarter results. The company notched profits that more than tripled from the same period last year as net income clocked in at $3.1 billion, amounting to adj. EPS of $8.45 per share. That figure also came in well ahead of the $7.22 forecast. Moreover, at 97%, Valero’s refineries showed their best utilization rate since 2018. This allowed the company to take advantage of the large gap between the prices of crude oil prices and refined product prices. The upshot of that was a 230% increase for the refining segment’s operating profit – to $4.1 billion.Story continuesGiven the performance, Valero was also able to lower its debt load by $2.7 billion last year, and the improved balance sheet provided the company with the means to return more cash to shareholders. As such, In January, the company upped its dividend payout by ~4% to $1.02 per share. With an annualized rate of $4.08, the dividend gives a 3.1% yield.This energy giant has drawn plaudits from Raymond James analyst Justin Jenkins, who sees plenty to like here.“We believe Valero remains extremely well-positioned to capitalize on the strength of the global refining backdrop as the ripple effects of Europe’s energy crisis add to the advantages of VLO’s top-tier portfolio,” the 5-star analyst said. “The company’s disciplined strategy has positioned VLO at the forefront of refining operations and broadened its footprint in both the renewable diesel and carbon capture spaces, all while re-fortifying its balance sheet. The stout combination will allow shareholder returns to ramp during 2023, positioning VLO to re-rate further.”Accordingly, Jenkins rates VLO shares a Strong Buy while his $174 price target suggests the stock will post gains of 25% over the coming year. (To watch Jenkins’ track record, click here)Turning to the rest of the Street, the bulls have it on this one. With 14 Buys, and just a single Sell, the word on the Street is that VLO is a Strong Buy. (See VLO stock forecast)Magnolia Oil &amp; Gas (MGY)Next up is Magnolia Oil &amp; Gas, a pure-play oil and gas E&amp;P (exploration and production) company. Most of MGY’s operations are concentrated in South Texas’s Eagle Ford Shale and Austin Chalk formations. Its holdings consist of a combined 460,000 net acres in the Giddings area and Karnes County, the former of which the business views as a resurgent oil play with ‘extensive inventory potential’ and significant room for growth.Growth was on the menu for the profitability profile when the company reported Q4 earnings last month. The company dialed in net income of $254.8 million in the quarter, up from $192.1 million in the same period a year ago. That translated to EPS of $1.20, some distance above the $0.78 anticipated by the analysts. Total production in the quarter increased by 6% year-over-year to 73.8 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day.During Q4, the company also repurchased 2.4 million shares for $57.8 million, not far off Q3’s $61 million, and the company has 8.9 million shares left on the repurchase authorization program.MGY has also shown a consistent commitment to paying out its dividend, and in late January, the company raised the payment by 15% to $0.115. This brought the annualized value of the dividend to $0.46 per share, and makes the yield 2.08%.For Truist analyst Neil Dingmann, it all adds up to a company that delivers the goods to its shareholders.“We continue to favor MGY’s relatively methodical shareholder return plan that includes dividends that will not exceed 50% of the prior year’s reported Net Income and opportunistic share repurchases of at least 1% of total shares each quarter,” the 5-star analyst wrote. “The flexible shareholder return program ensures the company maintains its pristine balance sheet while having ample dry powder to materially participate if the large equity sponsor decides to sell some, or all of its remaining 13% total shares. MGY’s operational plan remains stable with two rigs continuing with one focused on their highest return development activity, and the other is focused on both developmental and delineation activity.”Based on the above, Dingmann rates MGY shares a Buy along with a $29 price target. The implication for investors? Upside of ~27% from current levels. (To watch Dingmann’s track record, click here)Elsewhere on the Street, with 5 additional Buys outgunning 1 Hold, the stock claims a Strong Buy consensus rating. The forecast calls for 12-month returns of ~31%, considering the average target currently stands at $29.86. (See MGY stock forecast)Cheniere Energy (LNG)The last energy stock we’ll look at is Cheniere Energy. As implied by its ticker, Cheniere Energy is a liquefied natural gas (LNG) player, and in fact, in 2016, Cheniere was the first U.S. company to export liquefied natural gas.Today, the Houston, Texas-based firm is the U.S.’s largest producer of LNG and the second biggest LNG operator in the world. The company’s LNG facilities are in Southwest Louisiana and South Texas, and Cheniere prides itself on servicing dozens of markets across five continents, believing that as countries across the globe look for cleaner ways to power their economies, the demand for its fuel will only increase. That was quite evident in the company’s most recent quarterly statement – for 4Q22. Revenue grew by 38.6% year-over-year to $9.09 billion, beating the Street’s call by $1.05 billion. The company delivered consolidated adjusted EBITDA of roughly $3.1 billion, compared to 1.34 billion in the same period a year ago. For 2023, the company expects consolidated adjusted EBITDA in the range between $8.0 billion and $8.5 billion.For J.P. Morgan analyst Jeremy Tonet, the print “delivered on multiple fronts,” including better-than-expected 2023 EBITDA guidance, and bettering Q4 EBITDA estimates. Additionally, Tonet said, “Unlike most others in our coverage, Cheniere demonstrated a strong commitment to share buy-backs, with over &gt;$700mm executed in 4Q and plenty of room left on the $6bn program. At the same time, Cheniere redeemed $5.4bn of debt in 2022, highlighting robust financial flexibility.”Summing up, Tonet further said, “We continue to see value in the company’s top-tier, long-term take-or-pay contract portfolio, leverage to incremental LNG demand (and capturing market share as other sources decline), and unrivaled execution.”These bullish comments underpin Tonet’s Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating on LNG, while his $209 price target implies share appreciation of ~28% over the one-year timeframe. (To watch Tonet’s track record, click here)Amongst Tonet’s colleagues, there’s total agreement with that assessment; the stock’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on a unanimous 13 Buys. The analysts see shares delivering returns of ~20% over the coming year, given the average target currently stands at $195.62. As a small bonus, the company pays regular dividends that currently yield 1% annually.

363,5e93c88a-e2c7-398e-908f-6c471c80406a,VLO,2023-03-03,Valero Energy Corporation (VLO) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/valero-energy-corporation-vlo-attracting-140002617.html,1677765602,STORY,['VLO'],"[Valero Energy (VLO) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this oil refiner have returned +2.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.9% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, to which Valero Energy belongs, has gained 3.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Valero Energy is expected to post earnings of $6.90 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +198.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +3.8%.The consensus earnings estimate of $23.77 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -18.5%. This estimate has changed +2.9% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $16.55 indicates a change of -30.4% from what Valero Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Valero Energy is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VLO _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Valero Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $33.58 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -12.9%. The $148.81 billion and $136.66 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -15.6% and -8.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryValero Energy reported revenues of $41.75 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.3%. EPS of $8.45 for the same period compares with $2.47 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $40.91 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.04%. The EPS surprise was +13.42%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Valero Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Valero Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

364,b4064225-bb44-3260-9a35-465e8170e1c5,VLO,2023-03-03,Top 5 Stocks With High ROE as Equity Markets Flop in February,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-5-stocks-high-roe-132101500.html,1677763261,STORY,"['CNHI', 'HOLX', 'AN', 'VLO', 'R']","[The U.S. equity markets' downtrend continued in the past few trading sessions as strong economic data and a tight labor market portrayed signs that inflation was still a force to reckon with. Despite a solid start to the year, the equity markets largely remained choppy in February, while the 10-year Treasury yields jumped sharply to hit the highest level since November 2022. Experts widely believe that these will likely force the Fed to continue its aggressive stance against inflationary pressures.Fed had earlier raised the interest rates by 25 basis points – much akin to the broader expectations – and kept the door ajar for future hikes as it indicated that the battle against inflation was far from over. It also expected economic growth to remain subdued in 2023. Average hourly earnings in January fell 0.2% on a sequential basis and were down 1.8% from a year ago. The uncertain business environment failed to paint a clearer picture of the overall economy and led to the cacophony that drove the broader equity market volatility.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. AutoNation, Inc. AN, CNH Industrial N.V. CNHI, Valero Energy Corporation VLO, Hologic, Inc. HOLX and Ryder System, Inc. R are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Story continuesParameters Used for ScreeningIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 22 stocks that qualified the screen:AutoNation: Incorporated in Delaware in 1991, AutoNation is the largest automotive retailer in the United States.

The positive response could be attributed to the company’s earnings beat and an increase in dividend.What Did Diamondback Energy’s Earnings Unveil?Diamondback Energy reported fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $5.29, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.20 and surging from the year-ago bottom line of $3.63 per share. The outperformance reflects higher-than-expected production.Meanwhile, revenues of $2 billion managed to scrape past the year-ago quarter’s sales by $8 million but fell just short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate (by 0.1%) due to lower overall realization.In good news for investors, the company is using the excess cash from a supportive environment to reward them with dividends and buybacks. As part of that, FANG’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 80 cents per share to its common shareholders of record on Mar 3. The payout, up some 7% from the last one, will be made on Mar 10. In addition to the regular dividend, FANG declared a special dividend of $2.15 per share.The company also executed $316 million of share repurchases during the fourth quarter of 2022 at $134.49 apiece.Diamondback Energy, Inc.

Quote Production &amp; Realized PricesFANG’s production of oil and natural gas averaged 391,402 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), comprising 58% oil. The figure edged up 1.1% from the year-ago quarter and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 389,984 BOE/d. While crude and natural gas output were essentially flat year over year, natural gas liquids volumes increased 6.2% from the fourth quarter of 2021.The average realized oil price during the most recent quarter was $80.37 per barrel, 7.9% higher than the year-ago realization of $74.50 but below the consensus mark of $83. Meanwhile, the average realized natural gas price fell to $3.20 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) from $4.56 in the year-ago period and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.85. Overall, the company fetched $55.76 per barrel compared with $56.47 a year ago.Story continuesCosts &amp; Financial PositionDiamondback’s fourth-quarter cash operating cost was $10.16 per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE), literally unchanged from the prior-year quarter.

Of this, oil volumes are likely to be 256,000-262,000 barrels per day. The company forecast a capital spending budget between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion.

366,6f128717-483f-3ef2-9d8d-413fe5862340,REG,2023-03-03,5 Top High-Yield Stocks to Sail Through a Choppy March,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-top-high-yield-stocks-130301470.html,1677762181,STORY,"['PRU', 'NI', 'OMC', '^GSPC', 'REG', 'NJR', 'NIMC']","[Traditionally, the broader stock market performed well in March. For instance, the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.5%, on average, in March since 1928. However, the stock market is off to a discouraging start this March, with the S&amp;P 500 closing the month’s first day of trading in the red. This came after the stock market already delivered a lackluster performance in February following strong January gains.Wall Street, predominantly, was spooked by hotter-than-estimated inflation data at the beginning of 2023, which had led to more interest rate hike expectations. In the latter half of 2022, inflation started to gradually ease. But the consumer price index (CPI) advanced 0.5% in January and posted an annual gain of 6.4%, topping expectations of an increase of 0.4% and 6.2%, respectively, added the Labor Department.The producer price index (PPI) also rose by 0.7% in January and increased 6% year over year, exceeding analysts’ estimates of an increase of 0.2% and 5.6%, correspondingly, per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation index too remained stubbornly elevated, and its readings were more than anticipated.Now, with inflation increasing at a faster-than-predicted rate, it’s highly likely that the Fed would continue hiking interest rates to quell persistent inflationary pressure. The Fed may have reduced the size of interest rate hikes from 75 basis points to 50 basis points and now 25 basis points, but the minutes from the central bank’s latest meeting showed that most of the officials remain hell-bent on more interest rate increases to curb inflation.Regrettably, such a hawkish environment doesn’t bode well for the stock market. After all, rate hikes curb consumer outlays, push borrowing costs higher, and deter economic growth. Lest we forget, the labor market remains healthy, leading to upward pressure on prices, and chances of more rate hikes soon. The economy had added almost three times the jobs expected in January, and the unemployment rate at present is at its lowest level in more than 50 years.Story continuesMeanwhile, consumer confidence in the health of the economy dipped for the second successive month in February, which hurt the stock market as well. No doubt, high inflation, along with the looming fears of recession, dented consumers’ sentiment. The Consumer Confidence Index of the Conference Board declined to 102.9 in February from January’s reading of 106.Given such a gloomy scenario, the stock market is undoubtedly expected to remain volatile all through March and beyond. Therefore, it’s prudent for investors to look out for steady income at the moment by investing in dividend-paying stocks. This is because such stocks are known to have sound business models that help them remain unperturbed toward market upheavals.We have, thus, highlighted five such stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and provide high yields. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Regency Centers REG is one of the leading publicly traded retail REITs in the United States. The company has a Zacks Rank #2.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their importance, and go directly to read 5 Companies that Just Started Paying Dividends. The pandemic of 2020 took a toll on dividend payments in the US stock market. Nearly 190 companies ceased their dividends during that year, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence data. However, considering investors’ inclination toward dividends, over 60% of these companies reinstated their payouts through last year.Though 2022 was a challenging year for the capital markets, it opened new investment avenues for investors. Previously overlooked dividend equities remained their top priorities due to their ability to generate stable and regular income. Moreover, these companies have shown solid performance during inflationary periods in comparison to their peers. According to a report by AMG Funds, dividend payments in the S&amp;P 500 increased by an annual average rate of 6% over the past five decades, which is above the rate of inflation in the US during this period. The report also cited data from Ned Davis Research and mentioned that since 1979, dividend payers outpaced other asset classes in periods when 10-year Treasury is rising.When investing in dividend stocks, investors turn to companies that have strong dividend growth streaks under their belt. Moreover, these companies also have solid cash flow generation that indicates future dividend growth. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are some examples of popular dividend stocks with strong credentials.Amid the fluctuating market conditions, companies in the S&amp;P 500 paid record dividends last year, amounting to $561 billion, up from $511.2 billion in 2021. The trend is likely to continue this year as well as many companies have shown confidence in their cash flow and capital investments.

Here is what the firm has to say:“The world is short on raw materials and energy. Nordstern Capital has increased its exposure to raw materials and energy. Recession fears may temporarily suppress demand and prices. The fundamental issue, however, is a sustainable lack of supply, caused by decade-long underinvestment. The shortages cannot be resolved in the short to medium term.Currently suppressed stock prices offer a wonderful opportunity for our commodity businesses to buy back their own shares. For instance, Algoma Steel Group (NASDAQ:ASTL) reduced its diluted share count this year from 177 million to 111 million. Nonetheless, ASTL’s share price has come down 50%, because US HRC steel prices per ton declined in the past year from $2,000 to currently $713. Today, ASTL has $500m in net cash and a market capitalization of about $700m. The company is profitable even in the current recessionary environment. The CFO expects annual mid-cycle free cash flow generation greater than the current ASTL enterprise value. This is one illustrative example. ASTL is not alone. Many present-day commodity businesses are cash and earnings rich and can use weak stock prices for aggressive buybacks.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Companies that Just Started Paying Dividends. Suggested articles:16 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable11 High Growth UK Stocks to Buy12 High Growth SaaS Stocks that are ProfitableDisclosure.

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Stericycle's  ROE today.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Stericycle How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Stericycle is:2.3% = US$57m ÷ US$2.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.02 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Stericycle's Earnings Growth And 2.3% ROEIt is hard to argue that Stericycle's ROE is much good in and of itself. Even when compared to the industry average of 13%, the ROE figure is pretty disappointing. Although, we can see that Stericycle saw a modest net income growth of 11% over the past five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Stericycle's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 2.3% in the same period, which is great to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock.

Despite its low rate of return, the fact that the company reinvests a very high portion of its profits into its business, no doubt contributed to its high earnings growth.

But with the US economy still firing on all cylinders, profits are returning to the business, helped by diminished capacity across the airline industry and higher fares.“What you’re going to see from us over the next decade or so is just a more balanced approach to capital,” May said in an interview with Bloomberg News.The company is signaling a new era of budgetary restraint is a priority, against the backdrop of higher interest rates, a $12 billion capital-expenditure program through 2027 and big debt payments on the horizon in 2025.It will also pay $2.1 billion in interest expense in 2023 using current rates and capital structure, according to an analysis by Bloomberg Intelligence. That’s up from about $1 billion in 2019.“That is a huge bite,” said Philip Brendel, senior distressed credit analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “And from an operating perspective, they don’t get better food, more Wifi, or more comfortable seats for that money. Deleveraging is critical to free up capital for the business.”Story continuesCutting leverage will help the company improve its credit rating, which should allow it to pay less to borrow. Generally speaking, companies in the BB rating category effectively pay about 7.2% on average right now to borrow in the US bond market. That compares to about 8.8% for B rated borrowers, like American.By the end of the year, the carrier is aiming to bring a key leverage metric — net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and restructuring or rent costs — to the lowest since 2017. It also plans to pay down $2 billion to $3 billion in debt using free cash flow this year, according to May, 47.“We’ll obviously have some just baseline level of growth that’s going to require some amount of capital expenditures, but you probably aren’t going to see the fluctuations like you saw pre-pandemic,” May said.Airlines like American are benefiting from a recovery in demand for travel, especially among higher-end consumers. Yet, after the spending spree in the era of low interest rates and significant government assistance during the pandemic, the debt-cutting mission now hinges on its ability to generate excess cash through a likely economic slowdown ahead.“The big picture is, to continue to cut debt, they have to keep generating cash,” said George Ferguson, a senior airline analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “A lot of airlines left the pandemic with cash they can use to pay down debt. Some of the easy progress is behind them.”Sweet SpotThe Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier ranks below peers like Delta Air Lines Inc., with the latter eyeing a boost to investment grade by 2024 from its current BB rating by S&amp;P Global Ratings and BB+ from Fitch Ratings Inc. Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines Co. and Delta slashed total debt the most in 2022 compared to the year prior, with reductions of 23% and 11% respectively, according to data from S&amp;P. American cut debt by around 5% on a comparable basis.The company’s debt largely trades in line with those peers, with its 7.25% bonds due February 2028 changing hands around 97 cents on the dollar, according to Trace data. Meanwhile significant debt maturities arise in 2025, when scheduled principal payments spike to $7.6 billion, according to Fitch.A higher credit rating would give American the flexibility to better navigate the cyclical nature of its business and allow it to borrow at more attractive investment-grade levels for certain borrowings backed by its fleet and loyalty program, Treasurer Meghan Montana said.“That’s the sweet spot we’re targeting, which was informed by our experiences during the pandemic and the level of market access we think we’ll be able to afford when we get to that point,” she said.Read More: American Air Sells $750 Million Bond to Tackle Debt MaturityCompanies in the BB rating category trade with a 7.2% yield on average to borrow in the US bond market. That compares to about 8.8% for borrowers like American that are rated single B.For now, airfares are largely going up more than costs, such as wages, but a shift in the economic and commodity cycle could yet endanger the effort, warns Helane Becker, an analyst at TD Cowen.“The biggest concern is the recession is deeper and longer than people think it may be and spikes in fuel costs well over a hundred dollars per gallon would be hurtful,” she said. “Those are the two biggest things that would derail the plan.”Still May is sanguine, citing now-modest capital outlays this year.“The bookings we saw over the January period gave us a lot of confidence that our high-level demand forecast was a fair and accurate view of how this year could shape up,” May said. “If somehow our revenue projections are on the high end, I look at our capital-expenditure profile and we have a really nice one in a lower demand environment.”--With assistance from Boris Korby, James Crombie and Nina Trentmann.(Adds more details on interest expenses and market-wide cost of capital)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekFBI Documents Show Leonardo DiCaprio, Kim Kardashian Grilled for 1MDB SecretsFemale Execs Are Exhausted, Frustrated and Heading for the ExitsMicrosoft Expands Game Pass as Regulators Fret Over Activision DealRussian Airlines Are Flying High Despite SanctionsCritics of Biden’s Antitrust Push Target FTC’s Lina Khan©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

This will increase DAL’s costs to the tune of about $7 billion. The pay-raise apart, the deal includes provisions aimed at improving pilots’ quality of life. The contract takes effect from today (Mar 2) and becomes amendable on Dec 31, 2026.Expressing delight on the development, MEC chair Captain Darren Hartmann said “This industry-leading contract is the direct result of the Delta pilots’ unity and resolve. Despite a two-year delay in negotiations due to COVID, we never lost sight of our goal to obtain significant across-the-board enhancements to our pilot working agreement.”With U.S. airlines grappling with pilot-shortage, the bargaining power of this group has naturally increased as air-travel demand is buoyant, having bounced back very strongly from the pandemic lows.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksDelta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Transportation sector are American Airlines AAL and Alaska Air Group ALK, both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), presently.

(NASDAQ: YTEN) (“Yield10” or the “Company”), an agricultural bioscience company, today announced that it signed a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with American Airlines, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAL) on February 27, 2023 to collaborate in developing the value chain for Camelina as a low-carbon feedstock oil for sustainable aviation fuel (“SAF”). American is committed to helping to scale SAF production as a cornerstone of its climate strategy this decade.Under the MOU, Yield10 and American plan to work together to support the development of the Camelina oil-based SAF value chain with the potential to secure offtake agreements for Camelina oil-based SAF for use in the commercial airline business. The companies also plan to work together to support applications for government grants to support the establishment of infrastructure to support Camelina oil as a feedstock to refineries producing SAF.“SAF made from feedstocks that maximize carbon reduction is critical to our climate goals,” said Jill Blickstein, American’s Vice President of Sustainability. “We believe cover crops, like the Camelina varieties that Yield10 is working on, could play a significant role in helping us decarbonize. Since oilseed cover crops may also have other environmental benefits, such as helping reduce erosion and maintaining soil moisture, it makes them even more compelling.”“Yield10 is developing elite Camelina varieties to enable winter cover cropping and harvest of low-carbon intensity feedstock oil for the SAF market,” said Oliver Peoples, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Yield10 Bioscience. “With this new relationship in place with American, we continue to make progress toward our goal of establishing a network of collaborations across the biofuel value chain to support the establishment of Camelina as a major new source of feedstock oil for transportation fuel. We are excited to be aligned with American on the potential for Camelina to play an important role in sustainably de-carbonizing SAF. We look forward to working closely with American to establish the performance profile of Camelina feedstock oil and to develop the value chain for SAF from field to flight.”Story continuesBackground on Sustainable Aviation FuelMost SAF in production today is made from low-value feedstocks that include inedible plant oils, used cooking oils, waste fats, and agricultural residues. When blended with at least 50% petroleum-based jet fuel, SAF is considered a “drop-in” fuel that can be used by commercial aircraft. It meets the same safety and performance standards as petroleum-based jet fuel, but with up to 80% less greenhouse gas emissions when measured on a lifecycle basis. As part of the energy transition, a substantial increase in biofuels capacity in the United States is currently underway. It is expected that the increase in biofuels feedstock demand over the next few years to be filled mainly by feedstock oils, including oil from cover crops. Camelina’s low carbon footprint, and ability to be grown as a cover crop on otherwise fallow land, make it an attractive choice to fill the biofuels feedstock supply gap.About Camelina sativaCamelina sativa, commonly known as Camelina or false flax, is an annual oilseed plant in the mustard family that is native to Europe. Camelina has the potential to replicate the development of modern canola from rapeseed on an accelerated timeline based on modern technologies, including genomics and genome editing. Additionally, Camelina grows on marginal lands, displays early maturation, has enhanced drought and cold tolerance, and requires fewer inputs than other oilseed crops. With social conscience and sustainability in mind, Yield10 is leveraging its innovations in Camelina to use it as a platform crop for producing low-carbon feedstock oil for biofuels, including SAF; omega-3 nutritional oils; high-protein meal; and PHA bioplastic.About Yield10 BioscienceYield10 Bioscience, Inc. is an agricultural bioscience company that is using its differentiated trait gene discovery platform, the “Trait Factory”, to develop improved Camelina varieties for the production of proprietary seed products, and to discover high value genetic traits for the agriculture and food industries. Our goals are to efficiently establish a high value seed products business based on developing superior varieties of Camelina to produce biofuel feedstock oils, PHA bioplastics and omega-3 (EPA, DHA) oils and to license our yield traits to major seed companies for commercialization in major row crops, including corn, soybean and canola. Yield10 is headquartered in Woburn, MA and has a Canadian subsidiary, Yield10 Oilseeds Inc., located in in Saskatoon, Canada.For more information about the company, please visit www.yield10bio.com, or follow the Company on Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn.(YTEN-G)Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s top line is currently pegged at $899 million, which is an increase of 34.5% from the year-ago reported figure.The company’s revenues are expected to have been buoyed by upbeat passenger revenues with increasing air travel demand mainly on the domestic front. An uptick is also expected in the available seat kilometers, which measures the airline’s passenger carrying capacity. With the favorable movement of air traffic and capacity, the company is expected to witness a better load factor, which is the indicator of the airline’s capacity utilization.The bottom line is expected to have suffered due to escalating operating expenses. The surging fuel prices are likely to have played the key role in such an increase.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for AZUL this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.

PFG unveiled long-term guidance for 2023 that includes the impacts of the targeted improvements for long-duration insurance contracts accounting guidance. PFG expects to grow its operating earnings per share (EPS) at a rate of 3-6% year over year, excluding significant variances in both periods and reflecting macroeconomic assumptions as of Dec 31, 2022.Over the long term, the investment manager targets annual EPS growth of 9% to 12%, return on equity (ROE) of 14% to 16% and 75% to 85% free capital flow conversion, including a 40% dividend payout ratio.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings is currently pegged at $6.90 per share, indicating year-over-year growth of 3.6%.The 2023 guidance ranges exclude anticipated impacts of lower-than-expected variable investment income due to lower alternative investment returns, real estate sales and prepayment fees.With respect to the segment outlook, 2023 revenue growth &amp; margin guidance, excluding significant variances for net revenues at Retirement and Income Solutions (RIS) are expected to be 1% to 4% and 2% to 5% over the long term.For Operating margin at RIS, 2023 revenue growth &amp; margin guidance, excluding significant variances, are expected to be 35% to 39% and 36% to 40% over the long term.Operating revenues less pass-through expenses at Principal Global Investors are expected to be down 5-1% for 2023 revenue growth &amp; margin guidance, excluding significant variances and up 4-7% over the long term.

The loss ratio at Specialty Benefits is estimated between 60% and 65% for both 2023 revenue growth &amp; margin guidance, excluding significant variances and over the long term.Principal Financial continues to benefit from its strength and leadership in retirement and long-term savings, group benefits and protection in the United States, retirement and long-term savings in Latin America and Asia plus global asset management, which help it deliver solid operating earnings. Continued growth in fee, spread and risk businesses boost the company’s long-term prospects.Strong institutional flows across equities, real estate and specialty fixed income highlighting the value of diversified distribution through its institutional, retail and retirement channels are likely to aid Principal Financial to generate positive net cash flow for Principal Financial.PFG expects the Corporate segment to incur about $375 to $425 million pre-tax operating losses in 2023.Principal Financial boasts a strong capital position with sufficient cash generation capabilities and liquidity. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) investment manager exited 2022 with $1.5 billion of excess and available capital.

(ERO) shares ended the last trading session 5.9% higher at $16.58. The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 4.5% loss over the past four weeks.Ero Copper recently announced better-than expected production results for 2022, aided by strong copper and gold grades across its operations. Recent efforts to incorporate Project Honeypot into Caraíba's life-of-mine production plan has helped it improve the copper grade profile, resulting in record copper production for 2022. At the Xavantina Operations, ERO delivered record quarterly and full-year production results with increases in gold production driven by higher processed tons and grades.The Caraíba Operations produced 46,371 tons of copper in concentrate for 2022, surpassing the high-end of full-year guidance of 43,000 to 46,000 tons. The Xavantina Operations achieved record production of 42,669 ounces of gold for 2022, above the high-end of guidance of 39,000 to 42,000 ounces.These upbeat numbers are expected to have offset the impact of low metal prices on the company’s fourth quarter results. ERO is scheduled to report its fourth quarter results on Mar 7, 2023. This company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.29 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -55.4%. Revenues are expected to be $103 million, down 23.7% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Ero Copper Corp., the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 18.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. And a negative trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't usually translate into price appreciation. So, make sure to keep an eye on ERO going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.Story continuesThe stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

However, considering investors’ inclination toward dividends, over 60% of these companies reinstated their payouts through last year.Though 2022 was a challenging year for the capital markets, it opened new investment avenues for investors.

According to a report by AMG Funds, dividend payments in the S&amp;P 500 increased by an annual average rate of 6% over the past five decades, which is above the rate of inflation in the US during this period. The report also cited data from Ned Davis Research and mentioned that since 1979, dividend payers outpaced other asset classes in periods when 10-year Treasury is rising.When investing in dividend stocks, investors turn to companies that have strong dividend growth streaks under their belt. Moreover, these companies also have solid cash flow generation that indicates future dividend growth. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), PepsiCo, Inc.

Here is what the firm has to say:“The world is short on raw materials and energy. Nordstern Capital has increased its exposure to raw materials and energy. Recession fears may temporarily suppress demand and prices. The fundamental issue, however, is a sustainable lack of supply, caused by decade-long underinvestment. The shortages cannot be resolved in the short to medium term.Currently suppressed stock prices offer a wonderful opportunity for our commodity businesses to buy back their own shares. For instance, Algoma Steel Group (NASDAQ:ASTL) reduced its diluted share count this year from 177 million to 111 million. Nonetheless, ASTL’s share price has come down 50%, because US HRC steel prices per ton declined in the past year from $2,000 to currently $713. Today, ASTL has $500m in net cash and a market capitalization of about $700m. The company is profitable even in the current recessionary environment. The CFO expects annual mid-cycle free cash flow generation greater than the current ASTL enterprise value. This is one illustrative example. ASTL is not alone. Many present-day commodity businesses are cash and earnings rich and can use weak stock prices for aggressive buybacks.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Companies that Just Started Paying Dividends. Suggested articles:16 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable11 High Growth UK Stocks to Buy12 High Growth SaaS Stocks that are ProfitableDisclosure.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Union Pacific How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Union Pacific is:58% = US$7.0b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.58 in profit.Does Union Pacific Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Union Pacific has a better ROE than the average (26%) in the Transportation industry.roeThat's what we like to see. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROECompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining Union Pacific's Debt And Its 58% Return On EquityUnion Pacific clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 2.72. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.

399,edeb2834-e201-37f9-80ee-5397cf2a8414,GPS,2023-03-03,Gap (GPS) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q4 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gap-gps-expected-beat-earnings-150003365.html,1677769203,STORY,"['PLCE', 'GPS']","[The market expects Gap (GPS) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended January 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on March 9. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis clothing chain is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.59 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -2850%.Revenues are expected to be $4.33 billion, down 4.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.51% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Gap?For Gap, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +25.06%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Gap will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Gap would post a loss of $0.02 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.71, delivering a surprise of +3,650%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Gap appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerThe Children's Place (PLCE), another stock in the Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $4.18 for the quarter ended January 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -238.4%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $455.78 million, down 10.2% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for The Children's Place has been revised 151.5% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, reflecting an equal Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that The Children's Place will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Data science relies on data that relates to the problem you are trying to solve or the question you are trying to answer, so personally identifiable information (PII) is not necessary in many instances. The important thing is that the data is representative of the problem you are solving. It is imperative for a data scientist to be able to recognize when to exclude data, for instance, to avoid errors or biases in artificial intelligence and machine learning environments.Story continuesWhy Data Privacy is so ImportantData is typically stored on local servers or on the cloud. It's a company's ethical and legal responsibility to take care of the privacy aspect. Many times that responsibility will fall under the data engineer or database administrators' purview.Anonymizing data by removing or encrypting direct identifiers to individuals, such as a person's full name, address, email, personal identification number, physical description, or biometric info-the PII-and preventing the ability to reidentify them, is one way of ensuring data privacy.McKinsey argues that effective regulation of data anonymization is actually an opportunity, by reducing the risks to individuals and organizations, while making data more available for analysis.Data protection laws vary from country to country, but there are common practices such as: Having a data loss prevention and data discovery strategy; frequent backups; built-in protections such as replication, firewalls, encryption, authorization and authentication; and erasure and recovery strategies.The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) arguably has the widest reach. The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights stipulates that EU citizens have the right to protection of their personal data, and under the GDPR 1,031 fines were issued in the year to March 2022, totaling €1.581 billion.It should be noted that these fines were not levied against cyber criminals, but well-known corporations for breaches of the rules such as insufficient legal basis for data processing; non-compliance with general data processing principles; and insufficient technical and organizational measures to ensure information security.As an individual online, what can you do?There are many things you can do to secure your data. The most basic things are to:Use strong passwords, at least 11 characters long with a mixture of upper- and lower-case letters, symbols and numbers-it would take a cyber-criminal at least 400 years to crack your password that met these conditions. Longer passwords make it even harder.Back up your dataDon't open suspicious emailsNever provide personal data like a government ID number over the phoneJosh McCloud, Cisco's National Cybersecurity Officer in Singapore has some great cybersecurity tips online. Or you could explore the subject in greater depth by enrolling in Cisco Networking Academy's free Introduction to Cybersecurity course, designed to make cybersecurity awareness available for all.If, like me, you are curious about the world around you and have an interest in problem-solving, all the data being collected represents an enormous opportunity to improve communities and organizations in every corner of the globe.What's so great about data science?Introduction to Data Science is a primer course from Cisco Networking Academy that myself and a team of learning scientists developed to allow anyone to get their feet wet in the data science field. You can learn about data science at a high level and in an intuitive and interactive way for free on our ‘mobile-first' Skills for All learning platform.Data science affects our lives in numerous ways:In the entertainment industry, data science is responsible for classification algorithms that help viewers find videos they like. Based on their profile, including what videos they've watched, and what other customers with similar tastes have watched, the algorithms serve up recommendations.The fitness app on your smartphone, or fitness tracker, collects data fed into an application that can provide you with valuable health information. To calculate how many steps you take during a day or the distance you walk, these apps must build a model of your movements to identify what constitutes taking a step and the distance you cover with each one. Some fitness trackers are even using self-learning artificial intelligence (AI) software that can recognize and adapt to a wide variety of movements and is able to learn new fitness activities that are based on repetitive, cyclical patterns.In agriculture, farmers use cellphones to provide researchers with images of plant diseases. These images are used in image recognition systems to diagnose the diseases, and combined with environmental data regression, algorithms are then used to predict future outbreaks.And in medicine, researchers have developed a machine learning model that uses probability to classify breast cancer by examining medical histopathology images. This approach may eventually be capable of detecting cancer subtypes and classifying benign and malignant tissue.Data science is a powerful tool for good, and these are just a few examples of its application. On the surface, the cost of data privacy may appear to be an impediment to the potential advances that data science can bring. However, data privacy gives data scientists social license to use that tool responsibly. Everybody wins.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/741673/Data-Science-and-Data-Privacy-Work-Hand-in-Hand-To-Improve-the-World]"
