Nowadays, investors and traders alike can buy or sell shares anytime the market is open right from the palm of their hands. Most trading apps offer a wide range of educational resources on top of commission-free trading, bringing Wall Street much closer to Main Street for little-to-no cost.See Our List: 100 Most Influential Money ExpertsAlso: 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000The potential downside of this accessibility is that it encourages beginners to become stock traders rather than investors, and that can be a financially dangerous game. After all, when you can buy or sell stocks every minute of every day for no commission, it makes ""investing"" seem more like a video game than an important financial cornerstone. Nevertheless, for those who can maintain their discipline, stock trading apps can prove both educational and profitable. Here's a look at some of the best.Moyo Studio / Getty ImagesRobinhoodRobinhood was the first popular trading app to unveil zero-commission trading, and it remains among the industry leaders. Many of Robinhood's features have now been copied by other apps, but it continues to innovate with a focus on making its service user-friendly and easy to use. Robinhood does allow fractional share trading, which not all zero-commission apps do. In addition to free stock and ETF trading, Robinhood also offers commission-free cryptocurrency trading.Robinhood's interface is also helpful for investors as it allows them to customize their news feeds and alerts. For example, you can elect to receive push notifications if one of your stocks moves by 5% or 10%, or if a stock you are watching hits a predesignated target price.Take Our Poll: What's the First Thing You Would Do If You Won a Big Lottery Jackpot?kupicoo / Getty ImagesM1 FinanceM1 Finance is a zero-commission investment app and website that offers a bit of a unique experience for investors. One of the huge benefits of using M1, in addition to the zero-commission structure, is that you can buy fractional shares at the firm. Thus, even a $100 investment can be allocated across 10, 20 or even 50 different stocks, regardless of their share price.Story continuesTo accomplish this, M1 Finance has each investor create a ""pie,"" with each investment comprising a slice of that pie. Individual slices can be weighted anywhere from 1% to 100% of a particular pie and can be changed at any time, with M1 Finance automatically rebalancing the account after any changes.One of the few drawbacks of using M1 is that there is only one trading window per day, or two for paying ""M1 Plus"" members. Thus, this platform is not great for traders who need to get in and out of their positions rapidly. Of course, the flip side of this is that it prevents over-trading and encourages long-term investment.GaudiLab / Getty Images/iStockphotoSoFiSoFi, formerly known as Social Finance, was originally a student loan provider. Now, the app- and web-based fintech offers a wide range of products, from home mortgages and personal loans to savings accounts, credit cards, crypto trading and a no-commission investment platform for stocks and ETFs. This can make SoFi an interesting option for investors looking for a mobile-based one-stop shop.One drawback of SoFi is that although it does offer fractional share trading, its pool of available stocks is limited. Although you can trade nearly any stock you want for no commission, if you're looking to purchase fractional shares, you can only buy the specific stocks and ETFs included in the firm's ""Stock Bits"" program. Many of the most popular stocks and ETFs are included in Stock Bits, such as Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Tesla, but not all companies are available for fractional-share purchasing.YakobchukOlena / Getty Images/iStockphotoCharles SchwabIf you're looking for an ""old-school"" discount broker that also has modern research and trading capabilities to go along with zero commissions on stock and ETF trades, Charles Schwab might suit your needs. Schwab was one of the first discount brokers, dropping per-trade commission costs from the hundreds or even thousands of dollars charged by full-service firms to just a few dollars. In October 2019, Schwab dropped its standard commission rate from $4.95 per trade to zero, making it the first major firm to move to zero commissions.In addition to zero commissions, Schwab offers a complimentary, no-fee High-Yield Checking account that comes with a debit card that rebates ATM fees anywhere in the world. This can be a huge advantage for traders who travel a lot. Schwab also offers fractional-share trading through its Schwab Slices program, although trades are limited to S&amp;P 500 stocks.PeopleImages / Getty Images/iStockphotoTD AmeritradeTD Ameritrade is another ""old-school"" discount brokerage house that has modernized and now offers zero commissions on most stock and ETF trades. TD Ameritrade regularly receives awards for its trading platforms and tools, in addition to its educational offerings. One of the advantages of TD Ameritrade is that in addition to being simple to use for beginning investors, it also has advanced trading platforms like its trademarked thinkorswim platform. These advanced trading tools offer benefits like third-party research, elite-level analysis and testing strategies and idea generation tools. TD Ameritrade offers additional assistance for traders, ranging from in-app live chat to economic indicators straight from the Fed.pixdeluxe / Getty ImagesWebullIf you're an active stock trader, Webull may be of interest to you. Unlike many of the other apps on this list, Webull is dedicated solely toward active traders, with no other financial products offered. Webull doesn't offer fractional share trading, nor does it offer mutual funds. However, it does offer cryptocurrency trading and a host of advanced trading tools, including real-time quotes, detailed charting tools and Level 2 Nasdaq quotes, all with no account minimums or trading commissions. Webull also offers IRAs and full extended-hours trading.kupicoo / Getty ImagesStashStash isn't technically a commission-free trading app, but account holders do have access to zero-commission trading after they sign up for a monthly fee account. For $3/month, investors get access to automated investing and all of the basic Stash features, while the $9/month version offers additional Stock-Back rewards, custodial accounts and other benefits.Stash is clearly designed for beginning investors to educate them on the markets and get them involved with trading. The app offers fractional shares and access to thousands of stocks and ETFs. Actual trading within the app is free, although there's no avoiding the monthly account fee, which can prove expensive depending on how much value you get out of the app. When you sign up for Stash, you'll be asked some questions about your investment preferences and needs, at which point you'll be presented with a selection of recommended investments. Specific investment choices are up to each individual investor, however.Shutterstock.comAcornsAcorns is another investment app designed to appeal to beginning investors. Acorns accounts carry a monthly fee of either $3 or $5. As with some other investment apps, Acorns creates a suggested portfolio of exchange-traded funds for you to invest on based on your self-reported investment objectives and risk tolerance. What is unique about Acorns, however, is that your account contributions primarily come from your spare change. Whenever you make a purchase, your total is rounded up to the next dollar, with the additional amount being automatically invested into your chosen portfolio. For example, if you pay $2.52 for a cup of coffee, the Acorns app will automatically round up that purchase to $3 and invest the extra 48 cents into your portfolio. You are, of course, free to contribute additional money at any time.RichVintage / Getty ImagesBettermentBetterment isn't a zero-commission trading app in the vein of Robinhood or some other popular apps. Rather, it's a so-called robo-advisor, allocating funds to various exchange-traded funds according to customers' self-reported investment horizons, objectives and risk tolerance. The app also provides access to CFP investment professionals for an added cost. Fees at Betterment run 0.25% of assets annually for the standard robo-advisory service, or 0.40% for premium investors.For those looking for more of a ""hands-off"" approach to investing, a quality robo-advisor like Betterment can be a good choice, as it provides professionally managed portfolios that match investor needs for a low price. However, Betterment isn't a true ""trading app,"" as investors cannot trade in and out of individual stocks whenever they choose. Betterment's annual fee, while quite low, is higher than the zero commissions charged by other investment apps for stock and ETF trades. However, some investors may prefer paying that nominal fee for an automated service rather than picking their own investments.Nikada / Getty ImagesWealthfrontWealthfront is a robo-advisor in the vein of Betterment, charging 0.25% per year to construct and maintain a portfolio of exchange-traded funds matching an investor's objectives and ability to handle risk. Like Betterment, Wealthfront does not allow the commission-free trading of individual securities. However, it does aim to create long-term wealth via its risk-adjusted portfolios. It also offers a host of educational information to help beginners learn about investing.On the financial planning front, Wealthfront takes a unique tack by using real-world data to provide personalized advice. For example, if you're looking to save for a home, Wealthfront uses your actual financial data and integrates real-world housing information from Redfin to provide more relevant planning solutions.More From GOBankingRates40 Cities That Could Be Poised For a Housing CrisisHow Rich Is Former President Donald Trump?The 10 Best Cash Back Credit Cards for 20236 Strategies for Paying Off Multiple Credit CardsThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Ranking the Best Stock-Trading Apps Going Into 2023]"
2,6f46935e-e0cf-3782-8f37-fccaf7d72815,SCHW,2023-01-12,The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charles-schwab-corporation-schw-earnings-150003295.html,1673449203,STORY,['SCHW'],"[The market expects The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 18. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.09 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +26.7%.Revenues are expected to be $5.56 billion, up 18% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.97% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for The Charles Schwab Corporation?For The Charles Schwab Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.51%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that The Charles Schwab Corporation will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that The Charles Schwab Corporation would post earnings of $1.05 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.10, delivering a surprise of +4.76%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.The Charles Schwab Corporation appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, Morgan Stanley (MS), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.25 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -39.9%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $12.16 billion, down 16.3% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Morgan Stanley has been revised 1.8% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.72%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Morgan Stanley will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

3,2653524b-15ee-392e-b385-ac63a5c60144,SCHW,2023-01-12,Is Schwab Fundamental International Small Company Index (SFILX) a Strong Mutual Fund Pick Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-fundamental-international-small-company-120012334.html,1673438412,STORY,"['SCHW', '^GSPC']","[Looking for a Mutual Fund Equity Report fund? You may want to consider Schwab Fundamental International Small Company Index (SFILX) as a possible option. The fund does not have a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank, though we have been able to explore other metrics like performance, volatility, and cost.History of Fund/ManagerSchwab Funds is based in San Francisco, CA, and is the manager of SFILX. Since Schwab Fundamental International Small Company Index made its debut in January of 2008, SFILX has garnered more than $601 million in assets. A team of investment professionals is the fund's current manager.PerformanceObviously, what investors are looking for in these funds is strong performance relative to their peers. This fund carries a 5-year annualized total return of 0.04%, and it sits in the bottom third among its category peers. If you're interested in shorter time frames, do not dismiss looking at the fund's 3-year annualized total return of 1.52%, which places it in the bottom third during this time-frame.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. SFILX's standard deviation over the past three years is 22.79% compared to the category average of 25.15%. The fund's standard deviation over the past 5 years is 19.51% compared to the category average of 21.17%. This makes the fund less volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.Risk FactorsThe fund has a 5-year beta of 0.93, so investors should note that it is hypothetically less volatile than the market at large. Because alpha represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which is the S&amp;P 500 in this case, one should pay attention to this metric as well. Over the past 5 years, the fund has a negative alpha of -9.03. This means that managers in this portfolio find it difficult to pick securities that generate better-than-benchmark returns.Story continuesExpensesCosts are increasingly important for mutual fund investing, and particularly as competition heats up in this market. And all things being equal, a lower cost product will outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, so taking a closer look at these metrics is key for investors. In terms of fees, SFILX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.39% compared to the category average of 1.15%. So, SFILX is actually cheaper than its peers from a cost perspective.Investors should also note that the minimum initial investment for the product is $0 and that each subsequent investment has no minimum amount.Bottom LineYour research on the Mutual Fund Equity Report segment doesn't have to stop here.

4,3ad48a85-aa90-372f-9527-07c70d17012f,TXN,2023-01-12,Why Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) Could Be Worth Watching,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-texas-instruments-incorporated-nasdaq-120116465.html,1673524876,STORY,['TXN'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Texas Instruments’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Texas Instruments What Is Texas Instruments Worth?According to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average, the stock price seems to be justfied. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Texas Instruments’s ratio of 18.27x is trading slightly above its industry peers’ ratio of 17.42x, which means if you buy Texas Instruments today, you’d be paying a relatively sensible price for it. And if you believe that Texas Instruments should be trading at this level in the long run, then there should only be a fairly immaterial downside vs other industry peers. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Texas Instruments’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will Texas Instruments generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Though in the case of Texas Instruments, it is expected to deliver a negative earnings growth of -1.9%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? TXN seems priced close to industry peers right now, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to reduce the risk in your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock beneficial for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on TXN, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on TXN for a while, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. This means there’s less benefit from mispricing. In addition to this, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help gel your views on TXN should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved. For example, Texas Instruments has 3 warning signs (and 2 which are significant) we think you should know about.If you are no longer interested in Texas Instruments, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

It is well placed to gain from consistent market expansion and acquisitions. Univar is also benefiting from its pricing discipline to counter inflation and higher industrial demand, which are contributing to its top line growth.The company is also focused on cost-cutting, expense management and productivity actions, which are helping the company minimize operational costs and boost margins. It is taking a number of actions to reduce costs in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, including reduction in travel and other discretionary spending.The acquisition of Nexeo Solutions has also enhanced Univar’s capabilities and accelerated its ability to create a significant value for customers, supplier partners, employees and shareholders. The company is benefiting from the synergies of the Nexeo acquisition.The buyout of Brazilian ingredients and specialty chemicals distributor Sweetmix will also drive growth for the company’s Food Ingredients portfolio in Brazil and generate growth and cost synergies. This will also springboard its Latin American expansion. Revenues from the company’s LATAM unit went up 21% year over year in the third quarter, partly driven by the Sweetmix acquisition.The company also has a solid liquidity position.

10,281cc6c2-5042-3979-ae51-85a3a39647eb,NUE,2023-01-12,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Nucor Corporation (NUE) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-nucor-corporation-140002382.html,1673445602,STORY,['NUE'],"[Nucor (NUE) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this steel company have returned +1.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.2% change. The Zacks Steel - Producers industry, to which Nucor belongs, has gained 6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Nucor is expected to post earnings of $4.18 per share, indicating a change of -47.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.6% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $28.13 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +21.5%. This estimate has changed +11.4% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.76 indicates a change of -54.7% from what Nucor is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +11.4%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Nucor.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NUE _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Nucor, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.91 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -23.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $40.7 billion and $29.83 billion estimates indicate +11.6% and -26.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNucor reported revenues of $10.5 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.8%. EPS of $6.50 for the same period compares with $7.28 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.06%. The EPS surprise was +0.78%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nucor is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nucor. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

11,2d5d50bc-bb99-35db-a8f7-14d206eb9787,NUE,2023-01-12,Here Is Why Bargain Hunters Would Love Fast-paced Mover Nucor (NUE),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-bargain-hunters-love-fast-135001424.html,1673445001,STORY,['NUE'],"[Momentum investing is essentially the opposite of the tried-and-tested Wall Street adage -- ""buy low and sell high."" Investors following this investing style typically avoid betting on cheap stocks and waiting long for them to recover. They believe instead that one could make far more money in lesser time by ""buying high and selling higher.""Who doesn't like betting on fast-moving trending stocks? But determining the right entry point isn't easy. Often, these stocks lose momentum once their valuation moves ahead of their future growth potential. In such a situation, investors find themselves loaded up on expensive shares with limited to no upside or even a downside. So, going all-in on momentum could be risky at times.A safer approach could be investing in bargain stocks with recent price momentum. While the Zacks Momentum Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system) helps identify great momentum stocks by paying close attention to trends in a stock's price or earnings, our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen comes handy in spotting fast-moving stocks that are still attractively priced.There are several stocks that currently pass through the screen and Nucor (NUE) is one of them. Here are the key reasons why this stock is a great candidate.Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 1.1% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this steel company well in this regard.While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. NUE meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 21.5% over the past 12 weeks.Moreover, the momentum for NUE is fast paced, as the stock currently has a beta of 1.52. This indicates that the stock moves 52% higher than the market in either direction.Given this price performance, it is no surprise that NUE has a Momentum Score of B, which indicates that this is the right time to enter the stock to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.Story continuesIn addition to a favorable Momentum Score, an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions has helped NUE earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that the momentum-effect is quite strong among Zacks Rank #1 and #2 stocks. That's because as covering analysts raise their earnings estimates for a stock, more and more investors take an interest in it, helping its price race to keep up. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Most importantly, despite possessing fast-paced momentum features, NUE is trading at a reasonable valuation. In terms of Price-to-Sales ratio, which is considered as one of the best valuation metrics, the stock looks quite cheap now. NUE is currently trading at 0.90 times its sales. In other words, investors need to pay only 90 cents for each dollar of sales.So, NUE appears to have plenty of room to run, and that too at a fast pace.In addition to NUE, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our 'Fast-Paced Momentum at a Bargain' screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past.

We are webcasting today's conference call live. Thank you for your interest in Acuity Brands. I will now turn the call over to Neil Ashe.Story continuesNeil Ashe: Thank you, Charlotte. Happy New Year to all of you joining us on the call this morning. We delivered solid results in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, as we continue to demonstrate our ability to drive sales growth through product vitality and service in both our lighting and spaces businesses. We expanded adjusted operating profit, substantially grew adjusted diluted earnings per share, and generated strong cash flow from operations. We again created permanent shareholder value through share repurchases. Both our lighting and spaces businesses started the year with strong sales performance. First, in the Acuity Brands Lighting and Lighting Controls business. Our strategy of increasing product vitality and service levels continued to be a key differentiator for our customers.Our Contractor Select portfolio continues to be an excellent example of where these efforts are creating value. As a reminder, Contractor Select is a collection of the most important everyday lighting and lighting control products made up of a limited number of products with high product vitality and high service levels. This portfolio includes products from Lithonia Lighting, Juno, SensorSwitch and IOTA brands, and competes effectively in the electrical distributor and retail channels. An example of continued product vitality in the Contractor Select portfolio this quarter was the reintroduction of the upgraded DSX family of outdoor lighting. These products are used for commercial outdoor lighting as well as area lighting for schools, retail, and other everyday workspaces.The refresh focused on improving the design and increasing the control functions, including the ability to embed our nLight wireless controls. It is a significant step forward in enhancing our outdoor offering. Our focus on a concentrated offering with high product vitality and high service levels allows us to deliver high-end user satisfaction at attractive levels of profitability. Our product vitality strategy addresses several of our priorities, including our sustainability efforts. This quarter, in our A-Light brand, we launched a trio of sustainable products, lean, stitch and wings, that are marketed to office, commercial, and other similar customers. These products have a number of innovations, including collapsible designs and the use of new materials.For example, the materials in the wings products are 100% recyclable. Additionally, the collapsible design means the products contain less packaging waste and take-up less shipping space, which reduces the amount of fuel consumed during transportation as well as our shipping costs. The feedback on these products has been positive across the design and specification community and has been recognized. Our A-Light brand is leading by focusing on innovative design and sustainability, and I'm pleased to announce that this quarter our A-Light team won two GRANDS PRIX DU DESIGN Awards to celebrate the work of designers and architects who improve the quality of life and the built environment. We're also making progress on our strategy of improving service levels.We are beginning to satisfy more of our light backlog and decreased lead times as component availability becomes more stable. One of the core reasons our service continues to be differentiated is our manufacturing facilities in Mexico, not only are they strategically located, but they are also productive and very innovative. Our team of associates there is highly engaged and aligned to our values. I visited in December and I was impressed by the changes that they're making in staffing and employee engagement that will help us adapt to evolving market conditions. Finally, this quarter we took the decision to exit our Sunoptics Daylighting business, and our Winona custom architectural lighting solutions. These businesses were no longer strategically relevant and we do not expect them to meet our financial expectations in the future.We will continuously evaluate which businesses we operate and where we choose to compete. Karen will talk more about this in her comments. Now, moving to our Intelligent Spaces Group. The spaces team delivered good sales and operating profit growth this quarter. Both Distech and Atrius were successful in winning several new key customers and expanding services to existing customers. Our Distech product portfolio of controls and sensors is winning in the marketplace, largely in North America and France, and it has broader applicability. Therefore, we are focusing on increasing the addressable market for Distech. The first step is expanding the geographic markets that we serve. This effort is off to a promising start in the U.K. We are assembling the right group of independent systems integrators and are already delivering customer wins, including a large multi-million-dollar multi-year contract.In October, I was in Europe and had the opportunity to visit a large mixed-use construction site in Lyon, which was using a full suite of our Distech products to control the entire space. This installation is a great example of the power of a full Distech implementation with each VAC, lighting and shade control throughout all areas and for all tenants of the space. We look forward to continuing our market penetration in France, while we grow in the U.K. Moving to capital allocation. During the quarter, we repurchased just under 0.5 million shares, which brings the total amount repurchased since May of 2020 to just over 20% of our shares outstanding at an average price of approximately $140. Our capital allocation priorities remain the same.Our priorities are to invest for growth in our current businesses, invest in acquisitions, maintain our dividend and allocate capital for share repurchases when we perceive there is an opportunity to create permanent value for shareholders. Now, looking to the rest of fiscal 2023, there are two themes that we're focused on. First, there is obviously, uncertainty around the economy, inflation and interest rates, which we know will affect our business over-time. Second, we believe that as component availability improves, lead times will improve and backlog levels will return to normal. We are beginning to see this in our business. We are well-positioned in a variety of our end-markets and our continuing investment in-product vitality and service positions us well for these dynamic environments.Our organization continues to adapt to the changing requirements of our customers, and as a result, we have positioned ourselves not to predict the future perfectly, but rather to adapt to whatever comes our way. Finally, before I hand over to Karen, I want to congratulate our team on the accomplishments detailed in our 2022 EarthLIGHT report. Our products and services save our customers' energy and reduce their carbon emissions, and we are proud to announce our commitment to achieving net zero by 2040. As part of this, we've been working with the Science-Based Targets Initiative to establish new interim targets to further reduce our Scopes 1, 2, and 3 carbon emissions. This is both good for the environment and good for our business. Now, I'll turn the call over to Karen, who will update you on our first quarter performance and provide a strategic update.See also 25 Biggest Companies Headquartered in New York and 15 Best Growth Stocks To Buy.Karen Holcom: Thank you, Neil. Our first quarter of 2023 was a solid start to the year. We delivered good sales growth and strong adjusted diluted EPS growth. We improved adjusted operating profit, grew cash flow from operations, and continue to allocate capital effectively. As Neil mentioned, during the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we took the opportunity to strategically review our portfolio and sold our Sunoptics business. This business provided dome skylights and smoke vents to several different types of commercial buildings. We also announced plans to discontinue our Winona custom architectural lighting solutions by the end of the fiscal year. As a result, we took non-recurring charges of $22 million or $0.52 per diluted share related to impairments, severance, accelerated amortization, and a loss on the sale of the Sunoptics business.In the first quarter, we generated net sales of approximately $1 billion, which was 8% higher than the prior year, largely due to price. Both the ABL and ISG businesses contributed to the growth during the quarter. Operating profit in the first quarter of $109 million and adjusted operating profit was $140 million. The higher adjusted operating profit was a result of a good gross profit performance, as we continue to manage price and costs. However, the fall-through of the higher sales to adjusted operating profit was lower because of the impact of strategic decisions made for fiscal 2023 around commissions. Finally, we continue to grow adjusted earnings per share. Our diluted earnings per share of $2.29 was a decrease of $0.17 or 7% year-over-year, as a result of the $0.52 of non-recurring charges I detailed before, while our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.29 increased $0.44 or 15% over the prior year.The growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share was due to higher operating profit, benefits from foreign currency, and lower shares outstanding due to the share repurchases. I now want to expand on our segment performance. Net sales of ABL grew to $947 million, an increase of 7% compared with the prior year. This increase was driven by higher year-over-year sales in our independent sales network, the direct channel, corporate accounts, and the retail channel. ABL's operating profit was $118 million, a decrease of $10 million versus the prior year with ABL adjusted operating profit relatively flat year-over-year. The lower fall-through rate was primarily the result of higher commissions, as I mentioned previously. Now, moving to ISG. The spaces segment had a strong quarter and improved both net sales and operating profit.Sales in the first quarter of 2023 were $57 million, an increase of $10 million or 22% versus the prior year. During the quarter, Distech had strong performance across a variety of projects and was able to work down a significant amount of backlog from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 as component availability improved. ISG's operating performance also improved due to the higher sales and benefits from the mix of products as we cleared some of that backlog. Operating profit in the first quarter of 2023 increased to $8 million this quarter. Now, moving to cash flow. We generated $187 million of cash flow from operating activities for the first three months of fiscal 2023, an increase of $103 million over the prior year's first quarter. As a reminder, last year, we invested in inventory in order to support our growth as well as insulate our production facilities from inconsistent supply availability with the intention of working down that inventory over several quarters, which we have done.We are now down 13 inventory days from the peak in February of 2022. We also invested $18 million in capital expenditures during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and $78 million to repurchase approximately 0.5 million shares during the first quarter. Before I turn the call to the operator for questions, I want to reiterate the following. We are pleased with our performance in the first quarter of 2023. We delivered solid sales growth and strong adjusted diluted EPS.

13,effe2d7c-f19e-34b0-b3c3-728a899039aa,STT,2023-01-12,Analysis-Vanguard's climate group exit shows retail investors trail on ESG,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-vanguards-climate-group-exit-110608707.html,1673521568,STORY,"['BLK', 'STT']","[By Ross Kerber and Tommy Wilkes(Reuters) - Vanguard Group's decision last month to quit a key climate change coalition underscores how the retail investors who dominate its client base focus less on environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) priorities than institutional investors. Vanguard said last month it would drop out of the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative, whose members commit to making their investment portfolios emission-neutral by 2050. It said 80% of its close to $8 trillion in assets are in its index funds, which primarily attract retail investors. These funds generally do not have discretion to include or exclude stocks beyond a pre-set mandate, and most do not account for carbon emissions. Vanguard did not explain what changed since 2021, when it joined NZAM, but said it was responding to a desire of its clients to provide ""clarity"" and make its independence clear. Vanguard's biggest competitors, BlackRock Inc and State Street Corp's asset-management arm, rely more on institutional investors including pension funds and foundations. Both BlackRock and State Street have stuck with NZAM. At BlackRock and State Street, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds - the investment vehicles popular with retail investors that include many types of index funds - account for around 41% and 30% of assets, respectively, according to data from Morningstar Direct and company disclosures. At Vanguard, that figure is 88%. Institutional investors focus more on climate and other ESG priorities amid pressure to do so by clients, regulators and investment activists, said Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at ETF data and analytics provider VettaFi. ""BlackRock and State Street are appealing to an investment base that cares more about ESG,"" he said. Many retail investors are also interested in matters like climate change, but prioritize them less in building retirement portfolios, said Rosenbluth and other industry analysts.A FINRA Investor Education Foundation study of retail investors last March found only 9% of respondents held ESG investments. This is despite 57% of them saying they thought ESG investing can lead to positive change in the world. A big factor behind this gap is retail investors' lack of familiarity or knowledge about ESG products, the study found.Neil Bathon, managing partner of funds researcher FUSE Research Network, said obscure and inconsistent ESG ratings also make it hard for individuals to understand the value of ESG investing, especially after a fall-off in tech stocks and rising oil prices last year hurt returns in ESG funds. For many individuals, ""it's very difficult to trace investment to impact"" on environmental or social matters, Bathon said.Vanguard's NZAM participation was modest to begin with. It said 4% of its assets would be aligned by 2030 with a goal of net-zero emissions, compared with State Street committing 14% of its assets. BlackRock has said it expects more than half its assets to meet the 2030 target, but it has not made a firm commitment. ""You wonder why Vanguard signed up in the first place,"" said Hortense Bioy, global director of sustainability research at fund ratings firm Morningstar Inc. Vanguard representatives said the company looks forward to continuing constructive conversations with policymakers. A BlackRock spokesperson said it ""has a large and diverse client base with a range of investment goals"" and that as a fiduciary, ""our only agenda is delivering the best financial results.” State Street declined to comment. ESG BACKLASH Kirsten Spalding, vice president at sustainability nonprofit Ceres, a founding partner of NZAM, said she believed that Vanguard's move was mainly in response to a backlash against ESG from Republican politicians. Vanguard's NZAM withdrawal spared it from appearing at a Dec. 15 Texas hearing where BlackRock and State Street executives were grilled about their participation in NZAM and other ESG initiatives. State Street Executive Vice President Lori Heinel said during the hearing the firm must do some ""delicate threading"" to account for a wide range of views held by clients globally.Among the BlackRock and State Street institutional clients putting a higher priority on ESG would be European asset owners and big U.S. pension funds run by Democratic officials.One is New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who oversees some $41 billion of city assets managed by BlackRock, $31 billion managed by State Street, and none by Vanguard. ""We have made this commitment to net zero carbon and we can't achieve it unless our asset managers are aligned with it,"" Lander said. Vanguard's exit from NZAM has not fully spared it from the ESG backlash. A coalition of 13 Republican state attorneys general are pressing on with a motion asking federal energy regulators to limit Vanguard's ability to invest in public utilities.Representatives of several attorneys general declined to comment on what impact Vanguard's NZAM departure may have on the motion.(Reporting by Ross Kerber in Boston and Tommy Wilkes in London; Additional reporting by Simon Jessop in London; Editing by Greg Roumeliotis and Matthew Lewis)]"

CROX is the latest to follow suit by revisiting its forecast for the fourth quarter and 2022. The company yesterday raised its revenue guidance, driven by the robust consumer demand trends for its Crocs and HEYDUDE brands. The company called 2022 an exceptional year, with revenues for 2022 expected to rise 53%.Crocs anticipates 2022 revenues to reach $3.55 billion compared with the $3.46-$3.52 billion mentioned earlier. The revised view indicates an increase of 53% from that reported in 2021 versus the prior mentioned 49-52% rise. For the fourth quarter, the company expects year-over-year revenue growth of 60%. The company expects an adjusted operating margin of 27% for 2022.The company is encouraged by the significant progress made on debt reduction in 2022. Management noted that it reduced borrowings by $500 million since acquiring HEYDUDE in early 2022. Notably, it lowered the debt levels by $300 million in the fourth quarter.The company also outlined its initial guidance for 2023 ahead of the ICR conference on Jan 10, 2023. It anticipates year-over-year revenue growth of 10-13% in 2023. This indicates revenues of $3.9-$4 billion.Shares of CROX rose 1.6% yesterday as investors applauded the company’s commentary on strong demand trends and a raised view. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has rallied 51.5% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 13.5%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research What Else Should You Know?Solid consumer demand, and strength in the Crocs and HEYDUDE brands have been key to driving the robust performance of CROX for the past several quarters. The company’s top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the 10th straight quarter in the third quarter of 2022.With the HEYDUDE acquisition, Crocs added value to its fast-growing footwear business. This is the second high-growth, highly profitable brand added to the Crocs portfolio. Crocs believes that HEYDUDE’s consumer-insight-driven casual, comfortable and lightweight products perfectly fit its existing portfolio. The acquisition diversified Crocs’ brand portfolio and added to its digital penetration, as HEYDUDE has a strong online presence. HEYDUDE operates as a stand-alone division.Crocs earlier expected HEYDUDE to generate revenues of $700-$750 million, including the period prior to the closing of the acquisition. It expects HEYDUDE to deliver revenues of $620-$670 million on a reported basis, beginning Feb 17, 2022. The HEYDUDE brand is expected to attain $1 billion in revenues in 2023.Crocs is making significant progress in expanding digital and omnichannel capabilities. We note that digital sales advanced 22% on a constant-currency basis year over year in the third quarter, representing 37.4% of sales. This was mainly driven by growth across all regions and customer acquisitions. Increased focus on the Crocs mobile app and global social platforms aided digital sales. Gains from strategic collaborations, influencer campaigns, and digital and social marketing efforts are upsides.As part of its long-term strategy and key initiatives to deliver sustainable growth, Crocs expects to generate revenues of more than $5 billion by 2026, witnessing a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 17% in the next five years. It expects to attain the revenue target on strong digital sales, improved market share for sandals, growth in Asia, and innovative product and marketing. Management expects four times revenue growth in sandals by 2026.The company sees long-term opportunities in Asia, primarily in China, the second-largest footwear market in the world. Management expects revenue growth to see a CAGR of 25% and to represent 24% of the total revenues in 2026. It expects at least 50% of total revenues to come from digital channels by the end of 2026.Driven by strong revenue growth, the company anticipates improved profitability and cash flows through 2026. It expects the adjusted operating margin to be more than 26% and the annual free cash flow in excess of $1 billion by the end of 2026.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies from the Consumer Discretionary sector are lululemon athletica LULU, Oxford Industries OXM and PVH Corp.

With consistently low prices, plus coupons and other sales regularly available, it's easy to leave these stores feeling like you got a good deal. However, many big-box stores get you to spend more than you intend to -- or should -- with their secret money traps.See Our List: 100 Most Influential Money ExpertsMore: How To Get Free Gift Cards From Your Everyday PurchasesMake sure you know how to spot these 25 money traps before you open your wallet at checkout.Shutterstock.comPerishable Bulk ItemsBuying bulk items that will expire before you use them is one of the biggest money traps you can fall into when shopping at warehouse stores, said Alice Gerwat, senior content editor at Magic Freebies.""Even if you have the storage space for a large quantity of something, this doesn't mean that you'll definitely be able to get through it all, and you may end up chucking food or toiletries away because they go off before you can use them up,"" she said. ""This is particularly lucrative for big box stores with fresh food that goes off pretty quickly, because you'll feel compelled to come back and buy a big expensive bulk pack all over again.""Take Our Poll: How Long Do You Think It Will Take You To Pay Off Your Credit Card Debt?tdub303 / Getty ImagesDiscounts on Brand-Name ItemsJust because brand-name items are discounted at warehouse stores like Costco and Sam's Club, it doesn't mean it's the best deal you can get in the store.""These stores offer great deals on big-name brands, which can make it seem worthwhile, but it's often still better value to purchase their own brand items,"" Gerwat said. ""These items are often of the same quality but with a much lower price tag, so don't be fooled by big discounts on household names. This is especially true for alcohol.""Aja Koska / Getty ImagesBOGO Deals""Many times stores will advertise something as buy-one-get-one-free, but you don't always have to buy both,"" said Julie Ramhold, consumer analyst with DealNews.com. ""While some stores will require that you buy two to get the price, others will basically just cut the price on the item in half, no matter how many you get. Be sure to check the label and the store's policy before stocking up.""Story continuesShutterstock.comFree SamplesCostco is famous for its plethora of free samples. And even though they're free, this is actually another money trap. That cheesecake or meatball you tasted might be so good that you add it to your cart -- even though you had no plans to buy it before tasting it. Avoid the samples to resist this spending temptation.Techa Tungateja / Getty Images/iStockphotoSale Items That You Can Buy for a Lower Price ElsewhereIf you spot something marked down at a big-box store -- like a rollback at Walmart -- your immediate reaction is that this is a good deal. However, it's important to take the time to do a quick price comparison search on your smartphone to see if you can actually get it cheaper elsewhere.Trong Nguyen / Shutterstock.comPaying For a Membership That You Never UseIf you're paying for a membership at Sam's Club or Costco but you never actually go, you're throwing that membership fee away. Make sure you shop at the store often enough to make your membership worth it; otherwise, cancel it.Shutterstock.comInexpensive EyewearWarehouse clubs often sell glasses and lenses for less than other places, but sometimes you really do get what you pay for. Since this is an item you'll be using every day, make sure you're not sacrificing quality to save a few bucks.Shutterstock.comStore Credit Card OffersThe cashier might tempt you to open a store credit card at the checkout with an attractive sign-up offer, but make sure you know what you're really signing up for before applying. Retail cards tend to have higher annual percentage rates than traditional credit cards.Target's RedCard has an APR of 22.90%, and the Walmart Rewards Card has a 17.99% to 26.99% variable APR.97 / Getty ImagesShiny New Electronics at the Front of the StoreWarehouse clubs often put the latest TVs, electronics and other tempting tech right by the entrance. Maybe a new TV wasn't on your list, but if you are met with it first thing, you might be tempted to buy it. Don't fall for this trap.Shutterstock.com'Open the Wallet' PricingRetailers like Target and Walmart often stock the entrance with inexpensive seasonal items. These are usually things you don't need, but the visual appeal and low prices can tempt you to add these items to your shopping cart. Once you do, you might feel like since you got such a good deal, you can spend more on other stuff inside the store.Shutterstock.comFull-Price Seasonal ItemsThese seasonal items are really two traps in one. Target and Walmart will place their attractive seasonal merchandise at the front of the store a month or two before the season or holiday has actually begun, selling them to you at full price. If you wait until the end of the season or the day or two after the holiday, all of these items will be heavily discounted.QualityHD / Shutterstock.comCenter Aisles Filled With Things You Don't NeedCostco will often place essential items in outside aisles, and pack the center aisles with things you probably don't need -- but might want if you see. Avoid this money trap by only shopping the exterior of the store. Stick to your list if you have to venture to the center.Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comPsychologically Appealing SignageDon't be fooled into buying something you don't need just because you see a sign designating a ""limited time offer"" or a ""new low price.""According to Wise Bread, ""in many cases, the price of a 'limited time offer' is the same price the item has been for months, and the 'new low price' is simply the introductory price of a product."" Walmart famously puts ""everyday low price"" signs everywhere to make you think you're getting deals on regular-priced items.Do a quick Google of the item on your phone to see if these signs are really denoting a good deal or simply tempting you to buy.Nicole Glass Photography / Shutterstock.comHigh-Low PricingBed Bath &amp; Beyond and Kohl's seem to always have coupons available as well as ""sale prices"" on most items. You might think this means that you're always getting a good deal at these stores, but this is actually another money trap.According to Wise Bread, these retailers ""sell very little at full-retail, and at the same time, they give consumers the perception that they're scoring a great deal by issuing coupons and limited-time discounts. So in essence, the sale price becomes the everyday price and shoppers need to keep this in mind when price comparing."" Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.comDecoy PricingBest Buy often puts the most expensive items at the front of the store. For example, they'll put $3,000 HDTVs at the front, with cheaper model TVs toward the back. This way when you get to the cheaper TVs, you'll consider them to be a good deal. This is known as ""decoy pricing,"" according to Wise Bread.ZikG / Shutterstock.comGiant Shopping CartsMany big-box stores have oversized shopping carts so that no matter how much stuff you put in it, it doesn't actually look full. This can trick you into thinking you have less stuff in your cart than you actually do and tempt you to continue adding more items.Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.comOdd-Even PricingWalmart and other big-box stores employ a tactic called ""odd-even pricing"" to make you think an item costs less than it actually does, Business Insider reported. For example, if something costs $9.73, your mind quickly reads it as costing $9, when really it costs close to $10.Shutterstock.comGrouping Clusters of Related Products TogetherPerhaps you went to a big-box store to buy a single item, like a new camping tent. Because these stores are huge, they can stock up with tons of tempting items around every turn, so when you go to the aisle that sells tents, you'll also find other camping supplies like sleeping bags and fishing rods. Even if you didn't intend to buy these items, when you see them, you might just add them to your cart.Shutterstock.comCatchy TunesIt might be embarrassing, but we've probably all caught ourselves singing along to the music at a big-box store at one time or another. The music is intentionally catchy, Business Insider reported. The playlists are carefully curated to make you want to stay in the store longer, tempting you to keep shopping and spending more money.Charday Penn / Getty Images/iStockphotoExpensive Items at Eye LevelThe best bargains are usually found on upper and lower shelves. Retailers will place higher-priced items at eye level, where they know you're inclined to look first. Do a quick glance up and down the shelves before falling for this money trap.Shutterstock.comGift SetsEspecially around the holidays, stores like Walmart and Target will display appealing gift sets. Perhaps you wanted to give someone new lotion as a gift, but spot a beautifully packaged lotion and hand soap gift set that undoubtedly costs more than just the lotion alone. Sometimes the items in the set really do cost less when bought together, but other times this is just another way to upsell you.WalmartOdds and Ends at CheckoutStores like Target stock their checkout area with items like gum, batteries and snacks, and when you're waiting in line, your eyes are naturally drawn to these items. Before throwing any of them in your shopping cart, ask yourself if it's something you actually need.Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com'Free' ShippingWhen you're shopping at a big-box store online, you might go to check out, only to find out that you haven't met the minimum spend requirement to qualify for free shipping. Before you add things you don't need to your cart just to avoid shipping costs, consider using the pick up in-store option instead. Target, Walmart and Costco all offer this service that will save you from spending more than you need to.recep-bg / iStock.comBounce-Back PromotionsWhen you shop at Kohl's, you commonly end up with a coupon or Kohl's Cash promotion in your bag that you can use during your next shopping trip.""This offer [...] creates a return visit and purchase, which the consumer may not have otherwise made without the voucher,"" said Kendall Perez, formerly a savings expert at Coupon Sherpa.Recognize these ""bounce-back"" promotions as a retail strategy, and don't buy something you don't need just because you can get a discount for it.Shutterstock.comHigh-Profile CollaborationsTarget is known for collaborating with top people and brands for clothing and home goods collections, like Hunter boots and HGTV's Chip and Joanna Gaines. Kohl's and Walmart also employ this tactic to get you to spend.These collaborations not only tempt you to buy things you don't need because the big names make you feel like you're getting a deal, but they also create hype that brings you to the store or website, where you're more likely to spend even more.This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 25 Secret Money Traps at Costco, Target and More Big-Name Retailers]"
22,5539c10a-0170-31b8-8c22-af2e5d9f7906,WMT,2023-01-12,The inflation report is coming: Here are 2 blue-chip stocks to shockproof your portfolio,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inflation-report-coming-2-blue-195707209.html,1673467027,STORY,['WMT'],"[Inflation chat is once again this week’s hot topic. December’s consumer price index (CPI) will be released on Thursday with analysts hoping a repeat of last month’s positive declaration in inflation levels.The forecast is for core CPI to have climbed 0.3% in December. While this is a touch higher than November, it would still be in line with the quarter’s average, and less than the 0.5% average exhibited between January and September against a backdrop of the highest inflation in decades.The results will also provide an indication on whether the Fed will ease the scale of its rate hikes when it meets on Jan. 31-Feb. 1 to decide on the matter. The hope is that there will only be a 25 basis-point increase in the Fed’s benchmark rate, but a half-point increase is not out of the question either.With all possibilities open, it’s best to take a prudent approach to stock picking right now and lean into the blue chip stocks – the companies with an excellent reputation and a history of success even in a difficult macro environment.With this in mind, we delved into the TipRanks database and pulled out two such names - both stock market giants that outperformed the market last year and that could protect the portfolio against any incoming volatility. Let’s check the details.Walmart Inc. (WMT)Blue chip stocks, you say? Well, there’s no better place to start than with Walmart, officially the world's largest company by revenue. As of October 2022, the retail giant topped the Fortune Global 500 list, generating around $570 billion in annual revenue. Walmart boasts 10,586 stores and clubs spread across 24 countries, operating under 46 banners, with ~2.3 million worldwide employees, of which 1.6 million are U.S.-based.Walmart’s credentials as a stock to own in difficult times is reflected by its solid performance over the past year. Despite all the major indexes seeing out 2022 firmly planted in negative territory, WMT shares have sidestepped the carnage and are up by 2%.Story continuesThat’s because in the real world, Walmart has shown it is resilient to the tough conditions. This was evident in the company’s most recent quarterly statement – for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023.Revenue rose by 8.8% year-over-year to $152.8 billion, beating the Street’s call by $6 billion, while comparable sales grew by 8.2%, also above consensus expectations of 6.9%. On the bottom-line, the company delivered EPS of $1.50 – easily trumping the $1.32 forecast. Importantly, for Q4, Walmart expects consolidated net sales growth of around 5.5%, and said consolidated adjusted operating income is expected to drop by 6.5% to 7.5%, improving on its previous guidance of a 9% decline.All of this caught the attention of Credit Suisse’s Karen Short who sees multiple reasons to have WMT shares in a portfolio. These include, “1) WMT has been gaining meaningful market share since early 2021; 2) Our view that WMT is a well-positioned defensive name in an uncertain macro backdrop; 3) Price gaps to conventional grocers remain wide; 4) A potentially weak macro backdrop should accelerate share gains;, 5) In light of a potential combination of two of the largest conventional food retailers (Kroger and Albertsons merger), we believe WMT is well positioned to be even more offensive than usual to gain share; and 6) Alternative profit streams should continue to evolve and contribute to operating profits.”Unsurprisingly, then, the 5-star analyst rates WMT shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy) while her $170 price target makes room for gains of 17% in the year ahead. (To watch Short’s track record, click here)Most analysts are reading off the same page; the stock claims a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 20 Buys vs. 5 Holds. (See Walmart stock forecast)Visa Inc. (V)One of the most valuable firms in the world, Visa is a leader in international payments. The company doesn’t actually issue cards, extend credit, or set rates and fees for consumers. What it does is provide financial institutions with access to payment instruments that carry the Visa name, which they can use to provide credit, debit, prepaid, and cash access services to their customers. Over 200 countries and territories can accept digital payments thanks to its network, which can perform up to 30,000 transactions simultaneously and reach as much as 100 billion computations every second.Visa’s most recent earnings report – for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022 (September quarter) - was a strong one. Revenue climbed by 19% from the same period a year ago to $7.8 billion, beating Wall’s Street’s expectations by $250 million. The analysts were calling for adj. EPS of $1.86 but Visa delivered a much better $1.93. In further good news, the quarterly cash dividend was increased by 20% to $0.45 a share and a new $12.0 billion share repurchase program was also authorized.This is the kind of stuff which has shielded Visa from the stock market wreckage; the shares climbed 4% over the past year. 2023 should be another good year, according to Evercore analyst David Togut, who lays out the bull case for V, bear market or not.“V’s resilient business model and sizable moat around its network offers best-in-class risk/reward with downside protection in an uncertain macro environment and material upside opportunity in a rising economy,” the analyst explained. “With less than 50% of V’s revenue generated outside of the US and an inflation-hedged, ad valorem revenue model, we see moderate risk to V’s revenue as many international economies may underperform the US.”To this end, Togut rates V shares an Outperform (i.e., Buy) along with a $290 price target. The implication for investors? Upside of ~32% from current levels. (To watch Togut’s track record, click here)As for the rest of the Street, most are on board, too. The ratings mix show 20 Buys, 1 Hold and 2 Sells, all coalescing to a Strong Buy consensus rating.

TJX is benefiting from its solid store and e-commerce growth efforts. The leading off-price retailer remains committed to boosting growth through effective marketing initiatives. That being said, The TJX Companies is not immune to the rising inflationary environment.Let’s discuss this in detail.Factors Working in The TJX Companies’ FavorThe TJX Companies is expanding its footprint fast in the United States, Europe, Canada and Australia. During third-quarter fiscal 2023, the company increased its store count by 57 stores to reach 4,793. It increased square footage by 1% quarter over quarter during this time. The TJX Companies has been witnessing solid demand for an in-person shopping experience in the last few years. Its flexible buying supply chain and store formats aid the company in opening stores across a wide customer demographic.With more consumers resorting to online shopping, the company has undertaken several initiatives to boost online sales and strengthen its e-commerce business. We believe that The TJX Companies’ off-price model, strategic store locations, impressive brands and fashion products and efficient supply-chain management will likely aid its performance. In its last earnings call, management highlighted that it is committed to driving traffic and sales in the fiscal fourth quarter. In this regard, it is committed to providing products at great value throughout the store and online.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe TJX Companies is committed to boosting growth through effective marketing initiatives and loyalty programs. The company’s aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns through multiple mediums (TV, radio and social media) are adding growth. To fuel growth, management is on track to attract new shoppers of every age, including many Gen Z and millennial shoppers. Also, its treasure hunt shopping experience is gaining traction among shoppers. The TJX Companies’ gift-giving initiatives, unique among off-price retailers and loyalty card program (which offers consumers a non-credit card choice and soft benefits such as early shopping hours) have helped improve customer engagement.Story continuesHurdles on the WayThe TJX Companies is grappling with increased freight costs. To some extent, the company’s merchandise margin was hurt by incremental freight pressure in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The company also witnessed incremental wage costs, which weighed on the pretax profit margin. The TJX Companies saw additional wage costs of 80 basis points (bps). The company’s fiscal third-quarter gross profit margin was 29.1%, down 0.4 percentage points. In its last earnings call, management highlighted that for modeling purposes, it is currently projecting nearly 130 bps of incremental freight expense and 70 bps of additional wage costs for fiscal 2023.Nevertheless, we believe that the aforementioned upsides will likely help this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company stay afloat amid such hurdles. TJX’s stock has increased 39.8% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 8.7% growth.Solid Retail BetsSome better-ranked stocks are Walmart Inc. WMT, The Kroger Co. KR and Ross Stores Inc.

B is grappling with persistent supply-chain constraints, increasing operating costs and foreign currency woes.The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) player has a market capitalization of $2.2 billion.Let’s discuss the factors that might continue to take a toll on the firm.Weak Segmental Performance: Barnes’ Industrial segment is experiencing weakness due to the disruption in global automotive production caused by continued global supply-chain constraints and inflationary pressures. Also, the COVID-related operational disruption in the aerospace market is affecting the company’s Aerospace segment’s performance.Steep Costs and Expenses: The company’s cost of sales in the first nine months of 2022 increased 4.3% on a year-over-year basis. Its operating margin decreased 100 basis points year over year in the third quarter of 2022 due to inflationary headwinds and rising interest rates. Escalating costs and expenses are expected to persist in the quarters ahead, affecting B’s margins and profitability.High Tax Rate: For 2022, Barnes predicts a 24.5% tax rate, suggesting a rise from 21.9% recorded in 2021. High effective tax rates are concerning for the company, as they might dent the bottom line.Forex Woes: Given its widespread presence in the international markets, B is exposed to unfavorable foreign currency movement. For instance, in third-quarter 2022, foreign exchange headwinds had an adverse impact of 8%, year over year, on its Industrial segment’s sales.

More clients mean higher order volumes, pickup locations and increased route density that lowers costs per order.The companies declined to comment on the number of customers it hopes to sign under this deal. They also did not disclose whether retailers will have to pay per delivery or order.""Customer expectations are changing. They are expecting seamless online and in-store experiences from everybody,"" Anshu Bhardwaj, senior vice president, technology strategy and commercialization at Walmart Global Technology said on the call.""This (partnership) helps them move into a digital-led hybrid world much faster.""

FDX.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Top Research Reports for JPMorgan Chase, Chevron and Salesforce.comThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Chevron Corp. and Salesforce, Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of JPMorgan Chase have outperformed the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry over the past six months (+22.7% vs. +10.5%). The company’s opening of new branches, strategic acquisitions/investments and global expansion and digitization initiatives will keep driving financials. Higher rates and a steady rise in loan demand will keep bolstering net interest income (NII) growth.According to Zacks analyst estimates for NII (managed), figures are for a CAGR of 13% over the next three years. However, the volatile nature of the capital markets business and higher mortgage rates are likely to make fee income growth challenging.Our estimates for managed NII reflect a decline of 11.6% for 2022. Steadily rising operating expenses remain a major headwind, and we expect the same to rise 7% in 2022. Given the possibility of an economic slowdown, the company is expected to keep increasing provisions, with 2022 witnessing a substantial jump.(You can read the full research report on JPMorgan Chase here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Story continuesShares of Chevron have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+38.3% vs. +31.7%). The company is considered one of the best-placed global integrated oil firms to achieve sustainable production ramp-up.America’s No. 2 energy firm’s existing project pipeline is among the best in the industry, thanks to its premier position in the lucrative Permian Basin. As a reflection of these positives, we expect CVX’s EPS to jump 132% in 2022.However, Chevron was not immune to the commodity price crash of 2020, forcing the company to cut spending substantially. Its high oil price sensitivity is a concern too. Moreover, the supermajor’s 10-year reserve replacement ratio of 100% is indicative of its inability to replace the amount of oil and gas produced.(You can read the full research report on Chevron here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Salesforce shares have underperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (-38.0% vs. -27.0%). The company is facing stiff competition, which is a concern. Unfavorable currency fluctuations, along with increasing investments in international expansions and data centers, are overhangs on near-term profitability.Nevertheless, Salesforce is benefiting from a robust demand environment, as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The rapid adoption of its cloud-based solutions is driving demand for its products. Its sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its top-line.Continued deal wins in the international market is another growth driver. The acquisition of Slack would position the company to be a leader in enterprise team collaboration solutions and better compete with Microsoft’s Teams product.

In that report, analysts expect Salesforce.com to post earnings of $1.36 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 61.9%.

Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon.

They enable supply chain transparency and prevent damage to products during transport, retailing, e-commerce delivery, and storage. They enable access to fresh, safe food while preventing spoilage and protect essential goods while reducing packaging waste for consumers. The solutions' materials are designed for recovery and reuse.Transparency and Data ReportingDigital PackagingSEE digital packaging and digital printing capabilities enable customers and consumers to see inside the supply chain through tracking codes pre-printed on packages. With transparency, SEE's smart packaging and digital printing solutions are critical to unlocking efficiencies and reducing waste in processing and supply chain operations. Digital technologies are leveraged to improve efficiency within our operations, provide product identification and traceability, prevent product waste and damage across the supply chain, support recovery and recycling after use, and validate carbon reducing benefits to mitigate climate impacts.Environmental Product DeclarationThe use of an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) for our products provides customers with an independently verified and registered document that communicates information about the environmental impact of a product over its lifecycle. This international protocol for assessing environmental impacts helps customers make climate-smart decisions and advises manufacturers on areas for improvement. SEE published an EPD for its SEALED AIR® brand Whisper® soundabsorbing acoustic panels. The EPD is based on a lifecycle analysis and follows the product category rules for construction products and services.CRYOVAC® Brand FlexPrep® Portion-Dispensing PouchesCreated for foodservice operators as a sustainable, flexible alternative to traditional rigid containers, CRYOVAC® brand FlexPrep® portion-dispensing pouches hold emulsified sauces, condiments, and dressings. The low-density polyethylene (RIC 4) pouches are designed for recyclability. The degree of recyclability will vary depending on the scope and availability of flexible film collection, sortation, and recycling programsStory continuesA comparison of the pouches to rigid canisters revealed:A reduction in back-of-house condiment packaging material up to 85%Decreased shipping case size for equal condiment volume up to 46%Improved condiment product yield rates up 8% compared to canistersA decreased equipment footprint requiring less laborApproximately five times the reduction in the food waste carbon footprintReducing Resource Waste and Improving Productivity Through SEE AutomationCRYOVAC® Brand AutoVac 86 Automated Rotary Vacuum Chamber SystemThe CRYOVAC® brand AutoVac 86 automated rotary vacuum chamber system packages fresh and processed meats and cheese. The system's advanced diagnostics and automatic troubleshooting prevent product rework and packaging waste. The intelligent process monitoring adjusts machine speed, which reduces energy consumption.The AutoVac 86 system's key software component monitors for anomalies that could lead to bad packages, product loss, material waste, labor inefficiencies, and other critical issues. SEE performed a software logic analysis to current customer data, where five or above Torr was considered a bad package. The study showed the software is equivalent to an overall efficiency improvement of 3.7% versus the data analyzed, which means 3,700 bags were not wasted per 100,000 products packaged. Running at high utilization, the system potentially reduces bag waste of up to 222,000 per line each year based on a packaging line producing 6 million packages a year.Refurbishment Program for Automated SystemSEE created a refurbishment program in 2009 to extend the life of the CRYOVAC® brand vertical form-fill-seal systems that were returned after customer leases expired. Since the program's start, approximately 200 systems, which package liquid food products in a flexible film pouch, have been refurbished along with auxiliary equipment such as conveyor belts, pumps, and tooling. The program's circular approach allows SEE to capitalize on inventory, free up warehouse space, and reduce the company's environmental and resource impacts as compared to manufacturing new equipmentInvesting in CircularityAdvanced Recycling CollaborationA critical challenge facing the food industry is driving a circular economy for plastics using packaging materials that have strict hygiene and performance requirements for food protection and distribution. Recovering these essential packaging materials requires innovative recycling solutions beyond traditional mechanical recycling.A collaboration-the first of its kind in the U.S.-between SEE, ExxonMobil, and grocery retail group Ahold Delhaize USA is recycling flexible plastics from the food supply chain and remaking the materials into new, certified circular food-grade packaging. The project is helping to increase the use of recycled content by validating the technical and economic viability of a certified circular system based on advanced recycling technology and mass balance attribution. Flexible plastics are being designed to be collected, recycled, and repurposed into new food packaging. The project will help keep used flexible plastics out of landfills, increase the number of times essential plastics can be recycled, and ensure the safety and quality of packaged foods.CRYOVAC® Brand OptiDure ODF Recycle Ready Vacuum Shrink BagCRYOVAC® brand OptiDure ODF recycle ready vacuum shrink bags are a thinner, lighter-weight solution than standard vacuum thermoforming packs, which reduce excess packaging around the product and lower environmental impacts. The bags' barrier extends shelf life, safeguards food, and provides abuse resistance. New to the OptiDure lineup are medium abuse bags, which like the original standard and premium OptiDure bags are recycle ready and compatible with mechanical recycling of polyethylene. The degree of recyclability will vary depending on the scope and availability of collection, sortation, and recycling programs.Expanding Into Paper and Fiber-Based Packaging MaterialsBUBBLE WRAP® Brand Paper Bubble MailerWith a nod to SEE's flagship packaging solution-original BUBBLE WRAP® brand cushioning-the BUBBLE WRAP® brand paper bubble mailer is constructed with a padded bubble-shaped paper liner. The mailer passed the Western Michigan University Old Corrugated Container equivalency testing protocol making it certified for curbside recyclability. The outer layer of the mailer is made from 100% recycled paper manufactured in SEE's Sustainable Forestry Initiative-certified paper mills. The inner bubble-shaped liner of the mailer is made from paper certified by the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification.CRYOVAC® Brand Fiber-Based Forming WebThe CRYOVAC® brand fiber-based forming web is designed for case-ready packaging for fresh seafood. The non-barrier forming web is made from 90% Forest Stewardship Council-certified paper and is free of coatings that contain polyfluoroalkyl substances. This lightweight solution reduces the total amount of packaging compared to rigid trays and is recycle ready depending on the scope and availability of collection, sortation, and recycling programs.Reducing Customer Carbon FootprintCRYOVAC® Brand HydroLoQ Padless MAP TrayThe CRYOVAC® brand HydroLoQ padless MAP tray is designed to eliminate absorbent pads traditionally used in meat packaging. The tray is made from polypropylene (RIC 5) containing a minimum of 30% recycled content in clear trays and 50% recycled content in near-infrared black trays. The tray has been designated in Australia as curbside recyclable.SEALED AIR® Brand I-Pack Automated Void-Reduction SystemThe SEALED AIR® brand I-Pack automated void-reduction system produces a rightsized, curbside recyclable box for e-commerce orders. The system forms a corrugated tray into which contents are inserted and then folds the tray to create a carton specific to the size of the contents. This rightsizing maneuver eliminates void-fill materials and results in smaller parcels, which reduce warehouse storage space and the number of truckloads required to ship products-aspects that lead to a lower carbon footprint for customers who operate the system.Providing Societal ValueDistributing COVID-19 Test KitsAs the pandemic continued into 2022, the U.S. government provided at-home, rapid COVID-19 tests to Americans for free. SEE was a major packaging supplier for transporting the COVID-19 tests. The company's BUBBLE WRAP® brand cushioned poly mailers, BUBBLE WRAP® brand cushioned paper mailers, BUBBLE WRAP® brand original cushioning, and SEALED AIR® brand poly mailers, protected the test kits from damage during shipping to residences across the country.Protecting Freezers for Vaccine StorageDemand for ultra-low temperature freezers spiked during the pandemic because the mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 required storage that could maintain ultra-low temperatures. To avoid damage to the sensitive equipment during global shipping, SEE's tailored fabricated foam packaging solution provided effective protection for the freezers during transit.Read Sealed Air's Global Impact Report Here.Learn More About Sealed Air's ESG Efforts Here.Sealed Air, Wednesday, January 11, 2023, Press release pictureCRYOVAC® brand FlexPrep® portion-dispensing pouchesView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Sealed Air on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Sealed AirWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/sealed-airEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Sealed AirView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/734831/Sealed-Air-Global-Impact-Report-Solutions-Designed-for-Impact]"

After the frenzy of the past two years, this suggests good news for homebuyers in the new year with more options and more time to make a decision.""In December, we saw both buyers and sellers pulling back as they continue to adjust to a challenging market. Buyers started 2022 facing high home prices and limited inventories, and ended the year with interest rates roughly double where they started. Despite significant cooling in sales in 2022, some indicators remain in high gear. Prices are still significantly higher and homes are selling faster compared to 2019 pre-pandemic levels,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist for Realtor.com®. ""Although demand has softened compared to last year, pushing home price growth into single-digit territory for the first time in 12 months, moderation in home price growth may encourage more buyers to return to the market in the months ahead, and may also be welcome news for sellers aiming to sell and buy at the same time. Affordability will remain a challenge and buyers will want to keep a close eye on their potential mortgage payment – a mortgage calculator is a great way to do this.""December 2022 Housing Metrics – NationalMetricChange over Dec. 2021Change over Dec. 2019 Median listing price8.4% (to $400,000)33.4 %Active listings54.7 %-33.4 %New listings-21.0 %-17.7 %Median days on market11 days (to 67 days)-16 daysShare of active listings with price reductions6.5 percentage points (to 13.6%)3.3 percentage points(from 10.3%)Active listings up significantly from 2021, easing inventory constraints for buyersThe supply of active listings for sale in the U.S. increased significantly in December over the previous year, signaling continued hesitation from buyers in the face of mortgage affordability and other obstacles. While the number of homes for sale continued to increase in the latter part of 2022, inventory is still significantly lower than it was in 2019 before the pandemic. Home sellers also continued to be less active in December and fewer listed their home for sale compared to one year ago.Story continuesNationally, the active inventory of homes for sale grew 54.7% year-over-year in December, but is still well below pre-pandemic levels (-38.2% compared to the December 2017-2019 average).Both newly-listed homes (-21.0%) and pending listings, or homes under contract with a buyer (-36.8%), declined year-over-year.Among the 50 largest U.S. metros, 49 markets posted yearly active inventory gains in December, led by Raleigh, N.C. (+226.2%), Nashville, Tenn., (+226.0%), and Austin, Texas (+186.6%). Only Hartford, Conn. (-7.7%) saw a year-over-year decline in the number of for-sale homes.In December, on average across the 50 largest metros, the number of homes for sale was up 74.6% compared to a year ago, with the most growth in active listings in the West (+110.2%), which nearly reached pre-pandemic 2019 levels (-3.9%).On average across the 50 largest metros, no regions saw year-over-year new listing increases in December, with the greatest declines registered in the West (-32.5%), followed by the Northeast (-21.8%), Midwest (-19.3%) and South (-17.2%). Furthermore, newly-listed homes increased in just two markets: Nashville(4.1%) and Buffalo, N.Y.. (+3.0%).Home price growth moderates to single digits for the first time in a yearIn December, growth in the typical asking price slowed to a single-digit pace for the first time since December 2021. While this is still higher than normal, it's a significant slowdown from the peak 18% year over year pace seen earlier in 2022 and signals that fewer buyers are willing to take the plunge amid ongoing housing affordability challenges. Despite recent easing in mortgage rates from their early-November peak, higher rates and home prices compared to a year ago have increased the typical mortgage payment by nearly $750 each month or 58.9% more than last year, far outpacing recent rent growth (3.4%) and inflation (7.1%). Realtor.com®'s expectation for 2023 is that rates will climb higher early in the year before falling in the second half.In December, the U.S. median listing price was $400,000, up 8.4% year-over-year. This is the first time since December 2021 the annual growth rate has fallen below double-digits.While the monthly home price growth rate has slowed from the double-digits seen during the pandemic frenzy, overall, home prices continued to rise in 2022, and the median list price was up an average 13.4% compared to the previous year.The slowdown in the demand for homes has caused sellers to cut their prices. Nationally, 13.6% of active listings had their price reduced, a higher share than in December 2021 (+6.5 percentage points), but similar to the 2018 share (14.5%).Among the 50 largest U.S. metros, the biggest annual listing price gains were in Midwest metros (+12.2%, on average). The markets with the biggest increases were Milwaukee (+46.2%), Memphis, Tenn. (+34.0%), and Miami (+20.4%).Southern (+9.6 percentage points) and Western metros (+8.7 percentage points) saw the greatest increases in the share of listings with price reductions. Listing prices declined in nine markets, led by New Orleans (-4.4%), Denver (-4.0%), Austin (-3.4%), Phoenix( -2.4%) , and Pittsburgh (-2.3%).Homes stay on the market 11 days longer on average as buyers take their time to decideFor-sale homes continued to spend more time on market compared to the prior year amid a growing number of homes for sale and softening buyer demand. Modestly rising incomes (+4.6% year over year in December) and a robust jobs market (unemployment remains low at 3.5% in December), cannot completely offset lower buyer purchasing power, and as a result, homes are sitting on the market for longer, as buyers take their time to decide. Homes still sold faster in December than was common in 2019, with more affordable, lower-priced markets in the Midwest and Northeast seeing homes sell faster than in other areas. Looking ahead, mid-sized markets that offer better affordability and solid jobs and economies, especially those among Realtor.com®'s top housing markets of 2023, may continue to be attractive to homeshoppers, especially those with the flexibility to relocate.In December, the typical home spent 67 days on market, 11 days longer than last year, but still 16 days faster than in 2017-2019, on average.Time on market was lower across the 50 largest U.S. metros (61 days, on average) relative to the national pace, but also slowed from the December 2021 pace (+11 days).Forty-five metros saw an increase in time on market compared to last year, with larger metros in the West seeing the greatest increase (+18 days) followed by the South (+13 days). Metros where homes spent longest on the market compared to December 2021 were Raleigh, N.C.

Microsoft shares are currently being valued at a P/E ratio of 25.0 times the consensus EPS estimate for the fiscal year ending June 2023. Meanwhile, Intuit is being valued at 28.4 times the non-GAAP consensus estimate for the fiscal year ending July 2023. Many investors and analysts may accept that Intuit is trading at a higher multiple given expectations of greater growth potential. However, Intuit removes share-based compensation from their non-GAAP EPS whereas Microsoft does not. Given that Intuit’s GAAP EPS guidance for the year ending 31st July 2023 is $6.92–$7.22, its non-GAAP guidance is $13.59–$13.89, and the consensus estimate for 2023 EPS is at $13.69, it seems clear that most sell-side analysts are accepting the company’s non-GAAP adjustments, which includes the removal of some $1.8bn of share-based compensation, in their estimates. If we include the impact of share-based compensation in Intuit’s 2023 EPS to make a more apples-to-apples comparison with Microsoft based upon GAAP EPS, Intuit’s 2023 EPS would be closer to $9, meaning that the shares would be trading at a multiple of about 43 times. I think investors and analysts may find a premium of 14% for Intuit over Microsoft (28.4 times versus 25.0 times) to be reasonable.

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. Importantly, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) does carry debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?When Is Debt A Problem?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Walgreens Boots Alliance How Much Debt Does Walgreens Boots Alliance Carry?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Walgreens Boots Alliance had debt of US$11.7b at the end of November 2022, a reduction from US$13.9b over a year. However, it also had US$4.23b in cash, and so its net debt is US$7.50b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Walgreens Boots Alliance's LiabilitiesThe latest balance sheet data shows that Walgreens Boots Alliance had liabilities of US$28.0b due within a year, and liabilities of US$40.1b falling due after that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$4.23b as well as receivables valued at US$4.85b due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$59.1b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.The deficiency here weighs heavily on the US$32.0b company itself, as if a child were struggling under the weight of an enormous back-pack full of books, his sports gear, and a trumpet. So we'd watch its balance sheet closely, without a doubt. At the end of the day, Walgreens Boots Alliance would probably need a major re-capitalization if its creditors were to demand repayment.Story continuesWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.Walgreens Boots Alliance has net debt worth 2.0 times EBITDA, which isn't too much, but its interest cover looks a bit on the low side, with EBIT at only 4.9 times the interest expense. While that doesn't worry us too much, it does suggest the interest payments are somewhat of a burden. Shareholders should be aware that Walgreens Boots Alliance's EBIT was down 53% last year. If that earnings trend continues then paying off its debt will be about as easy as herding cats on to a roller coaster. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Walgreens Boots Alliance's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Happily for any shareholders, Walgreens Boots Alliance actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT over the last three years. That sort of strong cash generation warms our hearts like a puppy in a bumblebee suit.Our ViewOn the face of it, Walgreens Boots Alliance's EBIT growth rate left us tentative about the stock, and its level of total liabilities was no more enticing than the one empty restaurant on the busiest night of the year. But on the bright side, its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is a good sign, and makes us more optimistic. Overall, it seems to us that Walgreens Boots Alliance's balance sheet is really quite a risk to the business. For this reason we're pretty cautious about the stock, and we think shareholders should keep a close eye on its liquidity. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. To that end, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Walgreens Boots Alliance (including 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable) .If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.Have feedback on this article?

The policy is slated to take effect on Jan. 30.Starbucks is asking workers near its corporate headquarters in Seattle to go to the office three days a week: Tuesday, Wednesday, and a third day to be decided by individual teams. Employees living near regional headquarters are also expected to commute three times a week, though the company said local managers could decide the best days to bring people back.Starbucks did not immediately reply to a request for comment.A ‘privilege’In a post on the Starbucks website, Schultz said that working from home had hurt the company’s culture. He argued that Starbucks used “rituals,” like “coffee tastings” and “storytellings,” to build a sense of camaraderie among employees, and that returning to the office would “revive and reinvent” such exercises.Schultz also wrote that remote work had “unintended consequences,” fearing that the coffee company was “losing the art of collaboration,” as well as “a connection to a shared mission, something bigger.”But the Starbucks CEO also betrayed annoyance that employees had ignored an earlier request to come back to the office. Schultz wrote that “each of us made a promise to each other to be in the office between one to two days a week” in a shift to hybrid work last year. Yet he added that, according to badge swipes, “it’s clear that a good number of SSC partners are not meeting their minimum promise.” (Starbucks calls its employees “partners,” and its headquarters the “Starbucks Support Center,” or “SSC.”)Throughout his memo, Schultz called the ability to work remotely a “privilege,” one not shared by those working in the company’s stores, plants, and distribution centers. The CEO made clear that the new office mandate was a “requirement.”Story continues‘I’ll get on my knees’The Starbucks CEO has never been a fan of remote work. At a New York Times conference last June, Schultz complained that workers were not in the office as much as he wanted. “I’ve pleaded with them. I said, ‘I’ll get on my knees. I’ll do push-ups. Whatever you want,’” he noted at the time.Since then, more companies have expanded their return-to-office mandates. Apple, Meta, Google, Goldman Sachs, and Disney are all pushing workers to come back to the office for most of the working week.Economic motives are also providing an impetus to get workers back at their desks, with some tech companies asking workers to return to the office in the face of a slowdown in the sector. Both Snap and Salesforce said they would ask employees to return to the office following slow revenue growth.Starbucks, by comparison, appears to be weathering the current economic uncertainty. In November, the coffee company reported a 9% increase in global sales for the 2022 fiscal year. Strong sales growth in the U.S. offset a decline in international sales, particularly in China, where COVID outbreaks caused a 24% drop in store sales.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: Air India slammed for ‘systemic failure’ after unruly male passenger flying business class urinated on a woman traveling from New YorkMeghan Markle’s real sin that the British public can’t forgive–and Americans can’t understand‘It just doesn’t work.’ The world’s best restaurant is shutting down as its owner calls the modern fine dining model ‘unsustainable’Bob Iger just put his foot down and told Disney employees to come back into the office]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. ADM, Arista Networks Inc. ANET, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B), Philip Morris International Inc. PM and TransDigm Group Inc. TDG.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:5 Must-Buy Corporate Majors with Solid Long-Term PotentialU.S. stock markets have been fluctuating since the beginning of 2023 after an extremely volatile 2022. The two major concerns of last year, namely, a 40-year high inflation rate and the Fed’s ultra-hawkish policies in the form of decades-high interest rates and tighter monetary control, are persisting in 2023.Peak inflation seems behind us. Less-than-expected inflation rates in October and November with respect to several measures and an unexpected drop in wage rate in December and November have clearly indicated this.The Institute of Supply Management reported that the services sector index for December plummeted to 49.6% from 56.5% in November. The consensus estimate was 55.1%. Any reading below 50% indicates a contraction in services activities. The index contracted for the first time since May 2020, at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.A devastated housing market owing to the high mortgage rate, disappointing retail sales in December, the peak festive season, huge inventory accumulation by several retailers and a sharp fall in U.S. manufacturing activities indicated that the U.S. economy is cooling in the desired direction of the Fed. Several U.S. corporate giants have started retrenching manpower significantly at higher levels.However, Wall Street will remain volatile for at least the first half of this year as the Fed will continue to raise the benchmark interest rate with the terminal rate likely to go beyond 5%. At this stage it will be prudent to invest in stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank with a solid long-term potential.Story continuesStock Selection ProcessWe have selected five U.S. corporate giants (market capital &gt; $30 billion) as these companies have stable business model and globally claimed brand value. These stocks have strong long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth potential and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Finally, each of our picks sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. has been gaining from solid demand, improved productivity and product innovations.

The company has been significantly progressing on its three strategic pillars — optimize, drive and growth.Archer-Daniels-Midland has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 7.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.3% over the last seven days.Arista Networks Inc. develops markets and sells cloud networking solutions in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia-Pacific. ANET benefits from the expanding cloud networking market, driven by strong demand for scalable infrastructure. The company recently joined the Microsoft Intelligent Security Association.Arista Networks continues to gain from solid momentum and diversification across its top verticals and product lines.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 0.6% over the last 30 days.Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies measured by premium volume. BRK.B’s inorganic growth story remains impressive with strategic acquisitions. A strong cash position supports earnings-accretive bolt-on buyouts and indicates Berkshire Hathaway’s financial flexibility.Continued insurance business growth fuels an increase in float, drives earnings and generates maximum return on equity. The non-insurance businesses of BRK.B are delivering improved results with increased revenues over the past few years. A sturdy capital level provides further impetus.Berkshire Hathaway has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 12.3% over the last 60 days.Philip Morris International Inc. has long been benefiting from its strong pricing power. Higher pricing variance was an upside to PM’s performance across most regions during the third quarter of 2022. Additionally, focus on reduced-risk products, especially IQOS has been working well for PM.The company is witnessing a continued product mix shift from cigarettes to smoke-free products. Notably, smoke-free products generated more than 30% of the company’s net revenues in the third quarter, wherein revenues from RRPs jumped 12.9% to $2,362 million.Philip Morris has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 30 days.TransDigm Group Inc. has been enjoying significant growth opportunities in the defense space, driven by the U.S. administration’s expansionary budgetary policy. TDG also boasts a solid solvency position, at least in the near term.President Biden’s fiscal 2023 budget includes investment worth $773 billion in national security funding. This will ensure an increase of 4.1% over the previous year’s enacted amount. This enhanced budget proposal has thus boosted the possibility for renowned military jet builders and others to acquire significant defense contracts from the Pentagon, which, in turn, should benefit equipment suppliers like TDG.TransDigm Group has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 20.6%.

82,1f4fa52e-962d-376e-a9ee-bc9287b88a44,ADM,2023-01-12,Archer Daniels Midland and DR Horton have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/archer-daniels-midland-dr-horton-133301616.html,1673443981,STORY,['ADM'],"[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – January 11, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Archer Daniels Midland ADM as the Bull of the Day and DR Horton DHI as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Uber Technologies UBER, Lyft LYFT and Baidu BIDU.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Inflation has hit many parts of the world. You can see it in everything from wages to houses to cars to food prices. Rather than get down on the inflationary blues, why not invest in the stocks which are benefiting from the trend. It’s not stocks like the tech stocks that led the way previously which you should be looking at. Where can you find them?Leaning on the Zacks Rank allows you to uncover stocks with the strongest earnings trends. These earnings trends can show you what’s happening beneath the surface of many publicly traded companies. One such stock is today’s Bull of the Day, Archer Daniels Midland.Incorporated in Delaware in 1923, Archer Daniels Midland Company is successor to the Daniels Linseed Co. Founded in 1902, this Illinois-based company is one of the leading producers of food and beverage ingredients as well as goods made from various agricultural products.The company processes oilseeds, corn, wheat, cocoa and other feedstuffs. Moreover, it engages in the manufacturing, sale, and distribution of products like natural flavor ingredients, flavor systems, natural colors, proteins, emulsifiers, soluble fiber, polyols, hydrocolloids, natural health and nutrition products as well as other specialty food and feed ingredients.Archer Daniels Midland is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) which also enjoys a Zacks Value Style Score of A, Growth of A and Momentum of A to help it round out with a VGM Composite Score of A. The reason for the favorable rank is that analysts have been upping the ante for both this year and next year. While EPS growth is currently forecast to come in at 44% this year, there is a contraction for next year. However, over the last 90 days, our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year is up from $6.89 to $7.48 while next year’s number is up from $5.98 to $6.36.Story continuesBear of the Day:Housing has been one of the main benefactors of the inflationary surge. There was a perfect storm which sent parts of the country absolutely through the roof. Now, with interest rates on the rise, some areas of the country are beginning to feel the pinch. The good news for many is that they are locked in very low rates and are in a home they can stay in forever. The bad news is, it could make it tough for new buyers entering the market.Already, we are seeing earnings estimates come down for some of the homebuilders. That is why today’s Bear of the Day is DR Horton. D.R. Horton, Inc., based in Texas, is one of the leading national homebuilders, primarily engaged in the construction and sale of single-family houses both in the entry-level and move-up markets. D.R. Horton’s operations are spread across 106 markets in 33 states in the East, Midwest, Southeast, South Central, Southwest and West regions of the United States. Its houses are sold under the brand names D.R. Horton - America’s Builder, Emerald Homes, Express Homes and Freedom Homes.DR Horton is currently a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Building Products – Home Builders industry which ranks in the Bottom 6% of our Zacks Industry Rank. The reason for the unfavorable rank is that seven analysts have cut their estimates for the current year while four have done so for next year. The impact has cut our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year from $13.42 to $9.33 while next year’s number is off from $13.91 to $9.54.Additional content:UBER Benefits from Favorable Court RulingShares of Uber Technologies have been performing well in the markets lately, gaining 7.2% over the past two trading sessions. The upside can be attributed to a verdict issued by a New York City judge prohibiting pay raises for ride-sharing companies. The hikes were demanded by New York City's Taxi and Limousine Commission.The judge while delivering his verdict against the commission stated that it had used a faulty methodology to calculate the pay hike. The commission had used factors like the last summer’s steep increase in gas prices, which has come down since.The ruling vindicates Uber’s stand. It had sued the commission last month to try to block a significant pay increase for its drivers. Uber found the proposed increases unprecedented.In the lawsuit, Uber had stated last month that in the event of an unfavorable court ruling it would be forced to incur additional monthly cost in the band of $21-$23 million. In turn, Uber would have had to raise fares to drive its bottom line.Given this backdrop, the judge’s ruling has come as a boon for Uber. No wonder, its shares are rising.The ruling, which has prevented labor costs of ride sharing companies from increasing significantly, has also positively impacted the stock price of Uber’s rival Lyft. Shares of Lyft have risen 11.8% over the past two trading days.Following the judge’s ruling, the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which represents 25,000 taxi drivers in the city, tweeted, ""A few missing words in a Statement of Basis and Purpose does not justify denying a raise meant to help thousands of drivers with rent and groceries. Shame on Uber for spending millions on this heartless lawsuit only to deny drivers an increase of $1.66 more on an average trip.""The alliance wants the New York City's Taxi and Limousine Commission to tweak the rules in such a manner that in the future the ruling is in favor of a pay hike for drivers. Consequently, we expect investors to remain glued for further updates on this burning issue.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PickCurrently, Uber carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), while Lyft is Zacks #3 Ranked (Hold).Investors interested in the Internet-Services industry may, however, consider Baidu, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The two major concerns of last year, namely, a 40-year high inflation rate and the Fed’s ultra-hawkish policies in the form of decades high interest rates and tighter monetary control, are persisting in 2023.Peak inflation seems behind us. Less-than-expected inflation rates in October and November with respect to several measures and an unexpected drop in wage rate in December and November have clearly indicated this.The Institute of Supply Management reported that the services sector index for December plummeted to 49.6% from 56.5% in November. The consensus estimate was 55.1%. Any reading below 50% indicates a contraction in services activities. The index contracted for the first time since May 2020, at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.A devastated housing market owing to the high mortgage rate, disappointing retail sales in December, the peak festive season, huge inventory accumulation by several retailers and a sharp fall in U.S. manufacturing activities indicated that the U.S. economy is cooling in the desired direction of the Fed. Several U.S. corporate giants have started retrenching manpower significantly at higher levels.However, Wall Street will remain volatile for at least the first half of this year as the Fed will continue to raise the benchmark interest rate with the terminal rate likely to go beyond 5%. At this stage it will be prudent to invest in stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank with a solid long-term potential.Stock Selection ProcessWe have selected five U.S. corporate giants (market capital &gt; $30 billion) as these companies have stable business model and globally claimed brand value.

95,48216611-9a4f-3b48-bec3-04b827de8982,PM,2023-01-12,3 Tobacco Stocks to Watch on Impressive Industry Trends,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-tobacco-stocks-watch-impressive-141802897.html,1673446682,STORY,"['BATS.L', 'PM', 'TPB', 'BTI', '^GSPC']","[Payers in the Tobacco industry have been benefiting from their strong pricing power, which has been working well amid cost inflation as well as low cigarette volumes. Also, focus on reduced risk products (RRPs) or smoke-free alternatives has been working well for companies, given consumers’ rising health consciousness.While stern government regulations are a limiting factor, the abovementioned upsides and constant innovation bode well for companies like Philip Morris International Inc. PM, British American Tobacco p.l.c. BTI and Turning Point Brands, Inc. TPB.About the Industry The Zacks Tobacco industry includes companies that manufacture and sell cigarettes as well as tobacco and nicotine-based products such as cigars, snuffs and oral tobacco. Some companies also offer reduced-risk products such as e-cigarettes, vaping and heat-not-burn variants. A few of the firms are also engaged in making devices and attachments needed in vaping and heat-not-burn products. Most of the products manufactured by the tobacco industry participants fall under the strict vigilance of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are required to follow the permissible levels of nicotine in manufacturing. Players in this space sell products mostly through large retailers, distributors, convenience stores, drugstores, wholesalers and grocery chains. Additionally, some international tobacco firms operate in the country through subsidiaries.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Tobacco IndustryPricing Power a Key Driver: Industry participants have been gaining from the solid pricing power of tobacco products, which also help them make up for high taxes and sometimes even lower cigarette sales volumes. As smokers don’t mind a price hike due to their addiction, this strategy is likely to keep working for players in the tobacco space. The high pricing of cigarettes has been supporting revenues and operating income of some of the players in the tobacco industry.Story continuesLow-Risk Products Gain Prominence: Low-risk tobacco alternatives, also referred to as next-generation tobacco products, have been gaining immense popularity. Compared to cigarettes, these products are claimed to be less detrimental to health owing to their scientific composition and manner of use. Consumers are increasingly taking to such products in a bid to quit cigarettes. Tobacco biggies have been witnessing substantial revenue growth in the RRPs arena. The companies are making investments to expand in this category, such as undertaking innovations to make these products user-friendly and energy efficient. The performance of tobacco players is expected to continue benefiting from RRPs. That said, the FDA is keeping a close tab on the manufacturing and marketing policies of such items to regulate their usage among the youth.Strict Government Regulations: Cigarette volumes are being affected by strict government regulations pertaining to sales, marketing and manufacturing. Such regulatory norms are imposed due to the health hazards caused by the consumption of nicotine. Some of the guidelines issued by the FDA include the mandatory use of precautionary labels on cigarette packets and self-critical advertisements. Moreover, campaigns against tobacco consumption have led to increased consumer awareness, which has, in turn, resulted in lower smoking rates. Since cigarette sales account for the majority of revenues for companies in the tobacco industry, dwindling sales volumes in this category are a concern.Cost Inflation: An overall inflationary cost scenario has been hurting the performance of many industry players. Companies are witnessing elevated inflation rates due to rising global energy, commodity and food prices due to factors like demand-supply imbalances, labor shortage and the Ukraine war. Apart from these, hurdles in the supply and distribution channels stemming from the pandemic and the Ukraine war have been impacting the availability and cost of certain raw materials. Increased logistic costs remain a concern for a number of companies operating in the space.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Tobacco industry is housed within the broader Zacks sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #35, which places it in the top 14% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates solid near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential.

99,103f5dd8-5112-324a-8f88-235563fe7e25,TDG,2023-01-12,3 Defense Equipment Stocks to Buy Amid Improving Travel Data,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-defense-equipment-stocks-buy-140802567.html,1673446082,STORY,"['BAESY', 'CW', 'TDG', '^GSPC']","[Increasing travel volume, as is evident from increased revenue passenger-kilometers (RPKs) observed in November 2022, is boosting the growth prospects of aerospace-defense equipment stocks. However, COVID-led supply chain disruption might hurt the earnings and cash flows of the industry. Also, a stronger U.S. dollar puts pressure on airlines, which, in turn, may hurt aerospace-defense equipment stocks, particularly those engaged in commercial aerospace. Nevertheless, frequent mergers and acquisitions tend to boost the revenue generation prospects of the industry players. Some key players in this industry that you may keep in your portfolio include TransDigm Group TDG, Bae Systems BAESY and Curtiss-Wright CW.About the IndustryThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense Equipment industry comprises firms that manufacture a wide variety of vital components for the aerospace-defense space, ranging from aerostructures, space shuttles, propulsion systems, aircraft engines, defense electronics, missile and radar systems to flight test equipment, structural adhesives, instrumentation and control systems, communication products and many more. A few of these companies also offer integrated simulation and training services to the U.S. defense force. While the majority of the revenues are generated from the production of the aforementioned accompaniments, the industry players also generate revenues by providing notable aftermarket support and services like maintenance, repair and overhaul activities to aerospace and defense players.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Aerospace-Defense Equipment IndustryNew M&amp;As Instill Hopes: Rising competition has historically prompted industry majors to expand their product lines through small and medium-sized mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) besides the big mergers witnessed in the industry. In October 2022, Heico Corp.’s 3D PLUS subsidiary acquired TRAD SAS, which is a leader in highly specialized field of radiation engineering. Notably, TRAD's services and products are used primarily in the space, nuclear and medical fields. Thus, its acquisition will strengthen Heico’s position in the aeronautic, defense, space and medical markets. Such consolidations should improve economies of scale for the industry as a whole, with the players having access to diversified business models.Recovering Air Traffic View Boosts Prospects: World air travel data, which dwindled at the onset of 2022, thanks to the sporadic outbreak of the Omicron variant, has regained its growth trajectory in the past few months. Per the latest report published by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), revenue passenger-kilometers (RPKs) increased 41.3% year over year in November 2022, continuing the recent trend. As stated by U.S. Travel Association, domestic business travel volume is expected to reach 96% of pre-pandemic levels in 2023. This makes us optimistic about the near-term growth prospects of aerospace-defense equipment industry stocks, especially those engaged in commercial aviation.Unusual Strength of the Dollar Remains a Concern: The accelerated appreciation of the U.S. dollar in 2022 was led by the Russia-Ukraine war. This war, in turn, has been a major catalyst behind the latest inflation surge. A stronger U.S. dollar puts pressure on airlines on top of high inflation and high jet fuel prices. This is because U.S. dollar-denominated costs rise for all businesses whose revenues are in another currency. Thus, an appreciated U.S. dollar value remains a risk for aerospace-defense equipment stocks, particularly the ones in commercial aerospace.Supply Chain Disruption Poses Risk: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented crisis in the aerospace and defense supply chain. Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) need to dramatically scale back their capacity to reflect the new realities of the commercial air travel market. Such OEM rate reductions have been affecting the extended commercial aerospace manufacturing supply chain, which might result in lower earnings and cash flows for the aerospace and defense equipment industry in the near term.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Reflects Bright OutlookThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense Equipment industry is housed within the broader Zacks Aerospace sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #92, which places it in the top 37% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few aerospace-defense equipment stocks that you may want to add to your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Beats S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Aerospace-Defense Equipment industry has outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and its sector over the past year. The stocks in this industry have collectively gained 2.3%, while the Aerospace sector has declined 3.1%. The Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite has dropped 18.8% in the same timeframe.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of trailing 12-month EV/Sales, which is used for valuing capital-intensive stocks like aerospace-defense equipment, the industry is currently trading at 2.50X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 3.19X and the sector’s 2.26X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 2.69X, as low as 2.16X, and at the median of 2.45X, as the charts show below.EV-Sales Ratio TTM3 Aerospace-Defense Equipment Stocks to BuyTransDigm Group: Based in Cleveland, OH, TransDigm Group is a leading global designer, producer and supplier of highly engineered aerospace components used in commercial and military aircraft.  In November 2022, the company announced its fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results.

101,05b0bff4-eaed-3939-82d4-a259d2efdec5,SPG,2023-01-12,"Despite delivering investors losses of 3.1% over the past 5 years, Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG) has been growing its earnings",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/despite-delivering-investors-losses-3-130026096.html,1673528426,STORY,['SPG'],"[While not a mind-blowing move, it is good to see that the Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:SPG) share price has gained 27% in the last three months. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been less than pleasing. You would have done a lot better buying an index fund, since the stock has dropped 26% in that half decade.Although the past week has been more reassuring for shareholders, they're still in the red over the last five years, so let's see if the underlying business has been responsible for the decline. See our latest analysis for Simon Property Group There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.While the share price declined over five years, Simon Property Group actually managed to increase EPS by an average of 1.1% per year. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Or possibly, the market was previously very optimistic, so the stock has disappointed, despite improving EPS.Based on these numbers, we'd venture that the market may have been over-optimistic about forecast growth, half a decade ago. Having said that, we might get a better idea of what's going on with the stock by looking at other metrics.We note that the dividend has fallen in the last five years, so that may have contributed to the share price decline. On top of that, revenue has declined by 3.0% per year over the half decade; that could be a red flag for some investors.The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-and-revenue-growthIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Simon Property Group will earn in the future (free profit forecasts).Story continuesWhat About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Simon Property Group the TSR over the last 5 years was -3.1%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Simon Property Group shareholders are down 21% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 16%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 0.6% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Simon Property Group .There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

In addition to the around 3,200 from Goldman, Morgan Stanley has cut about 2% of its workforce, or 1,600 jobs, a source familiar with the matter said last month, while HSBC is shedding at least 200, sources previously told Reuters.The long-expected jobs cull at Goldman follows a recruitment drive during the pandemic, which saw the bank's total headcount top 49,000.But spiralling inflation and rising geopolitical tensions in the wake of the Ukraine war have led to a sharp decline in some critical investment banking activities, forcing cost-conscious bank bosses to prepare for leaner times.""The series of downsizing at banks have pushed out hundreds of bankers and created even more competition in the local job market,"" Arnaldo Oliveira, founder and chief executive of recruitment firm Orion Executive Search International told Reuters.""Everyone at banks is anxious, no doubt. We have seen bankers at managing director level let go these past few days,"" he said.Some of those affected at Goldman are making contact with executive search firms and investment banking recruitment specialists, one headhunting source with knowledge of the matter said, while others are seeking opportunities on LinkedIn, the online professional networking platform.Story continuesSeth Johnson, an investment banking compliance officer based in Salt Lake City, UT, wrote on LinkedIn: ""My role was among those impacted by Goldman Sachs' large scale reduction today. There are a lot of things I will miss about that role, but I'm optimistic about the next chapter.""Johnson, who was with Goldman Sachs for more than six years, declined to comment.TECH PIVOTAs news of the cuts impacting Goldman rippled across the world on Wednesday, the bank said it recognised the challenges for those moving on.""We know this is a difficult time for people leaving the firm. We're grateful for all our people's contributions, and we're providing support to ease their transitions,"" a memo seen by Reuters and signed by Tony Fratto, the bank's global head of communication, said.The bank declined to comment on dozens of postings on LinkedIn from some of its sacked workers.Oliveira said some bankers who have reached out to recruiters like him are considering ditching investment banking for other positions.""They are even considering opportunities outside of banks such as M&amp;A Advisory and Private Equity space,"" he added.A second London-based investment banking headhunter said having the Goldman Sachs brand on your CV will ""always be helpful"" but senior bankers were likely to find the job hunt more of a challenge.Junior and mid-level bankers have options to pivot to buy-side and tech positions, the headhunter said, while dealmakers with experience in private equity were also considered most in-demand, with that segment of the global mergers and acquisitions sector seen likely to rally first.""I come from a rural family so it has been one roller coaster of a journey, overcoming social and financial restrictions to come here,"" Shilpi Soni, a Dallas-based software engineer who was with the bank for 19 months, wrote on LinkedIn.""Knowing from where I started, being laid off hurts. But, I am still hopeful that this may not be the end of my journey here in the US.""Soni did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Reuters through LinkedIn.(Reporting by Scott Murdoch in Sydney and Selena Li in Hong Kong and Sinead Cruise and Iain Withers in London; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)]"

However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexManaged by Goldman Sachs Funds, GSSC has amassed assets over $455.84 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Style Box - Small Cap Blend. GSSC seeks to match the performance of the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity Index before fees and expenses.The Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity Index is designed to deliver exposure to equity securities of small capitalization U.S. issuers.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.Story continuesAnnual operating expenses for GSSC are 0.20%, which makes it on par with most peer products in the space.GSSC's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 1.25%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsMost ETFs are very transparent products, and disclose their holdings on a daily basis. ETFs also offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, though it's still important for investors to research a fund's holdings.GSSC's heaviest allocation is in the Financials sector, which is about 19.70% of the portfolio. Its Industrials and Information Technology round out the top three.Taking into account individual holdings, Usd U.s. Dollar accounts for about 0.74% of the fund's total assets, followed by Emcor Group Inc (EME) and Atkore Inc (ATKR).The top 10 holdings account for about 3.77% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskYear-to-date, the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity ETF has gained about 4.34% so far, and is down about -11.84% over the last 12 months (as of 01/12/2023). GSSC has traded between $50.18 and $64.87 in this past 52-week period.The ETF has a beta of 0.97 and standard deviation of 30.39% for the trailing three-year period. With about 1261 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesGoldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Small Cap Blend segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) tracks Russell 2000 Index and the iShares Core S&amp;P SmallCap ETF (IJR) tracks S&amp;P SmallCap 600 Index.

(NYSE:AIG) may be sending very bullish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios greater than 15x and even P/E's higher than 30x are not unusual. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so limited.American International Group certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to degrade substantially, which has repressed the P/E. If you like the company, you'd be hoping this isn't the case so that you could potentially pick up some stock while it's out of favour. View our latest analysis for American International Group peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on American International Group will help you uncover what's on the horizon.Is There Any Growth For American International Group?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as depressed as American International Group's is when the company's growth is on track to lag the market decidedly.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 166%. The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 810% in total over the last three years. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Shifting to the future, estimates from the ten analysts covering the company suggest earnings growth is heading into negative territory, declining 20% per year over the next three years. That's not great when the rest of the market is expected to grow by 9.1% each year.In light of this, it's understandable that American International Group's P/E would sit below the majority of other companies. However, shrinking earnings are unlikely to lead to a stable P/E over the longer term. There's potential for the P/E to fall to even lower levels if the company doesn't improve its profitability.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On American International Group's P/EWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.As we suspected, our examination of American International Group's analyst forecasts revealed that its outlook for shrinking earnings is contributing to its low P/E. Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises. It's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.It is also worth noting that we have found 2 warning signs for American International Group (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you need to take into consideration.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.

JBL, PepsiCo, Inc. PEP, DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. DKS, Hologic, Inc. HOLX and Suzano S.A. SUZ.5 Stocks with High ROE to Buy as Rate Hike Fears SubsideThe U.S. equity markets inched up in the past few trading sessions as the December jobs report and contraction in the services sector instilled hopes that inflation was cooling. The latest nonfarm payrolls report showed that the U.S. economy added 223,000 jobs in December compared with broad-based expectations of 200,000 job additions, while wages increased 0.3%, contrary to expectations of a 0.4% rise. The ISM Services index recorded a reading of 49.6% for December, portraying contraction amid a pullback in new orders and production.The economic indicators aroused hopes that the overall economy was contracting enough for the Fed to consider putting the brakes on its aggressive stance against inflation, fueling the stock market rally. Investors widely expect the New Year rally to continue in the short term, with the Fed being more dovish toward the rate hike regime. The Fed had increased its benchmark interest rates by half a percentage point in its last policy meeting to a targeted range between 4.25% and 4.5% and put the “terminal rate” to a target range of 5-5.25%As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return.

The latest nonfarm payrolls report showed that the U.S. economy added 223,000 jobs in December compared with broad-based expectations of 200,000 job additions, while wages increased 0.3%, contrary to expectations of a 0.4% rise. The ISM Services index recorded a reading of 49.6% for December, portraying contraction amid a pullback in new orders and production.The economic indicators aroused hopes that the overall economy was contracting enough for the Fed to consider putting the brakes on its aggressive stance against inflation, fueling the stock market rally. Investors widely expect the New Year rally to continue in the short term, with the Fed being more dovish toward the rate hike regime. The Fed had increased its benchmark interest rates by half a percentage point in its last policy meeting to a targeted range between 4.25% and 4.5% and put the “terminal rate” to a target range of 5-5.25%As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. Jabil Inc. JBL, PepsiCo, Inc. PEP, DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. DKS, Hologic, Inc. HOLX and Suzano S.A. SUZ are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.Why ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company.

It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Story continuesScreening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 16 stocks that qualified the screen:Jabil: Headquartered in St. Petersburg, FL, Jabil is one of the largest global suppliers of electronic manufacturing services.

On that day, Netflix is projected to report earnings of $0.45 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 66.17%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $7.84 billion, up 1.67% from the year-ago period.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Netflix. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends.

To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

But we had a nice pop on Tuesday on a few upgrades. The streaming giant continuing to rule out live sports rights, which dominated television in 2022. They are, however, adding live awards show. So Netflix going all in, whose ratings have just plummeted, what we were just talking about.They signed a multi-year deal to stream the Screen Actors Guild Awards starting in 2024. This year's SAG Awards will air on February 26 and stream live on the Netflix YouTube channel. I certainly don't think that this is going to have a different result. It will be interesting to see maybe if a streamer would have more success with this. I don't know about that, though, Dave.DAVE BRIGGS: Not optimistic. But certainly, the word ""live"" is interesting when you tie it to Netflix because, to your point, they have stayed out of sports. And Ted Sarandos saying, we're not anti-sports, we're just pro-profits. Sports rights are just far too expensive for Netflix. I am interested in how they do producing live events. And this will be the first one that we really get a glimpse at. Chris Rock will have a comedy special on March 4, which will be another.But I think that's-- I think it's a good move because I'd like to see how Netflix produces a live event and how many people tune in. They want people on the platform, more hours. They need that. Again, I'm guessing they didn't pay a whole lot of money for this, and probably some interesting tie-ins with Netflix shows. So perhaps it makes sense.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, well, certainly. It would also be a little bit more of a pressure-off situation in terms of their first live event, comparing that to what Amazon did with ""Thursday Night Football.""DAVE BRIGGS: Yes.SEANA SMITH: So we'll see.]"
116,4c038aef-6a5d-34cf-8465-526f738d6785,NFLX,2023-01-12,Netflix yanks back senior managers’ ability to see their coworkers’ pay,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-yanks-back-senior-managers-210323370.html,1673471003,STORY,['NFLX'],"[Netflix wants you to keep your eyes on your own paper—and not just when it comes to sharing passwords.The streaming giant’s director-level executives—senior managers who are neither C-suite execs nor vice presidents—have long had the ability to see their colleagues’ salaries. Now they’re in the same boat as the rest of us, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.According to the Journal’s sources at Netflix, the walkback stemmed from the vast expansion of director-level hires in recent years, some of whom demanded explanations for their pay discrepancies. Despite rounds of layoffs, Netflix employed 11,300 full-time workers at the end of 2021, representing a nearly 60% headcount growth from 2018.The move comes as an embattled Netflix attempts to tighten its belt after hemorrhaging subscribers in the first half of 2022. The revoke of access, instituted late last year, is a contradictory move by a company that, as the Journal puts it, has heretofore “offered a rare degree of transparency to its workforce.” That was mainly thanks to its co-CEO Reed Hastings, who has said transparency is vital to a healthy company culture.“Transparency has become [our employees’] biggest symbol of how much we trust them to act responsibly,” Hastings wrote in his 2020 book, No Rules Rules. Netflix has historically relied on a laissez-faire approach to leadership and management, he wrote, which necessitated “increasing organizational transparency and eliminating company secrets.”There’s also the fact that Netflix, like many Fortune 500 companies, must comply with new salary transparency requirements in places like Washington, Colorado, California, and New York City. Like many companies, they’ve been taking a backhanded approach, putting enormously wide bands on their job postings. One software engineer job provided a salary range of $90,000 to $900,000.The push and pull of salary transparencyTransparency laws going into effect across the country have breathed new life into the debate about their efficacy. Data suggests the answer is simple. A vast research initiative from University of Utah’s David Eccles School of Business found conclusively that knowing what your coworkers make “substantially reduces the gender pay gap, as well as other forms of pay inequity.”Story continuesWhen institutions increased wage transparency in a centralized way like Netflix did, the Utah researchers saw the gender pay gap close by 50%, and wage adjustment policies “substantially” changed—namely by granting bigger pay increases to historically underpaid groups.Sharing salaries also has the potential to spur collective action. In a study from the Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization, James Flynn, an economics Ph.D. candidate at the University of Colorado, found that workers respond to perceived pay unfairness not by withholding effort—or, to use the term du jour, quiet quitting—but rather by shifting their effort to better align with what pays more.Companies that pay their workers low wages, Flynn writes in his conclusion, “have a strong incentive to keep salary information secret, while higher-paying firms could benefit from policies designed to increase salary transparency.”The kind of “transparency shock” that comes with seeing what your coworkers are paying shouldn’t make anyone nervous—except bosses who know they’re earning inexcusably more than their workers. That may well be the case at Netflix, where Hastings’ total compensation in 2021 exceeded $34 million. (For co-CEO Ted Sarandos, that figure jumped to $40 million.)Despite removing the pay transparency perk, Netflix employees still enjoy more high-level insights than many public companies of similar size, including access to “strategic documents,” the Journal wrote. Netflix didn’t respond to Fortune’s request for comment on what, exactly, those are.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: Air India slammed for ‘systemic failure’ after unruly male passenger flying business class urinated on a woman traveling from New YorkMeghan Markle’s real sin that the British public can’t forgive–and Americans can’t understand‘It just doesn’t work.’ The world’s best restaurant is shutting down as its owner calls the modern fine dining model ‘unsustainable’Bob Iger just put his foot down and told Disney employees to come back into the office]"

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So when we looked at TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX), they do have a high ROCE, but we weren't exactly elated from how returns are trending.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for TJX Companies, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.27 = US$4.6b ÷ (US$28b - US$11b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).Thus, TJX Companies has an ROCE of 27%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Specialty Retail industry average of 17%. See our latest analysis for TJX Companies roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for TJX Companies compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering TJX Companies here  for free.What Can We Tell From TJX Companies' ROCE Trend?In terms of TJX Companies' historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Historically returns on capital were even higher at 46%, but they have dropped over the last five years. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.In Conclusion...Bringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by TJX Companies' reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. Investors must think there's better things to come because the stock has knocked it out of the park, delivering a 128% gain to shareholders who have held over the last five years. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.Story continuesTJX Companies does come with some risks though, we found 2 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those is concerning...TJX Companies is not the only stock earning high returns.

TJX is benefiting from its solid store and e-commerce growth efforts. The leading off-price retailer remains committed to boosting growth through effective marketing initiatives. That being said, The TJX Companies is not immune to the rising inflationary environment.Let’s discuss this in detail.Factors Working in The TJX Companies’ FavorThe TJX Companies is expanding its footprint fast in the United States, Europe, Canada and Australia. During third-quarter fiscal 2023, the company increased its store count by 57 stores to reach 4,793. It increased square footage by 1% quarter over quarter during this time. The TJX Companies has been witnessing solid demand for an in-person shopping experience in the last few years. Its flexible buying supply chain and store formats aid the company in opening stores across a wide customer demographic.With more consumers resorting to online shopping, the company has undertaken several initiatives to boost online sales and strengthen its e-commerce business. We believe that The TJX Companies’ off-price model, strategic store locations, impressive brands and fashion products and efficient supply-chain management will likely aid its performance. In its last earnings call, management highlighted that it is committed to driving traffic and sales in the fiscal fourth quarter. In this regard, it is committed to providing products at great value throughout the store and online.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe TJX Companies is committed to boosting growth through effective marketing initiatives and loyalty programs. The company’s aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns through multiple mediums (TV, radio and social media) are adding growth. To fuel growth, management is on track to attract new shoppers of every age, including many Gen Z and millennial shoppers. Also, its treasure hunt shopping experience is gaining traction among shoppers. The TJX Companies’ gift-giving initiatives, unique among off-price retailers and loyalty card program (which offers consumers a non-credit card choice and soft benefits such as early shopping hours) have helped improve customer engagement.Story continuesHurdles on the WayThe TJX Companies is grappling with increased freight costs. To some extent, the company’s merchandise margin was hurt by incremental freight pressure in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The company also witnessed incremental wage costs, which weighed on the pretax profit margin. The TJX Companies saw additional wage costs of 80 basis points (bps). The company’s fiscal third-quarter gross profit margin was 29.1%, down 0.4 percentage points. In its last earnings call, management highlighted that for modeling purposes, it is currently projecting nearly 130 bps of incremental freight expense and 70 bps of additional wage costs for fiscal 2023.Nevertheless, we believe that the aforementioned upsides will likely help this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company stay afloat amid such hurdles. TJX’s stock has increased 39.8% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 8.7% growth.Solid Retail BetsSome better-ranked stocks are Walmart Inc. WMT, The Kroger Co. KR and Ross Stores Inc.

MSCI's index for Latam currencies gained 1% and regional stocks jumped nearly 2%, outperforming emerging market peers. Colombia's peso rose 1.5% against the dollar as a 3% jump in crude prices supported the oil producer's currency, while Mexico's peso added 0.6%. Top copper producer Chile's peso rose 0.5% with prices of the metal breaking above $9,000 a tonne for the first time since June, while the Peruvian sol was up 0.7% having hit its highest level in more than six months earlier in the session. Peru's Congress approved a confidence vote in the government on Tuesday, supporting the new prime minister and Cabinet amid a political crisis following anti-government protests that have left 40 people dead and hundreds injured. ""The confirmation gives newly minted President (Dina) Boluarte breathing room and allows her to focus on pressing issues such as the second early election vote, which is top order of business after the first vote took place in December,"" Citi strategists wrote in a note to clients. The office of the Andean nation's top prosecutor said it has launched an inquiry into Boluarte and members of her Cabinet over the violent protests. ""Protests are likely to continue in the short term and add pressure to President Boluarte,"" Citi added. Data showed Mexican industrial output was unchanged in November from October but rose 3.2% on an annual basis. Economists, however, expect the sector to be hurt by an economic slowdown in the United States. Mexican stocks jumped nearly 2%. All eyes were on the release of U.S. Consumer Price Index data on Thursday which could sway the Federal Reserve's monetary policy tightening plans. The Brazilian real gained 0.5% after a volatile start to the week. Supporters of far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro stormed the seats of power in Brasilia on Sunday, ransacking the Supreme Court, Congress and presidential offices. Data showing Brazil's retail sales volumes posted their biggest drop in five months in November, affected by higher fuel prices and a weak Black Friday performance, also weighed on the real. Elsewhere in emerging markets, Egypt's pound rebounded after briefly hitting a new low below 32 to the dollar as the Egyptian central bank moved to a more flexible exchange rate under the terms of an International Monetary Fund financial support package.

Markets are betting that easing inflation will eventually push the Fed into pausing its current rate hike cycle.Spot gold was steady around $1,876.41 an ounce, while gold futures were muted at $1,879.50 an ounce by 19:06 ET (00:06 GMT). Both instruments were trading at an eight-month high, after logging a strong start to the year.Bullion prices also benefited from increased safe haven demand, as fears of a recession and bets that the dollar had peaked saw traders seeking gold.But while the yellow metal has recovered sharply from lows hit in 2022, it is still facing an environment where U.S. interest rates are at their highest level since the 2008 financial crisis. This, coupled with uncertainty over where U.S. interest rates will peak, is expected to limit bigger gains in gold in the near-term.While inflation is expected to have eased in December, it is still well above the Fed’s annual target. This has also elicited warnings from Fed members that interest rates could remain higher for longer, keeping metal markets under pressure.Among industrial metals, copper prices inched lower on Thursday, but hovered just below their strongest level since mid-June. The red metal is up nearly 10% so far this year amid increased optimism over an economic reopening in major importer China.Story continuesCopper futures fell 0.1% to $4.1730 a pound in early Asian trade. The metal is also expected to benefit from tighter supplies in the near-term, amid increased disruptions in world no. 2 copper producer Peru, as the country faces politically motivated violence.China, the world's largest copper importer, reopened its borders for the first time in three years this week. But the country's near-term economic outlook remains clouded by an unprecedented spike in COVID-19 cases.Related ArticlesGold hovers below $1,880 as U.S. CPI reading looms, copper upbeatCalifornia is deluged by record rain with more storms comingGM, Ford, Google partner to promote 'virtual' power plants]"

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Right now, Collegium Pharmaceutical is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Zoetis has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that COLL's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.COLL currently has a forward P/E ratio of 4.71, while ZTS has a forward P/E of 28.76. We also note that COLL has a PEG ratio of 0.24. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. ZTS currently has a PEG ratio of 2.65.Another notable valuation metric for COLL is its P/B ratio of 4.92. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ZTS has a P/B of 15.43.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to COLL's Value grade of A and ZTS's Value grade of C.COLL stands above ZTS thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that COLL is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

POST is well-placed on the back of portfolio strength, courtesy of prudent acquisitions. The consumer packaged goods company is benefiting from a recovery in the Foodservice channel. The upsides were seen in its fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 results, with the top and the bottom line increasing year over year and beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has increased 12.8% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 7.3% growth. The stock has comfortably outperformed the Zacks Consumer Staples sector’s 3.8% growth in the period.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Let’s delve deeper.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSolid Q4 Results, Foodservice RecoveryIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, Post Holdings benefited from strategic pricing actions to counter input and freight cost inflation. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 85 cents per share increased significantly from the 11 cents reported in the prior-year quarter. POST registered sales of $1,579.1 million, up 16.5%. The upside can be attributed to pricing actions in every segment and ongoing volume recovery across Foodservice business.Post Holdings is benefiting from strength in the Foodservice business. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, Foodservice sales increased 36.9% to $625.5 million. Revenues reflect the effects of inflation-driven pricing actions, the impact of commodity cost pass-through pricing model and avian influenza-driven pricing efforts. Volumes rose 3.6%. Management highlighted that its Foodservice business has completely recovered from COVID and turned profitable.Acquisitions: Key DriverPost Holdings has been focusing on acquisitions, helping it expand its customer base. On Apr 5, 2022, Post Holdings acquired Lacka Foods Limited. Lacka Foods is a U.K.-based marketer of high-protein, ready-to-drink (RTD) shakes under the UFIT brand. Post Holdings acquired Almark Foods (or Almark) on Feb 1, 2021. Almark, renowned for its hard-cooked and deviled egg products, provides conventional, organic and cage-free products. On Jan 25, Post Holdings acquired the Peter Pan peanut butter brand. On Jul 1, 2020, the company completed the acquisition of Henningsen Foods, Inc., which forms part of its Foodservice segment. In June 2021, the company stated that it had completed the acquisition of the PL RTE Cereal Business of TreeHouse Foods.We believe that, such well-chalked expansion endeavors will likely help POST stay in investors’ good books.Story continuesOther Food Stock Benefiting From BuyoutsSeveral other companies in the food space, like The Kraft Heinz Company KHC, Hormel Foods Corporation HRL and Tyson Foods, Inc. TSN, are benefiting from acquisitions.In April 2022, Kraft Heinz acquired a majority stake in a Brazil-based condiments and sauces company — Companhia Hemmer Industria e Comercio (""Hemmer""). The buyout widened Kraft Heinz's International Taste Elevation platform and enhanced its presence across emerging markets. In January 2022, KHC acquired an 85% stake in Germany-based Just Spices GmbH (“Just Spices”). The buyout enhanced its direct-to-consumer operations and go-to-market expansion.Hormel Foods is strengthening its business through strategic acquisitions. Recently, HRL announced its acquisition of a minority stake in Indonesia-based food and beverage company, PT Garudafood Putra Putri Jaya Tbk. The move is likely to help Hormel Foods to expand its presence in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. In June 2021, HRL acquired the Planters snacking portfolio from Kraft Heinz. Prior to this, it acquired Texas-based pit-smoked meats company Sadler's Smokehouse in March 2020. The buyout was in sync with Hormel Foods’ initiatives to strengthen its position in the foodservice space.Tyson Foods is focused on expanding into international markets as part of its strategic growth plan. In July 2022, TSN announced its strategic partnership with Tanmiah Food Company (Tanmiah) — a leading Middle Eastern provider of fresh and processed poultry, other processed meat products, animal feed and health products.

MSCI's index for Latam currencies gained 1% and regional stocks jumped nearly 2%, outperforming emerging market peers. Colombia's peso rose 1.5% against the dollar as a 3% jump in crude prices supported the oil producer's currency, while Mexico's peso added 0.6%.

Peru's Congress approved a confidence vote in the government on Tuesday, supporting the new prime minister and Cabinet amid a political crisis following anti-government protests that have left 40 people dead and hundreds injured. ""The confirmation gives newly minted President (Dina) Boluarte breathing room and allows her to focus on pressing issues such as the second early election vote, which is top order of business after the first vote took place in December,"" Citi strategists wrote in a note to clients. The office of the Andean nation's top prosecutor said it has launched an inquiry into Boluarte and members of her Cabinet over the violent protests. ""Protests are likely to continue in the short term and add pressure to President Boluarte,"" Citi added. Data showed Mexican industrial output was unchanged in November from October but rose 3.2% on an annual basis. Economists, however, expect the sector to be hurt by an economic slowdown in the United States. Mexican stocks jumped nearly 2%. All eyes were on the release of U.S. Consumer Price Index data on Thursday which could sway the Federal Reserve's monetary policy tightening plans. The Brazilian real gained 0.5% after a volatile start to the week. Supporters of far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro stormed the seats of power in Brasilia on Sunday, ransacking the Supreme Court, Congress and presidential offices. Data showing Brazil's retail sales volumes posted their biggest drop in five months in November, affected by higher fuel prices and a weak Black Friday performance, also weighed on the real. Elsewhere in emerging markets, Egypt's pound rebounded after briefly hitting a new low below 32 to the dollar as the Egyptian central bank moved to a more flexible exchange rate under the terms of an International Monetary Fund financial support package.

Markets are betting that easing inflation will eventually push the Fed into pausing its current rate hike cycle.Spot gold was steady around $1,876.41 an ounce, while gold futures were muted at $1,879.50 an ounce by 19:06 ET (00:06 GMT). Both instruments were trading at an eight-month high, after logging a strong start to the year.Bullion prices also benefited from increased safe haven demand, as fears of a recession and bets that the dollar had peaked saw traders seeking gold.But while the yellow metal has recovered sharply from lows hit in 2022, it is still facing an environment where U.S. interest rates are at their highest level since the 2008 financial crisis. This, coupled with uncertainty over where U.S. interest rates will peak, is expected to limit bigger gains in gold in the near-term.While inflation is expected to have eased in December, it is still well above the Fed’s annual target. This has also elicited warnings from Fed members that interest rates could remain higher for longer, keeping metal markets under pressure.Among industrial metals, copper prices inched lower on Thursday, but hovered just below their strongest level since mid-June. The red metal is up nearly 10% so far this year amid increased optimism over an economic reopening in major importer China.Story continuesCopper futures fell 0.1% to $4.1730 a pound in early Asian trade. The metal is also expected to benefit from tighter supplies in the near-term, amid increased disruptions in world no. 2 copper producer Peru, as the country faces politically motivated violence.China, the world's largest copper importer, reopened its borders for the first time in three years this week.

We already have the chips that they offer, the M1, M2, M1 Pro, and One Max. Those you can find in the Mac and MacBook line of products. They already offer their A15 chips that we have in the current iPhones.The A line of chips has been going on for some time. They're looking at those modems. They're looking at those Bluetooth chips. And now it's the displays. The displays in particular, however, are expected to start on the Apple Watch. And that's pretty much a smaller platform for them to get started on. According to this report, they're going to be using a type of technology called micro-LED. They currently use OLED technology on both their smartwatches and their smartphones. That's really just a great kind of tech overall. My TV's got it, so it's awesome.Basically means better colors, as well as deeper blacks. LCD technology, the kind that you have or regular LED technology that you have on your average laptop display, is not as good as far as colors go, but is brighter. Now this micro-LED technology kind of takes the best of both worlds. It's bright and offers those great colors. So it'll be interesting to see what this looks like on a watch and a smartphone down the line.But as I said, this is all part of that strategy of trying to bring everything in-house. Tim Cook is the architect of their supply chain, as we see it now. He started laying that out prior to being CEO. And so we can expect him to continue to make moves like this. It just depends on where else we could see it.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Absolutely. We'll be keeping an eye on that. A big thanks, Dan Howley there reporting for us.]"

(NASDAQ:EXPE) have mostly recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Moreover, analysts are expecting further growth in the near future, with Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN) projecting a three-to-five-year earnings per share growth rate of 52% and a forward price-earnings ratio of 11.9.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with EXPE. Click here to check it out. List of 52-Week LowsList of 3-Year LowsList of 5-Year LowsThe stock price, on the other hand, has headed in the opposite direction. Investors had bid the stock up to unusually high valuation levels in 2021 through early 2022 on anticipation of the rebound in travel demand following the lifting of pandemic restrictions, and when stocks began struggling as inflation and interest rates soared, Expedia was pulled back down to earth.Expedia: Good Value at a High CostNow that the stock is trading around pre-pandemic earnings and price levels, does it represent good value for investors? Based on earnings projections, it looks dirt cheap, but when we inspect the companys financials, several red flags emerge that have the potential to drag down the stocks per-share value in the coming years.Contending with higher debtOne thing that has reduced the value of Expedias shares over the years is debt. While this problem was exacerbated due to the slump in travel demand caused by Covid-19, Expedia has actually been taking on increasing levels of debt for longer than that, as shown in the chart below:Expedia: Good Value at a High CostThe core of the problem is the company is not earning enough on its borrowed funds to make up for the cost of borrowing said funds in the first place. The return on invested capital has been below the weighted average cost of capital for most of the companys history, indicating value destruction.Expedia: Good Value at a High CostOne positive is that, due to improvements in operating income, the company has been able to maintain an adequate interest coverage ratio. The Piotroski F-Score of 7 out of 9 indicates a healthy financial situation overall, even though the financials have deteriorated.Story continuesStock-based compensation weighing inAnother issue to consider is that Expedias stock-based compensation is rather high and the company doesnt make up for it with share repurchases, either. The three-year share buyback ratio of -1.9% means the company is issuing more share than it buys back.Expedia: Good Value at a High CostWhile high levels of stock-based compensation are great for the companys top executives and can help retain talent, they are something investors need to watch out for because they dilute shareholder value via a combination of new share issuances and money going toward buybacks when it could have gone toward growing the company instead.Are growth projections overblown?To recap, Expedias earnings and share price are at approximately the same levels as they were before Covid as of this writing, but debt, stock-based compensation and built-in value destruction mean shares are worth less than they were back then. Since thats the case, the only hope for shareholders is that future growth can make up the difference.Are growth projections overblown, though? Yes and no. Since the company recorded a GAAP loss per share of $1.80 last year, the expected return to positive territory for full-year 2022 would be a huge boost. Excluding this return to profitability from calculations, the projected future growth rate according to Morningstar estimates should come closer to 38%.If the company can truly achieve this kind of earnings growth, and if the U.S. manages to get inflation under control, allowing for a lower discount rate, the GuruFocus discounted cash flow calculator estimates the stock could be fairly valued at current levels:Expedia: Good Value at a High CostTakeawayMy first thought upon seeing that Expedias stock had fallen to pre-Covid levels despite earnings recovery and strong growth projections was that the stock must surely be undervalued. However, after taking a closer look at the companys financials, I no longer think thats the case.The company will need to achieve a fairly high growth rate in order to be worth its current valuation, and while its earnings history shows this should be feasible in times where economic growth is strong, theres also the business models baked-in shareholder value destruction to consider. This isnt something that investors want to see in a risk-off market, even if it may be overlooked in a bull market.Speaking of the current risk-off market, some might say we are still overdue for a recession due to the aftereffects of extreme monetary stimulus measures in 2020 and 2021. The Federal Reserve has been slowly hiking interest rates, but it still hasnt managed to bring inflation down to a manageable level yet. Even if we dont have a pronounced recession, a period of slow growth will likely be needed at the very least to keep the economy healthy in the long run.Overall, I find myself agreeing with the GF Value chart on Expedia. The GF Value chart rates the stock as a possible value trap. While it seems cheap compared to historical valuation levels, past returns and analysts estimates of future business performance, there are too many indicators of worsening financials that could impact shareholder value.Expedia: Good Value at a High CostThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Analyst Jed Kelly making the case that the stock's current price does not reflect improvements that Expedia has made to its platform. Shares have dropped about 50% over the past year. Earlier this month, BTIG in naming Expedia its top pick for the first half of 2023. All of this, I think, points to the fact that the travel industry appears to be, at least from these early readings on Expedia stock, that it's going to be healthy. And maybe consumers won't be pulling back their spending as much as we had feared in the first couple of months of the year.- Interesting to see investors jump on Expedia there. But when you take a closer look at the note, Bookings was also highlighted as the top pick in the internet sector-- sorry, in the online travel sector. From that note, Bookings not really moving much on the day, though. So I think maybe, Shanna, just investors more excited about the upside in Expedia, Bookings, and stock that are over to $2,000 a share. So probably just a bit of a difference there.]"

The firm raised its price target on NVR shares to $5,500 from $4,900.“Homebuilder stocks underperformed in 2022 as mortgages rates spiked to 7% from 3% and demand deteriorated in the second half of the year,” Jadrosich wrote. “In 2023, we are cautious on housing demand especially in 1H [first half of the year], but we see a more favorable setup for homebuilder stock performance for a few reasons.”Those reasons, Jadrosich explained to investors, are homebuilder valuations which have already priced in weak demand and home price depreciation, and mortgage rates that have waned from peak levels and are poised to move lower this year.Additionally, Jadrosich sees no material risk to book value as most of the land on homebuilder balance sheets was purchased prior to 2021, adding: ""We expect a home price correction (down 10%) rather than a crash (down 15-20%).""Lastly, he explained that builder margins will benefit from lower input costs.Still, Bank of America notes the outlook remains murky for the housing sector as demand and builder valuations have already hit recessionary levels.The Federal Reserve’s aggressive tightening campaign to cool inflation has had an outsize impact on the housing market in 2022. With borrowing costs nearly doubling from the start of last year, similar themes will likely continue this year, Jadrosich warned.Story continuesAffordability also remains near record lows, existing homeowners will remain locked into their current homes at low rates, builders will have to increase incentives and cut prices to drive orders, and new home inventory will be elevated.Moreover, tech-leveraged housing markets in areas like the West Coast, Mountain West, and Austin will likely underperform, in Jadrosich’s view.Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

(PHM) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-pultegroup-inc-140002438.html,1673445602,STORY,['PHM'],"[PulteGroup (PHM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this homebuilder have returned +5.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, which PulteGroup falls in, has gained 8.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $2.90 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.14 points to a change of +38.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.05 indicates a change of -30.5% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, PulteGroup is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PHM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate of $4.6 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +5.6%. The $15.66 billion and $14.53 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +12.5% and -7.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPulteGroup reported revenues of $3.94 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.4%. EPS of $2.69 for the same period compares with $1.82 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.49%. The EPS surprise was -1.47%.Over the last four quarters, PulteGroup surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PulteGroup is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PulteGroup. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The first nine months were tough, however, so for all of 2022, BA returned -6% versus -19% for the S&amp;P 500, noted the analyst.The analyst attributes the Q4 rally to a well-orchestrated Investor Day in early November and strong Q4 deliveries that should lead to strong cash flow in the period when BA reports on January 25.The extensions Congress granted for MAX 7 and 10 cockpit certification and large orders from United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: UAL) and Air India have also helped BA in recent months, along with a general improvement in risk sentiment, said the analyst.Q4 deliveries leave Boeing well-positioned to meet or exceed its 4Q22 Free Cash Flow guide of about $2.5 billion, the analyst cited.At the higher end of guidance for 70-80 787 deliveries in 2023, Boeing would be delivering an incremental ~50 units y/y, said the analyst.This, the analyst thinks, might provide $4.5b of incremental cash receipts, partially offset by late delivery penalties and incremental production costs, though low production rates should keep the latter in check.Also Read: Airbus Beats Boeing's Annual Plane Delivery Tally, Fourth Time In A RowPrice Action: BA shares are trading higher by 0.51% at $207.61 on the last check Wednesday.Photo Via CompanyLatest Ratings for BADateFirmActionFromToMar 2022Cowen &amp; Co.MaintainsOutperformJan 2022JefferiesMaintainsBuyJan 2022Morgan StanleyMaintainsOverweightView More Analyst Ratings for BAView the Latest Analyst RatingsDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

It is expected to impose the fine on Illumina in the coming months, the sources said.Illumina has already challenged the EU's veto, the EU decision to examine the case despite the deal not meeting the EU turnover threshold for scrutiny and the EU order to keep Grail separate so that it can unwind the takeover.(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Alexander Smith)]"

The stock lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 1.29%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.8%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 10.96%.Heading into today, shares of the technology platform and digital payments company had gained 5.73% over the past month, outpacing the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 2% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 0.23% in that time.Paypal will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. On that day, Paypal is projected to report earnings of $1.19 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 7.21%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $7.39 billion, up 6.85% from the year-ago period.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Paypal. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Paypal (PYPL) earns a Zacks Rank #3 27 days from its next quarterly earnings release on February 7, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.23 a share.Paypal's Earnings ESP sits at 3.6%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.23 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19.PYPL is part of a big group of Computer and Technology stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Analog Devices (ADI) as well.Analog Devices is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on February 15, 2023. ADI's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.67 a share 35 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analog Devices is $2.59, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 2.99%.Story continuesPYPL and ADI's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The temporary grounding sparked widespread flight delays, with U.S. departures halted until 9 a.m. ET. More than 21,000 flights were on the docket today, with at least 4,500 of those encountering either delays or cancellations.In the early morning hours, the White House announced that President Biden was briefed by the Secretary of Transportation on the massive FAA outage. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre posted on social media that “there is no evidence of a cyberattack at this point, but the President has directed the Department of Transportation to conduct a full investigation into the causes.”The national system that experienced an outage – known as Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) – is essential to pilots and flight personnel, according to the FAA. Pilots typically use the NOTAM system for up-to-date information on flight hazards and restrictions. The system appears to have been restored after the technical outage, allowing departures to resume.Apart from the major news, not many people have been talking about airlines from an investment standpoint.

In terms of what we're looking for stocks, as we just talked about with our last guest, really, a lot of investor focus is on tomorrow and tomorrow morning's CPI data.Ahead of that, though, it does look like we are seeing some early gains for stocks this morning. So kind of this upward momentum that we've seen to start the year. The NASDAQ going into today's session with three up days in a row. So if it rises today, this could be a four-day winning streak for the NASDAQ, an index that sorely needs it, of course, if you're a bull.BRIAN SOZZI: And Bath Beyond leading the market higher there, Brad. Party City, too, really powering that rally.JULIE HYMAN: Eh, I wouldn't go quite that far.BRIAN SOZZI: OK.BRAD SMITH: Green, we'll leave it at that. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, so that also seeing some green on the screen. It's up by about 4/10 of a percent. Net positive for the past three days, up by about 6/10 of a percent there. NASDAQ composite, tech-heavy average out of the gate, you're seeing that higher there on your screen by about half a percent. Past three days has been pretty good as well. That's up a little more than 2%. 2.2%, we'll round that off to and be generous. And then the S&amp;P 500, you're seeing that higher by about half a percent. Three-day period, 1.1% in gains there.Let's take a look at some of the sector activity out of the gate this morning. You've got every S&amp;P 500 sector, all 11 of them, call them green in positive territory. Real estate actually leading the charge here on the day. It's up by about 1.4% early in trade. The materials sector also, that's one of the bigger gainers on the day. That's up by about 1%, energy up 1%. And then all of the other 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors in the green, too.Story continuesAnd then additionally, I just wanted to check in on some of those travel names, given the alerts and notification that came across earlier this morning. And it seems like some of those issues have now started to be abated. And we're just keeping a close eye on some of the airliners here on the day. You've got Delta Airlines, United Airlines, and American Airlines, all in negative territory right now. Also seeing if I can see some LUV here on the screen. That's down by about 1.7% for Southwest Airlines. So we'll keep close tabs on some of those airline operators, given the NOTAM, which is probably a new acronym that many of us will remember for at least the next 24 hours.JULIE HYMAN: Yes, and-- or until we get on a flight again. And just a couple of updates from the Federal Aviation Administration, they say normal air traffic operations are resuming. The ground stop has been lifted, and they're continuing to look into the cause of the initial problem.And I'm also seeing some headlines that the Senate Commerce Committee chair, Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, says that the commerce committee will investigate the cause of the FAA computer system outage that triggered those delays this morning. So-- because we don't know why it happened. Was it just, as we talked about with some guests at the top of the show, that they're old systems that need to be updated? Is it that there was something more nefarious going on? We just don't have that information right now.BRAD SMITH: Well, in which case, it comes back to an allocation of funds in order for them to spend necessarily, in which case some lawmakers might need to just go look in the mirror, honestly.JULIE HYMAN: Right, well, and Mike Boyd was also talking about expertise at the FAA. So that might be part of it.]"

The bank initially announced in August 2021 a commitment of $20 billion over five years in support of environmental finance.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 18, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.95 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +7.3%.Revenues are expected to be $5.69 billion, up 11% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.62% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc?For The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.58%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc would post earnings of $3.66 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.78, delivering a surprise of +3.28%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerJPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM), another stock in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $3.11 for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -6.6%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $33.95 billion, up 16.1% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. has been revised 0.8% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.16%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With consistently low prices, plus coupons and other sales regularly available, it's easy to leave these stores feeling like you got a good deal. However, many big-box stores get you to spend more than you intend to -- or should -- with their secret money traps.See Our List: 100 Most Influential Money ExpertsMore: How To Get Free Gift Cards From Your Everyday PurchasesMake sure you know how to spot these 25 money traps before you open your wallet at checkout.Shutterstock.comPerishable Bulk ItemsBuying bulk items that will expire before you use them is one of the biggest money traps you can fall into when shopping at warehouse stores, said Alice Gerwat, senior content editor at Magic Freebies.""Even if you have the storage space for a large quantity of something, this doesn't mean that you'll definitely be able to get through it all, and you may end up chucking food or toiletries away because they go off before you can use them up,"" she said. ""This is particularly lucrative for big box stores with fresh food that goes off pretty quickly, because you'll feel compelled to come back and buy a big expensive bulk pack all over again.""Take Our Poll: How Long Do You Think It Will Take You To Pay Off Your Credit Card Debt?tdub303 / Getty ImagesDiscounts on Brand-Name ItemsJust because brand-name items are discounted at warehouse stores like Costco and Sam's Club, it doesn't mean it's the best deal you can get in the store.""These stores offer great deals on big-name brands, which can make it seem worthwhile, but it's often still better value to purchase their own brand items,"" Gerwat said. ""These items are often of the same quality but with a much lower price tag, so don't be fooled by big discounts on household names. This is especially true for alcohol.""Aja Koska / Getty ImagesBOGO Deals""Many times stores will advertise something as buy-one-get-one-free, but you don't always have to buy both,"" said Julie Ramhold, consumer analyst with DealNews.com. ""While some stores will require that you buy two to get the price, others will basically just cut the price on the item in half, no matter how many you get. Be sure to check the label and the store's policy before stocking up.""Story continuesShutterstock.comFree SamplesCostco is famous for its plethora of free samples. And even though they're free, this is actually another money trap. That cheesecake or meatball you tasted might be so good that you add it to your cart -- even though you had no plans to buy it before tasting it. Avoid the samples to resist this spending temptation.Techa Tungateja / Getty Images/iStockphotoSale Items That You Can Buy for a Lower Price ElsewhereIf you spot something marked down at a big-box store -- like a rollback at Walmart -- your immediate reaction is that this is a good deal. However, it's important to take the time to do a quick price comparison search on your smartphone to see if you can actually get it cheaper elsewhere.Trong Nguyen / Shutterstock.comPaying For a Membership That You Never UseIf you're paying for a membership at Sam's Club or Costco but you never actually go, you're throwing that membership fee away. Make sure you shop at the store often enough to make your membership worth it; otherwise, cancel it.Shutterstock.comInexpensive EyewearWarehouse clubs often sell glasses and lenses for less than other places, but sometimes you really do get what you pay for. Since this is an item you'll be using every day, make sure you're not sacrificing quality to save a few bucks.Shutterstock.comStore Credit Card OffersThe cashier might tempt you to open a store credit card at the checkout with an attractive sign-up offer, but make sure you know what you're really signing up for before applying. Retail cards tend to have higher annual percentage rates than traditional credit cards.Target's RedCard has an APR of 22.90%, and the Walmart Rewards Card has a 17.99% to 26.99% variable APR.97 / Getty ImagesShiny New Electronics at the Front of the StoreWarehouse clubs often put the latest TVs, electronics and other tempting tech right by the entrance. Maybe a new TV wasn't on your list, but if you are met with it first thing, you might be tempted to buy it. Don't fall for this trap.Shutterstock.com'Open the Wallet' PricingRetailers like Target and Walmart often stock the entrance with inexpensive seasonal items. These are usually things you don't need, but the visual appeal and low prices can tempt you to add these items to your shopping cart. Once you do, you might feel like since you got such a good deal, you can spend more on other stuff inside the store.Shutterstock.comFull-Price Seasonal ItemsThese seasonal items are really two traps in one. Target and Walmart will place their attractive seasonal merchandise at the front of the store a month or two before the season or holiday has actually begun, selling them to you at full price. If you wait until the end of the season or the day or two after the holiday, all of these items will be heavily discounted.QualityHD / Shutterstock.comCenter Aisles Filled With Things You Don't NeedCostco will often place essential items in outside aisles, and pack the center aisles with things you probably don't need -- but might want if you see. Avoid this money trap by only shopping the exterior of the store. Stick to your list if you have to venture to the center.Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comPsychologically Appealing SignageDon't be fooled into buying something you don't need just because you see a sign designating a ""limited time offer"" or a ""new low price.""According to Wise Bread, ""in many cases, the price of a 'limited time offer' is the same price the item has been for months, and the 'new low price' is simply the introductory price of a product."" Walmart famously puts ""everyday low price"" signs everywhere to make you think you're getting deals on regular-priced items.Do a quick Google of the item on your phone to see if these signs are really denoting a good deal or simply tempting you to buy.Nicole Glass Photography / Shutterstock.comHigh-Low PricingBed Bath &amp; Beyond and Kohl's seem to always have coupons available as well as ""sale prices"" on most items. You might think this means that you're always getting a good deal at these stores, but this is actually another money trap.According to Wise Bread, these retailers ""sell very little at full-retail, and at the same time, they give consumers the perception that they're scoring a great deal by issuing coupons and limited-time discounts. So in essence, the sale price becomes the everyday price and shoppers need to keep this in mind when price comparing."" Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.comDecoy PricingBest Buy often puts the most expensive items at the front of the store. For example, they'll put $3,000 HDTVs at the front, with cheaper model TVs toward the back. This way when you get to the cheaper TVs, you'll consider them to be a good deal. This is known as ""decoy pricing,"" according to Wise Bread.ZikG / Shutterstock.comGiant Shopping CartsMany big-box stores have oversized shopping carts so that no matter how much stuff you put in it, it doesn't actually look full. This can trick you into thinking you have less stuff in your cart than you actually do and tempt you to continue adding more items.Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.comOdd-Even PricingWalmart and other big-box stores employ a tactic called ""odd-even pricing"" to make you think an item costs less than it actually does, Business Insider reported. For example, if something costs $9.73, your mind quickly reads it as costing $9, when really it costs close to $10.Shutterstock.comGrouping Clusters of Related Products TogetherPerhaps you went to a big-box store to buy a single item, like a new camping tent. Because these stores are huge, they can stock up with tons of tempting items around every turn, so when you go to the aisle that sells tents, you'll also find other camping supplies like sleeping bags and fishing rods. Even if you didn't intend to buy these items, when you see them, you might just add them to your cart.Shutterstock.comCatchy TunesIt might be embarrassing, but we've probably all caught ourselves singing along to the music at a big-box store at one time or another. The music is intentionally catchy, Business Insider reported. The playlists are carefully curated to make you want to stay in the store longer, tempting you to keep shopping and spending more money.Charday Penn / Getty Images/iStockphotoExpensive Items at Eye LevelThe best bargains are usually found on upper and lower shelves. Retailers will place higher-priced items at eye level, where they know you're inclined to look first. Do a quick glance up and down the shelves before falling for this money trap.Shutterstock.comGift SetsEspecially around the holidays, stores like Walmart and Target will display appealing gift sets. Perhaps you wanted to give someone new lotion as a gift, but spot a beautifully packaged lotion and hand soap gift set that undoubtedly costs more than just the lotion alone. Sometimes the items in the set really do cost less when bought together, but other times this is just another way to upsell you.WalmartOdds and Ends at CheckoutStores like Target stock their checkout area with items like gum, batteries and snacks, and when you're waiting in line, your eyes are naturally drawn to these items. Before throwing any of them in your shopping cart, ask yourself if it's something you actually need.Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com'Free' ShippingWhen you're shopping at a big-box store online, you might go to check out, only to find out that you haven't met the minimum spend requirement to qualify for free shipping. Before you add things you don't need to your cart just to avoid shipping costs, consider using the pick up in-store option instead.

Morgan Healthcare Conference on January 11, 2023.Financial and Operational HighlightsFourth quarter 2022 worldwide da Vinci procedures grew approximately 18% compared with the fourth quarter of 2021. The fourth quarter of 2022 reflected a resurgence in COVID-19 in China, which negatively impacted procedure volumes in the region. The fourth quarter of 2021 reflected COVID-19 disruptions later in the quarter in the U.S. and Europe, which also impacted the Company’s procedures.

The unaudited results in this press release are preliminary and subject to the completion of the Company’s final closing procedures and annual independent audit and, therefore, are subject to adjustment.Story continuesPreliminary fourth quarter 2022 instruments and accessories revenue increased by 12% to approximately $941 million, compared with $843 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily driven by growth in da Vinci procedure volume, partially offset by customer buying patterns and foreign currency impacts. Preliminary full year 2022 instruments and accessories revenue increased by 13% to approximately $3.52 billion, compared with $3.10 billion for 2021, primarily driven by growth in da Vinci procedure volume, partially offset by foreign currency impacts and customer buying patterns in 2022 and the benefit of stocking orders in 2021 associated with the launch of the Company’s Extended Use Program.Fourth quarter 2022 da Vinci procedures increased approximately 18% compared with the fourth quarter of 2021. In 2022, approximately 1,875,000 surgical procedures were performed with da Vinci Surgical Systems, an increase of approximately 18% compared with approximately 1,594,000 surgical procedures performed with da Vinci Surgical Systems in 2021. The growth in the Company’s overall procedure volume in 2022 was primarily driven by growth in U.S. general surgery procedures and outside of the U.S. cancer procedures.

During the second half of 2022, the Company saw COVID-19 resurgences impact da Vinci procedure volumes in China.

238,40b454f2-8a07-3afd-9390-4dc0ad6d2d45,ROST,2023-01-12,Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why Ross Stores (ROST) is a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-top-momentum-pick-why-170005807.html,1673456405,STORY,['ROST'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Ross Stores (ROST), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Ross Stores currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if ROST is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this discount retailer holds up.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor ROST, shares are up 4.74% over the past week while the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry is up 4.33% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 1.92% compares favorably with the industry's 2.31% performance as well.Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of Ross Stores have increased 41.49% over the past quarter, and have gained 12.03% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 8.98% and -14.65%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to ROST's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. ROST is currently averaging 1,987,434 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with ROST.Over the past two months, 9 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost ROST's consensus estimate, increasing from $3.99 to $4.30 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 8 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that ROST is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Ross Stores on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

During third-quarter fiscal 2023, the company increased its store count by 57 stores to reach 4,793. It increased square footage by 1% quarter over quarter during this time. The TJX Companies has been witnessing solid demand for an in-person shopping experience in the last few years. Its flexible buying supply chain and store formats aid the company in opening stores across a wide customer demographic.With more consumers resorting to online shopping, the company has undertaken several initiatives to boost online sales and strengthen its e-commerce business. We believe that The TJX Companies’ off-price model, strategic store locations, impressive brands and fashion products and efficient supply-chain management will likely aid its performance. In its last earnings call, management highlighted that it is committed to driving traffic and sales in the fiscal fourth quarter. In this regard, it is committed to providing products at great value throughout the store and online.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe TJX Companies is committed to boosting growth through effective marketing initiatives and loyalty programs. The company’s aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns through multiple mediums (TV, radio and social media) are adding growth. To fuel growth, management is on track to attract new shoppers of every age, including many Gen Z and millennial shoppers. Also, its treasure hunt shopping experience is gaining traction among shoppers. The TJX Companies’ gift-giving initiatives, unique among off-price retailers and loyalty card program (which offers consumers a non-credit card choice and soft benefits such as early shopping hours) have helped improve customer engagement.Story continuesHurdles on the WayThe TJX Companies is grappling with increased freight costs. To some extent, the company’s merchandise margin was hurt by incremental freight pressure in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The company also witnessed incremental wage costs, which weighed on the pretax profit margin. The TJX Companies saw additional wage costs of 80 basis points (bps). The company’s fiscal third-quarter gross profit margin was 29.1%, down 0.4 percentage points. In its last earnings call, management highlighted that for modeling purposes, it is currently projecting nearly 130 bps of incremental freight expense and 70 bps of additional wage costs for fiscal 2023.Nevertheless, we believe that the aforementioned upsides will likely help this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company stay afloat amid such hurdles. TJX’s stock has increased 39.8% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 8.7% growth.Solid Retail BetsSome better-ranked stocks are Walmart Inc. WMT, The Kroger Co. KR and Ross Stores Inc.

BBBY has continued its dry spell with dismal third-quarter fiscal 2022 results. Both top and bottom lines not only missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but also declined year over year. Although the company made efforts to change the assortment, and other merchandising and marketing strategies, inventory constraints acted as headwinds.The home goods retailer is reeling under dwindling cash position as suppliers demanded stringent payment terms right before the pivotal holiday shopping season. Also, fewer products on its shelves led to reduced customer traffic.Management noted that it intends to lay off more employees to reduce costs. Earlier, it announced to close 150 stores and lay off 20% of its corporate and supply-chain workforce. Also, the company failed to convince bondholders to swap out their investments for new debt.In a recent development, BBBY revealed that it is exploring options, including bankruptcy, after continuous weak sales performance. That said, the company is leaving no stone unturned to increase in-stock levels to meet demand via using liquidity it gained from holiday sales. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Consequently, shares of the company have plunged 59.1% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 17.9%. However, shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company moved up nearly 28% after the close of the trading session on Jan 10. This might be due to rumors of its bankruptcy, which makes it a potential acquisition target.Q3 in DetailBed Bath &amp; Beyond reported an adjusted loss of $3.65 per share in the fiscal third quarter compared with a loss of 25 cents in the year-ago quarter. The figure was also wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $2.36.Net sales of $1,259 million declined 33% year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,379 million.

Also, the adjusted gross margin contracted 1310 basis points (bps) to 22.8% due to the adverse impacts of Owned Brands’ clearance activity and higher promotional.SG&amp;A expenses slumped 16.3% to $583.6 million in the reported quarter, driven by cost optimization plans. SG&amp;A expenses, as a percentage of sales, expanded 1070 bps year over year to 46.3%. The company is on track to meet its target of a SG&amp;A expense reduction of $250 million.Adjusted EBITDA was loss of $225 million against earnings of $40.6 million reported in the year-ago period.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Paypal (PYPL) earns a Zacks Rank #3 27 days from its next quarterly earnings release on February 7, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.23 a share.Paypal's Earnings ESP sits at 3.6%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.23 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19.PYPL is part of a big group of Computer and Technology stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Analog Devices (ADI) as well.Analog Devices is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on February 15, 2023. ADI's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.67 a share 35 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analog Devices is $2.59, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 2.99%.Story continuesPYPL and ADI's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

In that report, analysts expect Visa to post earnings of $2 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 10.5%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $7.66 billion, up 8.51% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $8.28 per share and revenue of $31.73 billion. These totals would mark changes of +10.4% and +8.26%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Visa. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum.

It is worth considering Visa (V), which belongs to the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry.This global payments processor has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 8.78%.For the last reported quarter, Visa came out with earnings of $1.93 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.86 per share, representing a surprise of 3.76%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.74 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.98 per share, delivering a surprise of 13.79%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Visa. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Visa has an Earnings ESP of +0.21% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on January 26, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

The government on Tuesday called the contract invalid, whereas First Quantum asserts the contract remains valid.But the company must still make a $375 million payment to the government for its 2022 operations, even when it was operating without a contract, Minister Federico Alfaro told Reuters.The company has until this Friday to appeal the order, said Alfaro, who has been leading negotiations with First Quantum. His ministry will then review any appeals before the 10-day period formally begins, he added, but declined to provide a specific deadline.The lucrative copper mine is an important asset for both sides of the dispute, as a major source of earnings for the company as well as accounting for about 3.5% of Panama's economy.Contract termination terms are among the sticking points to reach an agreement, the minister said. He noted the company is asking the government to pay 85% of the mine's fair market value in the event of termination.Responding to a request for comment, a First Quantum spokesperson pointed to remarks by CEO Tristan Pascall on Tuesday that did not detail any company proposal if its mine is terminated.Pascall instead emphasized his readiness to agree to, and even exceed, government demands on environmental and labor standards as well as revenues in a new contract.The government hopes to reach a deal with the firm via regular meetings with First Quantum representatives, said Alfaro.Story continuesSince last month, both parties are in arbitration, with Alfaro expressing confidence as talks continue.""We're in the best position to defend the interests of the state as has been done in other arbitration processes between private companies and the government,"" he said.

The government on Tuesday called the contract invalid, whereas First Quantum asserts the contract remains valid.But the company must still make a $375 million payment to the government for its 2022 operations, even when it was operating without a contract, Minister Federico Alfaro told Reuters.The company has until this Friday to appeal the order, said Alfaro, who has been leading negotiations with First Quantum. His ministry will then review any appeals before the 10-day period formally begins, he added, but declined to provide a specific deadline.The lucrative copper mine is an important asset for both sides of the dispute, as a major source of earnings for the company as well as accounting for about 3.5% of Panama's economy.Contract termination terms are among the sticking points to reach an agreement, the minister said. He noted the company is asking the government to pay 85% of the mine's fair market value in the event of termination.Responding to a request for comment, a First Quantum spokesperson pointed to remarks by CEO Tristan Pascall on Tuesday that did not detail any company proposal if its mine is terminated.Pascall instead emphasized his readiness to agree to, and even exceed, government demands on environmental and labor standards as well as revenues in a new contract.The government hopes to reach a deal with the firm via regular meetings with First Quantum representatives, said Alfaro.Since last month, both parties are in arbitration, with Alfaro expressing confidence as talks continue.Story continues""We're in the best position to defend the interests of the state as has been done in other arbitration processes between private companies and the government,"" he said. ""We're ready.""But the minister stressed that his preferred outcome is to reach a deal before the 90-day cooling period ends, as stipulated in the arbitration under a Canada-Panama trade pact.Alfaro also noted that the government is prepared in the event no new deal is reached with the miner, noting that lawyers and other international experts have been proactively hired ""to contemplate all options.""(This story has been refiled to delete the third paragraph, which was a repetition of a phrase in the second paragraph)(Reporting by Valentine Hilaire; Editing by David Alire Garcia and Christopher Cushing)]"

MSCI's index for Latam currencies gained 1% and regional stocks jumped nearly 2%, outperforming emerging market peers.

""Protests are likely to continue in the short term and add pressure to President Boluarte,"" Citi added. Data showed Mexican industrial output was unchanged in November from October but rose 3.2% on an annual basis. Economists, however, expect the sector to be hurt by an economic slowdown in the United States. Mexican stocks jumped nearly 2%. All eyes were on the release of U.S. Consumer Price Index data on Thursday which could sway the Federal Reserve's monetary policy tightening plans. The Brazilian real gained 0.5% after a volatile start to the week. Supporters of far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro stormed the seats of power in Brasilia on Sunday, ransacking the Supreme Court, Congress and presidential offices. Data showing Brazil's retail sales volumes posted their biggest drop in five months in November, affected by higher fuel prices and a weak Black Friday performance, also weighed on the real.

Markets are betting that easing inflation will eventually push the Fed into pausing its current rate hike cycle.Spot gold was steady around $1,876.41 an ounce, while gold futures were muted at $1,879.50 an ounce by 19:06 ET (00:06 GMT). Both instruments were trading at an eight-month high, after logging a strong start to the year.Bullion prices also benefited from increased safe haven demand, as fears of a recession and bets that the dollar had peaked saw traders seeking gold.But while the yellow metal has recovered sharply from lows hit in 2022, it is still facing an environment where U.S. interest rates are at their highest level since the 2008 financial crisis. This, coupled with uncertainty over where U.S. interest rates will peak, is expected to limit bigger gains in gold in the near-term.While inflation is expected to have eased in December, it is still well above the Fed’s annual target. This has also elicited warnings from Fed members that interest rates could remain higher for longer, keeping metal markets under pressure.Among industrial metals, copper prices inched lower on Thursday, but hovered just below their strongest level since mid-June. The red metal is up nearly 10% so far this year amid increased optimism over an economic reopening in major importer China.Story continuesCopper futures fell 0.1% to $4.1730 a pound in early Asian trade.

After the frenzy of the past two years, this suggests good news for homebuyers in the new year with more options and more time to make a decision.""In December, we saw both buyers and sellers pulling back as they continue to adjust to a challenging market. Buyers started 2022 facing high home prices and limited inventories, and ended the year with interest rates roughly double where they started. Despite significant cooling in sales in 2022, some indicators remain in high gear. Prices are still significantly higher and homes are selling faster compared to 2019 pre-pandemic levels,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist for Realtor.com®. ""Although demand has softened compared to last year, pushing home price growth into single-digit territory for the first time in 12 months, moderation in home price growth may encourage more buyers to return to the market in the months ahead, and may also be welcome news for sellers aiming to sell and buy at the same time. Affordability will remain a challenge and buyers will want to keep a close eye on their potential mortgage payment – a mortgage calculator is a great way to do this.""December 2022 Housing Metrics – NationalMetricChange over Dec. 2021Change over Dec. 2019 Median listing price8.4% (to $400,000)33.4 %Active listings54.7 %-33.4 %New listings-21.0 %-17.7 %Median days on market11 days (to 67 days)-16 daysShare of active listings with price reductions6.5 percentage points (to 13.6%)3.3 percentage points(from 10.3%)Active listings up significantly from 2021, easing inventory constraints for buyersThe supply of active listings for sale in the U.S. increased significantly in December over the previous year, signaling continued hesitation from buyers in the face of mortgage affordability and other obstacles. While the number of homes for sale continued to increase in the latter part of 2022, inventory is still significantly lower than it was in 2019 before the pandemic. Home sellers also continued to be less active in December and fewer listed their home for sale compared to one year ago.Story continuesNationally, the active inventory of homes for sale grew 54.7% year-over-year in December, but is still well below pre-pandemic levels (-38.2% compared to the December 2017-2019 average).Both newly-listed homes (-21.0%) and pending listings, or homes under contract with a buyer (-36.8%), declined year-over-year.Among the 50 largest U.S. metros, 49 markets posted yearly active inventory gains in December, led by Raleigh, N.C. (+226.2%), Nashville, Tenn., (+226.0%), and Austin, Texas (+186.6%). Only Hartford, Conn. (-7.7%) saw a year-over-year decline in the number of for-sale homes.In December, on average across the 50 largest metros, the number of homes for sale was up 74.6% compared to a year ago, with the most growth in active listings in the West (+110.2%), which nearly reached pre-pandemic 2019 levels (-3.9%).On average across the 50 largest metros, no regions saw year-over-year new listing increases in December, with the greatest declines registered in the West (-32.5%), followed by the Northeast (-21.8%), Midwest (-19.3%) and South (-17.2%). Furthermore, newly-listed homes increased in just two markets: Nashville(4.1%) and Buffalo, N.Y.. (+3.0%).Home price growth moderates to single digits for the first time in a yearIn December, growth in the typical asking price slowed to a single-digit pace for the first time since December 2021. While this is still higher than normal, it's a significant slowdown from the peak 18% year over year pace seen earlier in 2022 and signals that fewer buyers are willing to take the plunge amid ongoing housing affordability challenges. Despite recent easing in mortgage rates from their early-November peak, higher rates and home prices compared to a year ago have increased the typical mortgage payment by nearly $750 each month or 58.9% more than last year, far outpacing recent rent growth (3.4%) and inflation (7.1%). Realtor.com®'s expectation for 2023 is that rates will climb higher early in the year before falling in the second half.In December, the U.S. median listing price was $400,000, up 8.4% year-over-year. This is the first time since December 2021 the annual growth rate has fallen below double-digits.While the monthly home price growth rate has slowed from the double-digits seen during the pandemic frenzy, overall, home prices continued to rise in 2022, and the median list price was up an average 13.4% compared to the previous year.The slowdown in the demand for homes has caused sellers to cut their prices. Nationally, 13.6% of active listings had their price reduced, a higher share than in December 2021 (+6.5 percentage points), but similar to the 2018 share (14.5%).Among the 50 largest U.S. metros, the biggest annual listing price gains were in Midwest metros (+12.2%, on average). The markets with the biggest increases were Milwaukee (+46.2%), Memphis, Tenn. (+34.0%), and Miami (+20.4%).Southern (+9.6 percentage points) and Western metros (+8.7 percentage points) saw the greatest increases in the share of listings with price reductions. Listing prices declined in nine markets, led by New Orleans (-4.4%), Denver (-4.0%), Austin (-3.4%), Phoenix( -2.4%) , and Pittsburgh (-2.3%).Homes stay on the market 11 days longer on average as buyers take their time to decideFor-sale homes continued to spend more time on market compared to the prior year amid a growing number of homes for sale and softening buyer demand. Modestly rising incomes (+4.6% year over year in December) and a robust jobs market (unemployment remains low at 3.5% in December), cannot completely offset lower buyer purchasing power, and as a result, homes are sitting on the market for longer, as buyers take their time to decide. Homes still sold faster in December than was common in 2019, with more affordable, lower-priced markets in the Midwest and Northeast seeing homes sell faster than in other areas. Looking ahead, mid-sized markets that offer better affordability and solid jobs and economies, especially those among Realtor.com®'s top housing markets of 2023, may continue to be attractive to homeshoppers, especially those with the flexibility to relocate.In December, the typical home spent 67 days on market, 11 days longer than last year, but still 16 days faster than in 2017-2019, on average.Time on market was lower across the 50 largest U.S. metros (61 days, on average) relative to the national pace, but also slowed from the December 2021 pace (+11 days).Forty-five metros saw an increase in time on market compared to last year, with larger metros in the West seeing the greatest increase (+18 days) followed by the South (+13 days). Metros where homes spent longest on the market compared to December 2021 were Raleigh, N.C.

258,2d9ff5c5-112a-3ec2-8ec7-80c5fd7bd4a1,VZ,2023-01-12,"Boasting A 22% Return On Equity, Is Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) A Top Quality Stock?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boasting-22-return-equity-verizon-120121389.html,1673524881,STORY,['VZ'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Verizon Communications How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Verizon Communications is:22% = US$20b ÷ US$89b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.22 in profit.Does Verizon Communications Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Verizon Communications has a superior ROE than the average (14%) in the Telecom industry.roeThat is a good sign. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for Verizon Communications.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesVerizon Communications' Debt And Its 22% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Verizon Communications, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.70. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.But note: Verizon Communications may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

With a focus on creating smart, connected, self-service and human-assisted interactions throughout the entire customer journey, the latest VCC digital solutions were designed to facilitate exceptional customer experiences.“In the past few years, the contact center has undergone a digital transformation, which is prompting the end-to-end customer journey to evolve in kind. With more customers turning to digital channels outside of the contact center to kickstart their issue resolution, companies need a holistic strategy for managing customer entry points. The Verizon Virtual Contact Center anticipates and addresses those digital-first interactions, allowing organizations to deliver improved, personalized customer experiences,” said Debika Bhattacharya, Chief Product Officer, Verizon Business.As the nerve center where customer experience paths meet, the contact center experience can no longer afford to be one that is considered reactionary and transactional. Customers today expect companies to address their full range of “needs'' effortlessly across any channel, and with a seamless transition to human agents when necessary. Many organizations, however, don't have the necessary insight into how all their digital entry points and customer experience interactions can be coordinated to get the most from search engines, mobile/desktop apps, websites, and social media.To reduce friction along the customer journey, VCC provides entirely new ways to digitally transform the customer experience (CX):Story continuesVCC Guide provides self-service, contextual guidance for web and mobile experiencesVCC Expert is a smart knowledge management and content optimization tool that optimizes content to shape the customer journeyVCC Enlighten XO builds smarter applications using auto-generated insights through artificial intelligence (AI) that’s based on actual CX conversation dataVCC SmartAssist powered by Amelia is a smart conversational AI that can resolve customer and employee issues in a more natural wayAccording to the NICE 2022 Digital-First Customer Experience Report, 81% of customers will first try to solve their problems on their own using web search or self-service. Sold separately or as a bundle, these latest VCC digital solutions are vendor agnostic and can be bolted on top of any existing contact center solution to help address individual entry points and support the customer's complete digital journey. By empowering customers with the most relevant content for self-service success and faster, more accurate agent-assisted answers, organizations will be better equipped to address their customers’ needs with fewer transfers and callbacks.With these latest digital solutions added to the Verizon Virtual Contact Center, organizations can meet their customers wherever they are in their digital journey.

Selling at an average price of US$175, which is higher than the current price might have been the right call as holding on to stock would have meant their investment would be worth less now than it was at the time of sale.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for NVIDIA NVIDIA Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Independent Director, Mark Stevens, sold US$51m worth of shares at a price of US$186 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$160). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.In the last year NVIDIA insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At NVIDIA Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at NVIDIA. In total, insiders sold US$21m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Does NVIDIA Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that NVIDIA insiders own 4.1% of the company, worth about US$16b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The NVIDIA Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders sold NVIDIA shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. You'd be interested to know, that we found 3 warning signs for NVIDIA and we suggest you have a look.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

According to research firm Gartner, worldwide PC shipments declined a staggering 28.5% in the fourth quarter of 2022, the largest decline since the company began tracking shipments in the mid-1990s.That drop is especially stunning considering consumers tend to spend more on electronics like laptops and desktops during the holidays.“The anticipation of a global recession, increased inflation, and higher interest rates have had a major impact on PC demand,” Mikako Kitagawa, director analyst at Gartner said in a statement.“Since many consumers already have relatively new PCs that were purchased during the pandemic, a lack of affordability is superseding any motivation to buy, causing consumer PC demand to drop to its lowest level in years.”It’s not just consumers, though, either. According to Kitagawa, enterprise PC sales have also declined, with businesses delaying purchases amid fears of a slowing economy. Enterprise sales aren’t expected to return to growth until sometime next year.Gartner says shipments of Apple's computers fell more than 10% year-over-year. (Photo by Zhang Peng/LightRocket via Getty Images)No major PC vendor was spared from the declines, with Acer seeing shipments drop 41% year-over-year from 6.1 million in Q4 2021 to 3.5 million in Q4 2022. Lenovo, HP (HPQ), and Dell (DELL), the largest PC vendors, saw declines of 28.6%, 29.1%, and 37%, respectively.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, saw shipments fall 10.2% year-over-year from 7.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 to 7 million in Q4 2022.Chip makers including Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Nvidia (NVDA) have each had poor financial showings in recent quarters. In Q3, Intel reported revenue of $15.3 billion, a 15% year-over-year decline, while Nvidia reported a 17% drop in revenue to $5.3 billion. AMD, meanwhile, revised its Q3 earnings downward on slowing PC sales.The PC and chip industries are dealing with the aftershocks of the early days of the pandemic when the initial thinking was that consumers would pull back on spending throughout lockdowns. Instead, workers, students, and average people began buying up laptops and desktops in droves for everything from their jobs and school to entertainment.Story continuesChip makers fought to catch up, and PC makers did the same, eventually meeting demand. Now, however, chip and PC makers are working through an inventory glut, hitting their bottom lines.Kitagawa previously predicted that the industry would return to growth sometime in the next 5 years. That lines up with about the time many consumers’ pandemic-era PCs will be nearing the end of their life cycles.Until then, the industry looks like it’s in for a bumpy ride.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Tech newsletterMore from DanApple says it’s paid out $320 billion to developers since 2008 as App Store fight heats upCES 2023: One of the most popular gadgets at the show goes in your toiletBMW debuts i Vision Dee concept, a car that can change colors and smile at youGot a tip?

The report will offer a preview of how semiconductor companies are currently doing as we move further into 2023.Semiconductor stocks, in general, have felt the brunt of the pain from higher inflation and Taiwan Semiconductor’s report will receive considerable attention with other chip giants like Nvidia NVDA and Broadcom AVGO not reporting until later in the quarter.Q4 Earnings &amp; Outlook  With Taiwan Semiconductor sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at the moment it may be more plausible that an earnings beat is in store which could be a further catalyst for broader semiconductor stocks as well.  The Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) has TSM beating expectations by 1.3% as earnings estimate revisions have continued to trend higher over the last week going into its Q4 report.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurthermore, the Zacks Consensus for TSM’s Q4 Earnings is $1.80 per share, which would be a 56% increase year over year. Sales for Q4 are expected to be up 29% at $20.29 billion. This is an indication that Taiwan Semiconductor is starting to adjust to tougher operating environments seen across the global economy.Taiwan Semiconductor’s full-year earnings for its current fiscal 2022 are projected to climb 55% to $6.39 per share. Fiscal 2023 earnings are forecasted to decline -9% after a better-than-expected year. Earnings estimate revisions are up for FY22 and have started to trend higher again for FY23.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOn the top line, sales for fiscal 2022 are expected to climb 27% and rise another 7% in FY23 to $77.31 billion. Fiscal 2023 would be a very impressive 116% increase from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $35.77 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPerformance &amp; Momentum Over the last year, TSM is still down -38% underperforming the Nasdaq’s -29% and the S&amp;P 500’s -18%. In comparison, Nvidia’s -44% has underperformed TSM and broader indexes as well, while Broadcom’s -8% has outperformed. Taking the last five years into account, we can see from the nearby chart that TSM’s +98% has easily outperformed broader indexes but still trailed the performance of Broadcom and Nvidia.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, Taiwan Semiconductor stock has continued to see strong momentum of late, rallying nicely over the last two months. TSM stock has now climbed +34% from its November lows, outperforming Broadcom, Nvidia, and the broader indexes during this period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuation Looking at Taiwan Semiconductor’s valuation may be key for some investors to buy into the possibility of more upside in TSM shares after such extensive rallies.In this regard, shares of TSM still look attractive trading around $81 per share and at 14.1X forward earnings. This is 59% below its decade high of 34.4X and an 11% discount to the median of 15.9X. Even better, TSM stock trades 18% beneath the benchmark’s 17.5X forward earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPlus, when taking the growth rate into account with its price to earnings TSM’s PEG of 0.66 is nicely below the optimum level of 1. This is also beneath the benchmark’s PEG of 1.64 and the broader Computer and Technology sectors 1.69.Bottom Line Based on Taiwan Semiconductor’s (TSM) valuation and top line growth there could certainly be more upside in the stock. In addition to sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), TSM stock has an overall “A” VGM Style Scores grade with the average Zacks Price Target suggesting 33% upside from current levels.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

    Wednesday, Jan. 11, 2023Apple's mixed-reality headset won't replace your iPhoneApple (AAPL) is expected to unveil its first mix-reality headset. According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the Cupertino-based company will unveil the highly anticipated hardware, dubbed the Reality Pro, ahead of its Worldwide Developers Conference event in June, before launching it later this fall.For years, Apple has been searching for a new product to offset its reliance on iPhone sales, which make up the bulk of its revenue. It’s introduced subscription services like Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Fitness+ and debuted accessories like the AirPods and Apple Watch. But those are more or less add-ons for iPhone owners.The Reality Pro headset, on the other hand, is a self-contained device that will launch the company into a completely new computing space — and put it into direct competition with the likes of Meta (META). The headset is expected to be one of the most advanced on the market and come complete with high-resolution displays, external cameras for augmented reality capabilities, and run on Apple’s own M2 processor.But don’t expect the Reality Pro to save Apple from its iPhone dependence anytime soon.“It's a meaningless product,” UBS Analyst David Vogt told Yahoo Finance. “It's a very high-end device. We're talking like $1,500, $2,000, if not more. So that's a very limited audience. And it's mostly going to be, we think, industrial-centric to start. So, the volumes we think are going to be relatively low.”In other words, Apple’s iPhone will still be its most important product regardless of what form of reality you’re in.Apple’s iPhone is as important as everIn 2022, the iPhone accounted for $205.4 billion of the company’s $394.3 billion in total sales. Services, Apple’s second largest business segment, made up just $78.1 billion of the company’s total 2022 revenue. Heck, the Wearables, Mac, and iPad businesses combined made up less revenue than the iPhone—$110.7 billion.Story continues“Apple has very much become a one crop economy, so to speak, where its reliance on iPhone revenues has started to become perhaps troubling in terms of…its ability to sustain growth,” NYU Stern School of Business professor Arun Sundararajan told Yahoo Finance. “And so I can see the motivation from within the company to want to have another game changing product.”But analysts say the Reality Pro’s steep price means it’s unlikely to ever sell in the kinds of volumes needed to to outpace the iPhone.Apple CEO Tim Cook holds the new iPhone 14 at an Apple event at their headquarters in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 7, 2022. REUTERS/Carlos BarriaAccording to CCS Insight, worldwide VR and AR device shipments will top out at 66.8 million by 2026. That’s a huge jump from the 9.6 million shipped in 2022, but nowhere near the 1.24 billion smartphones IDC says were shipped in 2022.According to Vogt, the only products that could help Apple become more than an iPhone company are its car, codenamed Project Titan, or a deeper foray into the health-care space.If that’s the case, then why is Apple jumping into the mixed reality arena to begin with? Simple: it sees companies like Meta, Nvidia (NVDA), and Microsoft (MSFT) investing in the space, and can’t afford to fall behind on the off chance that mixed reality headsets or their accompanying software end up being the go-to devices of the future.After all, Apple saw firsthand how much Microsoft suffered by entering the smartphone market too late. After spending $7.2 billion to acquire Nokia in 2014, the cloud computing giant sold portions of the phone maker for scraps.The smartphone is still the center of our digital livesApple’s iPhone is a generational product that has influenced everything from its competitors — Google reworked its prototype Android phone after Apple founder Steve Jobs debuted the iPhone in 2007 — to our cars, which now sport interfaces that look more like our phones than ever.A person plays Beat Saber in the Quest Experience during a preview of the inaugural physical store of Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc in Burlingame, California, U.S. May 4, 2022. REUTERS/Brittany Hosea-Small“Every meaningful part of our lives is affected and influenced by smartphones on a daily basis,” NYU Stern School of Business professor Anindya Ghose told Yahoo Finance.“Given this, I don’t see a viable path for a virtual reality device to make any significant dent with respect to mind share or adoption by consumers. The smartphone, and the iPhone in particular, is incredibly powerful in terms of share of mind for consumers.”Of course, that could play to Apple’s advantage. The company’s customers tend to be incredibly loyal, giving it an install base of hundreds of millions of iPhone users ready to check out its newest device.Still, it’s hard to imagine those consumers will be willing to wear headsets for long periods to view content that they can otherwise see by quickly picking up their phones. Headsets, regardless of who makes them, are still too bulky and off-putting to be a person’s primary means of computing. Even Meta’s high-end Quest Pro is too heavy and uncomfortable, according to The Verge.That’s not to say an Apple-built mixed reality headset won’t be a success, or that it won’t help drive more consumer interest in virtual reality and mixed reality. But for the foreseeable future, the iPhone will continue to serve as both Apple’s breadwinner and most influential product. It’s virtually guaranteed.By Daniel Howley, tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

WST is well poised for growth, backed by the robust Proprietary Products segment and sustained strength in research and development (R&amp;D). However, foreign exchange volatility is a concern.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 22.1% against the industry's gain of 5.9% in the past six months. The S&amp;P 500 Index has fallen 0.2% in the same period.West Pharmaceutical — with a market capitalization of $17.82 billion — is a leading global manufacturer, engaged in the design and production of technologically advanced, high-quality, integrated containment and delivery systems for injectable drugs and healthcare products. Its earnings are anticipated to improve 15.1% over the next five years. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 5.07%, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchKey CatalystsThe proprietary products business continues to exhibit sustained strength and is an important contributor to WST's top line. This segment's customers primarily comprise several of the major biologic, generic and pharmaceutical drug companies globally that incorporate components and other offerings in their injectable products for distribution to patients.Sales improved 4.3% organically in the third quarter of 2022. High-value products (components and devices) accounted for more than 70% of segment sales and delivered mid-single-digit organic sales growth. Consumer demand for NovaPure, Envision and Daikyo Crystal Zenith components and self-injection devices led to the upside.Mid-single-digit organic net sales growth in the Biologics and Generics market units and low-single-digit organic net sales growth in the Pharma market unit are other quarterly highlights. The expansion of the adjusted operating margin also augurs well for the company.West Pharmaceutical maintains its research-scale production facilities and laboratories for creating new products and provides contract engineering design and development services to help customers with new product developments.Story continuesThe company continues to pursue innovative strategic platforms in prefillable syringes, injectable containers, advanced injections, and safety and administration systems. In the third quarter of 2022, the company's R&amp;D expenses increased 3.8% from the prior-year quarter.West Pharmaceutical remains committed to seeking new innovative opportunities for the acquisition, licensing, partnering or development of products, services and technologies. WST is focused on its objective to connect dots throughout science and technology to fulfill ideas for potential value creation.Factors Hurting the StockThe growing exposure to international markets makes the company susceptible to adverse foreign exchange volatility. Unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates can affect West Pharmaceutical's international sales. On the third-quarter 2022 earnings call, the company projected forex headwind on revenues of $60 million for the fourth-quarter of 2022.Moreover, the continued fall in the Contract-Manufactured Products segment is a concern. Lower demand for COVID-related products is worrying from the business perspective. Contraction in gross margin does not bode well. The lowering of West Pharmaceutical’s full-year financial outlook also raises apprehensions.Estimates TrendWest Pharmaceutical has been witnessing an upward estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has improved 0.8% to $7.28 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues stands at $2.86 billion, suggesting growth of 0.9% from the year-ago reported number.West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.

The battle would pit the activist investor known for his work at consumer firms against Iger, one of the most popular executives in Hollywood.Disney's shares, which have tumbled 39% in the past year, jumped more than 4%. Some analysts pointed to Peltz's past successes in bringing changes at firms.Iger is expected to focus on performance of the money-losing Disney+ streaming business he helped launch in 2019. Peltz told CNBC on Thursday that Disney should either jettison that business or buy the rest of rival streaming service Hulu. Disney has a majority stake in Hulu; Comcast Corp owns the rest.Disney has said it expects the streaming business to be profitable by 2024, after it lost nearly $1.5 billion in the last reported quarter.The tussle with Disney could be Peltz's biggest proxy battle since an acrimonious fight to bag a seat on the board of Tide detergent-maker P&amp;G. During his more than three-year tenure on P&amp;G's board, the firm's stock price rose nearly 80%.Peltz's Trian Fund Management owns a 0.5%, or roughly $900 million stake in Disney. The fund on Thursday filed documents with the U.S. securities regulator for his election as a director after Disney denied him a board seat.""Investors would appreciate additional assurance that past problems won't repeat,"" Rosenblatt Securities said. ""Peltz - with a change-maker history at targets including P&amp;G, (Kraft) Heinz and Wendy's - could provide a measure of that.""Story continuesUnless Peltz settles with Disney, investors will vote this year on whether he should sit on the company's board. Last year, the annual shareholder meeting was held on March 9.Disney also needs to boost capital expenditure at its parks business, where it probably raised ticket prices ""too hard,"" he said in a CNBC interview. It ""is more than a media company and is a consumer company,"" he said.Disney did not respond to requests for comment.'WELL-LIKED CEO'Iger has already rolled back some price hikes that the parks division implemented under previous CEO Bob Chapek, and started his second stint with a vow to focus on cost cuts and profitability.Analysts believe the executive, who Peltz says he does not want to replace, could be a major hurdle in the activist's plan.""Iger is a well-liked CEO, not only within Disney and its employees but also in Hollywood and the stock market. Peltz might find it tough to gain traction with this campaign,"" said Ben Barringer, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot.During Iger's first tenure, Disney made several key acquisitions, including Pixar Animation Studios, Marvel Entertainment and 21st Century Fox. Its market capitalization rose five-foldThe company has also faced pressure from Third Point's Daniel Loeb to spin off cable sports channel ESPN, refresh its board and buy Comcast's stake in Hulu - which has around 46 million subscribers.(Reporting by Akash Sriram, Aditya Soni, Chavi Mehta and Nivedita Balu in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli and David Gregorio)]"

The stock had tumbled 39% last year.""Investors would appreciate additional assurance that past problems won't repeat,"" Rosenblatt Securities said. ""Peltz -- with a change-maker history at targets including P&amp;G, Heinz, and Wendy's -- could provide a measure of that.""Trian Fund Management owns roughly $900 million worth of Disney stock, which equates to an about 0.5% stake.Peltz, who says Disney's problems are primarily self-inflicted, has not given a detailed plan for achieving his goals.Sources familiar with Disney have said he has only leveled criticisms without offering possible solutions.Disney has given Peltz access to the board and management over the last months, but blocked his request to join the board, in part, due to his lack of expertise in media and technology, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.The media giant has also faced pressure from Third Point's Daniel Loeb to refresh its board, over uncertainty around profitability of its streaming business and the surprise return of Iger.Investors will vote later this year on whether Peltz should sit on the company's board. Last year, the annual shareholder meeting was held on March 9.(Reporting by Akash Sriram and Aditya Soni in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)]"

As a result, 15,000 oil-equivalent barrels (Boe) per day of production was lost. Per the update, Devon is expected to produce an average of 636,000 Boe/d in the fourth quarter, including 316,000 barrels per day of oil.Devon Energy has already restored production volumes in the affected regions and the production drop will be limited to its fourth-quarter volumes only.Devon Energy initially expected its fourth-quarter 2022 production volumes in the range of 640,000-660,000 Boe/d, taking into consideration the accretive acquisitions of Williston Basin and Eagle.Strong Asset BaseDespite an expected drop in the fourth-quarter production volumes, Devon Energy has sufficient production areas to recoup the production volumes.In the beginning of third-quarter 2022, Devon Energy completed the acquisition of RimRock Oil and Gas LP in the Williston Basin.

To be reported as identified items, the taxation effect will not influence the period’s adjusted earnings. The London-based supermajor further revealed that its Chemicals and Products and Marketing division results would suffer this quarter but the Integrated Gas segment might benefit due to a boost from trading and optimization.  Now, let’s dig into some other segment-wise selected items from Friday’s release.UpstreamAccording to the latest update, Shell’s upstream production fell 13.2% on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter of 2022 at the midpoint of the guidance. The supermajor is estimating its output in the range of 1,825-1,925 MBOE/d compared to 2,161 MBOE/d a year ago and 1,789 MBOE/d in the third quarter of 2022. Tax charges are expected to hurt earnings in the range of $3.1-3.9 billion.Meanwhile, Shell sees the share of profit of joint ventures and associates to have an impact between a loss of $200 million and a gain of $400 million. The segment’s result is also likely to include well write-offs to the tune of $150-$550 million. Finally, operating expense for the segment is projected at around #3.1 billion.Integrated GasShell’s LNG liquefaction volumes are expected in the range of 6.6-7 million tons, translating into a deterioration of around 14% year over year and 6% sequentially. Shell’s integrated gas production is expected to decrease to the range of 900,000-940,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) or 920,000 BOE/d at the midpoint. It was 927,000 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 924,000 BOE/d in the September quarter.Per the company, fourth-quarter trading and optimization results in its integrated gas unit will be “significantly higher compared to the third quarter 2022.” Segment operating cost is expected between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion.Story continuesMarketingThe midpoint of management’s marketing sales volume guidance equates to 2.55 million barrels per day, lower than the 2.581 achieved in the third quarter of 2022. Overall, segment profits are expected to be below the quarter-ago levels, while operating expenses would be between $2 and $2.3 billion.Chemicals &amp; ProductsThe company fears a considerable drop in its ‘Trading &amp; Optimisation’ results from the third-quarter levels. However, as projected by Shell, the refining margin should strengthen in the fourth quarter, with the metric improving 27% sequentially. Meanwhile, despite chemical margins returning to positive territory, numbers are expected to be lower partly due to the Pennsylvania Chemicals project’s commencement of tax-related depreciation. Shell also forecast refinery utilization of 88-92%, operating expense of 2.8-3.2 billion and chemicals manufacturing plant utilization of 75-79%.Renewables and Energy SolutionsThe adjusted bottom line of this segment is expected to hover between a loss of $500 million and a profit of $100 million.Q4 EstimatesThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, which consolidated its dual headquarters in London over The Hague and became a single United Kingdom (“UK”) entity last year, is slated to release fourth-quarter 2022 results on Feb 2.

293,ac23c852-6439-3293-9c74-436702a87cc0,DVN,2023-01-12,Time To Worry? Analysts Just Downgraded Their Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) Outlook,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-worry-analysts-just-downgraded-100527849.html,1673517927,STORY,['DVN'],"[Today is shaping up negative for Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) shareholders, with the analysts delivering a substantial negative revision to next year's forecasts. There was a fairly draconian cut to their revenue estimates, perhaps an implicit admission that previous forecasts were much too optimistic.Following the downgrade, the consensus from 14 analysts covering Devon Energy is for revenues of US$18b in 2023, implying a noticeable 4.9% decline in sales compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are anticipated to dip 8.5% to US$8.75 in the same period. Before this latest update, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$20b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$9.20 in 2023. Indeed, we can see that analyst sentiment has declined measurably after the new consensus came out, with a substantial drop in revenue estimates and a minor downgrade to EPS estimates to boot. Check out our latest analysis for Devon Energy earnings-and-revenue-growthDespite the cuts to forecast earnings, there was no real change to the US$77.86 price target, showing that the analysts don't think the changes have a meaningful impact on its intrinsic value. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. There are some variant perceptions on Devon Energy, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$98.00 and the most bearish at US$45.00 per share. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that the analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business.Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. These estimates imply that sales are expected to slow, with a forecast annualised revenue decline of 3.9% by the end of 2023. This indicates a significant reduction from annual growth of 16% over the last five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in the industry are forecast to see their revenue decline 7.1% annually for the foreseeable future. The forecasts do look comparatively optimistic for Devon Energy, since they're expecting it to shrink slower than the industry.Story continuesThe Bottom LineThe most important thing to take away is that analysts cut their earnings per share estimates, expecting a clear decline in business conditions. Sadly they also cut their revenue estimates, although at least the company is expected to perform a bit better than the wider market. Given the stark change in sentiment, we'd understand if investors became more cautious on Devon Energy after today.There might be good reason for analyst bearishness towards Devon Energy, like a weak balance sheet.

Devon boasts a multi-basin portfolio and the adverse weather conditions significantly impacted its Williston Basin operations.The extreme weather conditions resulted in well shut-ins, facility downtime and delays in the completion of activity. As a result, 15,000 oil-equivalent barrels (Boe) per day of production was lost. Per the update, Devon is expected to produce an average of 636,000 Boe/d in the fourth quarter, including 316,000 barrels per day of oil.Devon Energy has already restored production volumes in the affected regions and the production drop will be limited to its fourth-quarter volumes only.Devon Energy initially expected its fourth-quarter 2022 production volumes in the range of 640,000-660,000 Boe/d, taking into consideration the accretive acquisitions of Williston Basin and Eagle.Strong Asset BaseDespite an expected drop in the fourth-quarter production volumes, Devon Energy has sufficient production areas to recoup the production volumes.In the beginning of third-quarter 2022, Devon Energy completed the acquisition of RimRock Oil and Gas LP in the Williston Basin. This acquisition also adds more than 100 highly economic undrilled locations, positioning Devon’s Williston assets to maintain high-margin production and strong free cash flow for years to come.During the end of third-quarter, Devon Energy completed the acquisition of Validas Energy, which further expanded Devon’s operation in the Eagle Ford shale. This acquisition added 42,000 net acres and an oil-weighted production mix with a low-cost structure that will further boost margins and free cash flow of the company.Zacks Rank and Key PicksDevon Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

URI, Hillman Solutions Corp. HLMN and Janus International Group, Inc. JBI.Industry: Building ProductsLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2037813/3-top-building-products-industry-stocks-to-buy-despite-headwindsThe current U.S. housing market slowdown, continued supply-chain bottlenecks, investments in new products and higher raw material costs have been compressing margins for companies under the Zacks Building Products - Miscellaneous industry. That said, higher government spending for infrastructural enhancement has been aiding the industry players. Companies like United Rentals, Inc., Hillman Solutions Corp. and Janus International Group, Inc. are set to benefit from operational excellence, geographic and product diversification strategies, accretive buyouts and higher infrastructural spending.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Building Products - Miscellaneous industry primarily comprises manufacturers, designers and distributors of home improvement and building products like ceiling systems, doors, and windows as well as flooring and metal products. Some industry players provide solutions to rehabilitate the aging infrastructure, primarily pipelines in wastewater, water, energy, mining and refining industries.The companies also manufacture expansion joints and structural bearings, ventilation products, ground-mounted solar racking and commercial greenhouses as well as mail storage (solutions including mailboxes along with package delivery products). Companies in this industrial cohort also rent out equipment to a diverse customer base that includes construction and industrial companies, manufacturers, utilities, municipalities, homeowners as well as government entities.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Building Products IndustrySupply Chain &amp; Inflationary Woes: Inflationary headwinds with respect to transportation costs, material costs and energy costs owing to supply-chain disruptions have been a pressing concern. Also, rising labor costs are compressing margins. These are dampening the companies’ operating performance. Rising costs related to steel, asphalt, resin and other input materials are compressing margins.Story continuesAlthough the companies have been working to recover higher costs through various price increases, they expect this ongoing volatility in material and transportation costs to persist in the near term. Meanwhile, the companies have been witnessing short-term project delays due to material and labor shortages that are impacting upstream building activity. This may result in a lower backlog in the near term.Apart from higher raw material costs, the companies bear expenses related to product launches. If companies are unable to offset these costs through price increases or supply-chain initiatives, their profits may be affected.Also, as the industry players’ business prospects are highly correlated with U.S. housing market conditions and repair and remodeling activity, the current slowdown in the market has been impacting the company’s performance.U.S. Administration’s Infrastructure Spending: The industry players are expected to benefit from strong global trends in infrastructure modernization, energy transition, national security, and a potential super-cycle in global supply-chain investments. The U.S. administration’s endeavor to rebuild the nation’s deteriorating roads and bridges and fund new climate-resilient and broadband initiatives is expected to aid the companies.Operational Excellence, Product Innovation &amp; Acquisitions: The industry participants have been carrying out strong cost-saving initiatives like business consolidation, system implementations, plant/branch closures, improvement in the global supply chain and headcount reductions to boost profitability. Industry participants have also been strategically investing in new products, sales and support services, digitally enabled solutions as well as advanced manufacturing capabilities to boost revenues. The companies are also following a systematic acquisition strategy to supplement organic growth, and expand access to additional markets as well as products.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Building Products – Miscellaneous industry is a 27-stock group within the broader Zacks Construction sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #212, which places it in the bottom 15% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of tepid earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since October 2022, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have been revised 1.5% downward to $3.82 per share.Despite the industry’s blurred near-term view, we will present a few stocks that one may consider adding to their portfolio. Before that, it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Building Products – Miscellaneous industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Construction sector but outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.Over this period, the industry has lost 18.8% compared with the broader sector’s 16.6% decrease and the S&amp;P 500’s decline of 19.1%.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price to earnings, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing building products’ stocks, the industry is trading at 12.7X versus the S&amp;P 500’s 17.3X and the sector’s 14.2X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 19.9X, as low as 6.9X and at a median of 13.1X.3 Building Product Stocks to Buy NowWe have selected three stocks from the Zacks universe of building products that currently carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can seethe complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.United Rentals: Headquartered in Stamford, CT, United Rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world. This company has been gaining from better fleet productivity on broad-based rental demand in construction and industrial verticals. It remains optimistic for 2023 courtesy of growth opportunities across its verticals, with persistent growth opportunities for data centers, distribution centers and renewables as well as the automotive and ship plants projects.URI, a Zacks Rank #1 stock, has gained 14.9% over the past year. URI has seen an upward estimate revision of 0.9% for 2023 earnings over the past 30 days to $37.14 per share. The company’s earnings for 2023 are expected to increase 14.2%.Hillman Solutions: Based in Cincinnati, OH, this company provides hardware-related products and related merchandising services in North America. The company believes that near-record homeowner’s equity in homes and an aging U.S. housing stock will provide a meaningful driver of home improvement projects for the future. This will give the company an opportunity in meaningful repair, remodel and maintenance activity. Notably, HLMN has estimated 90% exposure to repair, remodel and maintenance activity. Again, pricing actions to offset the high costs owing to complex labor and supply chain issues are adding to the positives.HLMN, a Zacks Rank #2 stock, has lost 17.1% over the past year. That said, HLMN’s 2023 earnings estimate has increased to 33 cents from 30 cents over the past seven days.Janus International Group: This Temple, GA-based company manufactures and supplies turn-key self-storage and commercial and industrial building solutions. The company has been generating solid contributions from all of its sales channels, led by Commercial &amp; Other and R3 sales channels. Productivity improvements and commercial actions, including pricing, are expected to drive growth. The company is expected to benefit from its one-stop-shop offering with a leading market share in self-storage doors and related design and installation services.JBI, a Zacks Rank #2 stock, has lost 15.4% over the past year. That said, JBI has seen an upward estimate revision of 3.5% for 2023 earnings over the past 30 days to 88 cents per share.

WMS or ADS declined significantly in the past three months. The stock declined 34.3% in the said period versus the Zacks Building Products - Miscellaneous industry’s 14% growth.On Nov 3, it reported lackluster results for second-quarter fiscal 2023. Both the top line and bottom line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimates by 4.9% and 4.3%, respectively. The company has been suffering from inflationary pressures on material and manufacturing costs and increased transportation costs.Owing to the weakness in the residential housing market due to higher interest rates and affordability issues as well as end-market choppiness in certain non-residential geographies, the company reduced its prospects for fiscal 2023 net sales. Net sales are now expected to be $3.1-$3.2 billion compared with $3.25-$3.35 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNonetheless, this projection is still above the previous year’s figure of $2.77 billion. The consensus mark for fiscal 2023 revenues reflect year-over-year growth of 13.7%. Earnings of $6.01 per share also show a positive trend in analysts’ expectations, up 68.8% year over year. ADS still expects adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $900-$940 million, with adjusted EBITDA margin up 130 basis points on the mid-point.Let’s delve deeper into the factors supporting this leading provider of innovative water management solutions in the stormwater and onsite septic wastewater industries.Solid Performance: The company has been navigating the challenges related to inflationary cost pressures in transportation and manufacturing operations with broad-based growth across the construction end markets and geographies it serves, with notable strength in its priority states. The pricing actions have more than offset its raw material costs.In the second half of fiscal 2023, the company’s net sales increased 30.7% year over year to $1,798.4 million. Domestic Pipe sales rose 35.2%, Domestic Allied Products &amp; Other sales gained 47.1% and Infiltrator sales increased 16.3% during the period. These upsides were driven by double-digit sales growth in the U.S. construction end markets. International sales increased 12.4%, given the strong sales growth in the Mexican and Exports businesses. Notably, adjusted EBITDA rallied 69.7% year over year. Adjusted EBITDA margin also improved 720 bps year over year.Strong Liquidity: ADS ended the first half of fiscal 2023 with $1.05 billion in liquidity, including $457.4 million in cash and cash equivalents along with a $588.4 million committed credit facility. At September end, net cash provided by operating activities was $437 million compared to $94.9 million in the prior-year period. Free cash flow (non-GAAP) was $361.5 million versus $31.1 million a year ago. Net debt (total debt and finance lease obligations net of cash) was $853.9 million as of Sep 30, 2022, a decrease of $70.6 million from Mar 31, 2022.Higher ROE: WMS’ trailing 12-month ROE is indicative of growth potential. ROE for the trailing 12 months is 51.6%, much higher than the industry’s 8.7% reflecting the company’s efficient usage of shareholders’ funds.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Otis carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

That said, higher government spending for infrastructural enhancement has been aiding the industry players. Companies like United Rentals, Inc. URI, Hillman Solutions Corp. HLMN and Janus International Group, Inc. JBI are set to benefit from operational excellence, geographic and product diversification strategies, accretive buyouts and higher infrastructural spending.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Building Products - Miscellaneous industry primarily comprises manufacturers, designers and distributors of home improvement and building products like ceiling systems, doors, and windows as well as flooring and metal products. Some industry players provide solutions to rehabilitate the aging infrastructure, primarily pipelines in wastewater, water, energy, mining and refining industries. The companies also manufacture expansion joints and structural bearings, ventilation products, ground-mounted solar racking and commercial greenhouses as well as mail storage (solutions including mailboxes along with package delivery products). Companies in this industrial cohort also rent out equipment to a diverse customer base that includes construction and industrial companies, manufacturers, utilities, municipalities, homeowners as well as government entities.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Building Products IndustrySupply Chain &amp; Inflationary Woes: Inflationary headwinds with respect to transportation costs, material costs and energy costs owing to supply-chain disruptions have been a pressing concern. Also, rising labor costs are compressing margins. These are dampening the companies’ operating performance. Rising costs related to steel, asphalt, resin and other input materials are compressing margins. Although the companies have been working to recover higher costs through various price increases, they expect this ongoing volatility in material and transportation costs to persist in the near term. Meanwhile, the companies have been witnessing short-term project delays due to material and labor shortages that are impacting upstream building activity. This may result in a lower backlog in the near term.Apart from higher raw material costs, the companies bear expenses related to product launches. If companies are unable to offset these costs through price increases or supply-chain initiatives, their profits may be affected.Also, as the industry players’ business prospects are highly correlated with U.S. housing market conditions and repair and remodeling activity, the current slowdown in the market has been impacting the company’s performance.U.S. Administration’s Infrastructural Spending: The industry players are expected to benefit from strong global trends in infrastructure modernization, energy transition, national security, and a potential super-cycle in global supply-chain investments. The U.S. administration’s endeavor to rebuild the nation’s deteriorating roads and bridges and fund new climate-resilient and broadband initiatives is expected to aid the companies.Operational Excellence, Product Innovation &amp; Acquisitions: The industry participants have been carrying out strong cost-saving initiatives like business consolidation, system implementations, plant/branch closures, improvement in the global supply chain and headcount reductions to boost profitability. Industry participants have also been strategically investing in new products, sales and support services, digitally enabled solutions as well as advanced manufacturing capabilities to boost revenues. The companies are also following a systematic acquisition strategy to supplement organic growth, and expand access to additional markets as well as products.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Building Products – Miscellaneous industry is a 27-stock group within the broader Zacks Construction sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #212, which places it in the bottom 15% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of tepid earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since October 2022, the industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have been revised 1.5% downward to $3.82 per share.Despite the industry’s blurred near-term view, we will present a few stocks that one may consider adding to their portfolio. Before that, it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Building Products – Miscellaneous industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Construction sector but outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.Over this period, the industry has lost 18.8% compared with the broader sector’s 16.6% decrease and the S&amp;P 500’s decline of 19.1%.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price to earnings, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing building products’ stocks, the industry is trading at 12.7X versus the S&amp;P 500’s 17.3X and the sector’s 14.2X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 19.9X, as low as 6.9X and at a median of 13.1X, as the chart below shows.Industry’s P/E Ratio (Forward 12-Month) Versus S&amp;P 5003 Building Product Stocks to Buy NowWe have selected three stocks from the Zacks universe of building products that currently carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. United Rentals: Headquartered in Stamford, CT, United Rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world. This company has been gaining from better fleet productivity on broad-based rental demand in construction and industrial verticals. It remains optimistic for 2023 courtesy of growth opportunities across its verticals, with persistent growth opportunities for data centers, distribution centers and renewables as well as the automotive and ship plants projects.URI, a Zacks Rank #1 stock, has gained 14.9% over the past year. URI has seen an upward estimate revision of 0.9% for 2023 earnings over the past 30 days to $37.14 per share. The company’s earnings for 2023 are expected to increase 14.2%.Price and Consensus: URIHillman Solutions: Based in Cincinnati, OH, this company provides hardware-related products and related merchandising services in North America. The company believes that near-record homeowner’s equity in homes and an aging U.S. housing stock will provide a meaningful driver of home improvement projects for the future. This will give the company an opportunity in meaningful repair, remodel and maintenance activity. Notably, HLMN has estimated 90% exposure to repair, remodel and maintenance activity. Again, pricing actions to offset the high costs owing to complex labor and supply chain issues are adding to the positives.HLMN, a Zacks Rank #2 stock, has lost 17.1% over the past year. That said, HLMN’s 2023 earnings estimate has increased to 33 cents from 30 cents over the past seven days.Price and Consensus: HLMNJanus International Group: This Temple, GA-based company manufactures and supplies turn-key self-storage and commercial and industrial building solutions.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So when we looked at Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM), they do have a high ROCE, but we weren't exactly elated from how returns are trending.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Yum! Brands is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.46 = US$2.1b ÷ (US$5.8b - US$1.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, Yum! Brands has an ROCE of 46%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Hospitality industry average of 11%. View our latest analysis for Yum! Brands roceIn the above chart we have measured Yum! Brands' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is Yum! Brands' ROCE Trending?There hasn't been much to report for Yum! Brands' returns and its level of capital employed because both metrics have been steady for the past five years. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. So it may not be a multi-bagger in the making, but given the decent 46% return on capital, it'd be difficult to find fault with the business's current operations. With fewer investment opportunities, it makes sense that Yum! Brands has been paying out a decent 47% of its earnings to shareholders. Unless businesses have highly compelling growth opportunities, they'll typically return some money to shareholders.Story continuesThe Bottom LineWhile Yum! Brands has impressive profitability from its capital, it isn't increasing that amount of capital. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 71% over the last five years. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.On a final note, we found  3 warning signs for Yum!

Aon (AON), which belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This insurance brokerage has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 1.42%.For the most recent quarter, Aon was expected to post earnings of $2.01 per share, but it reported $2.02 per share instead, representing a surprise of 0.50%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.57 per share, while it actually produced $2.63 per share, a surprise of 2.33%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Aon lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Aon has an Earnings ESP of +1.50% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on February 3, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

The report--based on insights from more than 113 Aon offices that broker, administer or advise on employer-sponsored medical plans around the world--provides insights on how medical rates will change based on interactions with clients and the insurance partners represented in their medical plan portfolio.As employer-sponsored medical plans become an ever-increasing part of an organization's employee compensation, pressure is growing to accurately forecast and manage future costs. The overall market medical trend rate is an important component of overall spend, and employers need to understand the factors driving costs to better navigate volatility and make more-informed decisions.""We published the 2023 Global Medical Trend Rates Report amid economically volatile conditions, the likes of which haven't been seen in decades. Record inflation has garnered all the headlines – and is a big part of the story – but it's important to highlight not only the top line number, but the regional differences, the conditions driving the trend rate and the ways in which companies are mitigating the increases,"" said Carl Redondo, global benefits leader at Aon. ""Although there is still a fair amount of uncertainty on how long global inflationary pressures will persist, it is clear from the locations surveyed that the expectation around employer-sponsored medical plans is that the medical trend rates will see a sharp rise in 2023 – and employers need to consider several factors as they maintain the resilience of their workforce.""The top medical conditions driving medical plan costs in Canada are:1)Autoimmune disease2)Diabetes3)Mental health4)Lung disorder/respiratory5)Cardiovascular""Over the last 2 years, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted health care costs across Canada, with claims slowly returning to pre-pandemic levels during 2022,"" said Joey Raheb, senior vice president and Canadian national leader for growth and client engagement for Health Solutions at Aon. ""The effects of long COVID-19 and other COVID-19 related illnesses and comorbidities (i.e., mental health) continue to evolve, while the Canadian market remains conservative in its reaction to pricing. Supply chain and rising inflation will also play a substantive role in 2023. ""We expect a return to typical medical inflation driven by Canadian plan sponsors taking a more preventative and pragmatic approach to managing plan spend in 2023.""Story continuesThe global average Medical Trend Rate for 2023 is expected to be 9.2 percent, up from 7.4 percent in 2022 and the highest since 2015.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Paccar (PCAR) earns a Zacks Rank #3 13 days from its next quarterly earnings release on January 24, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.26 a share.Paccar's Earnings ESP sits at 1.63%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.26 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.23.PCAR is one of just a large database of Auto-Tires-Trucks stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Harley-Davidson (HOG).Harley-Davidson, which is readying to report earnings on February 14, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.12 a share, and HOG is 34 days out from its next earnings report.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Harley-Davidson is $0.03, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 300%.Story continuesPCAR and HOG's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So on that note, NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for NetApp:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.19 = US$1.2b ÷ (US$9.8b - US$3.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).Thus, NetApp has an ROCE of 19%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Tech industry average of 12% it's much better. View our latest analysis for NetApp roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for NetApp compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From NetApp's ROCE Trend?NetApp has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 39% in that same time. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayAs discussed above, NetApp appears to be getting more proficient at generating returns since capital employed has remained flat but earnings (before interest and tax) are up. Investors may not be impressed by the favorable underlying trends yet because over the last five years the stock has only returned 18% to shareholders. Given that, we'd look further into this stock in case it has more traits that could make it multiply in the long term.On a final note, we found  2 warning signs for NetApp (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable)  you should be aware of.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

The impressive Cologuard volume growth buoys optimism. A promising solvency position is an added advantage. However, mounting expenses and stiff competition do not bode well.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has lost 20.8% compared with a 17.7% decline of the industry and a 19.1% decline of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned global medical device company has a market capitalization of $10.68 billion. The company’s long-term expected growth rate of 27.5% compares with the industry’s growth projection of 18.4%.Let’s delve deeper.Key DriversQ3 Upsides: Exact Sciences exited the third quarter of 2022 with better-than-expected results. The quarter’s net loss per share was narrower than the year-ago period. Robust revenues from the Screening and Precision Oncology segments contributed to the third-quarter top line. The company noted that more than 292,000 healthcare providers ordered Cologuard from its launch till the end of September. The growing uptake of the company’s Oncotype DX Breast and therapy selection products are major advantages.First Strategic Priority Bodes Well:  The company is currently focusing on three areas to enhance Cologuard growth.  The first strategy is building the best and most effective commercial organization in healthcare by investing in the leadership team, training and sales force effectiveness. Secondly, improving the customer experience by making it simpler to order Cologuard electronically and continue rescreening patients every three years. The third strategy is screening more people starting at age 45 to catch cancer earlier. In the third quarter, 10,000 new healthcare providers ordered Cologuard, and more than 292,000 have ordered since the launch as of September. Moreover, the company added 65,000 new ordering healthcare providers.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesOverall Strong Solvency: Exact Sciences exited the third quarter of 2022 with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $669.1 million compared with $728 million at the end of the second quarter of 2022. The company reported long-term debt of $50 million on its balance sheet at the end of the third quarter of 2022, much lower than its current short-term cash level, indicating a good solvency position. This is good news, particularly at the time of an overall tough macroeconomic scenario when the company is faced with a manufacturing and supply halt globally.DownsidesEscalating Costs:  In the third quarter of 2022, Exact Sciences’ gross margin contracted 292 basis points (bps) to 71.7%. Meanwhile, research and development expenses rose 20.5% year over year. Sales and marketing expenses fell 4.5%. General and administrative expenses rose 2.9% year over year. These mounting expenses pushed up adjusted operating costs by 2.6% year over year, resulting in an adjusted operating loss in the quarter under review, placing significant pressure on the company’s bottom line.Tough Competitive Landscape: Given the large market for colorectal cancer screening, Exact Science faces numerous competitors, some of which possess significantly greater financial and other resources and development capabilities than the company.Estimate TrendIn the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Exact Sciences’ loss for 2022 has moved down from $4.30 to $3.84.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 revenues is pegged at $2.04 billion, suggesting a 15.2% rise from the 2021 reported number.Other Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

AAPL. The complaint was filed in 2021, alleging that Apple Inc. had infringed a number of Masimo’s patents including one of its pulse oximeter patents.The recent ruling states that Apple Inc. has infringed the patent related to pulse oximeter by importing and selling certain Apple Watches with light-based pulse oximetry functionality and components within the United States.The Apple Watch Series 6, launched in 2020, was the first smartwatch model to incorporate pulse oximeter sensor and AAPL continues to use the sensor in the current Apple Watches. Following the recent court ruling, the U.S. ITC may consider an import ban on these Apple Watches.Shares of Masimo gained 5.6% during after-hours trading on Jan 10, following the favorable court ruling. The company’s shares have gained 16.4% in the past six months compared with the industry’s increase of 2.8%. The S&amp;P 500 Index however declined 0.3% in the same time period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMasimo believes that the ruling from the U.S. ITC is likely to restore fairness in the market. The company alleges that the world’s largest publicly traded company, Apple, has a history of infringing other companies’ technologies and repackaging them.Masimo is the leading  manufacturer of pulse oximeters for medical use that revolutionized the industry with its Masimo SET pulse oximetry technology. The company is using this technology in its newly-launched, first wearable device — Masimo W1 — that will provide consumers with accurate, continuous health-related data, including oxygen level, hydration index, and pulse, heart, and respiration rates.Masimo’s technology is proven to have helped reduce blindness in babies in the neonatal intensive care unit, save lives of post-surgical patients on opioids and COVID patients monitored remotely during clinical studies.Story continuesMeanwhile, we note that Apple has also filed counter-allegations in 2022 stating that the MASIMO W1 watche infringes a number of its patents and thus seeks damages, injunctive relief and declaratory relief. Masimo continues to pursue all of its legal remedies in its litigation against Apple and believes that the company has good and substantial defenses to Apple’s claims.Industry ProspectsPer a report by technavio, the wearables market share in the United States is expected to increase by USD 6.85 billion from 2021 to 2026 at a compound annual growth rate of 8.9%. Factors like preference for wearables electronic devices for payment and integration of artificial intelligence in wearable medical devices are expected to drive the demand for these devices.Given the market potential, the court ruling may favor Masimo going forward if a ban is imposed on Apple Watches as it will likely impede the growth of one of the leading makers of wearable-devices in the U.S. market.Notable DevelopmentsEarlier this month, study data published in the Egyptian Journal of Anesthesia showed that continuous SpHb through Masimo Pulse CO-Oximetry indicated clinically acceptable accuracy of Hb measurement compared to invasive Hb, even, in patients with low Hb levels and those undergoing CS with antepartum hemorrhage. This is likely to solidify Masimo’s position in the global real-time patient monitoring space.Last month, Masimo announced the full-market release of the Hydration Index for the Masimo W1 watch. In the same press release, the company announced that a medical version of Masimo W1 would be available outside the United States for use in telehealth and telemonitoring applications via Masimo SafetyNet and Personal SafetyNet for healthcare providers and payers along with individual use.Masimo also announced the launch of the expansion of the HEOS platform in December to provide a robust and always-on connection to the Masimo Health secure cloud. This feature will add the ability to aggregate, record and display health data from wearable Masimo continuous and spot-check health and wellness devices.Masimo Corporation PriceMasimo Corporation PriceMasimo Corporation price | Masimo Corporation QuoteZacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Masimo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are AMN Healthcare Services, Inc.

In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Ulta Beauty (ULTA), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Ulta Beauty currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if ULTA is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this beauty products retailer holds up.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor ULTA, shares are up 3.65% over the past week while the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry is up 5.12% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 5.21% compares favorably with the industry's 3.22% performance as well.Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Ulta Beauty have risen 20.65%, and are up 27.1% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 8.98% and -14.65%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to ULTA's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. ULTA is currently averaging 537,366 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with ULTA.Over the past two months, 13 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost ULTA's consensus estimate, increasing from $21.34 to $22.87 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 12 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 2 downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that ULTA is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Ulta Beauty on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Coca-Cola (KO).Coke currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.55, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 11 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.55 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 11 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy, representing 72.7% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for KOBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for KOCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Coke here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Coke, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is KO a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Coke, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.8% over the past month to $2.48.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Coke. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Coke may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. In 2022, the Fundsmith Equity Fund declined -13.8% compared to a 7.8% decline for the MSCI World Index in sterling with dividends reinvested. However, the fund is the best performer in the Investment Association Global sector since its inception in November 2010. In addition, you can check the top 5 holdings of the fund to know its best picks in 2022.Fundsmith highlighted stocks like Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) in the 2022 yearly investor letter. Headquartered in Mountain View, California, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) provides financial management products and services to individuals, small businesses, and accounting professionals. On January 11, 2023, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) stock closed at $395.31 per share. One-month return of Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) was -0.31%, and its shares lost 28.51% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) has a market capitalization of $111.052 billion.Fundsmith made the following comment about Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) in its 2022 yearly investor letter:“Take the example of Microsoft and Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU). Microsoft shares are currently being valued at a P/E ratio of 25.0 times the consensus EPS estimate for the fiscal year ending June 2023. Meanwhile, Intuit is being valued at 28.4 times the non-GAAP consensus estimate for the fiscal year ending July 2023. Many investors and analysts may accept that Intuit is trading at a higher multiple given expectations of greater growth potential. However, Intuit removes share-based compensation from their non-GAAP EPS whereas Microsoft does not. Given that Intuit’s GAAP EPS guidance for the year ending 31st July 2023 is $6.92–$7.22, its non-GAAP guidance is $13.59–$13.89, and the consensus estimate for 2023 EPS is at $13.69, it seems clear that most sell-side analysts are accepting the company’s non-GAAP adjustments, which includes the removal of some $1.8bn of share-based compensation, in their estimates. If we include the impact of share-based compensation in Intuit’s 2023 EPS to make a more apples-to-apples comparison with Microsoft based upon GAAP EPS, Intuit’s 2023 EPS would be closer to $9, meaning that the shares would be trading at a multiple of about 43 times. I think investors and analysts may find a premium of 14% for Intuit over Microsoft (28.4 times versus 25.0 times) to be reasonable. I’m not so sure they are fully aware that Intuit shares are actually trading at a premium of 73% if share-based compensation is treated in the same manner between the two companies.Many investors and analysts, including us, look to cash flow metrics more than accrual profits. Unfortunately, share-based compensation may cause distortions in cash flow metrics as well, even when they follow GAAP. Under GAAP, share-based compensation is added back in the cash flow from operating activities, which in turn is used in the computation of free cash flow.  ..” (Click here to read the full text)Story continuesNew Trending Business Ideas for BeginnersRawpixel.com/Shutterstock.comIntuit Inc.

In addition, the company is establishing a 2030 scope 3 GHG emissions reduction target of 30 percent, relative to a 2020 baseline and in accordance with guidelines from the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). The company's previously announced goal to achieve net zero scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from global operations by 2050 remains unchanged.""We believe a more ambitious GHG reduction target is achievable and will create substantial value for all of our stakeholders,"" said Peter Vanacker, CEO of LyondellBasell. ""Reducing emissions while simultaneously building a world-class Circular and Low Carbon Solutions business is needed to meet the demands we are seeing throughout the value chain. This approach is not only good for society, but also good for business. We will follow a disciplined approach to prioritize high-return projects and will continue to meet or exceed our return expectations.""Estimates of the capital expenditures necessary to achieve its emissions reduction goals are built into the company's long-range plan. These investments are not expected to represent a significant portion of total capital expenditures over the next three years, nor change the capital allocation strategy. While many of the GHG emissions reduction projects are still in the early stages of development, the company will evaluate, pursue and prioritize its GHG emission investments based on each project's rate of return.LyondellBasell will submit its climate goals to SBTi to be validated against SBTi guidance. The SBTi defines and promotes best practice for corporate GHG emissions target setting aligned to the latest climate science.Story continuesIn the near term, LyondellBasell continues to execute its previously announced initiatives to reduce emissions, including:Startup of four power purchase agreements in Texas, representing approximately 400 thousand metric tons of the company's scope 2 GHG emissions annuallyPhasing out use of coal at its Wesseling, Germany site, reducing the site's scope 2 emissions by about 170 thousand metric tons annuallyAs announced in April 2022, the company is on track to close its Houston refinery by the end of December 2023. This is expected to reduce scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions by more than 3 million metric tons annually and scope 3 emissions by approximately 40 million metric tons annually.LyondellBasell also aims to secure at least 75 percent of its global electricity from low carbon power by 2030, a majority of which will come from its existing goal to procure a minimum of 50 percent of global electricity from renewable sources.Many of the GHG emissions reduction initiatives planned for implementation by 2030 will begin in 2024 and beyond as the company leverages existing asset turnaround schedules for its largest sites, including:Process heat recovery projects, electrification of a large process turbine and optimization of steam demand at its site in Wesseling, Germany in 2024Optimization of heated equipment through advanced digitization, efficiency improvements and fuel management at its site in Channelview, Texas in 2025In addition, the company's previously announced Circular and Low Carbon Solutions business will focus on achieving its goal to produce and market 2 million metric tons of recycled and renewable-based polymers annually by 2030, further reducing scope 3 emissions.Value chain collaboration remains a top priority for the company. Most recently, LyondellBasell joined the World Economic Forum Low Carbon Emitting Technologies (LCET) group to help accelerate the development and upscaling of the low carbon emitting technologies required for the chemical industry and related value chains to reach net zero emissions by 2050.Additional information regarding the company's transition plan, climate risk and capital allocation approach and its alignment to the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) requirements will be included in the 2022 LyondellBasell Sustainability Report.

The stock lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 1.29%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.8%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 10.96%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the oil refiner had gained 9.52% over the past month. This has outpaced the Oils-Energy sector's gain of 4.41% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 0.23% in that time.Valero Energy will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be January 26, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Valero Energy to post earnings of $6.45 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 161.13%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $41.12 billion, up 14.54% from the prior-year quarter.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Valero Energy. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 5.07% lower. Valero Energy is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors should also note Valero Energy's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 7.3. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 8.12.Meanwhile, VLO's PEG ratio is currently 1.22. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Valero Energy (VLO) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $6.89 a share, just 15 days from its upcoming earnings release on January 26, 2023.Valero Energy's Earnings ESP sits at 6.82%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $6.89 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.45.VLO is part of a big group of Oils-Energy stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at PBF Energy (PBF) as well.PBF Energy, which is readying to report earnings on February 16, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $5.16 a share, and PBF is 36 days out from its next earnings report.Story continuesPBF Energy's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 4% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.96.Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, VLO and PBF could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Since the company has significant exposure to the healthcare business, sustained membership growth is likely to have aided the quarterly performance. Community-based and senior offerings of the unit are likely to have triggered growth.UnitedHealthcare BusinessThrough this segment, UNH offers healthcare benefits around the world. While it has significant exposure to the Medicare and Medicaid markets, it also serves individuals and employers. The defensive properties of the sector enable UnitedHealth to maintain its momentum despite economic headwinds. In the last reported quarter, the segment’s revenues jumped 10.8% year over year to $62 billion, while operating income improved 43.3% to $3.8 billion.UnitedHealthcare's Q3 PerformanceConsidering the unit’s products, premiums increased 11.3% year over year to $59.4 billion in the third quarter while service revenues rose 1.2% to $2.4 billion. Total revenues from Employer &amp; Individual Domestic, Medicare &amp; Retirement, and Community &amp; State businesses came in at $59.9 billion, increasing 11.3%. However, from global operations, UNH reported revenues of $2,120 million, down 0.9% year over year.Forecast for Q4 Segment PerformanceThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealthcare’s revenues indicates a 10.3% year-over-year increase from the year-ago level of $56.4 billion while our estimate suggests a 10.9% rise. The consensus mark for fourth-quarter operating earnings signals a 20.2% year-over-year rise from $2.1 billion a year ago.The consensus mark for fourth-quarter 2022 medical care ratio is pegged at 83%, down from the year-ago level of around 84%, while our estimate of 82.8% suggests further improvement.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2022 global revenues indicates 9.8% year-over-year growth from $2,053 million. The consensus mark for UnitedHealthcare’s Community &amp; State revenues suggests an 8.8% rise from the year-ago period’s $14,133 million.Story continuesThe consensus mark for Medicare &amp; Retirement business’ revenues signals 13% year-over-year growth from $24.8 billion a year ago while our estimate indicates a 12.3% improvement.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealthcare’s total number of people served in commercial domestic business indicates a 0.2% increase from the year-ago level of 26,580 thousand while our estimate predicts a 0.3% year-over-year increase.Final ThoughtsThe UnitedHealthcare unit is expected to have positioned the company for remarkable year-over-year growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UNH’s fourth-quarter earnings signals a 15.4% increase from the prior-year figure of $4.48 per share while our estimate suggests a 14.4% year-over-year rise. The consensus estimate for revenues of $82.8 billion indicates a 12.3% increase from the year-ago reported figure while our estimate predicts a 12.6% rise.However, higher total costs might have affected the margins in the fourth quarter, making an earnings beat uncertain. Our estimate for medical costs indicates an 11.6% year-over-year increase while we expect operating expenses to have jumped 11.1%. Further, we expect the cost of products sold to have jumped 14.8% year over year in the to-be-reported quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for UnitedHealth this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is not the case here.UnitedHealth has an Earnings ESP of -0.79% and currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseUnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseUnitedHealth Group Incorporated price-eps-surprise | UnitedHealth Group Incorporated QuoteStocks to ConsiderHere are some companies from the broader Medical space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:Adicet Bio, Inc.

353,1f4fa52e-962d-376e-a9ee-bc9287b88a44,DHI,2023-01-12,Archer Daniels Midland and DR Horton have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/archer-daniels-midland-dr-horton-133301616.html,1673443981,STORY,"['ADM', 'DHI', 'UBER', 'LYFT']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – January 11, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Archer Daniels Midland ADM as the Bull of the Day and DR Horton DHI as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Uber Technologies UBER, Lyft LYFT and Baidu BIDU.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.Bull of the Day:Inflation has hit many parts of the world. You can see it in everything from wages to houses to cars to food prices. Rather than get down on the inflationary blues, why not invest in the stocks which are benefiting from the trend. It’s not stocks like the tech stocks that led the way previously which you should be looking at. Where can you find them?Leaning on the Zacks Rank allows you to uncover stocks with the strongest earnings trends. These earnings trends can show you what’s happening beneath the surface of many publicly traded companies. One such stock is today’s Bull of the Day, Archer Daniels Midland.Incorporated in Delaware in 1923, Archer Daniels Midland Company is successor to the Daniels Linseed Co. Founded in 1902, this Illinois-based company is one of the leading producers of food and beverage ingredients as well as goods made from various agricultural products.The company processes oilseeds, corn, wheat, cocoa and other feedstuffs. Moreover, it engages in the manufacturing, sale, and distribution of products like natural flavor ingredients, flavor systems, natural colors, proteins, emulsifiers, soluble fiber, polyols, hydrocolloids, natural health and nutrition products as well as other specialty food and feed ingredients.Archer Daniels Midland is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) which also enjoys a Zacks Value Style Score of A, Growth of A and Momentum of A to help it round out with a VGM Composite Score of A. The reason for the favorable rank is that analysts have been upping the ante for both this year and next year. While EPS growth is currently forecast to come in at 44% this year, there is a contraction for next year. However, over the last 90 days, our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year is up from $6.89 to $7.48 while next year’s number is up from $5.98 to $6.36.Story continuesBear of the Day:Housing has been one of the main benefactors of the inflationary surge. There was a perfect storm which sent parts of the country absolutely through the roof. Now, with interest rates on the rise, some areas of the country are beginning to feel the pinch. The good news for many is that they are locked in very low rates and are in a home they can stay in forever. The bad news is, it could make it tough for new buyers entering the market.Already, we are seeing earnings estimates come down for some of the homebuilders. That is why today’s Bear of the Day is DR Horton. D.R. Horton, Inc., based in Texas, is one of the leading national homebuilders, primarily engaged in the construction and sale of single-family houses both in the entry-level and move-up markets. D.R. Horton’s operations are spread across 106 markets in 33 states in the East, Midwest, Southeast, South Central, Southwest and West regions of the United States. Its houses are sold under the brand names D.R. Horton - America’s Builder, Emerald Homes, Express Homes and Freedom Homes.DR Horton is currently a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Building Products – Home Builders industry which ranks in the Bottom 6% of our Zacks Industry Rank. The reason for the unfavorable rank is that seven analysts have cut their estimates for the current year while four have done so for next year. The impact has cut our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year from $13.42 to $9.33 while next year’s number is off from $13.91 to $9.54.Additional content:UBER Benefits from Favorable Court RulingShares of Uber Technologies have been performing well in the markets lately, gaining 7.2% over the past two trading sessions. The upside can be attributed to a verdict issued by a New York City judge prohibiting pay raises for ride-sharing companies. The hikes were demanded by New York City's Taxi and Limousine Commission.The judge while delivering his verdict against the commission stated that it had used a faulty methodology to calculate the pay hike. The commission had used factors like the last summer’s steep increase in gas prices, which has come down since.The ruling vindicates Uber’s stand. It had sued the commission last month to try to block a significant pay increase for its drivers. Uber found the proposed increases unprecedented.In the lawsuit, Uber had stated last month that in the event of an unfavorable court ruling it would be forced to incur additional monthly cost in the band of $21-$23 million. In turn, Uber would have had to raise fares to drive its bottom line.Given this backdrop, the judge’s ruling has come as a boon for Uber. No wonder, its shares are rising.The ruling, which has prevented labor costs of ride sharing companies from increasing significantly, has also positively impacted the stock price of Uber’s rival Lyft. Shares of Lyft have risen 11.8% over the past two trading days.Following the judge’s ruling, the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which represents 25,000 taxi drivers in the city, tweeted, ""A few missing words in a Statement of Basis and Purpose does not justify denying a raise meant to help thousands of drivers with rent and groceries. Shame on Uber for spending millions on this heartless lawsuit only to deny drivers an increase of $1.66 more on an average trip.""The alliance wants the New York City's Taxi and Limousine Commission to tweak the rules in such a manner that in the future the ruling is in favor of a pay hike for drivers. Consequently, we expect investors to remain glued for further updates on this burning issue.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PickCurrently, Uber carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), while Lyft is Zacks #3 Ranked (Hold).Investors interested in the Internet-Services industry may, however, consider Baidu, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

JBL, PepsiCo, Inc. PEP, DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. DKS, Hologic, Inc. HOLX and Suzano S.A. SUZ.5 Stocks with High ROE to Buy as Rate Hike Fears SubsideThe U.S. equity markets inched up in the past few trading sessions as the December jobs report and contraction in the services sector instilled hopes that inflation was cooling. The latest nonfarm payrolls report showed that the U.S. economy added 223,000 jobs in December compared with broad-based expectations of 200,000 job additions, while wages increased 0.3%, contrary to expectations of a 0.4% rise. The ISM Services index recorded a reading of 49.6% for December, portraying contraction amid a pullback in new orders and production.The economic indicators aroused hopes that the overall economy was contracting enough for the Fed to consider putting the brakes on its aggressive stance against inflation, fueling the stock market rally. Investors widely expect the New Year rally to continue in the short term, with the Fed being more dovish toward the rate hike regime. The Fed had increased its benchmark interest rates by half a percentage point in its last policy meeting to a targeted range between 4.25% and 4.5% and put the “terminal rate” to a target range of 5-5.25%As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. Jabil Inc., PepsiCo, Inc., DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc., Hologic, Inc. and Suzano S.A. are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.Story continuesWhy ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Here are five of the 16 stocks that qualified the screen:Jabil: Headquartered in St. Petersburg, FL, Jabil is one of the largest global suppliers of electronic manufacturing services. The company offers electronics design, product management and after-market services to customers catering to aerospace, automotive, computing, consumer, defense, industrial, instrumentation, medical, networking, peripherals, storage and telecommunications industries.It delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 8.8%, on average, and has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 12%.

The latest nonfarm payrolls report showed that the U.S. economy added 223,000 jobs in December compared with broad-based expectations of 200,000 job additions, while wages increased 0.3%, contrary to expectations of a 0.4% rise. The ISM Services index recorded a reading of 49.6% for December, portraying contraction amid a pullback in new orders and production.The economic indicators aroused hopes that the overall economy was contracting enough for the Fed to consider putting the brakes on its aggressive stance against inflation, fueling the stock market rally. Investors widely expect the New Year rally to continue in the short term, with the Fed being more dovish toward the rate hike regime. The Fed had increased its benchmark interest rates by half a percentage point in its last policy meeting to a targeted range between 4.25% and 4.5% and put the “terminal rate” to a target range of 5-5.25%As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. Jabil Inc. JBL, PepsiCo, Inc. PEP, DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. DKS, Hologic, Inc. HOLX and Suzano S.A. SUZ are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.Why ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Story continuesScreening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 16 stocks that qualified the screen:Jabil: Headquartered in St. Petersburg, FL, Jabil is one of the largest global suppliers of electronic manufacturing services.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Right now, Regeneron is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Techne has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that REGN's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.REGN currently has a forward P/E ratio of 16.81, while TECH has a forward P/E of 41.13. We also note that REGN has a PEG ratio of 1.87. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. TECH currently has a PEG ratio of 2.57.Another notable valuation metric for REGN is its P/B ratio of 3.55. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, TECH has a P/B of 7.75.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help REGN earn a Value grade of B, while TECH has been given a Value grade of C.REGN has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than TECH, so it seems like value investors will conclude that REGN is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Among these, Regeneron (REGN) was down on disappointing updates on Eylea.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories:Regeneron Gives Eylea Update:  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. REGN announced that its lead drug Eylea sales were negatively impacted by a short-term shift to off-label use of Avastin (bevacizumab). On a preliminary basis, sales of Eylea in the fourth quarter came in at $1.5 billion, down 3% year over year. For 2022, sales on a preliminary basis were $6.26 billion, up 8% year over year.Per Regeneron, sales in the fourth quarter were also affected by the temporary closing of a fund that provides patient co-pay assistance.  Avastin is approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) but is used to treat age-related macular degeneration (AMD) on an off-label basis. Eylea, approved for various ophthalmology indications, has been a consistent performer, and a slowdown in sales will adversely impact the top line.Regeneron also announced that the Dermatologic and Ophthalmic Drugs Advisory Committee (“DODAC”) of the FDA met to discuss the proposed use of Eylea injection as a treatment for preterm infants with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). The DODAC provided advice to the FDA on appropriate communication and labeling of Eylea as a treatment for ROP in preterm infants. Regeneron is in alignment with the outcome of the discussion. The DODAC’s guidance will now be considered by the FDA in its review of the supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) for EYLEA in ROP, which was previously accepted for Priority Review and assigned a target action date of Feb 11, 2023.Regeneron currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

CINC surged after the company entered into a definitive agreement with pharma giant AstraZeneca AZN whereby the latter will acquire the former.  AstraZeneca will buy all of CinCor’s shares for a price of $26.00 per share in cash at closing plus a non-tradable contingent value right of $10.00 per share in cash payable upon a specified regulatory submission of a baxdrostat product.  The upfront cash portion of the consideration represents a transaction value of approximately $1.3 billion. The offer price represents a 121% premium over CinCor’s closing market price on Jan 6, 2023.  Investors were upbeat about the premium offered, and shares surged on the same.  The acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023. Lead asset, baxdrostat, a highly selective, oral small molecule inhibitor of aldosterone synthase, is in clinical development for treating hypertension and primary aldosteronism.Story continuesUpdates From Moderna:  Moderna MRNA announced updates on its pipeline development and outlook for 2023. The company expects to record around $18.4 billion as preliminary revenues from product sales in 2022, generated entirely from its COVID-19 vaccines. The company expects to incur around $3.3 billion in R&amp;D expenses for 2022. Management expects to close the year with cash and cash equivalents of around $18.0 billion. Moderna expects to record a minimum of around $5.0 billion from COVID-19 vaccine sales in 2023, based on confirmed advance purchase agreements and contract deferrals.

Another candidate is VX-522, an investigational mRNA-based therapy for cystic fibrosis (CF), which is being developed in collaboration with Vertex Pharmaceuticals.Editas Down on Layoffs: Editas Medicine EDIT announced that it will reduce its headcount by approximately 20%, which is expected to extend the company’s cash runway into 2025. As part of the portfolio reprioritization, Editas will shift all its resources toward EDIT-301, the company’s lead clinical program. The candidate is being developed for the treatment of severe sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia.EDIT has decided to discontinue all its investments in its previously lead pipeline candidate, EDIT-101, which is developed for treating Leber congenital amaurosis type 10 (LCA10), a rare genetic illness that causes blindness. The company also decided to discontinue its investments in other pipeline candidates, EDIT-103 for rhodopsin-associated autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa and EDIT-202 for solid tumors.Editas Medicine will continue advancing its cellular therapy assets through partnerships, including continued development of alpha-beta T-cell medicines with Bristol-Myers Squibb and gamma-delta T-cell medicines with Immatics N.V.PerformanceThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index has gained 2.23% in the past five trading sessions.

373,3cd6cf73-2eda-3086-8041-3425e0203eca,DGX,2023-01-12,Quest Diagnostics' Initiatives for Returning to the “Business of Play”,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-initiatives-returning-business-171000621.html,1673457000,STORY,['DGX'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / January 11, 2023 / More than 2 years following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Americans are eager to resume something like normal life again.This not only means returning to work and to school: perhaps just as importantly, it also means returning to recreation. Several innovative partnerships are allowing Quest to help people safely return to the activities they love. Here are a few examples.Quest plays key role in the return of the world's oldest marathonAfter being canceled for the first time in its 124-year history due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, runners were once again able to participate in the 2021 Boston Marathon. As the virus continued to race across the country with the introduction of new variants, the 125th running of the marathon faced multiple health and safety challenges. As part of the protocols mandated by the Boston Athletic Association (BAA), the 10,000 athletes as well as organizers, volunteers, and staff were all required to show either proof of vaccination or a current negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours of the race.At the request of the BAA, Quest was selected to be the sole on-site testing provider offering COVID-19 testing. To provide this high volume of testing, Quest employees were specially trained to work at the race's starting point as registration representatives, specimen collection observers, testers, supervisors, and support staff, playing a crucial role in providing a safer environment for runners, staff, and volunteers alike.""Quest's involvement in the Boston Marathon was crucial. Without providing a safe environment for runners, the Boston Athletic Association would not be able to conduct this historic race. My eyes well up with tears when I think about the extraordinary job and effort our Quest Diagnostics team took to operate this testing event. ""Gillian Plummer Director, Product Management, Sports DiagnosticsA safe return to the high seasIn mid-March 2020, the CDC issued a ""no-sail order"" for cruise ships due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It wasn't until more than a year later, in summer 2021, that the CDC allowed cruise lines to resume operations.Story continuesEnsuring a safe return to cruise ships required establishing best practices for health and safety.As part of these efforts, Quest Diagnostics partnered with Carnival Corporation and Royal Caribbean, the 2 largest cruise lines in the US, to make pre-board COVID-19 testing more accessible and convenient for guests, offering the reassurance of a trusted national laboratory provider.Regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status, all cruise passengers must present negative COVID-19 test results 2-3 days before embarking. In establishing their program, Carnival, Royal Caribbean, and Quest understood the importance of testing passengers before they arrived at their ports-thereby avoiding port congestion and the costs and frustration that could result from receiving positive COVID-19 tests at port, preventing guests from being allowed to board.Instead, the Carnival, Royal Caribbean, and Quest testing programs help to streamline pre-cruise preparation. By offering passengers the convenience of receiving quality COVID-19 testing close to home, the program makes testing available at more than 2,200 Quest Diagnostics patient service centers and select Walmart locations, Giant Eagle drive-throughs, and other retail pharmacy testing locations throughout the US.A return to ""Tennis Paradise""Referred to as ""Tennis Paradise"" by the tennis community, the BNP Paribas Tennis Open is a professional men's and women's tennis tournament in Indian Wells, CA traditionally held in March. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the organizers canceled the 2020 tournament and rescheduled for October 6 to 17, 2021, turning to Quest for assistance.Returning safely to the courts and courtside required a multifaceted effort. Quest employees registered all tournament participants and attendees and collected PCR and antigen samples (resulting in &gt;4,500 samples) from all in attendance, including world-class players, coaches, family members, international media, tournament officials, and even VIP world champion tennis legend Billie Jean King. Quest employees tested antigen samples directly on-site and provided results in fewer than 20 minutes. They also sent PCR samples out daily to Quest's lab in San Juan Capistrano, CA.This was the third world-class tennis event in 2021 for which Quest served as the testing lab for the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) - as part of its ongoing commitment to form innovative partnerships to enhance health, safety, and well- being in all walks of life.Our continued safe return to all we loveAs we learn to live with the ongoing challenges of COVID-19 and its endemic presence, Quest will continue to develop innovative partnerships to help us all return safely to the recreational activities that form such an important part of our lives.Read MoreQuest Diagnostics , Wednesday, January 11, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Quest Diagnostics on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Quest Diagnostics Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/quest-diagnosticsEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Quest DiagnosticsView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/734880/Quest-Diagnostics-Initiatives-for-Returning-to-the-Business-of-Play]"

Each blog highlights a different Cisco employee whose work makes a positive impact on people, communities, or the planet.Cisco Networking Academy is one of the world's largest and longest-standing purpose-driven IT skills-to-jobs programs, impacting the lives of more than 3 million learners annually (17.5 million since inception) in 190 countries. 95 percent of learners attribute their participation in the program to helping them obtain a job or educational opportunity.On October 18, 2022, Networking Academy celebrated its 25-year anniversary and announced an ambitious goal to offer digital and cybersecurity skills training to 25 million learners over the next ten years to prepare them for in-demand jobs. Networking Academy is aligned with Cisco's purpose to power an inclusive future for all, one learner at a time.As an instructor teaching Networking Academy courses to community college students in Rhode Island during the early days of the program in 1999, to her current role as its Director of Business Operations-Lynn Bloomer's service and commitment to empowering learners through technology and education is profound. Recently, I met with Lynn to learn more about her story.Can you share some of your early background with me? Who/what were your greatest influences?Lynn: I grew up in a small coastal town located in southern Rhode Island. Tourists would travel to my town to visit and vacation, but there weren't many residents who lived there year-round. I went to kindergarten with the same group of kids who I graduated high school with. It was the kind of town where everybody knew everybody.My immediate family is small, consisting of my dad, mom, sister, and I. Growing up, I really looked up to my big sister, who is four years older than me and very protective. My parents have always been supportive of me. I have a large extended family-my grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins also offered a strong support system. My family has significantly influenced the decisions I made and the direction I took in life.Story continuesWhat piqued your interest in technology?Lynn: I left Rhode Island to attend college at Villanova University in Pennsylvania, where I completed my BS in Electrical Engineering. I followed in my family's footsteps-my dad was an electrical engineer, and my sister also received her BS in Electrical Engineering at Villanova. My first job out of college was as a litigation consultant in New York. Most of the work I was doing wasn't related to my educational background.The company I worked for in New York had six offices throughout the U.S., and this was before we had email. It was during the time when the Internet was just starting to take off. If my office in New York was working on a case and we needed help from somebody in another office location, we'd have to save the file on a floppy disk and FedEx it to them so they could make changes.When I began thinking about pursuing my masters, I was really interested in how we could use technology to connect all these offices through a network to enable people to collaborate more effectively regardless of their physical locations. I returned to Villanova University and decided to complete my MS in Computer Engineering.How did you become involved with Networking Academy?Lynn: While I was getting my masters, I had an opportunity to teach a review course for an engineer and training exam. It went really well, and I loved it. So, my chairman invited me to teach a full senior-level Electrical Engineering class. My day job as a graduate student was maintaining the labs at the university and my night job was teaching students as an adjunct instructor.Eventually, my husband and I decided to move back to Rhode Island after about ten years of being away. It was my husband who encouraged me to apply for full-time teaching positions as he had observed how excited I would get about my night job back at Villanova. Community College of Rhode Island (CCRI) was the perfect fit.While I was teaching at CCRI, Cisco came to pitch their new Networking Academy program to us. The curriculum was shared with us on a floppy disk so we could evaluate it and determine if we wanted to participate. We decided to move forward with the program. CCRI became the first academy in Rhode Island. I taught my first Networking Academy class in 1999.Tell me how your role with Networking Academy has changed and evolved throughout your career.Lynn: Given that the Networking Academy program was just getting started, Cisco would pull in a lot of its instructors for help. I was still teaching full-time at CCRI when I was invited to intern at Cisco for a few hours a week to write assessment questions. The program was growing quickly, and I was recruited for a full-time role with Cisco in 2000 as a CCNA/CCNP Product Manager.I took nearly a month to decide whether I wanted to leave teaching because I loved working with students and planned to retire in that role. But the opportunity at Cisco seemed unique. I loved having an impact in the classroom but being a part of the greater Networking Academy team was enticing as it would enable me to broaden my scope and increase my impact. Additionally, I was able to remain at CCRI as an adjunct instructor. Even though I was working full-time at Cisco, I continued teaching at CCRI for over 15 years.I later transitioned into the role of Business Architect &amp; Process Manager for Networking Academy, which allowed me to represent what the instructors needed and what the business needed, before taking a few years off from working to stay home with my young daughter. In 2008, I returned to Cisco as part of a different team. In 2012, I received a call from a colleague who invited me to interview for the role of Strategy and Planning Project Manager for Corporate Affairs.By 2014, I made my return to Networking Academy. In a sense, it felt as though I was returning home. I currently serve as the Director of Business Operations. I drive strategy and lead a team responsible for the delivery of multiple Networking Academy services. Other key responsibilities include providing customer support, legal support, student career services and business transformation. Annual planning, budget management, talent management and forecasting are also part of my scope.Has being a female in the technology space impacted your experience? How so?Lynn: When I was in college, there weren't many Electrical Engineering majors who were women. Out of 55 to 60 students, there were probably 4 or 5 of us. My school was very supportive, and the instructors didn't treat us differently nor did our peers. I never felt out of place. I think a big part of this is going back to my early influences-my parents instilled a lot of confidence in my sister and me. While I recognize that I've been part of the minority as a female in the technology space, I never felt as though anything was beyond my reach.My advice for young women who are interested in pursuing careers in technology is to recognize that you can do anything you put your mind to. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. If you work hard, if you are determined and committed-you're going to be successful.View original content hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-inc Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/734825/People-Behind-CSR-at-Cisco-Empowering-Learners-Through-Technology-and-Education]"
