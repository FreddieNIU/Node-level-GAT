One area of focus will be how these big financial institutions are coping with the Federal Reserve's high for longer interest rate policy. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter David Hollerith gives a preview of what investors can expect.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptJOSH LIPTON: And big bank earnings kicking off on Friday as big name players, such as JP Morgan and Citi, gear up to report their quarterly results. Let's get right to Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith with a preview on what investors can expect.DAVID HOLLERITH: Yeah. So Josh, the outlook for banks has changed a lot sort of in the last few weeks of Q3. Deposit outflows don't really look as much of an issue as they were for Q2. But the Federal Reserve's signal to keep interest rates higher for longer is obviously going to pressure banking profitability going forward. And this is sort of a time for banks to come out and show investors that they can hang with a higher for longer environment.And now, I would also point out that given the rise in the 10 and 30-year bond yields, the unrealized losses that banks keep on their balance sheets are going to be worse this quarter. Taken together, obviously, bank stocks have widely underperformed the S&amp;P year-to-date. And, you know, there's going to be a big question here about whether or not this is sort of the bottom, so to speak.Three of the big four banks report Friday. And JPMorgan Chase is expected to steal the show as being the lender that is best positioned to withstand higher rates for longer. It's the only one that's expected to show a jump in core revenue compared to last quarter. It's also supposed to outpace peers on the year-ago period. Bank of America and then Charles Schwab and then Truist are among the larger banks that have higher unrealized losses. So they're going to be needing to thread the needle here.Story continuesAgain, this has been framed by analysts as more of a stock performance issue than a liquidity issue like we saw in the spring. But investors are clearly very mindful of this. So we'll want to see what management says about that.And then I think just going forward on the bank credit side of things, which is sort of the looming issue commercial, you know, real estate. I think that is not looking to be noticeably worse, although we are expecting to see most banks sort of take higher net charge-offs, meaning they're going to be marking down more loans as having borrowers that are unlikely to repay. So all that taken together, we're kind of at an inflection point where, you know, we're staring at the worst of what bank lending is looking like. And most is hinging on the forward outlook for the next couple of quarters.Results actually do not appear to be that bad. But again, it's going to hinge a lot on how banks are looking to the future.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. A lot to consider here as we come up against this quarter. It will really be interesting to see if it's the bottom for some of these banks in terms of performance around rates. David Hollerith-- and if it's the bottom rates for that matter. David Hollerith, appreciate it.]"

(IBKR) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/interactive-brokers-group-inc-ibkr-140016948.html,1696946416,STORY,"['IBKR', 'SCHW']","[Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (IBKR) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 17, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.47 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +36.1%.Revenues are expected to be $1.08 billion, up 37.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.33% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Interactive Brokers Group, Inc.For Interactive Brokers Group, Inc.The Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.23%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. Will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. Would post earnings of $1.41 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.32, delivering a surprise of -6.38%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. Appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerThe Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW), another stock in the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.76 for the quarter ended September 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -30.9%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $4.69 billion, down 14.7% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for The Charles Schwab Corporation has been revised 3% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -2.45%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that The Charles Schwab Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

Its revenues and earnings in the quarter are expected to have declined on a year-over-year basis.In the second quarter of 2023, Schwab’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from solid performance of the asset management business. The absence of fee waivers and solid brokerage account numbers acted as tailwinds. However, a fall in revenues due to higher funding costs, lower volatility and softer investor sentiments posed a major headwind.The company has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three and missed in one of the trailing four quarters.The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseThe Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseThe Charles Schwab Corporation price-eps-surprise | The Charles Schwab Corporation QuoteSchwab’s activities in the to-be-reported quarter did not encourage analysts to revise earnings estimates upward. In the past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for SCHW’s third-quarter earnings has been unchanged at 76 cents per share. The estimate indicates a decline of 30.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for third-quarter earnings is pinned at 75 cents.The consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $4.69 billion, which indicates a fall of 14.7% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for total revenues is also $4.69 billion.Before we take a look at what our quantitative model predicts, let’s check the factors that are likely to have impacted Schwab’s third-quarter performance.Key Factors &amp; Estimates for Q3While the risk of a near-term recession has faded, concerns like the economic slowdown, the central bank’s hawkish monetary policy and other geopolitical issues remain, which led to ambiguity among investors in the third quarter. Due to these factors, market volatility and client activity were subdued in the quarter.In addition to these macro factors, SCHW’s trading performance is expected to have been impacted by the temporary attrition of TD Ameritrade clients and advisors.In July and August, SCHW’s core net new assets declined 57% and 89% from the respective prior-year months because of client attrition.Moreover, since the third quarter is a seasonally weak quarter for the capital markets, Schwab’s trading revenues are likely to have been hurt to some extent.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter trading revenues is pegged at $814 million, which suggests a decline of 12.5% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for trading revenues is pinned at $795.7 million, indicating a decline of 14.4%.Coming to net interest revenues, the consensus estimate for average interest-earning assets for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $461 billion, which suggests a decline of 21.5% from the prior-year quarter’s reported level.While the Federal Reserve continued to tighten its monetary policy in the third quarter, raising interest rates by another 25 basis points in July, SCHW’s interest income is not expected to have improved much because of relatively weaker loan demand and an increase in funding costs.Due to the economic uncertainty, Schwab has been forced to use other sources of funding to make up for the lack of cash flow. The company noted that it was turning to more expensive sources of funding, like borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Bank, to make up for its lack of cash flow.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter net interest revenues is pegged at $2.29 billion, which indicates a year-over-year decline of 21.8%. Our estimate for the metric is $2.48 billion, suggesting a decline of 15.2%.Nevertheless, the consensus estimate for SCHW’s asset management and administration fees of $1.22 billion implies a rise of 16.7% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. We project the metric to rise 8.8% to $1.14 billion.Schwab’s operating expenses have been elevated in the past few quarters. Due to persistent regulatory spending and strategic buyouts to drive efficiency, overall expenses are expected to have been high in the to-be-reported quarter. We project total expenses of $2.98 billion for the quarter, implying a rise of 5.7% from the year-ago quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsAccording to our quantitative model, the chances of Schwab beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings this time are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for Schwab is -2.45%.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Stocks Worth A LookA few finance stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming releases per our model, are Wells Fargo WFC and PNC Financial PNC.The Earnings ESP for Wells Fargo is +3.83% and carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 79% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Nucor, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Nucor ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Nucor?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Nucor. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Nucor's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Nucor is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 10.0% and 8.8%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 14 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of NucorThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that Nucor Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$228m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 20% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Nucor better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Nucor (at least 1 which doesn't sit too well with us)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

TITN, PVH Corp. PVH, Unum Group UNM, AAR Corp. AIR and Valero Energy Corp. VLO.4 Value Stocks with Impressive EV-to-EBITDA Ratios to Snap UpThe price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple enjoys wide-scale popularity among investors seeking stocks trading at a bargain. In addition to being a widely used tool for screening stocks, P/E is a popular metric to work out the fair market value of a firm. But even this ubiquitously used valuation multiple has a few limitations.Although P/E is the most popular valuation metric, a more complicated multiple called EV-to-EBITDA works even better. Often considered a better alternative to P/E, it gives the true picture of a company's valuation and earnings potential, and has a more complete approach to valuation. While P/E considers a firm's equity portion, EV-to-EBITDA determines its total value.Titan Machinery Inc., PVH Corp., Unum Group, AAR Corp. and Valero Energy Corp. are some stocks with attractive EV-to-EBITDA ratios.What Makes EV-to-EBITDA a Better Alternative?EV-to-EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company's market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents.The other component of the multiple, EBITDA, gives a better idea of a company's profitability as it removes the impact of non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings. It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows.Just like P/E, the lower the EV-to-EBITDA ratio, the more attractive it is. A low EV-to-EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued.EV-to-EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company's balance sheet that P/E ratio does not. Due to this reason, EV-to-EBITDA is generally used to value the potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume. Stocks boasting a low EV-to-EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates.Story continuesAnother shortcoming of P/E is that it can't be used to value a loss-making firm. A company's earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. On the other hand, EV-to-EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value companies making losses but are EBITDA-positive.EV-to-EBITDA is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. Moreover, it can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt.However, EV-to-EBITDA is not devoid of shortcomings and alone cannot conclusively determine a stock's inherent potential and future performance. The multiple varies across industries and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries, given their diverse capital expenditure requirements.Hence, a strategy entirely based on EV-to-EBITDA might not yield the desired results. But you can club it with other major ratios such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) to screen value stocks.Here are our five picks out of the 12 stocks that passed the screen:Titan Machinery operates a network of full-service agricultural and construction equipment dealer locations in North America and Europe.

The company also offers a suite of products for various non-smartphone markets, including wireless base stations, cable TV and networking equipment, and infrastructure and military applications. With a current stock price of $92.86 and a GF Value of $109.48, Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) appears to be modestly undervalued.Qorvo (QRVO): A Closer Look at Its Modest UndervaluationUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that represents the current intrinsic value of a stock. It is calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line on our summary page provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should ideally be traded.According to the GF Value, Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) appears to be modestly undervalued. This conclusion is based on historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on Qorvo's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. A stock price significantly above the GF Value Line may indicate overvaluation and poor future returns. Conversely, a stock price significantly below the GF Value Line may suggest undervaluation and higher future returns.Story continuesGiven Qorvo's modest undervaluation, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Qorvo (QRVO): A Closer Look at Its Modest UndervaluationLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthBefore investing in a company, it's crucial to assess its financial strength.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades: UBS upgraded Rivian Automotive (RIVN) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $24, down from $26. The firm sees a reduced probability of an additional capital raise over the next year or so with capital likely not needed until the end of 2025 and thinks the market can refocus on improving fundamentals with the fundraising out of the way.BofA upgraded Electronic Arts (EA) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $150, up from $145. With investors cautious on the rebranding of FIFA and EA Sports, the stock's balance of risk looks attractive again, the firm says.Piper Sandler upgraded Exact Sciences (EXAS) to Overweight from Neutral with an unchanged price target of $90. With strong Cologuard growth and a ""clear path"" to five years growth rates of above 10%, the 36% pullback in shares since the highs in July ""represent a pretty compelling entry point,"" the firm argues.Jefferies upgraded Pinnacle Financial (PNFP) to Hold from Underperform with an unchanged price target of $71. The firm says the risk of negative estimate revisions due to Bankers Healthcare Group is no longer valid.JPMorgan upgraded Acadia Pharmaceuticals (ACAD) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $32, up from $29. The shares have underperformed the broader biotech markets over the recent months and are down 35% from its summer highs due to concerns related to Nuplazid's composition of matter patents, the firm notes.The homepage of the Qorvo website. (Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) (SOPA Images via Getty Images)Top 5 Downgrades:Citi downgraded Qorvo (QRVO) to Sell from Neutral with a price target of $78, down from $116. While the company's China sales have already come down over the last year due to weak China smartphone demand, increasing competition from Chinese domestic RF component makers will lead to potential share losses and a weak sales recovery in 2024, the firm tells investors in a research note.Citi downgraded Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) to Sell from Neutral with a price target of $87, down from $116. The firm sees increased China substitution risk post the recent Huawei Mate 60 phone launch, which it believes uses domestic radio frequency and connectivity chips.JPMorgan downgraded Juniper Networks (JNPR) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $29, down from $32. Cloud and service provider headwinds position Juniper for downside earnings risk and a pullback in the stock's valuation multiple, the firm tells investors in a research note.JPMorgan downgraded Corning (GLW) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $36, down from $43. The magnitude of earnings upside in the near- to medium-term is likely to be more muted than previously anticipated and the ""tepid recovery"" is likely to ""underwhelm relative to elevated consensus expectations"" in Q4 and 2024, the firm argues.UBS downgraded NextEra Energy Partners (NEP) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $20, down from $74. Following the announcement reducing distribution growth expectations from 12% to 6% year-over-year, the firm sees limited near-term positive catalysts to drive a re-rating of the shares.Story continuesThe company sign of ARM at a trade expo in Shanghai. (LONG WEI / Feature China/Future Publishing via Getty Images) (Future Publishing via Getty Images)Top 5 Initiations: Daiwa initiated coverage of Arm (ARM) with a Buy rating and $63 price target. Arm's processor architecture speeds time to market and lowers cost, and its expanded portfolio, especially in complex areas, will aid growth and margins, the firm tells investors in a research note.Scotiabank initiated coverage of MongoDB (MDB) with a Sector Perform rating and $335 price target. The firm, which sees ""minimal AI tailwind"" to MongoDB in 2024, notes that the Street's subscription revenue growth forecast for FY25 is ""among the fastest in software.""TD Cowen initiated coverage of Advance Auto Parts (AAP) with a Market Perform rating and $55 price target. The firm awaits better visibility into the company's long-term revenue, margin and free cash flow potential as a new CEO works to stabilize and improve trends.TD Cowen initiated coverage of AutoZone (AZO) with an Outperform rating and $2,975 price target. The firm sees catalysts that should support ""strong revenue growth,"" projecting revenue to grow at a 7.7% compound annual growth rate from FY23-FY27.TD Cowen initiated coverage of O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) with an Outperform rating and $1,100 price target. The firm views O'Reilly as a ""best-in-class operator"" and expects ongoing market share growth across both its do-it-for-me and do-it-yourself channels.]"
13,8fb6390a-d431-35dd-9f92-2a729a3af47d,QRVO,2023-10-11,4 Solid Semiconductor Stocks to Buy on Rebounding Sales,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-solid-semiconductor-stocks-buy-120500021.html,1696939500,STORY,"['LRCX', 'NVDA', 'ON', 'QRVO']","[The semiconductor industry is making a solid turnaround after a dull second half of 2022. Sales are increasing once again as demand continues to be high and price pressures are easing. Although sales are still down year over year, the steady growth over the past few months suggests that the worst is over.Given this situation, investing in semiconductor stocks like NVIDIA Corporation NVDA,Qorvo, Inc. QRVO, ON Semiconductor Corporation ON and Lam Research Corporation LRCX would be a prudent choice.Microchip Sales GrowSemiconductor sales grew 1.9% month over month in August, totaling $44 billion compared to July’s total of $43.2 billion, the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) said on Oct 4. Although sales were down 6.8% year over year in August, the market is steadily getting back on its feet.Regionally, semiconductor sales rose 4.6% in the Americas, 1.2% in Asia Pacific and 2% in China.  John Neuffer, SIA president and CEO, said, “Global semiconductor sales ticked up on a month-to-month basis for the sixth consecutive month in August, demonstrating a slow-and-steady increase in market demand during the middle of the year.”Needless to say, 2023 has been good for semiconductors after sales started nosediving in the second half of 2022. Semiconductor sales totaled $124.5 billion in the second quarter of 2023, up 4.7% from the prior quarter.With sales increasing in July and August, the third quarter will likely be impressive for the industry. Also, industry experts remain optimistic about a surge in sales consistent with earlier predictions.The demand for semiconductors started shrinking in the latter half of 2022, following strong sales in 2020 and 2021, primarily fueled by the surge in remote working prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic.However, this slowdown intensified due to elevated prices, attributed to the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary tightening policy aimed at fighting record-high inflation.Story continuesAlongside these economic factors, a range of geopolitical factors and the enduring impacts of the pandemic played a role in the decline of semiconductor sales during the latter half of 2022 and the initial months of 2023.The semiconductor market is poised to grow further as inflation continues to decline and price pressures ease.Moreover, the market is expected to benefit from growing worldwide integration and widespread use of consumer electronics. Additionally, the increasing impact and widespread application of cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and machine learning are expected to play a pivotal role in driving continued demand for semiconductors.Our ChoicesGiven the promising future, it would be wise to invest in semiconductor stocks. Below are four chip stocks that investors can gain from in the near term.NVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit (GPU). Over the years, NVDA’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to AI-based solutions that now support high-performance computing, gaming and virtual reality platforms. NVIDIA’s GPU success can be attributed to its parallel processing capabilities supported by thousands of computing cores necessary to run deep-learning algorithms.NVIDIA’s expected earnings growth rate for next year is 52%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 37.3% over the past 60 days. NVDA presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

They also lowered their calendar year 2024 estimates for earnings per share and slashed their price targets.The Citi analysts noted that they believe the Huawei device will likely use domestic radio-frequency and connectivity components, eating into the two companies' China businesses.Weakness in the Chinese handset market has already hit both of the firms' sales in the world's second-largest economy for over a year, Citi flagged.Related ArticlesSkyworks Solutions, Qorvo shares slip after Citi lowers ratings of chipmakersFactbox-Top issues in Detroit Three's negotiations with UAWJetBlue anticipates revenue growth, Citigroup maintains neutral stance]"

TITN, PVH Corp. PVH, Unum Group UNM, AAR Corp. AIR and Valero Energy Corp. VLO.4 Value Stocks with Impressive EV-to-EBITDA Ratios to Snap UpThe price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple enjoys wide-scale popularity among investors seeking stocks trading at a bargain. In addition to being a widely used tool for screening stocks, P/E is a popular metric to work out the fair market value of a firm. But even this ubiquitously used valuation multiple has a few limitations.Although P/E is the most popular valuation metric, a more complicated multiple called EV-to-EBITDA works even better. Often considered a better alternative to P/E, it gives the true picture of a company's valuation and earnings potential, and has a more complete approach to valuation. While P/E considers a firm's equity portion, EV-to-EBITDA determines its total value.Titan Machinery Inc., PVH Corp., Unum Group, AAR Corp. and Valero Energy Corp. are some stocks with attractive EV-to-EBITDA ratios.What Makes EV-to-EBITDA a Better Alternative?EV-to-EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company's market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents.The other component of the multiple, EBITDA, gives a better idea of a company's profitability as it removes the impact of non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings. It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows.Just like P/E, the lower the EV-to-EBITDA ratio, the more attractive it is. A low EV-to-EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued.EV-to-EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company's balance sheet that P/E ratio does not. Due to this reason, EV-to-EBITDA is generally used to value the potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume. Stocks boasting a low EV-to-EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates.Story continuesAnother shortcoming of P/E is that it can't be used to value a loss-making firm. A company's earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. On the other hand, EV-to-EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value companies making losses but are EBITDA-positive.EV-to-EBITDA is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. Moreover, it can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt.However, EV-to-EBITDA is not devoid of shortcomings and alone cannot conclusively determine a stock's inherent potential and future performance. The multiple varies across industries and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries, given their diverse capital expenditure requirements.Hence, a strategy entirely based on EV-to-EBITDA might not yield the desired results. But you can club it with other major ratios such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) to screen value stocks.Here are our five picks out of the 12 stocks that passed the screen:Titan Machinery operates a network of full-service agricultural and construction equipment dealer locations in North America and Europe.

To skip our detailed analysis of the US markets today, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Growth Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.Is Now The Right Time To Invest?Equity investors in American stocks today might be wondering when the right time to invest in US stocks will come around. With market volatility and economic conditions across the world making most investors and businesses cautious about major decisions involving larger sums of money, this line of thinking is becoming more commonplace than some might have expected. At this moment, one thing investors can do to ensure they make sound investment decisions is to remain apprised of not only current events in the US markets but also of expert opinions on how to approach the market at present.On October 10, Paul Tudor Jones, the founder and Chief Investment Officer of Tudor Investment, joined CNBC's 'Squawk Box' to give his take on current market trends and more. Here are some of his comments:""The United States is probably in its weakest fiscal position since, certainly, World War II, with debt-to-GDP at a 122%. So, it's a really tough time for, I think, the moral voice of the world.""Geopolitical Tensions As A Barrier To InvestmentJones sees the current geopolitical environment of the world as ""the most threatening"" and ""challenging"" environment he has ever seen, with the recent developments in the Israel-Palestine crisis and the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian crisis. Here's what he had to say on these issues, alongside how they and US economic conditions are impacting equity investors in the US:""It's a really challenging time to wanna be an equity investor in US stocks right now, it's really hard, because again you've got the geopolitical uncertainty, which we, I think, have come to live with to a certain extent. Equally as much of a problem is the fiscal situation that we're facing in the United States, which is gonna require a completely different political mentality.""Story continuesAll in all, Jones highlighted the existing barriers and challenges that may hinder equity investors in the US markets from taking part in the investment cycles. However, investors can still remain active in the markets by carefully picking out reliable stocks with high growth potential, especially those stocks that have lived up to their growth potential in the past. These include several companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), among others that are considered to be stellar growth stock options today.

(NYSE:NOW) in its July 2023 investor letter:“US-based software company ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) delivered another impressive quarterly result that came in ahead of analysts expectations. Subscription revenues grew 25% year-on-year in constant currency terms to $2.1 billion and operating margins came in at 23.4%. Despite ongoing variability in the macro backdrop, ServiceNow continues to benefit from spend prioritisation within the IT tech stack as vendors look to consolidate back-office apps onto an integrated platform. The company’s operational metrics held firm, with remaining performance obligations growing 24% year-on-year to $14.2 billion and renewal rates ticking up to 99%. As we have mentioned before, the company’s renewal rates are noteworthy as not only are they best-in-class but they are also remarkably consistent, typically in the range of 97% to 99%. They speak to the mission critical nature of the platform and are a key driver of long term annuity value.Investors were also excited to hear management speak to the burgeoning artificial intelligence (AI) opportunity. Things are moving fast and the company plans to release new premium offerings of their workflow products – across IT, customer service and human resources – towards the back end of 2023 that will have new Generative AI capabilities embedded into them. Management also mentioned that they anticipate these new offerings could deliver a “minimum” 60%-plus list price uplift relative to its current Pro versions as they provide meaningful productivity improvements for end users. Whilst it’s still early days, ServiceNow appears well placed to capitalise on the Generative-AI opportunity and we believe it could be a meaningful driver for the company’s next phase of growth.”13.

(NASDAQ:ADBE). Their total stake value was $6.1 billion.Here's what Harding Loevner said about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Although the market initially feared that Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) would lose out to Al image-generating programs Dall-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, the design-software giant has since released its own generative Al model called Firefly. One feature of Firefly is that it can help designers generate ideas and create and manipulate images more quickly in Photoshop or Illustrator that can then be processed by other Adobe products for further development, fostering a seamless workflow. There’s more work involved when trying to manipulate images created by outside tools. Also, because Firefly is trained on Adobe’s vast inventory of stock images and other licensed content, it can generate professional-quality, commercially viable results, further setting it apart from generic models that are often trained on copyrighted content that isn’t properly licensed. These are just two examples of how Al enhances the Adobe suite, which should allow the company to raise subscription prices and upsell users.”11. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor company that offers x86 microprocessors and graphics processing units (GPUs).

(NASDAQ:AMD) shares on August 3 by Cody Acree at Benchmark.This is what Artisan Partners said about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Among our top contributors were Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NU Holdings and Netflix. AMD’s data center CPUs are used in the cloud service provider (CSP) servers. In addition to the broader secular tailwind from cloud adoption, the company has a performance and pricing advantage over Intel, which we believe will enable it to continue capturing market share. However, the recent stock price rally was due to growing excitement around the company’s AI exposure. It will launch its new MI300 graphics processing unit (GPU) chip later this year to compete against the dominant market leader NVIDIA. Similar to its approach that won market share from Intel within the CPU market, AMD’s product will aim to provide similar performance at a more attractive price. AMD is already working with Microsoft and Meta, while Amazon publicly stated that it is evaluating AMD’s inferencing chips. Using assumptions around the total GPU market size, potential market share gains and price points, our research indicates this could be a $20 billion opportunity for AMD. That would nearly double its revenue. While the company has not historically missed many deadlines, there is execution risk as it works to manufacture and distribute these complex chips at scale, which, combined with an elevated valuation after the stock’s strong performance run, led us to trim the position.”10. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 114Seaport Global analyst David Joyce initiated coverage on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares with a Buy rating and a $482 price target on October 6.A total of 114 hedge funds were long Netflix, Inc.

Thermo Fisher currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Thermo Fisher’s business strategy primarily includes expansion through strategic acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment the company’s existing products and services. As a result of these acquisitions, till the end of fiscal 2022, the company recorded significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on its balance sheet, amounting to approximately $41.20 billion and $1.24 billion, respectively.Its recent strategic acquisitions too are likely to drive future growth.

(NYSE:TMO) Stock Has Shown Weakness Lately But Financials Look Strong: Should Prospective Shareholders Make The Leap?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-inc-nyse-130041961.html,1696942841,STORY,['TMO'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Thermo Fisher Scientific's (NYSE:TMO) recent performance, when its stock has declined 4.5% over the past three months. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Thermo Fisher Scientific's  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Thermo Fisher Scientific is:13% = US$5.7b ÷ US$44b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.13 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Thermo Fisher Scientific's Earnings Growth And 13% ROEAt first glance, Thermo Fisher Scientific seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 13%. This certainly adds some context to Thermo Fisher Scientific's exceptional 20% net income growth seen over the past five years. We believe that there might also be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesWe then performed a comparison between Thermo Fisher Scientific's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 21% in the same 5-year period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is TMO worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether TMO is currently mispriced by the market.Is Thermo Fisher Scientific Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Thermo Fisher Scientific's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 5.8%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 94% of its profits. So it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business and this reflects in its earnings growth number.Additionally, Thermo Fisher Scientific has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 5.6%. Still, forecasts suggest that Thermo Fisher Scientific's future ROE will rise to 20% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that Thermo Fisher Scientific's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

Declining COVID-19 testing revenues impede the company's growth. The contraction of margins, due to escalating costs remain a concern.However, on a positive note, strong execution of proven growth strategy, launching a range of high-impact, innovative new products are likely to aid the company's growth in coming quarters.

The asset divestments might hinder BP's future cash generating opportunities going forward.BP's balance sheet is more levered than most peers, limiting its financial flexibility. Thus, the integrated energy company is more vulnerable to economic downturn than its peers. While crude oil prices are currently on an upward trend, the broader commodity pricing environment is not as robust as it was a year ago.As a result, the Zacks analyst anticipates that the leading integrated energy company's revenue to decrease in 2023. Also, we project that exploration expenses will rise by 47% this year, impacting the company's bottom line.

If you want to explore similar companies, you can go to 5 Most Innovative Companies in the World in 2023.Innovation doesn’t arrive straight away. Governments and organizations invest heavily in research and development, scientific publications, and other areas of research to drive innovation each year.According to WIPO’s Global Innovation Index 2023, investments in innovation showed a mixed performance in 2022, compared to the boom in 2021. Despite moderate growth compared to 2021, scientific publications, research and development, venture capital deals, and patents continued to increase higher than ever in 2022. Scientific publications grew moderately by 1.5% to around 2 million in 2022. Worldwide research and development expenditure by the world’s leading R&amp;D spending corporations crossed $1.1 trillion, a record high in 2022. This research spending in 2022 is a key driver for innovation for companies in 2023. Tech giants including Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have been making ample developments in AI. Thanks to their investment in AI over the past few years. Most Innovative Economies in 2023The Global Innovation Index 2023 ranks Switzerland as the most innovative economy for the 13th year now. Sweden is the second most innovative country followed by the United States at third. The Swiss government spends a huge amount on innovation. However, it is no surprise that the United States is way ahead when it comes to innovation as it has bigger corporations and they invest heavily in innovative technologies. As we mentioned earlier, 10 out of the 15 most innovative companies are based in the United States. For instance, the American tech giant Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) spent around $35 billion on research and development in 2022, compared to Switzerland’s $33 billion in research and development in 2022. The United States continues to lead the Global Innovation Index's innovation indicators.

Green technologies' exports from developed countries soared from $60 billion in 2018 to $156 billion in 2021. Whereas, the developing economies' exports for green technologies jumped from around $57 billion to about $75 billion, in the same period. Companies Delivering in AI in 2023Companies are speeding up in adapting generative AI and other in-demand technologies. American companies lead when it comes to the adoption of a new technology. The reason for that is the huge amount of investment in research and development from big American companies.

Here is what the billionaire investor said:""My biggest concern is stocks and bonds seem to be taking a very, very different view. Bonds are pricing in multiple, severe cuts over the next year to two years. That is a forecast for a recession, and not a mild one. Equities are whistling past the graveyard. If inflation stays sticky, or it comes down because we enter a non-trivial recession, it's equities that I think are a scary place. They're not priced very consistently with bonds, and we're going to find out who's right in the next year.""Cliff Asness' firm began with 10 employees in 1998 and has since grown to a team of over 700, with 65% of staff holding advanced degrees.

Nevertheless, we maintain a positive outlook on the company, which is bolstered by the resilience of its core virology commercial business and the increasingly compelling oncology portfolio. We believe Gilead’s strategic transformation into a more diversified biopharmaceutical entity, expanding its focus from virology to oncology, provides a strong foundation for its future growth.”13. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) Value of AQR Capital Management’s 13F Position: $331 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 113AQR Capital sold 21% of its stake in Adobe Inc.

(NASDAQ:ADBE) would lose out to Al image-generating programs Dall-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, the design-software giant has since released its own generative Al model called Firefly. One feature of Firefly is that it can help designers generate ideas and create and manipulate images more quickly in Photoshop or Illustrator that can then be processed by other Adobe products for further development, fostering a seamless workflow. There’s more work involved when trying to manipulate images created by outside tools. Also, because Firefly is trained on Adobe’s vast inventory of stock images and other licensed content, it can generate professional-quality, commercially viable results, further setting it apart from generic models that are often trained on copyrighted content that isn’t properly licensed. These are just two examples of how Al enhances the Adobe suite, which should allow the company to raise subscription prices and upsell users.”12. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)Value of AQR Capital Management’s 13F Position: $332 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 79Cliff Asness’ investment firm increased its stake in Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

CVS has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by more than 40 percentage points over the past 12 months, impacted by a cloud of company-specific and legislative concerns. While we are not dismissive of these potential risks and headwinds, we believe the market has become overly pessimistic. This created an attractive opportunity to invest in what we view as a durable, competitively advantaged and well-managed enterprise at a high-single-digit multiple of earnings.”10.

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft were also positive contributors, up 55.19% and 42.66%, respectively. All three stocks benefited from a renewed interest in growth stocks by investors in the first half of the year.Amazon had an impressive first half of the year as well with growth out of its retail segment but slightly slower growth in its cloud business. Customers optimized workloads for existing capacity they were already paying for rather than adding incremental capacity in the current environment. We remain very excited about the opportunity for the company to reduce the labor needs of its retail segment through the use of technology and automation in the future.”7. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Value of AQR Capital Management’s 13F Position: $483 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 178NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), like Amazon.com, Inc.

Here is what the firm stated about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA):NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the biggest beneficiary this year in terms of its stock run and projected revenue gains. More companies- including, perhaps, some not yet in existence-will certainly join the ranks over time.In the meantime, NVIDIA has emerged as the unrivaled global leader in providing the technologies at the center of the Al arms race. NVIDIA’s competitive advantage is the result of investments that began two decades ago, when it recognized an early opportunity to repurpose its video-game graphics chips for the heavy-load computing done in scientific research. This led management to expand the GPU business. It also spent years and significant resources developing a free software platform that’s exclusive to its chips called CUDA that allows developers to easily program its GPUs for a variety of computationally intensive applications. Researchers then began using both NVIDIA’s chips and CUDA to train the human-brain-inspired neural networks that power Al models.Now, due to an explosion of demand related to generative Al and LLMs from across its customer base, NVIDIA projects that data-center revenue for its fiscal second quarter ending in July will surge to US$11 billion. Not only is that more than double last quarter’s total, but the forecast also shattered the average analyst estimate that called for about US$7 billion. Taking advantage of the stock’s meteoric rise, we reduced our holding (it has risen tenfold since we first purchased in 2018)…” (Click here to read the full text)6. Meta Platforms, Inc.

(NASDAQ:META). Here is what the firm stated about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META):“Our best performing stocks this quarter were Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet and Heidelberg Materials. Meta was the largest contributor to performance. Its shares have almost fully recovered from last year’s declines, rising 35% during the quarter and 138% YTD. During the quarter, the company reported earnings that showed a return to growth and healthy user engagement metrics. Most importantly, profitability appears to have stabilized and is poised to improve as significant cost reduction actions implemented over the past six months begin to have an impact. Separate from fundamental performance, there is excitement over AI’s potential to help the company’s business. While Meta’s technology prowess and massively scaled media platform certainly position the company to take advantage of AI, we believe it’s far too early to estimate any discrete tangible benefits. Overall, we view AI as one of several drivers that will contribute to Meta’s continued growth.”Like Walmart Inc. (NASDAQ:WMT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of AQR Capital Management’s top stock picks.

However, he said: “We’re studying it closely for obvious reasons.”It follows claims last week by US retail giant Walmart that people who were taking the appetite suppressant drugs were buying less food at its stores.Walmart US chief executive John Furner said the company has been monitoring how much people who picked up a prescription for weight loss medicines at its pharmacies were spending in stores.Mr Furner said these people were buying “slightly less calories” than those who were not on the medication.Investors dumped shares in major snack and fizzy drink makers in response to the comments.PepsiCo, which aside from Pepsi also makes products including Doritos and Quaker Oats, ended last week around 5pc lower. Coca Cola fell to its lowest level in a year, while McDonald’s and US chocolate maker Hershey also ended the week lower.PepsiCo chief executive Officer Ramon Laguarta said on a call with analysts on Tuesday: “Of course, we’re observing the growth of these new drugs and its potential impact. So far, the impact is negligible.”Wegovy was approved for use to tackle obesity in the UK last month and is also already available in the US.This embedded content is not available in your region.Another appetite-suppressing drug Ozempic is rumoured to be widely used in Hollywood for weight-loss, although it is designed to help people with diabetes manage the condition.This new breed of weight-loss drugs, known as semaglutide, have been hailed as “miracle” drugs thanks to their efficacy in helping weight loss.Mr Johnston and Mr Laguarta’s comments about the drugs came as PepsiCo said it was placing more focus on zero-sugar drinks and portion control packages, amid changing preferences among consumers.Story continuesThe company raised its annual profit forecasts for the third time this year, with shoppers continuing to buy its products despite price increases.Analysts at Citi said the results showed that concerns about the impact of appetite suppressing drugs on PepsiCo’s sales were “overblown”.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Earlier this summer, PepsiCo rival, Coca Cola (NYSE: KO) also lifted its full-year revenues fueled by a stronger-than-expected second quarter performance that included price hikes of around 10% across the board, which offset flat overall case volumes.Fiscal Third Quarter HighlightsFor the quarter ended in September, the packaged foods and beverage maker reported revenue grew 6.7% to $23.45 billion, topping LSEG’s estimate of $23.39 billion, while organic revenue that excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, rose 8.8%. PepsiCo made a net income of $3.09 billion, or $2.24 per share. Adjusted earnings amounted to $2.25, also topping the expected $2.15.Yet, PepsiCo’s volume, which strips out pricing and currency changes, fell again this quarter as inflation harmed product demand. In response, Pepsi has been shrinking portions and making smaller value packs to provide consumers with more affordable options. During the quarter, Pepsi executed price increases of about 11%.Food Performed Better Than BeveragesNorth American food divisions outperformed the beverages unit that contracted 6%. In North America, Quaker Foods experienced a 1% volume rise as its brands gained market share in key categories, while Frito-Lay’s volume was flat.2024 OutlookOrganic revenue growth has been guided at the high end of 4% to 6% with core constant currency earnings per share growing in high single digits.Consumers Digested Higher Prices Of SnacksPepsi reported added another successful round of price increases to its solid organic sales growth, allowing to drinks and snacks giant to lift its full year profit forecast for the third consecutive quarter.Story continuesThe Threat Of Weight Loss DrugsLast Thursday, shares of both PepsiCo and Coca Cola got smashed when Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) executive John Furner told Bloomberg that new generation of weight loss drugs are causing consumers to cut back on groceries and beverages that are high in calories. Coca Cola shares had a rough week that added to a challenging year. But Coca Cola has a balance sheet that is literally built to weather the worst possible recession with ease. With net debt is only about two times its annual net income, Coca Cola can navigate through challenging times but besides the commentary of the Walmart executive, even analysts have expressed concerns regarding the implications of the growing popularity of anti-obesity drugs. Although the Walmart executive spoke mainly of a changing consumer behavior in terms of the changes in customers’ baskets, these drugs reduce appetite and cravings, therefore altering the physiology that goes on within the body and possibly even eliminate the need for snacks altogether. Considering that about 45% of the U.S. population is deemed as obese with as much as 70% categorized as overweight, the weight loss craze will undoubtedly have a profound impact on PepsiCo and Coca Cola, as well as Walmart, as they will all be forced to alter their offerings to fit their consumers.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

This involves efforts to streamline operations, rationalize the company's footprint, optimize its product portfolio and refine its cost structure. The focus on cost management is aimed at improving profitability.As part of its cost management and profitability efforts, the company has closed the Athens production facility and plans to close the Portland, OR-based garden distribution facility by the end of 2023.

Improved pricing, a favorable product mix and cost management enhanced the operating margin up to 210 basis points to 16.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.CENT recognizes the importance of customer service in building brand loyalty and retaining customers. By focusing on customer needs, the company aims to create a positive reputation, which will lead to long-term customer relationships.The company is experiencing rapid growth in its e-commerce sales, outpacing traditional brick-and-mortar retail as consumers increasingly shift their purchasing habits online. Although it currently constitutes a relatively small portion, the e-commerce segment has surged by more than 20% and accounts for over 5% of the total garden sales in the third quarter.This growth can be attributed to Central Garden &amp; Pet's successful retail media initiatives, expanded product offerings and improved home delivery options for its top three customers. In the garden segment, CENT has witnessed a promising resurgence, as evidenced by a 2% year-over-year increase in net sales to $520 million in the quarter under review.Story continuesStrong Financial PositionCentral Garden &amp; Pet Company has a robust financial standing, boasting a cash reserve exceeding $330 million by the end of third quarter and an untapped $750 million credit facility at its disposal.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and BP p.l.c. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of Thermo Fisher Scientific have declined -9.3% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry's decline of -10.4%. The company's overall business growth is dented by lower economic activity in China and cautious spending across its customer base globally, particularly in biotech. Declining COVID-19 testing revenues impede the company's growth. The contraction of margins, due to escalating costs remain a concern.However, on a positive note, strong execution of proven growth strategy, launching a range of high-impact, innovative new products are likely to aid the company's growth in coming quarters. The company strengthened its commercial engine and trusted partner status with the opening of a customer center of excellence in Milan.(You can read the full research report on Thermo Fisher Scientific here &gt;&gt;&gt;)AMD shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry over the year-to-date period (+65.6% vs. +42.0%). The company is benefiting from the growing adoption of fourth-generation EPYC. Genoa adoption has been strong in the second quarter of 2023, with deployments from the likes of Microsoft, AWS, Alibaba and Oracle.Availability of Bergamo is crucial as a number of server providers like Dell, HPE, Lenovo and Supermicro are set to launch their new Bergamo-based platforms in the third quarter. AMD continues to benefit from acquisitions, including Xilinx and Pensando, which has diversified its business.However, weakness in the Gaming and Embedded segment revenues are expected to hurt top-line growth. For 2023, our estimate for the Gaming segment is pegged at $6.55 billion, indicating a decline of 3.8% year over year.(You can read the full research report on AMD here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of BP have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the year-to-date period (+10.2% vs. +1.7%). The company has cleared the huge litigation expenses related to the oil spill incident of 2010, it had to divest some of its best operating properties. The asset divestments might hinder BP's future cash generating opportunities going forward.BP's balance sheet is more levered than most peers, limiting its financial flexibility. Thus, the integrated energy company is more vulnerable to economic downturn than its peers. While crude oil prices are currently on an upward trend, the broader commodity pricing environment is not as robust as it was a year ago.As a result, the Zacks analyst anticipates that the leading integrated energy company's revenue to decrease in 2023. Also, we project that exploration expenses will rise by 47% this year, impacting the company's bottom line.

37,31fa6593-4032-3923-a70d-893c6017825a,HBAN,2023-10-11,Should You Be Adding Huntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:HBAN) To Your Watchlist Today?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adding-huntington-bancshares-nasdaq-hban-101451622.html,1697019291,STORY,['HBAN'],"[For beginners, it can seem like a good idea (and an exciting prospect) to buy a company that tells a good story to investors, even if it currently lacks a track record of revenue and profit. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Huntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:HBAN). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. See our latest analysis for Huntington Bancshares How Quickly Is Huntington Bancshares Increasing Earnings Per Share?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Impressively, Huntington Bancshares has grown EPS by 26% per year, compound, in the last three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Our analysis has highlighted that Huntington Bancshares' revenue from operations did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. EBIT margins for Huntington Bancshares remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 7.1% to US$7.2b. That's progress.Story continuesIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Huntington Bancshares' future EPS 100% free.Are Huntington Bancshares Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$15b company like Huntington Bancshares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$113m. We note that this amounts to 0.8% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Huntington Bancshares but it's still worth mentioning. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.It means a lot to see insiders invested in the business, but shareholders may be wondering if remuneration policies are in their best interest. Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. For companies with market capitalisations over US$8.0b, like Huntington Bancshares, the median CEO pay is around US$12m.Huntington Bancshares offered total compensation worth US$10m to its CEO in the year to December 2022. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies and seems pretty reasonable. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Should You Add Huntington Bancshares To Your Watchlist?For growth investors, Huntington Bancshares' raw rate of earnings growth is a beacon in the night. If you need more convincing beyond that EPS growth rate, don't forget about the reasonable remuneration and the high insider ownership. Everyone has their own preferences when it comes to investing but it definitely makes Huntington Bancshares look rather interesting indeed. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 1 warning sign for Huntington Bancshares that you need to be mindful of.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a free list of them here.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

This company, which is in the Zacks Gaming industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This casino and resort operator has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 505.66%.For the last reported quarter, MGM came out with earnings of $0.59 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.53 per share, representing a surprise of 11.32%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.04 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.44 per share, delivering a surprise of 1,000%.For MGM, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.MGM has an Earnings ESP of +8.01% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

(NYSE:IT) Could Be Worth Watching",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-gartner-inc-nyse-could-172453180.html,1696958693,STORY,['IT'],"[Gartner, Inc. (NYSE:IT) received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$374 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$327. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Gartner's current trading price of US$354 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Gartner’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Gartner What Is Gartner Worth?According to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Gartner’s ratio of 30.2x is above its peer average of 22.39x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the IT industry. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that Gartner’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will Gartner generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of Gartner, it is expected to deliver a negative earnings growth of -8.4%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? If you believe IT is currently trading above its peers, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. Given the risk from a negative growth outlook, this could be the right time to de-risk your portfolio. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on IT for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has climbed past its industry peers, in addition to a risky future outlook. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management. Should the price fall in the future, will you be well-informed enough to buy?If you want to dive deeper into Gartner, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

They rose to $89 a barrel on Monday after Hamas' attack, but remain around 11% lower than the $97.69 level reached in late September.The minutes from the Fed's September meeting, when it chose to hold interest rates at 5.25% to 5.5% but signalled more hikes might be on the way, are due to be released at 1800 GMT (2 p.m. ET). Investors will scrutinise them for hints about the economic outlook and where U.S. rates are heading.On Thursday, the latest U.S. inflation data is expected to show that the growth in prices slowed slightly to 3.6% in September, from 3.7% in August.The dollar index, which tracks the currency against six major peers, was trading roughly flat at 105.8. It has fallen around 1.6% since hitting an 11-month high of 107.34 last week.A Bloomberg report on China preparing stimulus to help its economy supported the mood in Asian equity markets overnight.

And one veteran strategist thinks that even if the war spilled over into the broader region, with Iran being drawn into the conflict, oil prices would still be capped at $100 a barrel.That strategist is Ed Morse, global head of commodity strategy at Citi. He spoke to Yahoo Finance Live yesterday.“The good news for the market is that with the cuts that have been taken, we have a good 4.5 to 5 million barrels a day of capacity in the world,” he said. “Should prices get significantly higher, and by that I mean above $100, I think we can expect that the spare capacity that has been held back particularly by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Kuwait will find a place in the market.”Morse said that absent an escalation in the war, oil’s ceiling is still $100 a barrel — in part because of slower or no growth in regions from Europe to China to the US.Another longtime energy analyst, Pavel Molchanov, thinks it’s extremely unlikely that Iran will be drawn into a war with Israel.“It would be their biggest mistake in four decades, and I do not think the Iranian regime is suicidal,” Molchanov told Yahoo Finance Live. “So the odds that this war will have a physical effect on oil supply from the Middle East is very low.”Molchanov does see oil at $100 a barrel within six months.That may end up being a headache for drivers, and for the Federal Reserve if it feeds through in a sustained way into increased prices of other goods and services. But for now, the threat of a further price spike from the Mideast conflict doesn’t seem imminent.Story continuesmorning brief imageClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

That’s the biggest spread in dollar terms since the $60-a-barrel limit came into force after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in the first quarter of 2022.Oil rallied in the third quarter as OPEC+ leaders Russia and Saudi Arabia choked off some supply to tighten the market. That rally lifted benchmark prices even further above the price set by the cap — which is designed by the Group of Seven to meet the twin needs of seeking to limit the Kremlin’s crude-based income, while at the same time keeping Russian flows on the global market.The cap is constructed to bar access to critical western financing and insurance services for crude cargoes if shipments are valued above $60. Beyond that level, they are permitted, as long as buyers and sellers make alternative arrangements. India, a vast oil buyer, has been adept at doing so.US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently warned that the US is preparing to crack down on evasion of the G-7 cap on Russian oil, as recent market prices signal the mechanism may no longer be working as hoped. The US is looking at enforcement very carefully, Yellen told the Wall Street Journal.Story continuesOne of the architects of the plan, meanwhile, has proposed steps to fix the program. Ben Harris, a former senior official at the US Treasury who helped design the cap, said the G-7 and European Union need to both raise the price level, and crack down on Russia’s evasion.Since Indian refiners buy crude on a delivered basis, the responsibility of attesting it was bought below the cap falls on suppliers, according to Vandana Hari, founder of Vanda Insights. While some Indian banks did withdraw from transactions as prices broke through the cap, others stepped in, with some payments in UAE dirhams, she added.--With assistance from Andrew Janes and Serene Cheong.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe War in Israel Shows How Social Media’s Idealistic Era Has EndedWorst US Bond Selloff Since 1787 Marks End of Free-Money EraHas Bob Iger Lost the Magic?A Plan to Rewrite the Ending of Italy’s Monte Paschi SagaInside the Bitter Election That a Europe at War Can’t Ignore©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Instead, in a statement, it repeated its stance that Beijing opposes unilateral sanctions and China's normal trade deserves respect and protection.China's General Administration of Customs did not reply to a request for comment.RUSSIAN IMPORTSFrom January to September, Russia supplied 1.3 million bpd of seaborne crude, based on the average of data supplied by Vortexa and Kpler. China also imported about 800,000 bpd of ESPO crude via pipeline, according to Chinese trading sources.The seaborne imports are mainly ESPO shipped from Russia's Pacific port of Kozmino as well as Urals from the Baltic Sea.From January to September, total Russian shipments grew by over 400,000 bpd from a year earlier, led by Urals, according to Vortexa, as sanctions triggered by Moscow's invasion of Ukraine sparked a massive diversion of its oil flows from Europe to India and China.China has this year saved $4.34 billion by importing Russian oil, based on Reuters' comparison of the monthly price differentials between ESPO and Tupi crude from Brazil, and Urals versus Oman, using price information provided by traders.For imports of Venezuelan oil, mostly heavy grade Merey, China saved an average of $10 a barrel versus comparable Colombian Castilla crude, the calculations based on the trader data showed. The country saved roughly $15 a barrel buying Iranian crude versus Oman oil.China has saved roughly $4.2 billion by importing a record 1 million bpd during the same period from Iran, 60% above pre-sanction peaks recorded by Chinese customs in 2017 at 623,000 bpd, as Tehran raised output to near-maximum levels and offered discounts as steep as $17 a barrel versus Brent.By comparison, Oman averaged a $2 premium above Brent in the first nine months of this year.With January-September inflows of Venezuelan oil at around 430,000 bpd, according to the average of the Vortexa and Kpler data, China's savings from buying Venezuelan oil was $1.17 billion.A U.S. State Department spokesperson said in a statement price caps on Russian oil let buyers ""drive a harder bargain"" in their purchases, limiting Moscow's revenue.Since 2021, the U.S. has sanctioned over 180 individuals and entities dealing Iranian oil and petrochemicals and the impact of sanctions has caused hyperinflation in Iran and its currency to plunge, the spokesperson said.U.S. sanctions enforcement will continue for Venezuela and the Maduro government's relationship with China does not demonstrate strength but its isolation ""within the global community.""TEAPOT MARGINSWith state refiners Sinopec and PetroChina refraining entirely from buying Iranian and Venezuelan crude, teapots have feasted on discounted oil from the two suppliers.According to Chinese consultancy JLC, teapots in the refining hub of Shandong province operated at 65.7% of capacity during the first three quarters of 2023, up 4.2 percentage points, generating margins on processing imported crude of 567 yuan ($77.63) per ton, compared with 50 yuan a year ago.However, the upside for more cost savings is capped as teapots are constrained by crude import quotas, while holding no fuel export quotas, as well as regulatory scrutiny.""This is especially true for Shandong refiners which, if subjected to another round of crackdowns as seen over the past years, could put a hard limit on how much Iran exports,"" said Viktor Katona, Kpler's lead crude analyst.Earlier this year, customs stepped up inspections of heavy crude cargoes headed to Shandong after finding several Iranian shipments mislabelled as diluted bitumen to bypass import quotas.If the U.S. tightens enforcement of sanctions on Tehran over the recent crisis in Israel, that could also curb Iran's oil exports, analysts said, which mostly flow to China.($1 = 7.3042 Chinese yuan renminbi)(Reporting by Chen Aizhu and Muyu Xu; Editing by Tony Munroe and Christian Schmollinger)]"

(Brian Snyder/REUTERS) (Brian Snyder / reuters)Whether US banks are properly prepared for an extended period of high rates will be a central theme running through the third quarter earnings season that kicks off Friday with results from giants JPMorgan (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC).The Federal Reserve made it clear in September that it expects rates to stay higher for longer. That stance will continue to place pressure on banks by making deposits more expensive, deepening paper losses on bonds held for investment, and making it more difficult for bank borrowers to pay back their loans.A focus for many investors in the coming weeks will be what banks say about a key measure of profitability known as net interest income, which measures the difference between what banks earn on their loans and pay for deposits.Those margins have been under pressure from the Fed’s campaign to cool inflation and the intense competition for depositors that followed the chaos of the spring, when the failures of three sizable regional banks stoked panic throughout the financial world.""The length of time we stay at these levels is a critical factor,"" Scott Siefers, a large bank analyst for Piper Sandler, told Yahoo Finance. ""If rates stay up here for years, it'll just be this grind higher where banks have to pay more to every incremental account.""Hammered during the regional banking crisis in March, bank stocks have notably lagged the S&amp;P 500 this year, even as they've recovered from their lows reached back in May.As of Tuesday, the S&amp;P Bank Index ETF (KBE) and the S&amp;P Regional Bank Index ETF (KRE) were down more than 18% and 29% year to date, respectively. The S&amp;P 500, in contrast, has gained nearly 13% this year.Story continuesGerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC who covers large banks, told Yahoo Finance that if the Fed is done with its interest rate hikes, stocks are likely ""bottoming out."" But the risk, he said, is that the Fed can’t get inflation under control and has to take rates above 7% in 2024.""That's the bear case for the banks,"" Cassidy said about the possibility of more hikes, calling it “long-tail risk” for the industry.September forecasts from the Federal Reserve suggested one additional rate hike would be necessary in 2023 before rate cuts begin next year.The lessons of 2008The big bank that appears to be best positioned for an era of higher rates is JPMorgan, which signaled as early as 2020 that it wasn’t willing to take a lot of risk with an influx of deposits that flooded into all banks during the early days of the pandemic.Some of JPMorgan’s rivals began investing that money in longer-dated securities in a search for higher yield, only to see the value of those holdings go down once the Fed began raising rates.The unrealized losses that piled up were partly responsible for the fall of Silicon Valley Bank, which attempted in March to sell large amounts of its bonds at a loss in a last-ditch effort to gain more liquidity.Dimon, according to a person familiar with his thinking, is concerned that some banks didn’t do enough to fix their balance sheets following the events of this spring. JPMorgan in May purchased operations from another lender seized by regulators, First Republic.The current period reminds him, this person said, of the months following the March 2008 fall of Wall Street investment bank Bear Stearns, which JPMorgan also purchased with help from the US government.Not enough institutions used that March 2008 warning to fix their balance sheets, leaving them vulnerable to a systemwide crisis that roiled the global economy in September of that year.When JPMorgan releases its third quarter results this Friday, its profits are expected to outshine other large banks.It is the only one of the big four banks expected to show a rise in net interest income when compared with the second quarter. Its jump when compared to the third quarter of 2022 is also expected to far outpace those at Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo.Bank of America is among the lenders that are now paying for a decision to pile hundreds of billions into longer-dated Treasurys and mortgage bonds during the pandemic. Those holdings were down by more than $100 billion on paper as of June 30.The unrealized losses are a big reason investors have pushed Bank of America’s stock near a 52-week low.Analysts don’t expect Bank of America to have a need to sell those holdings, and therefore book a loss.But smaller banks may not have as many options, which could create new concern among investors. All banks held $309.6 billion in unrealized losses as of the second quarter, a 9% rise from the first quarter and a 28% rise from last year.“An institution that has very large unrealized losses without enough explanation could generate concern and that's what we saw in the spring,” Eric Rosengren, the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, told Yahoo Finance.There will be other challenges to look for in third quarter results. Analysts expect banks big and small to set aside more money for future loan losses and take higher charge-offs as borrowers begin to struggle to repay their debts.Big banks with sizable Wall Street operations, such as Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), will also be trying to show that a two-year slump in dealmaking is finally waning.The drought is far from over, however, according to Dealogic data. Global investment banking revenue is expected to be down by 10% from last quarter and 17% from a year ago.High rates are not all bad for the industry, some analysts said. They do allow bankers to charge more for their loans, and that could help some institutions when demand for new borrowings picks up.And bank stocks could recover in 2024 if it’s clear the Fed is done with its campaign to cool inflation.Aside from the risk that loan losses mount, ""higher for longer, ultimately, should be a positive for bank fundamentals,"" David Chiaverini, regional and midsized bank analyst for Wedbush, told Yahoo Finance.David Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking and crypto.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis advertising company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.85 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.5%.Revenues are expected to be $3.57 billion, up 3.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.31% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Omnicom?For Omnicom, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.27%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Omnicom will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Omnicom would post earnings of $1.80 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.81, delivering a surprise of +0.56%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Omnicom doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Since the implementation of the LTIIP smart grid technology in neighborhood power lines, the company has seen a 74% reduction in customer minutes of interruption associated with outages.Benefits of the InitiativeThe work involved installation of new, automated equipment and technology in the distribution substation and along the power lines that serve more than 15,000 people in the Sharon area, as well as in the Hermitage, Transfer, Greenville and West Middlesex areas.These electrical devices are also safer and more efficient, allowing automatic resumption of services to customers rather than dispatching a crew to investigate the outage. If the device detects a serious outage, it isolates the same to a specific area and limits the number of customers affected.  In addition to avoid voltage problems, these devices could also potentially help save energy by evenly distributing power so that all customers served by one power line receive the same level of safe and reliable power. Penn Power workers placed nearly 100 new poles, specially designed to withstand extreme winter conditions.This initiative is in addition to the system improvements that Penn Power has made over the past few years in the Mercer County service area. Apart from installing more than 200 automatic reclosing systems in rural areas with lots of trees, it has fitted interior fencing in four substations to keep out any electrical equipment that could cause a power outage.Investment in Infrastructure is a MustA favorable change in temperature not only increases the demand for electricity but also poses a threat to electric infrastructure. Investments are crucial in maintaining service reliability and ensuring customer satisfaction.In order to provide reliable services to customers, utilities make systematic investments to upgrade transmission and distribution lines and develop new substations. The objective is to warrant proper supply of electricity to millions of customers across the United States.Penn Power has invested heavily in smart grid technologies over the past few years. This has enabled the company to improve its reliability performance and experiment with new devices.FirstEnergy has plans to invest nearly $18 billion in the 2021-2025 period to further strengthen its existing operations. FE’s Energizing the Future plan is aimed to modernize its transmission system with cutting-edge machinery and technology that will help further strengthen the power grid and reduce the frequency and duration of customer outages. Through 2022, the company has invested more than $10 billion in the Energizing the Future program.Along with FE, other electric power companies like Xcel Energy, Inc. XEL, Exelon Corporation EXC and Duke Energy DUK also aim to invest to further strengthen their existing infrastructure.Xcel Energy aims to spend $29.5 billion during 2023-2027, out of which it plans to invest nearly $18 billion in strengthening its electric distribution and transmission operations.XEL’s long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate is 6.34%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share (EPS) implies a year-over-year improvement of 5.7%.Exelon invests substantially in infrastructure projects. It plans to spend nearly $31.3 billion during 2023-2026 on regulated utility operations for grid modernization and enhancement of its infrastructure’s resilience.EXC’s long-term earnings growth rate is 6.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 EPS implies a year-over-year improvement of 3.5%.Duke Energy remains focused on expanding its scale of operations and implementing modern technologies at its facilities. Almost 85% of the company’s planned investment funds its generation fleet transition and grid modernization. This includes approximately $75 billion to modernize and strengthen its transmission and distribution infrastructure.DUK’s long-term earnings growth rate is 6.09%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 EPS implies a year-over-year increase of 6.3%.Story continuesPrice PerformanceIn the past month, shares of FirstEnergy have lost 2.3% compared with the industry’s 13% decline. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankFirstEnergy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

To skip our detailed analysis of the US markets today, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Growth Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.Is Now The Right Time To Invest?Equity investors in American stocks today might be wondering when the right time to invest in US stocks will come around. With market volatility and economic conditions across the world making most investors and businesses cautious about major decisions involving larger sums of money, this line of thinking is becoming more commonplace than some might have expected. At this moment, one thing investors can do to ensure they make sound investment decisions is to remain apprised of not only current events in the US markets but also of expert opinions on how to approach the market at present.On October 10, Paul Tudor Jones, the founder and Chief Investment Officer of Tudor Investment, joined CNBC's 'Squawk Box' to give his take on current market trends and more. Here are some of his comments:""The United States is probably in its weakest fiscal position since, certainly, World War II, with debt-to-GDP at a 122%. So, it's a really tough time for, I think, the moral voice of the world.""Geopolitical Tensions As A Barrier To InvestmentJones sees the current geopolitical environment of the world as ""the most threatening"" and ""challenging"" environment he has ever seen, with the recent developments in the Israel-Palestine crisis and the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian crisis. Here's what he had to say on these issues, alongside how they and US economic conditions are impacting equity investors in the US:""It's a really challenging time to wanna be an equity investor in US stocks right now, it's really hard, because again you've got the geopolitical uncertainty, which we, I think, have come to live with to a certain extent. Equally as much of a problem is the fiscal situation that we're facing in the United States, which is gonna require a completely different political mentality.""Story continuesAll in all, Jones highlighted the existing barriers and challenges that may hinder equity investors in the US markets from taking part in the investment cycles. However, investors can still remain active in the markets by carefully picking out reliable stocks with high growth potential, especially those stocks that have lived up to their growth potential in the past. These include several companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

(NYSE:NOW) in its July 2023 investor letter:“US-based software company ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) delivered another impressive quarterly result that came in ahead of analysts expectations. Subscription revenues grew 25% year-on-year in constant currency terms to $2.1 billion and operating margins came in at 23.4%. Despite ongoing variability in the macro backdrop, ServiceNow continues to benefit from spend prioritisation within the IT tech stack as vendors look to consolidate back-office apps onto an integrated platform. The company’s operational metrics held firm, with remaining performance obligations growing 24% year-on-year to $14.2 billion and renewal rates ticking up to 99%. As we have mentioned before, the company’s renewal rates are noteworthy as not only are they best-in-class but they are also remarkably consistent, typically in the range of 97% to 99%. They speak to the mission critical nature of the platform and are a key driver of long term annuity value.Investors were also excited to hear management speak to the burgeoning artificial intelligence (AI) opportunity. Things are moving fast and the company plans to release new premium offerings of their workflow products – across IT, customer service and human resources – towards the back end of 2023 that will have new Generative AI capabilities embedded into them. Management also mentioned that they anticipate these new offerings could deliver a “minimum” 60%-plus list price uplift relative to its current Pro versions as they provide meaningful productivity improvements for end users. Whilst it’s still early days, ServiceNow appears well placed to capitalise on the Generative-AI opportunity and we believe it could be a meaningful driver for the company’s next phase of growth.”13.

(NASDAQ:ADBE). Their total stake value was $6.1 billion.Here's what Harding Loevner said about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Although the market initially feared that Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) would lose out to Al image-generating programs Dall-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, the design-software giant has since released its own generative Al model called Firefly. One feature of Firefly is that it can help designers generate ideas and create and manipulate images more quickly in Photoshop or Illustrator that can then be processed by other Adobe products for further development, fostering a seamless workflow. There’s more work involved when trying to manipulate images created by outside tools. Also, because Firefly is trained on Adobe’s vast inventory of stock images and other licensed content, it can generate professional-quality, commercially viable results, further setting it apart from generic models that are often trained on copyrighted content that isn’t properly licensed. These are just two examples of how Al enhances the Adobe suite, which should allow the company to raise subscription prices and upsell users.”11. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor company that offers x86 microprocessors and graphics processing units (GPUs). It is based in Santa Clara, California.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was seen in the 13F holdings of 112 hedge funds in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $6.9 billion.A Buy rating and a $145 price target were maintained on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) shares on August 3 by Cody Acree at Benchmark.This is what Artisan Partners said about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Among our top contributors were Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NU Holdings and Netflix. AMD’s data center CPUs are used in the cloud service provider (CSP) servers. In addition to the broader secular tailwind from cloud adoption, the company has a performance and pricing advantage over Intel, which we believe will enable it to continue capturing market share. However, the recent stock price rally was due to growing excitement around the company’s AI exposure. It will launch its new MI300 graphics processing unit (GPU) chip later this year to compete against the dominant market leader NVIDIA. Similar to its approach that won market share from Intel within the CPU market, AMD’s product will aim to provide similar performance at a more attractive price. AMD is already working with Microsoft and Meta, while Amazon publicly stated that it is evaluating AMD’s inferencing chips. Using assumptions around the total GPU market size, potential market share gains and price points, our research indicates this could be a $20 billion opportunity for AMD. That would nearly double its revenue. While the company has not historically missed many deadlines, there is execution risk as it works to manufacture and distribute these complex chips at scale, which, combined with an elevated valuation after the stock’s strong performance run, led us to trim the position.”10. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 114Seaport Global analyst David Joyce initiated coverage on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares with a Buy rating and a $482 price target on October 6.A total of 114 hedge funds were long Netflix, Inc.

(NYSE:CRM) shares on October 4.Based in San Francisco, California, salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) is an application software company. It provides Customer Relationship Management (CRM) technology.Harding Loevner said the following about salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), a company we’ve owned since 2019, recently added ChatGPT-like capabilities onto its existing Al module, Einstein, to support its internal sales efforts and customer-facing software. For example, Einstein GPT can help generate marketing emails tailored to specific clients by using Salesforce’s customer database and past email correspondence to learn the most effective approach for each client. Einstein GPT is also different from off-the-shelf LLMS in three important ways: It keeps personal identifiable information private and secure, compared with external tools that retain anything a user enters. It employs the latest data in Salesforce’s system, as opposed to the sometimes-stale public data that train generic models. And generative Al capabilities can be integrated with other Salesforce offerings; the company has already introduced Slack GPT and Tableau GPT, Al-equipped versions of its workplace collaboration and analytics tools.”8.

QuoteSalesforce is one of the stocks that has outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry’s rise of 36.5% year to date. CRM rallied 56.3% in the same time frame.Why Should You Bet on CRM Stock?Salesforce stock currently trades way lower than the 52-week high, which reflects its potential to go upward. The stock’s closing price of $207.22, on Oct 9, 2023, was 13% lower than the 52-week high of $238.22 attained on Jul 19, 2023.Moreover, Salesforce currently trades at an attractive valuation multiple.

It also trades at a discount to the Zacks Internet Software industry’s one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple of 29.46X.Additionally, amid the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds and geopolitical issues, it is prudent to pick solid growth companies as these are financially stable, accruing profits in established markets. These stocks, with their solid fundamentals, allow investors to hedge their funds from any economic downturn.Apart from having solid fundamentals, Salesforce has the favorable combination of a Growth Score of B and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.Story continuesPer Zacks’ proprietary methodology, stocks with a combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 and a Growth Score of A or B offer solid investment opportunities.CRM has an impressive earnings surprise history.

Additionally, the stock has an impressive earnings per share growth expectation for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.06 per share for fiscal 2024 earnings suggests growth of approximately 53.8% from the year-ago period. For fiscal 2025, the consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $9.37 per share, indicating a year-over-year increase of 16.3%.Long-Term Growth DriversThe rapid adoption of cloud-based solutions is spurring demand for Salesforce’s products. The company’s focus on introducing more aligned products per customer needs is driving its top line.Management believes that digitization is reinforcing the company’s strategic relationships. Its ability to provide an integrated solution for customers’ business problems is the key driver.Per a Fortune Business Insights report, the global CRM software market, valued at $64.41 billion in 2022, is projected to witness a CAGR of 12% between 2023 and 2030. With its SaaS-based CRM and social enterprise applications, we think that salesforce is well-positioned to lead the market.Salesforce is currently focusing on incorporating generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools across its products as it looks to keep its business ahead of rivals. The company forayed into the generative AI space with the launch of Einstein GPT in March 2023.Upping its ante in the space, CRM launched its AI Cloud service in June 2023, which is the company’s one-stop AI-powered solution for enterprises looking to enhance productivity. The company also raised its venture capital fund for generative AI to $500 million from $250 million.On Sep 12, Salesforce introduced the latest generation of the Einstein AI assistant, which now includes conversational AI assistants, namely Einstein Copilot and Copilot Studio.

Also, the partnership between Salesforce and Amazon Web Services has deepened on the Generative AI front.In addition to partnerships, acquisitions have been one of the key growth strategies for strengthening the company’s overall business. With the acquisition of Airkit.ai, an AI-powered customer service app development startup, Salesforce has further advanced its presence in the AI and CRM-software arena.Salesforce’s latest reported financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 reflect continued growth despite disruptions caused by macroeconomic headwinds and geopolitical issues. The company’s second-quarter 2023 revenues grew 11% year over year to $8.6 billion.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the broader technology sector are Synopsys SNPS, NVIDIA NVDA and Splunk SPLK, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 at present.

(NYSE:CRM) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Salesforce The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At SalesforceIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Co-Founder, Marc Benioff, sold US$105m worth of shares at a price of US$211 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$207. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Salesforce insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like Salesforce better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider Ownership Of SalesforceAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Salesforce insiders own about US$6.0b worth of shares (which is 3.0% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Salesforce Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Salesforce insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. At Simply Wall St, we found 1 warning sign for Salesforce that deserve your attention before buying any shares.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The move by the congressional news startup is meant to generate more revenue by making its content more available to those who aren’t D.C. insiders.D.C.-based media companies have seen their valuations rise in recent years. In fact, Axios sold for $525 million in August 2022.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIf you look closely, there’s something to cheer about if you work for a media company. All is not doom and gloom.With regards to the print media, there are several publicly traded companies I could have chosen, but they wouldn’t be suitable investments. Here are three that are.The New York Times (NYT)The headquarters of the New York Times (NYT) at night.Source: Osugi / Shutterstock.comThe New York Times (NYSE:NYT) is having an excellent year in the market, up nearly 24%, more than double the S&amp;P 500.I subscribe to the Times. While I joined to help me write better about the markets, a lot of the non-business stuff is very interesting and informative. That said, I’m not picking up the paper’s print version, but I would if I were in New York, if only for nostalgia’s sake.I also subscribed to The Athletic before the NYT acquired it last year for $550 million. Sadly, as part of the acquisition, the Times closed its sports section, moving sports cover over to The Athletic. While that stings, it’s a financial decision that makes total sense. The duplication was unnecessary.The company reported Q2 2023 results in August. They were reasonably good, with revenues 6.3% higher to $590.9 million, with an adjusted operating profit of $92.2 million, 21% higher year-over-year.Its total subscribers were 9.88 million at the end of the second quarter, up from 9.17 million a year ago, with digital-only accounting for 93%. Its average revenue per user (ARPU) was $9.15 during Q2 2023, 11 cents higher than Q1 2023 and 32 cents more than a year ago.Story continuesThe bundled subscription is working for the Times. Down from its all-time high of around $55, it’s got room to move higher.News Corporation (NWSA)News Corp. (NWSA_ Building frontSource: ShutterstockNews Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA) is another media company whose products I subscribe to. I currently have subscriptions for both Barron’s and MarketWatch. I refuse to subscribe to the Wall Street Journal because of its shameless editorials in support of former President Donald Trump. But that’s okay; I’ve also got Bloomberg to keep me informed.And, yes, I realize News Corp owns both Barron’s and MarketWatch, but they don’t veer off the business path too often.In September, Rupert Murdoch announced he was stepping down as leader of both News Corp and Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA), leaving the CEO chores to his son Lachlan, who’s a much younger 52. That makes sense.Once Murdoch Sr. dies, the real fireworks will start as the kids inherit their father’s voting shares. Rupert holds 40% of News’ and 43% of Fox’s voting shares. They will control both businesses.News Corp’s business isn’t nearly as strong as the Times.In fiscal 2023, its sales fell 5% to $9.88 billion, with a 15% decline in segment earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), to $1.42 billion.However, its Dow Jones unit, which operates the Wall Street Journal, etc., had an excellent year, growing 7% in revenue and 14% in EBITDA. Across the board, Dow Jones’ subscriptions were significantly higher in the fourth quarter. It finished the year with 5.24 million total subscribers, up from 4.90 million a year earlier.Business is good.Nexstar Media Group (NXST)Nexstar Media Group logo on a phone screenSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comI picked Nexstar Media Group (NASDAQ:NXST) primarily because of its focus on local news. However, it’s technically not a print media company using digital means to reach 106 million estimated consumers.Nexstar’s digital operations are spread across 125 websites and 239 mobile apps. Comscore ranks Nexstar’s digital assets as a top 10 U.S. digital news and information property. It does that aided by its 200 owned or partner local broadcast stations in 116 U.S. markets, reaching 68% of households.Now, it could be ready to land a massive fish by acquiring ABC from Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS). The two companies are currently in early talks about a possible sale. However, given complications, such as ESPN’s relationship with ABC and the fact that Nexstar’s TV stations are primarily Fox, NBC or CBS affiliates, things need to be worked out before any actual numbers are discussed.Estimates put the sale of ABC and its eight TV stations at $4 billion, or about 7x EBITDA. Nexstar currently has a market cap of just $4.7 billion. So, any deal would be difficult to swing for the Texas-based media business.Nonetheless, its focus on local media will continue to resonate with Americans.

The rebound in sales of dental products and services is mainly due to the easing of pandemic-related restrictions in the past few years. Also, the major players in the industry have been taking initiatives to improve their margins post the pandemic, including cost cutting and price improvement. The dental market is also driven by the high rate of oral diseases, an aging population, the increasing demand for cosmetic dentistry and technological innovations. It is expected to keep growing as the dental industry adapts and develops new treatments and procedures to meet the changing needs of patients. Going by the Fortune Business Insight data, the global dental industry is expected to reach $63.93 billion by 2029 at a CAGR of 7.4% (from the 2022 level).However, the current rising interest rate regime will continue to increase the cost of capital. Other macro headwinds like supply-chain constraints are hurting the margins of the industry players. These are likely to continue in 2023, subduing earnings growth. Industry participants like McKesson MCK, West Pharmaceutical Services WST, Align Technology ALGN and Henry Schein HSIC have shown encouraging trends amid uncertain times and are likely to gain from the existing market opportunities.Industry DescriptionThe global dental industry consists of companies that design, develop, make and market dental products, such as consumables, laboratory products and specialty items. Some of these companies also offer software and systems for practice management, patient education and office administration. Dental stocks have been attracting attention amid recovery in sales after the weakness faced amid the pandemic-induced disruptions. The market has been recovering and maintaining its position. Notably, dental care is being provided safely, following the advice and recommendations of the American Dental Association and CDC. Thanks to the rebound seen by the companies in this space, patient volume has been increasing steadily despite the COVID-19 uncertainty.Story continuesMajor Trends Shaping the Future of the Medical Dental Supplies IndustryIncreasing Burden of Oral Diseases and an Aging Population: The dental equipment market in the United States is being driven by the country's growing geriatric population. This group is a significant demographic in dental surgeries and other dental practices. Per the United States Census Bureau, the country had 54.1 million people aged 65 and above in 2020. Old age increases the likelihood of dental issues such as cavities, root and coronal caries, and periodontitis. Consequently, the rising number of seniors in the country is a key contributor to the growth of the market.Demand for Esthetic and Cosmetic Dentistry: The dental equipment market in the United States is growing due to the demand for esthetic and cosmetic dentistry. People, influenced by Internet strategies, current trends and media coverage, want to improve their dental appearance. Cosmetic dentistry, which started in the United States, has led to many innovations in the field. Patients in the country are looking for procedures that can enhance their smile, as well as restore dental function. This trend is boosting the growth of the U.S. dental equipment market.Technological Advancements: Dental procedures are changing with new technologies like digital imaging, laser dentistry and CAD/CAM systems. These technologies make treatments more accurate and effective, leading to better results. Also, new materials have been developed that are stronger, more compatible and attractive, giving dental practitioners more options for supplies.Zacks Industry RankThe Zacks Medical Dental Supplies industry falls within the broader Zacks Medical sector.It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #56, which places it in the top 22% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few dental supply stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry PerformanceThe industry has outperformed its sector as well as the S&amp;P 500 Composite in the past year.Stocks in this industry have collectively gained 22.5% compared with the Zacks Medical sector’s growth of 2.2%. The S&amp;P 500 has gained 13.6% in the same time frame.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing medical stocks, the industry is currently trading at 18.3X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 18.4X and the sector’s 21.3X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 20.97X and as low as 14.9X, with the median being 18.6X, as the charts show.Price-to-Earnings Forward Twelve Months (F12M)Price-to-Earnings Forward Twelve Months (F12M)4 Promising Dental Supply StocksMcKesson is a healthcare services and information technology company, McKesson operates through two segments. The Distribution Solutions segment distributes branded and generic pharmaceutical drugs, along with other healthcare-related products worldwide. The segment also provides practice management, technology, clinical support and business solutions to community-based oncology and other specialty practices. It also provides specialty pharmaceutical solutions for pharmaceutical manufacturers. The Technology Solutions segment provides enterprise-wide clinical, patient care, financial, supply-chain and strategic management software solutions.Strong growth in the U.S. markets, especially for pharmaceutical and specialty solutions, drove McKesson’s top line by 10.9% year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems, and increased contributions from its generics program aided the top-line improvement. However, inflationary pressure continues to hurt margins. The company expects adjusted earnings per share (EPS) in the range of $26.55-$27.35 for fiscal 2024.For this San Francisco, CA-based company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 revenues indicates growth of 10.9% from the year-ago reported figure, while the same for earnings implies an increase of 4.4%. McKesson has a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 8.10%. Presently, the company carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Price and Consensus: MCKWest Pharmaceutical Services is a leading global manufacturer with respect to the design and production of technologically advanced, high-quality, integrated containment and delivery systems for injectable drugs and healthcare products. It operates under two segments — Proprietary Products and Contract-Manufactured Products. The Proprietary Products segment provides packaging, containment and drug delivery products, together with analytical lab services and other integrated services and solutions mainly to biologic, generic and pharmaceutical drug customers. The Contract-Manufactured Products segment acts as a fully-integrated business, which remains committed toward the design, manufacture and automated assembly of complex devices.Continued strong demand for WST’s high-value products fueled its top-line growth in the second quarter of 2023. The Pharma and Generics market units demonstrated robust organic growth during the quarter. However, declining sales related to COVID-19 vaccines continue to hurt the Biologics market unit.West Pharmaceutical Services expects EPS in the $7.65-$7.80 range for 2023.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 revenues indicates growth of 3.3% from the year-ago reported figure, while the same for earnings implies a decline of 8.5%. WST has a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 12.47%. It carries a Zacks Rank of 2 at present.Price and Consensus: WSTAlign Technology manufactures and markets a system of clear aligner therapy, intra-oral scanners and CAD/CAM digital services used in dentistry, orthodontics and dental records storage. The initial adoption of the recently launched Invisalign Comprehensive product was favorable and holds potential for faster revenue recognition than the traditional ones.In the next one to three years, Align Technology expects to strengthen its existing offerings with the newest technologies and innovations.The company’s top line gained 3.3% in the last reported quarter and also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.7%. Revenues from the Clear Aligner segment reflected higher volumes, increased Average Selling Prices and higher non-case revenues. Meanwhile, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against nearly every other major currency hampered Align Technology’s revenues in the international markets. The company expects total revenue growth of 11-13.5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. ALGN anticipates its adjusted operating margin to be slightly up on a sequential basis as it continues to prioritize investments in R&amp;D and go-to-market activities.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 earnings and revenues indicates year-over-year growth of 6.6% and 13.1%, respectively. Currently, the company holds a Zacks Rank of 2.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Price and Consensus: ALGNHenry Schein is a leading distributor of health care products and services across the globe, Henry Schein serves office-based dental, medical and animal health practitioners, dental laboratories, government as well as institutional health care clinics and other alternate-care sites. Additionally, the company offers other value-added services such as practice management software, e-commerce solutions and an array of financial services. Henry Schein boasts a wide global footprint with 61 distribution centers. Apart from North America and Canada, the company has its presence in Australia and New Zealand as well as in emerging nations like China, Brazil, Israel, the Czech Republic and Poland. HSIC’s worldwide reach provides it with a major competitive advantage over other players in the healthcare distribution industry.In the second quarter of 2023, the company performed well. Growth in the Technology and Value-added Services business was strong in the international market during the second quarter, banking on the strength of the Dentally cloud-based solution. Development in North America was driven by the sales of its practice management software. Sales growth in the Medical business continued to be robust, reflecting higher patient traffic to alternate care sites. Widespread network and channel mix and favorable long-term trends in the dental business are likely to drive future growth. However, severe currency headwinds and lower sales of PPE and COVID-19 test kits are likely to continue to hurt the top line in 2023. Henry Schein expects sales growth of nearly 1-3% in 2023 year over year.For this Melville, NT-based company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings and revenues indicates an increase of 9.6% and 1.5%, respectively.

66,3c6cd9dd-78b2-3777-964c-a45de1ae0e8d,MRO,2023-10-11,Does Marathon Oil (MRO) Have the Potential to Rally 28.07% as Wall Street Analysts Expect?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-marathon-oil-mro-potential-135508942.html,1696946108,STORY,"['MRO', 'TGT']","[Shares of Marathon Oil (MRO) have gained 0.2% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $26.22, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $33.58 indicates a potential upside of 28.1%.The mean estimate comprises 19 short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $5. While the lowest estimate of $25 indicates a 4.7% decline from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 71.6% to reach $45. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable.However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in MRO. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.Here's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?Story continuesThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Here's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in MROThere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current year, four estimates have moved higher over the last 30 days compared to no negative revision. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 8.7%.Moreover, MRO currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much MRO could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Don't Ignore These 2 Oils-Energy Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-better-returns-dont-ignore-130006263.html,1696942806,STORY,['MRO'],"[Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Chevron (CVX) earns a Zacks Rank #2 17 days from its next quarterly earnings release on October 27, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $3.60 a share.CVX has an Earnings ESP figure of 4.42%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $3.60 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.45.CVX is one of just a large database of Oils-Energy stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Marathon Oil (MRO).Marathon Oil is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on November 1, 2023. MRO's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.72 a share 22 days from its next earnings release.Marathon Oil's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 8.38% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.66.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, CVX and MRO could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Motorola has established itself as the leading technology provider for public safety organizations in Lithuania and this deal signifies the continuation of this long-standing business relationship that spans over a decade.The M500 in-car system, integrated with AI, is a significant step toward the advancement of real-time awareness. Its mission-critical design offers extreme durability and tamper-proof features, built to withstand tough conditions. The system incorporates industry-leading video technology with sharp sensors that enhance the clarity of vision, both during the day and night, as well as inside and outside of the vehicle. With embedded intelligence at its core, the solution constantly assesses its surroundings, enabling officers to respond swiftly to potential threats.The M500’s automatic number plate recognition feature accurately informs officers what is in the vicinity, even before they step out of the vehicle. The backseat occupancy detection feature starts recording whenever a person is detected in the rear seat, improving the safety of the suspects. The highly resilient solution comes with an intuitive user interface that makes it easy to operate in adverse conditions and also amplifies the capabilities of the existing mission-critical technologies.Motorola will also offer VB400 body-worn cameras with built-in connectivity and full HD video recording capability. Lithuania has already equipped its national police and border guard personnel with over 2,500 body-worn cameras. Motorola’s VB400 body-worn cameras are increasingly being deployed across the globe to boost the security of police officers. The use of body-worn cameras improves transparency and accountability, which can foster trust between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve. Advanced features of VB400, combined with its Pronto mobile digital policing platform, significantly improve real-time communication and collaboration, enhance the decision-making process and streamline the workflow.Additionally, the solution suite also offers VideoManager, a highly configurable evidence management solution. It effectively prepares, processes and shares high-quality video footage from in-car video technology and the suite of body-worn cameras. These advance features not only boost officer’s safety but also help in post-incident investigations.The law enforcement officers often face inherent risks owing to numerous unpredictable and potentially dangerous situations in this line of work. Advanced video security technology can play a vital role in this context, serving various use cases such as evidence collection, enhanced situation awareness, training, accountability and checking on officers’ behavior during a particular incident. Motorola’s diligent strategies in this regard are allowing it to strengthen its portfolio, solidify its presence in the market and pave the way for further business expansion.As a leading provider of mission-critical communication products and services worldwide, Motorola has ensured a steady revenue stream from this niche market.

You can skip and read the 5 Most Socially Advanced Countries in the World.In today's interconnected world, the success and attractiveness of a nation to global businesses isn't just a reflection of its GDP or the size of its stock market. Social advancement plays a crucial role in shaping a nation's appeal to both foreign investors and multinational corporations. This is especially significant when businesses consider long-term investment or setting up base in a new country.Take, for instance, the tech titan Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). When deciding on locations for its new campuses and stores, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) doesn't merely evaluate the economic robustness of a region. The company's Environmental Progress Report shows its keen interest in regions that prioritize sustainable initiatives and education. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s extensive educational programs and partnerships, such as its collaboration with educational institutions in countries with a strong focus on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math), further solidify this stance.Social advancements such as poverty reduction, gender quality, and sustainability have been linked with improved economic growth as well.For instance, gender quality is a significant factor in social advancement, which could have a positive or negative impact on economic growth. According to the World Bank, around 2.4 billion women don’t have equal income opportunities and only 12 countries worldwide provide 100% equal legal standing to women across different measures, such as entrepreneurship, workplace, mobility, pension, marriage, and more.However, the European Institute of Gender Equality (EIGE) believes that promoting gender equality can significantly boost GDP per capita, thus leading to improved economic development. It believes that initiatives in gender equality could produce up to 10.5 million additional jobs by 2050.Story continuesWhen we talk about social advancement in the global economic scenario, it’s clear that businesses taking responsibility for their environmental and social impacts are likely to perform better. A 2020 report confirms this, revealing that companies with high ESG scores were more likely to outperform their counterparts in the stock market.Another meta-analysis of over 1,000 studies on ESG by the Stern School of Business found a positive correlation between ESG and the company’s financial performance for 58% of the analyzed studies. According to another global survey, more than $30 trillion is now invested in assets that have some ESG criteria, a significant rise from a decade ago.With these facts, companies are now focusing on complying with ESG standards to attract more investors. One such example is Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS). The company introduced the P.A.C.E program to empower women in the global garment industry. Over 1.3 million women across 19 countries participated in this program, yielding high returns for female garment workers, their families, and the companies they work for. Moreover, Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS)’s 75% of employees are women, which shows its commitment to closing the gender gap. This dedication to social responsibility, among other factors, positions Gap Inc. (NYSE:GPS) as a dominant global retailer, with outlets in more than 40 countries.Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSF) is another example of a dedication to ESG principles. With a goal to be carbon-negative by 2030, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSF) contracted the removal of 1.44 million metric tons of carbon in FY 2022 alone. By the same year's end, the company provided nearly a million people with clean water and sanitation solutions. Additionally, since its founding, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSF) has earmarked over $600 million from its Climate Innovation Fund for impactful investments. This holistic ESG strategy has likely played a part in its robust financial performance and appeal to investors. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSF)’s current market cap stands at around $2.74 trillion, making it one of the most valuable companies globally.This shift is a reflection of a global community that's becoming increasingly conscious of its impact and responsibilities. Whether it's nations optimizing their socio-economic standards or businesses rethinking their strategies, the path forward is clear: economic prosperity and social responsibility must go hand in hand.20 Most Socially Advanced Countries in the WorldCopyright: rawpixel / 123RF Stock PhotoMethodologyFor our list of the 20 most socially advanced countries in the world, we used Insider Monkey’s research and rankings on the most civilized countries, most feminist countries, freest countries, least racist countries, most educated countries, and most LGBTQ-friendly countries.

Walgreens Boots Alliance's former CEO, Rosalind Brewer, stepped down in late August as the company was struggling with drug and staffing shortages.Health care is suffering from wider worker dissatisfaction and staffing shortages that are not isolated to drugstores, as the recent Kaiser Permanente strike shows.The exact scale of the pharmacists' protest was unclear. Organizers on Tuesday estimated that more than 300 Walgreens locations — out of nearly 9,000 nationwide — were affected by walkouts planned for Monday through Wednesday. A company spokesperson said “no more than a dozen” pharmacies experienced disruptions.A Walgreens pharmacy manager who helped organize the walkouts told The Associated Press that teams were short-staffed and overworked, especially with the additional demands from the COVID-19 pandemic.“It’s led to upset customers,” said the organizer, who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity for fear of being punished by the company. “It’s led to medication errors, vaccination errors, needle sticks.”Many Walgreens workers aren't unionized and the employees who walked out are organizing online. They shared three main requests for the company, the organizer said: to improve transparency about shifting hours and schedules; to set aside training hours for new team members; and to adjust tasks and expectations at each location based on staffing levels.The organizer said if Walgreens does not address concerns from pharmacy staff, more walkouts could happen at the end of the month.Walgreens spokesman Fraser Engerman said the company is listening to the employees' concerns.“We are committed to ensuring that our entire pharmacy team has the support and resources necessary to continue to provide the best care to our patients while taking care of their own wellbeing,” Engerman said in a statement.Story continuesDrugstores across the country are challenged by heavy workloads heading into the busy fall season. And CVS locations in the Kansas City area also saw walkouts last month, after which the company promised to boost hiring.Many of these underlying concerns about working conditions have been building for years, said Bled Tanoe, a former pharmacist who has been supporting the walkouts on social media. But the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the issue by adding new demands like testing and vaccination, without “the proper support for the people behind the counter,” she said.Brewer, who left in late August, had said the company was limiting hours at 1,100 pharmacies, or about 12% of its U.S. locations. That was down from 1,600 earlier this year, but a company executive has said it doesn’t expect to return all pharmacies to normal operating hours by year’s end.In a statement, Walgreens Executive Chairman Stefano Pessina said the company had been seeking a CEO with “deep healthcare experience.”“We are confident he is the right person to lead WBA's next phase of growth in to a customer-centric healthcare company,” Pessina said.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Gavin Newsom.The bill, written by Assemblymember Matt Haney, a San Francisco Democrat, allows pharmacists to increase staffing when they believe the workload is too much to handle.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

89,71e76a11-eaea-38ad-b4df-c962d2e89e5b,SYY,2023-10-11,7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Loading Up on Before They Soar,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-warren-buffett-loading-140833031.html,1696428513,STORY,"['DHI', 'BRK-A', 'BRK-B', 'JPM', 'SYY', 'COF', 'KO', 'OXY']","[Warren Buffett, the legendary investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B), has a keen eye for value stocks that are poised for growth. In recent months, he has been selectively adding to positions in companies he believes are undervalued and have significant upside potential. According to Berkshire Hathaway’s latest 13F filing, Buffett boosted his stakes in just five stocks during the second quarter of 2023. However, given how rapidly market conditions can change, some of the best Buffett stocks to buy now likely extend beyond these recent purchases.In this article, I will explore seven stocks that the Oracle of Omaha has been accumulating ahead of what he anticipates will be strong growth. Specifically, I will look at some of the five companies he added to based on the latest regulatory filings, along with a couple of stealth investments uncovered by my research into his other portfolios. While Buffett’s reputation is built on long-term investments, the stocks covered here appear poised for immediate gains as well.Of course, it is important to point out that even the best investors can be wrong about market movements. So, we will analyze each pick carefully, including the likely investment thesis as well as the potential risks. Notably, what Buffett bought a few months ago isn’t necessarily a good buy right now, at least in my opinion. Thus, I will be excluding picks that don’t make sense right now. Let’s have a look at the following seven Warren Buffet stocks to buy right now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B)The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comWithout a doubt, Berkshire Hathaway stock is Warren Buffett’s favorite stock to buy, as he has been consistently buying up shares of his own company. Berkshire Hathaway’s performance has been undeniable, and the time-tested company has continued to outperform in 2023. In the second quarter alone, Berkshire repurchased over $1.4 billion worth of its own shares.Story continuesBuffett clearly sees Berkshire as undervalued and an attractive investment opportunity even at current levels. The conglomerate reported a stunning $71.4 billion in operating earnings in the first half of 2023, showcasing the earnings power of Berkshire’s wide-moat businesses like Geico, BNSF Railway, and its manufacturing, service, and retail operations. Furthermore, Berkshire’s $147 billion cash pile gives it an “elephant gun” for hunting down whole companies or other major investments at good prices. With Buffett at the helm, Berkshire Hathaway remains a long-term compounding machine.Capital One Financial (COF)A street view of a Capital One (COF) bank location in New York City.Source: Northfoto / Shutterstock.comCapital One (NYSE:COF) is one of the five companies Warren Buffett boosted his stake in during Q2 2023, based on recent regulatory filings. He increased his position by more than 25%, making it among Berkshire’s top 25 holding. I’m unsure if Buffett is completely bullish with this name, even considering his current additions. However, I believe this is a great long-term pick due to its cheap valuation. The stock price has almost halved over the last two years, and now trades at just 8-times forward earnings.Sure, there are fears about the banking and financial sector in general. However, with the Federal Reserve showing willingness to bail out banks earlier this year, I believe the fears are a little excessive. Capital One reported strong Q2 earnings, with revenue topping estimates. It is aggressively cutting expenses to protect margins in a challenging environment. Furthermore, its consumer business remains robust, with ending loans and revenue up 18% each year-over-year. As macroeconomic uncertainty eventually fades, the market may realize Capital One is undervalued, providing upside for investors buying at today’s prices.Coca-Cola (KO)coca-cola bottles and cans. coke is a blue-chip stocksSource: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.comCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is one of the most consistent Warren Buffett stocks (evidenced by its low beta), and while Berkshire Hathaway did not add to its position in KO stock this past quarter, Warren Buffett’s New England Asset Management did. This consumers staples company will continue churning out cash and paying dividends, making it a great buy right now, even if it faces some short-term selling pressure. Coca-Cola reported strong Q2 2023 earnings, with 11% organic revenue growth and earnings per share growth of 11% as well.The company continues to gain market share globally, and has pricing power even in the face of inflation. Coca-Cola also pays a dividend yielding around 3.3%, and is less susceptible to economic downturns than other sectors. With its diversified portfolio of beverages and presence across 200 countries worldwide, Coca-Cola has what it takes to deliver stable returns regardless of market conditions. While not the most exciting stock, it is a core Buffett holding for good reason.Sysco (SYY)Best Stocks for Students: Sysco (SYY)Source: ShutterstockSysco (NYSE:SYY) is another stock Warren Buffett’s NEAM has been stockpiling that is poised for strong growth. His firm expanded its position in this name by 15%. Sysco has lost nearly 20% of its value from its peak, and now sits well below its pre-pandemic highs. Further short-term downside risk remains as inflation could continue squeezing margins.However, entering this stock at today’s levels will likely lead to juicy long-term gains. Sysco is the global leader in food distribution, giving it economies of scale and pricing power that smaller rivals lack. The reopening of restaurants, hotels, and other hospitality businesses Sysco serves also provides a multi-year tailwind. Notably, the company has also been cutting costs and improving efficiency.This is reflected in the company’s recent results, in which Sysco reported sales growth of more than 4%, and earnings per share that beat estimates. Notably, SYY stock provides a dividend yield which is now an attractive 3% as well. With that in mind, its dominance and margin drivers make it one of the best Warren Buffet stocks to own for the long-run.JPMorgan Chase (JPM)Source: ShutterstockJPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is one of the top lending institutions globally. Rest assured, I am almost certain that this business will not go underwater, no matter what. JPMorgan has been one of the strongest financial stocks, which is why it is also one of Berkshire Hathaway’s holdings and one of the stocks that NEAM bought in its latest reported quarter.In the most recent quarter, JPMorgan Chase reported earnings per share of $4.75 on revenue of $41.31 billion, handily beating estimates. The company has produced stellar results this year, even in a challenging macroeconomic environment, thanks to strength across business lines, including investment banking, trading, consumer banking, and more. Revenue soared 34% year-over-year.JPMorgan Chase increased its net interest income guidance for the full year 2023 to approximately $87 billion, driven by higher rates and slower deposit repricing than previously assumed. The bank grew its CET1 capital ratio to 13.8% and received approval for a lower Stress Capital Buffer requirement of 2.9% starting in its Q4 2023. This will allow JPMorgan Chase to return more capital to shareholders.While uncertainties remain relating to the forward economic outlook, competition for deposits, and pending finalization of Basel III rules, JPMorgan Chase remains optimistic about generating continued excellence through diverse conditions. The company has an unmatched competitive position and balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase currently trades at around 10-times forward earnings, which is toward the lower end of its historical range.Given its dominant position and ability to produce consistent returns across cycles, JPMorgan Chase stock appears attractively valued. This Buffett stock remains a long-term compounder to own. It is definitely one of the top Warren Buffett stocks to buy right now.D.R. Horton (DHI)In this photo illustration the D.R. Horton (DRI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comI believe D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) stock offers substantial upside, but it is also quite risky right now due to its connection with the housing market. My personal rating here would be “hold” because it could make strong moves either way, considering where the broader economy goes.In its fiscal 2023 third quarter, D.R. Horton generated $3.90 of earnings per share on revenues of $9.73 billion, soundly beating estimates. The company continues to see strong demand conditions, with consolidated net sales orders up 10.7% year-over-year. D.R. Horton also drove gross margin expansion and reduced construction cycle times by over a month.However, the housing market faces considerable uncertainty looking ahead. Rising mortgage rates have impacted affordability, slowing the frenetic pace of demand over the past couple of years. D.R. Horton has adapted by lowering prices and increasing buyer incentives. But if demand were to drop more meaningfully, it would likely pressure homebuilding profit margins.On the other hand, D.R. Horton maintains a fortress balance sheet with ample liquidity and low leverage. This gives it the flexibility to invest in growth and weather downturns better than rivals. D.R. Horton also has an industry-leading scale, geographic diversification, and an efficient operating model that produces industry-topping returns on capital.With its wide moat, D.R. Horton seems poised to continue taking market share profitably despite housing market fluctuations. But this uncertainty merits caution, until we gain more clarity on the economy and housing market. This makes DHI stock a “hold” for now.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comLikewise, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is also a little speculative, but could soar in the coming weeks. It all depends on the price of oil. Should the economy see the so-called “soft landing” economists think is possible, we will likely see elevated oil prices for quite some time. Conversely, a recession or economic slump could imply at least a 30% downside from here, in my opinion. However, I still believe this stock is a buy over the long-run due to the company’s oil reserves, as well as its impressive dividend.In Q2 2023, Occidental generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.68, missing expectations. However, total production beat guidance by 42,000 BOE per day, as operational execution continued humming. Occidental raised its full-year 2023 production outlook and generated over $1 billion of free cash flow, even with planned maintenance downtime.Occidental bought also back $425 million of common shares in Q2 and has now completed about 40% of its $3 billion repurchase program. It also redeemed another $520 million of preferred equity. Occidental believes it can sustain shareholder payouts above $4 per common share at oil prices of $75 per barrel or above. Yet, shares trade very cheaply at just 7-times earnings.

The round was led by Badlands Capital with notable participation from an early utility partner of Thread's, Minnkota Power Cooperative, Generational Partners, Rosecliff Ventures, Excell Partners, Homegrown Capital and Kevin O'Leary's Wonder Fund North Dakota. This new round of funding accelerates Thread's horizontal expansion across asset types and enables the company to continue developing its UNITI platform, which is positioned to become the first practical turnkey Asset Performance Management (APM) platform for the energy and utilities industry.Since its inception, Thread has proven its ability to automate data capture of utility assets via robotic inspection across wind, oil and gas, and now linear (transmission and distribution) at scale. The company works across the fleets of several Fortune 500 customers including Xcel Energy and with major asset protection companies such as MISTRAS Group.""We recognize the challenges our customers face in today's dynamic utility sector,"" said Josh Riedy, Founder and CEO of Thread. ""The aging of the world's critical infrastructure, disconnected workflow integrations between traditional software and shiny object vendors, and a depleting skilled workforce in Operations &amp; Maintenance (O&amp;M) continue to be major issues in data collection, which makes it increasingly difficult for stakeholders to make data-driven decisions. This Series A funding allows us to better service our customer's needs by bridging the gap between legacy one-off inspections and real-time asset performance data, bringing the industry into the digital age. We are enabling our customers to cut inspection workstreams from days into hours, using UNITI as a single point for collaborative decision-making and O&amp;M spend prioritization.""Story continuesThe $1T Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for new energy infrastructure has elevated industry demands for a more robust way to monitor the health of its most critical assets. ""UNITI by Thread is cementing its position as the industry-standard,"" said Blaine Crissman, General Partner at Badlands Capital. ""Thread empowers its customers to make more data-driven decisions around inspection and maintenance through digital representation and autonomous upkeep of their assets.""""For nearly a decade, utility operators have been disappointed by unkept promises of low-cost, on-demand drone inspections,"" said Asher Kraut, Partner at Generational Partners. ""Thread has not only fully automated the inspection process, but they've also built a turnkey platform that empowers its customers to make Operations and Maintenance decisions based on real-time data across their entire fleet of assets. Thread is a prime example of an emerging business that is leveraging well-understood technologies once considered 'deep tech' to solve today's most crucial customer challenges. What's more, they're achieving this in a safety-critical industrial environment that will define the next generation of founders and investors.""Thread also announced the expansion of its relationship with Xcel Energy, one of its earliest customers and co-development collaborators. This work will advance the development of Thread's flagship product, UNITI, to ensure its viability for deployment at scale across all asset types in the utility industry globally. This relationship, which is the first-of-its-kind for Xcel Energy, puts both organizations at the forefront of transforming the way energy and utility operators utilize automation, robotics, and business intelligence to drive asset performance.As presented at a recent Utilities Imagery and Inspection Consortium Conference of top Utility leaders, the value of transforming Utility asset health was of prime concern.""When Xcel Energy began automated wind inspections in-house, we changed the dynamic of how we work on a day-to-day basis, as well as how we manage our data and assets,"" said Thomas Stegge UAS Program Manager, Xcel Energy. ""What we have learned from this transition is flowing into changing asset management strategies across the entire company.""About ThreadThread, formerly Airtonomy, is the leading data solution for enterprises looking to streamline and transform critical infrastructure lifecycle management. Leveraging its proprietary, data-driven, and robust platform technology, Thread embeds unmanned aerial systems and robotics with a suite of applications to automate enterprise inspection workflows and to create the first inspection-based digital asset catalog.

This will help it deliver better care to its provider network with active collaboration and create better, meaningful, and standard metrics for behavioral healthcare.This move bodes well for Evernorth as it would improve health outcomes of patients in the provider network and help with client retention. Evernorth Health Services segment aims to bring value or measurement-based care to behavioral health, which has existed for a long time in physical health. As providers and payers continue their journey toward value-based care, programs to improve the quality of care and reduce administrative costs should poise Cigna’s Evernorth well for growth. The company expects the Evernorth Health Services segment to report adjusted operating income on a pretax basis of a minimum of $6.4 billion in 2023.Through this initiative, Evernorth will strengthen its interventions with patients and improve its relationship with providers. A lack of consistent and repeatable measures marks this program as a time opportune one, as this would reduce administrative work and ensure trust from providers. This new program aims to align the measurement of treatments, improving quality of care while reducing costs. Collaborating with providers and establishing measurement touchpoints would benefit patients and clients as well as solidify Evernorth’s core value proposition.Evernorth will work with 44,000 providers, including behavioral health coaches, therapists etc, and build on its existing metrics, like the time taken for a patient to get an appointment, to ensure high-quality care is provided. Tracking such information will aid providers in focusing on patient care and improve outcomes for patients and providers. Shared metrics can be used by providers and payers to get insights into a patient’s journey and improve the value-based care provided.Story continuesShares of Cigna have gained 8.7% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 1.4% growth.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231010228617/en/(Photo: Business Wire)This study involved more than 800,000 ICU patients in 137 HCA Healthcare hospitals, and built upon an earlier study among these research partners demonstrating that daily bathing with antiseptic chlorhexidine soap plus nasal mupirocin for all ICU patients prevented many bloodstream and other serious infections. This strategy is called ""decolonization"" because it reduces the amount of bacteria on the body in order to reduce infection risk. Today, as a result of the previous study, the majority of ICUs bathe patients with chlorhexidine; however, only one-third of hospital ICUs provide nasal mupirocin to all patients, largely due to fears of fueling antibiotic resistance.Because of a concern that disease-causing bacteria might become resistant to mupirocin, the investigators compared mupirocin to an alternative nasal antiseptic product, known as povidone-iodine or iodophor.The Mupirocin-Iodophor Swap Out Trial directly compared nasal mupirocin to nasal iodophor in the context of chlorhexidine bathing. The trial found that mupirocin worked significantly better than the antiseptic in preventing Staphylococcus aureus infection, including those due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus, or MRSA. The CDC-funded study was published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).Story continues""This study further supports CDC guidance on using a strategy that combines nasal decolonization plus CHG bathing in ICU patients. Furthermore, the data show that using mupirocin for nasal decolonization may be preferred over iodophor because it is more effective at preventing S. aureus infections or colonization. S.aureus infections account for nearly a quarter of the infections in ICUs in the United States,"" said John Jernigan, MD, Branch Chief, CDC’s Epidemiology, Research and Innovations Branch.The results resolved the question about whether nasal treatment is necessary in addition to chlorhexidine bathing to prevent these ICU infections. ""This large study confirms that clearing the nose of bacteria prevents infection, and that the choice of product matters. Mupirocin antibiotic ointment remains the best treatment, and serious ICU infections can be avoided by simply giving patients mupirocin for the first five days of an ICU stay along with daily chlorhexidine bathing. Povidone-iodine does not work as well,"" remarked lead investigator, Susan S. Huang, M.D., M.P.H., professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine.The 137 participating community hospitals spanned 18 states and are part of HCA Healthcare, a leader in pragmatic research in real-life settings. Half of the hospitals continued their standard practice of treating ICU patients with mupirocin nasal ointment, and the other half switched to nasal povidone-iodine. All hospitals used the nasal product for five days plus chlorhexidine for daily bathing.Importantly, this trial showed a durable benefit from mupirocin. The use of an antibiotic ointment for the past 10 years at HCA Healthcare did not diminish its impact. There was similar persistent clinical benefit even after nearly a decade of continuous ICU use, suggesting that use of chlorhexidine soap and mupirocin had not lost their effect. This is important because widespread antibiotic use can lead to antibiotic resistance in some instances.Because of the size of the study and the fact that it was conducted at such a wide range of community hospitals, the results are generally believed to be applicable to hospitals across the country.""HCA Healthcare is honored to continue collaborating with the CDC, UCI Health and the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute to leverage our scale to answer clinical questions that will benefit patients everywhere,"" said Kenneth Sands, MD MPH, chief epidemiologist at HCA Healthcare. ""The remarkable benefit from our earlier REDUCE MRSA study to evaluate this protocol for preventing ICU infections led to widespread adoption across our hospital system 10 years ago. This new trial confirms the effectiveness of the mupirocin CHG protocol, and we have already put this science into practice, establishing universal use of mupirocin as the preferred agent for nasal decolonization in all hospitals.""The study was conducted through a longstanding scientific consortium, including HCA Healthcare, Harvard Medical School’s Department of Population Medicine at the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, the University of California, Irvine and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This same scientific group conducted the REDUCE MRSA Trial over 10 years ago, which first showed that this decolonization regimen could reduce MRSA by 37% and bloodstream infections by 44%. Now, the Mupirocin-Iodophor Swap Out Trial showed that switching from mupirocin to iodophor produced 18% less protection from S. aureus infections.""A unique opportunity presented itself to compare our REDUCE MRSA trial from 10 years ago to the Mupirocin-Iodophor Swap Out Trial. Although mupirocin was clearly better than povidone-iodine, there was also a strong suggestion that povidone-iodine was also preventative when compared to ICUs in the prior trial that received no nasal anti-infective. This provides even more evidence for the important role of the nose as a source of infection,"" adds senior author Richard Platt, MD, MSc, professor and chair of the Department of Population Medicine at the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute and Harvard Medical School.The Mupirocin-Iodophor Swap Out Trial adds to a growing set of evidence that reducing the amount of bacteria on the skin and in the nose through decolonization can protect patients from infection during high-risk moments. This same scientific group not only conducted the REDUCE MRSA Trial, but also the ABATE Infection Trial which showed that decolonization of hospitalized patients with medical devices outside of the ICU reduces both bloodstream infections and antibiotic-resistant pathogens.""This study provides additional evidence of the benefit of reducing the burden of pathogens in or on a patient’s body,"" said Dr. Jernigan. ""Not only does this reduce risk for patients who are carrying harmful germs, but it may also reduce the spread of these germs to others. To maximize the impact of this promising strategy, we hope the Mupirocin-Iodophor Swap Out Trial will inspire the research and development of a greater number of agents that can be brought to market to extend the benefit of pathogen reduction.""Additional information about the Mupirocin-Iodophor Swap Out Trial can be found in the following JAMA author interview podcast: https://edhub.ama-assn.org/jn-learning/audio-player/10.1001/jama.2023.19978.About Centers for Disease Control and PreventionThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is one of the major operating components of the Department of Health and Human Services.

PPG Industries (PPG), which belongs to the Zacks Chemical - Specialty industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This paint and coatings maker has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 11.28%.For the most recent quarter, PPG Industries was expected to post earnings of $2.14 per share, but it reported $2.25 per share instead, representing a surprise of 5.14%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.55 per share, while it actually produced $1.82 per share, a surprise of 17.42%.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for PPG Industries. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.PPG Industries has an Earnings ESP of +0.32% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on October 18, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.PPG Industries in FocusHeadquartered in Pittsburgh, PPG Industries (PPG) is a Basic Materials stock that has seen a price change of 2.4% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $0.65 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.02%. In comparison, the Chemical - Specialty industry's yield is 0.91%, while the S&amp;P 500's yield is 1.73%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $2.60 is up 7.4% from last year. In the past five-year period, PPG Industries has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 6.74%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. PPG Industries's current payout ratio is 36%. This means it paid out 36% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for PPG for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $7.49 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 23.80%.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Story continuesFor instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, PPG is a compelling investment opportunity.

(Brian Snyder/REUTERS) (Brian Snyder / reuters)Whether US banks are properly prepared for an extended period of high rates will be a central theme running through the third quarter earnings season that kicks off Friday with results from giants JPMorgan (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC).The Federal Reserve made it clear in September that it expects rates to stay higher for longer. That stance will continue to place pressure on banks by making deposits more expensive, deepening paper losses on bonds held for investment, and making it more difficult for bank borrowers to pay back their loans.A focus for many investors in the coming weeks will be what banks say about a key measure of profitability known as net interest income, which measures the difference between what banks earn on their loans and pay for deposits.Those margins have been under pressure from the Fed’s campaign to cool inflation and the intense competition for depositors that followed the chaos of the spring, when the failures of three sizable regional banks stoked panic throughout the financial world.""The length of time we stay at these levels is a critical factor,"" Scott Siefers, a large bank analyst for Piper Sandler, told Yahoo Finance. ""If rates stay up here for years, it'll just be this grind higher where banks have to pay more to every incremental account.""Hammered during the regional banking crisis in March, bank stocks have notably lagged the S&amp;P 500 this year, even as they've recovered from their lows reached back in May.As of Tuesday, the S&amp;P Bank Index ETF (KBE) and the S&amp;P Regional Bank Index ETF (KRE) were down more than 18% and 29% year to date, respectively. The S&amp;P 500, in contrast, has gained nearly 13% this year.Story continuesGerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC who covers large banks, told Yahoo Finance that if the Fed is done with its interest rate hikes, stocks are likely ""bottoming out."" But the risk, he said, is that the Fed can’t get inflation under control and has to take rates above 7% in 2024.""That's the bear case for the banks,"" Cassidy said about the possibility of more hikes, calling it “long-tail risk” for the industry.September forecasts from the Federal Reserve suggested one additional rate hike would be necessary in 2023 before rate cuts begin next year.The lessons of 2008The big bank that appears to be best positioned for an era of higher rates is JPMorgan, which signaled as early as 2020 that it wasn’t willing to take a lot of risk with an influx of deposits that flooded into all banks during the early days of the pandemic.Some of JPMorgan’s rivals began investing that money in longer-dated securities in a search for higher yield, only to see the value of those holdings go down once the Fed began raising rates.The unrealized losses that piled up were partly responsible for the fall of Silicon Valley Bank, which attempted in March to sell large amounts of its bonds at a loss in a last-ditch effort to gain more liquidity.Dimon, according to a person familiar with his thinking, is concerned that some banks didn’t do enough to fix their balance sheets following the events of this spring. JPMorgan in May purchased operations from another lender seized by regulators, First Republic.The current period reminds him, this person said, of the months following the March 2008 fall of Wall Street investment bank Bear Stearns, which JPMorgan also purchased with help from the US government.Not enough institutions used that March 2008 warning to fix their balance sheets, leaving them vulnerable to a systemwide crisis that roiled the global economy in September of that year.When JPMorgan releases its third quarter results this Friday, its profits are expected to outshine other large banks.It is the only one of the big four banks expected to show a rise in net interest income when compared with the second quarter. Its jump when compared to the third quarter of 2022 is also expected to far outpace those at Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo.Bank of America is among the lenders that are now paying for a decision to pile hundreds of billions into longer-dated Treasurys and mortgage bonds during the pandemic. Those holdings were down by more than $100 billion on paper as of June 30.The unrealized losses are a big reason investors have pushed Bank of America’s stock near a 52-week low.Analysts don’t expect Bank of America to have a need to sell those holdings, and therefore book a loss.But smaller banks may not have as many options, which could create new concern among investors. All banks held $309.6 billion in unrealized losses as of the second quarter, a 9% rise from the first quarter and a 28% rise from last year.“An institution that has very large unrealized losses without enough explanation could generate concern and that's what we saw in the spring,” Eric Rosengren, the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, told Yahoo Finance.There will be other challenges to look for in third quarter results. Analysts expect banks big and small to set aside more money for future loan losses and take higher charge-offs as borrowers begin to struggle to repay their debts.Big banks with sizable Wall Street operations, such as Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), will also be trying to show that a two-year slump in dealmaking is finally waning.The drought is far from over, however, according to Dealogic data. Global investment banking revenue is expected to be down by 10% from last quarter and 17% from a year ago.High rates are not all bad for the industry, some analysts said. They do allow bankers to charge more for their loans, and that could help some institutions when demand for new borrowings picks up.And bank stocks could recover in 2024 if it’s clear the Fed is done with its campaign to cool inflation.Aside from the risk that loan losses mount, ""higher for longer, ultimately, should be a positive for bank fundamentals,"" David Chiaverini, regional and midsized bank analyst for Wedbush, told Yahoo Finance.David Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking and crypto.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 17. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis investment bank is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.84 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -29.2%.Revenues are expected to be $11.08 billion, down 7.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.74% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Goldman?For Goldman, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -11.96%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Goldman will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Goldman would post earnings of $3.25 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.08, delivering a surprise of -5.23%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Goldman doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This year’s survey looks at progress in modernizing back-office finance processes for businesses amid the impact of multiple macroeconomic factors. The 2023 report includes responses from buyers and their vendors, presenting a complete view of the AP and payment automation landscape.“As businesses continue to face a number of challenges and pressures, finance teams are being tasked with finding new ways to drive operating efficiencies and get more control over cash flow,” said Brian Greehan, head of B2B Solutions for Global Payments. “In response, they are prioritizing investments in back-office automation and working with vendors to increase the adoption of digital payments.”MineralTree’s 2023 State of AP Report explores these trends and their significant impact on finance teams. It also offers practical guidance to help businesses continue to optimize their AP and payment operations.Some key themes highlighted in the report, include:Recessionary headwinds, rising costs and hybrid workplaces are pressuring AP teams to do more with less With increasing corporate belt-tightening, finance leaders are focused on boosting the productivity of lean AP teams and taking measures to cut costs.59% of finance leaders cite doing more with less, followed by reducing AP processing costs (49%); improving the ability to manage cash flow (43%); and gaining better visibility into their current cash position (42%).Almost half (45%) of firms looking to hire anticipate hiring challenges and delays.AP teams are also more likely to work remote, as 68% of AP work environments are now hybrid or fully remote–which is expected to increase over the next year.Story continuesAP automation is providing critical value and remains a top digitization priorityAP automation is allowing finance teams to do more with less.An overwhelming majority of teams surveyed using AP automation realized efficiency gains (85%) and faster, more timely payments (63%).58% are able to absorb a growing volume of invoices and payments with the same-sized team. Almost a quarter (24%) have reallocated freed-up staff time to other projects. In addition, they are gaining much-needed visibility into cash flow and working capital.For those who have begun the automation journey, the most digitized AP task is invoice approval/workflows (71%), followed by invoice data capture and coding (66%), payment execution (58%) and payment authorization (58%).Vendor relationships play a growing role in the adoption of AP automationThe pandemic put a lot of focus on the importance of strategic vendor relationships and that sentiment continues to grow.Two-thirds (66%) of finance leaders agree or strongly agree that their vendor relationships have grown in importance.Vendors continue to rank speed of payment as the top priority in the payment experience but are unhappy with the time it takes to respond to payment inquiries. This remains their top pain point in the customer payment process.Vendor dissatisfaction may be growing. Just over half (52%) feel that AP follows up on payment inquiries in a timely manner, compared to 56% last year.Currently, only 20% of businesses have fully automated their AP processes, creating ample opportunity for businesses to evolve their processes in order to remain competitive. In addition to these key themes, the report offers guidance every business can take to optimize their payment operations, including:Businesses that begin to automate can focus on immediate wins that deliver ROI, such as digitizing paper invoices and automating approval routing.Businesses that have automated some aspects of their AP workflow can realize even better results by automating additional elements, such as vendor payments. End-to-end automation increases operational efficiencies, enables more timely payments and improves cash flow management.By using managed payment services to remove some of the upfront administrative requirements, companies can more quickly enroll vendors for virtual card payments and accelerate ROI from automation.Analyzing invoice and payment data can help businesses identify opportunities to reduce spend and maximize cash flow by consolidating vendors, timing payments and taking better advantage of early payment discounts.The full report delves into all of these topics and more in greater detail and is available for download here.About the MineralTree State of Accounts Payable (AP) Report 2023For the eighth consecutive year, MineralTree surveyed a wide range of finance professionals to analyze their current state of finance operations, challenges, and outlook for the year ahead.

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Wall Street Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 5 Stocks.As financial landscapes evolve in response to economic forces and global dynamics, the delicate interplay of credit becomes an ever-more crucial orchestrator, shaping the fortunes of businesses, consumers, and entire economies. Credit is crucial for the smooth functioning of the U.S. economy, facilitating major purchases like cars and homes. Businesses also heavily rely on credit through loans, lines of credit, and equipment loans. Credit availability is essential for economic growth, and its scarcity can impede the purchasing of vehicles, homes, and equipment, hindering business inventories and overall economic expansion. Recent data from the Federal Reserve's ""Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices"" indicates tighter credit standards for both consumer and business loans, reflecting lenders' concerns about an uncertain economic outlook. According to Wells Fargo Advisors, this trend is expected to persist, further tightening credit conditions. Despite better-than-expected consumer spending, a significant portion is driven by borrowing, with credit card debt surpassing $1 trillion. However, the savings levels for most households remain below pre-pandemic levels. This suggests that consumers' ability to propel the economy forward is weakening, indicating a potential economic slowdown. Given expectations of stumbling consumer spending and tighter credit conditions, investors are advised to adopt a more defensive portfolio approach. Anticipating more equity downside from current levels, better buying opportunities are foreseen in the future.On October 10, in response to remarks from Federal Reserve officials suggesting a potential pause in policy adjustments until year-end, both Treasuries and Asian stocks experienced notable movements. The yield on the two-year Treasury, sensitive to policy changes, witnessed its most significant drop since late August. Simultaneously, the benchmark 10-year Treasury had its strongest performance since March. Traders, interpreting these developments, increased speculation that the U.S. tightening cycle might be nearing its conclusion. Additionally, concerns surrounding the Israel-Hamas conflict contributed to heightened demand for safe-haven assets. This combination of factors has created a dynamic market environment with implications for both fixed-income and equity markets. After experiencing its most significant gain in six months, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil pulled back, dropping below $86 a barrel. The surge, triggered by attacks from Hamas on Israel, led to a 4.3% increase on Monday. However, concerns escalated as Israel declared that its retaliation had just commenced, heightening the potential for increased instability in the Middle East.Story continuesOn the stock market front, analysts are bearish on stocks such as Visa Inc.

(NYSE:DPZ)Price Reaction after the Price Target Cut: +8.58 (+2.51%)On October 9, BofA Securities analyst Sara Senatore made adjustments to the price target for Domino's Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ), revising it downward from $483.00 to $461.00. Despite the reduction in the target price, Senatore maintained a favorable buy rating for the company. This move reflects the analyst's updated evaluation of Domino's Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) within the broader context of the industry.

(NYSE:DPZ).LRT Capital made the following comment about Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) in its October investor letter:“Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) is the world’s largest franchisor of pizza restaurants with over 13,800 locations in 85 countries. As for any restaurant operator, the key metric to consider for Domino’s Pizza is same-store-sales (SSS) growth. Growing same-store-sales are ultimately how a restaurant business increases earnings from its existing assets. The company continues to impress in this criterion with SSS having grown in the U.S. for 40 consecutive quarters, and an astounding 109 straight quarters internationally.Two-thirds of the company’s stores are currently abroad, and the international segment remains the company’s largest growth opportunity, as the penetration of convenient fast food remains lower abroad than in the United States. Pizza is a product with exceptionally high gross margins, one that “translates” well across different cultures, and one that literally “travels well”, not losing much of its appeal when delivered in a cardboard box. The rise of 3rd party delivery platforms such as Uber Eats, Doordash and Grubhub is challenging the pizza category as it has expanded the number of choices consumers have for convenient takeout. However, the economics of food delivery remain challenging for most restaurants and platforms alike25, while pizza delivery continues to be highly profitable. Regardless of how the “delivery wars” currently playing out end, Domino’s financial results show little impact of this increased competition, and the company continues to deliver exceptional financial performance…” (Click here to read the full text)09.

The pay-TV provider, with unique potential to become a viable fourth wireless carrier, continues to face challenges executing its wireless buildout in a higher rate environment where a leveraged balance sheet is a liability. We believe there is still value to be captured for Dish, but it is clearly taking longer to realize, and we are monitoring the stock closely.”08. Netflix, Inc.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“In 2022, some of our holdings had difficulty achieving revenue growth in line with their long-term trends because of difficult comparisons and changing COVID dynamics. Now, most of these companies have experienced a rebound in revenue growth and have also shown a newfound willingness to control their operating expenditures, yielding substantial margin expansion and earnings growth. For example, Amazon and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) (two of our top three absolute contributors to our return in 2Q) are exercising more stringent spending discipline while revenue growth accelerates, a powerful combination for earnings growth in our view.The top absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance in the second quarter were Amazon, Netflix, and Microsoft. As mentioned, Amazon and Netflix are seeing their revenue growth accelerate after a difficult 2022 while keeping expense growth in check. We expect robust earnings growth for both companies in 2023 and growth rates in the mid-teens or higher well into the future.”07. Dominion Energy, Inc.

(NASDAQ:META)Price Reaction after the Price Target Cut: +2.93 (+0.93%)On October 9, Wells Fargo &amp; Company took a stance on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), adjusting its outlook by lowering the price target from $389.00 to $372.00. Despite this reduction, the current market price for Meta stands at $318.36, indicating a modest increase of 0.9%. Wells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski, in light of a higher spending outlook, made this adjustment while maintaining an overweight rating.

(NASDAQ:META) outperforming the broader market, even with the revised price target.Artisan Global Value Fund made the following comment about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Our best performing stocks this quarter were Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet and Heidelberg Materials. Meta was the largest contributor to performance. Its shares have almost fully recovered from last year’s declines, rising 35% during the quarter and 138% YTD. During the quarter, the company reported earnings that showed a return to growth and healthy user engagement metrics. Most importantly, profitability appears to have stabilized and is poised to improve as significant cost reduction actions implemented over the past six months begin to have an impact. Separate from fundamental performance, there is excitement over AI’s potential to help the company’s business. While Meta’s technology prowess and massively scaled media platform certainly position the company to take advantage of AI, we believe it’s far too early to estimate any discrete tangible benefits. Overall, we view AI as one of several drivers that will contribute to Meta’s continued growth.” Click to continue reading and see Wall Street Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 5 Stocks. Suggested articles:15 Biggest Agricultural Companies in the US10 Best Regional Bank ETFs10 Best Infrastructure ETFsDisclosure: None.

To skip our detailed analysis of the US markets today, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Growth Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.Is Now The Right Time To Invest?Equity investors in American stocks today might be wondering when the right time to invest in US stocks will come around. With market volatility and economic conditions across the world making most investors and businesses cautious about major decisions involving larger sums of money, this line of thinking is becoming more commonplace than some might have expected. At this moment, one thing investors can do to ensure they make sound investment decisions is to remain apprised of not only current events in the US markets but also of expert opinions on how to approach the market at present.On October 10, Paul Tudor Jones, the founder and Chief Investment Officer of Tudor Investment, joined CNBC's 'Squawk Box' to give his take on current market trends and more. Here are some of his comments:""The United States is probably in its weakest fiscal position since, certainly, World War II, with debt-to-GDP at a 122%. So, it's a really tough time for, I think, the moral voice of the world.""Geopolitical Tensions As A Barrier To InvestmentJones sees the current geopolitical environment of the world as ""the most threatening"" and ""challenging"" environment he has ever seen, with the recent developments in the Israel-Palestine crisis and the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian crisis. Here's what he had to say on these issues, alongside how they and US economic conditions are impacting equity investors in the US:""It's a really challenging time to wanna be an equity investor in US stocks right now, it's really hard, because again you've got the geopolitical uncertainty, which we, I think, have come to live with to a certain extent. Equally as much of a problem is the fiscal situation that we're facing in the United States, which is gonna require a completely different political mentality.""Story continuesAll in all, Jones highlighted the existing barriers and challenges that may hinder equity investors in the US markets from taking part in the investment cycles. However, investors can still remain active in the markets by carefully picking out reliable stocks with high growth potential, especially those stocks that have lived up to their growth potential in the past.

(NYSE:NOW) in its July 2023 investor letter:“US-based software company ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) delivered another impressive quarterly result that came in ahead of analysts expectations. Subscription revenues grew 25% year-on-year in constant currency terms to $2.1 billion and operating margins came in at 23.4%. Despite ongoing variability in the macro backdrop, ServiceNow continues to benefit from spend prioritisation within the IT tech stack as vendors look to consolidate back-office apps onto an integrated platform. The company’s operational metrics held firm, with remaining performance obligations growing 24% year-on-year to $14.2 billion and renewal rates ticking up to 99%.

They speak to the mission critical nature of the platform and are a key driver of long term annuity value.Investors were also excited to hear management speak to the burgeoning artificial intelligence (AI) opportunity. Things are moving fast and the company plans to release new premium offerings of their workflow products – across IT, customer service and human resources – towards the back end of 2023 that will have new Generative AI capabilities embedded into them. Management also mentioned that they anticipate these new offerings could deliver a “minimum” 60%-plus list price uplift relative to its current Pro versions as they provide meaningful productivity improvements for end users. Whilst it’s still early days, ServiceNow appears well placed to capitalise on the Generative-AI opportunity and we believe it could be a meaningful driver for the company’s next phase of growth.”13.

(NASDAQ:ADBE). Their total stake value was $6.1 billion.Here's what Harding Loevner said about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Although the market initially feared that Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) would lose out to Al image-generating programs Dall-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, the design-software giant has since released its own generative Al model called Firefly. One feature of Firefly is that it can help designers generate ideas and create and manipulate images more quickly in Photoshop or Illustrator that can then be processed by other Adobe products for further development, fostering a seamless workflow. There’s more work involved when trying to manipulate images created by outside tools. Also, because Firefly is trained on Adobe’s vast inventory of stock images and other licensed content, it can generate professional-quality, commercially viable results, further setting it apart from generic models that are often trained on copyrighted content that isn’t properly licensed. These are just two examples of how Al enhances the Adobe suite, which should allow the company to raise subscription prices and upsell users.”11. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor company that offers x86 microprocessors and graphics processing units (GPUs).

(NASDAQ:AMD) shares on August 3 by Cody Acree at Benchmark.This is what Artisan Partners said about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Among our top contributors were Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NU Holdings and Netflix. AMD’s data center CPUs are used in the cloud service provider (CSP) servers. In addition to the broader secular tailwind from cloud adoption, the company has a performance and pricing advantage over Intel, which we believe will enable it to continue capturing market share. However, the recent stock price rally was due to growing excitement around the company’s AI exposure. It will launch its new MI300 graphics processing unit (GPU) chip later this year to compete against the dominant market leader NVIDIA. Similar to its approach that won market share from Intel within the CPU market, AMD’s product will aim to provide similar performance at a more attractive price. AMD is already working with Microsoft and Meta, while Amazon publicly stated that it is evaluating AMD’s inferencing chips. Using assumptions around the total GPU market size, potential market share gains and price points, our research indicates this could be a $20 billion opportunity for AMD. That would nearly double its revenue. While the company has not historically missed many deadlines, there is execution risk as it works to manufacture and distribute these complex chips at scale, which, combined with an elevated valuation after the stock’s strong performance run, led us to trim the position.”10.

(NYSE:CRM), a company we’ve owned since 2019, recently added ChatGPT-like capabilities onto its existing Al module, Einstein, to support its internal sales efforts and customer-facing software. For example, Einstein GPT can help generate marketing emails tailored to specific clients by using Salesforce’s customer database and past email correspondence to learn the most effective approach for each client. Einstein GPT is also different from off-the-shelf LLMS in three important ways: It keeps personal identifiable information private and secure, compared with external tools that retain anything a user enters. It employs the latest data in Salesforce’s system, as opposed to the sometimes-stale public data that train generic models. And generative Al capabilities can be integrated with other Salesforce offerings; the company has already introduced Slack GPT and Tableau GPT, Al-equipped versions of its workplace collaboration and analytics tools.”8.

113,a18860a2-1fce-375c-8d63-29c10eb370b9,NFLX,2023-10-11,YouTube surpasses Netflix as top video platform for teens: Survey,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/youtube-surpasses-netflix-top-video-212140015.html,1696972900,VIDEO,"['NFLX', 'GOOG', 'GOOGL']","[A new report from Piper Sandler finds YouTube (GOOGL, GOOG) has overtaken Netflix (NFLX) as the top daily video platform for teens. The research shows teens now spend 29% of their daily video time on YouTube, with Netflix falling 200 basis points.Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal, Josh Schafer and Pras Subramanian analyze potential factors behind this shift, suggesting Netflix cracking down on password sharing and YouTube emerging as the central hub for creator content and podcasts may be driving more teen engagement.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptALEXANDRA CANAL: Guys, today we're talking teenagers, good old teens. Because Piper Sandler is out with their biannual--JOSH SCHAFER: I cannot laugh at that.ALEXANDRA CANAL: --survey about what Gen Z is looking at and caring about. And apparently, Netflix no longer is at the top. They're actually falling for the first time behind YouTube, dropping 200 basis points compared to six months ago. Now, of course, we're in this fragmented media environment. There's a lot of competition out there. YouTube has also been upping its game when it comes to some of the content plays. And I also thought of the password sharing crackdown, where if you're a college student, you now have to pay for your own subscription.JOSH SCHAFER: Yep.ALEXANDRA CANAL: It doesn't matter if you're still using your parents' credit card at the bar. You still, at the end of the day, need your own subscription. So that's what came to mind for me.JOSH SCHAFER: To me, it could get to a way that-- we've known for a while now, I think, how younger people consume content and YouTube being a core piece of that. YouTube getting into Shorts, being good with that, but also people watch podcasts on YouTube now. People watch comedy skits on YouTube. They watch their favorite creators on YouTube, and that is not something that Netflix really has.Story continuesI mean, Netflix has gotten into comedy shows certainly more and gotten into things like that, but the streamers don't have that unique edge that YouTube has, which is, I'm going to go into the search bar, Google-style, type in my favorite person, and just watch a clip of them. And it's going to be super-quick hitting. It's going to be five minutes, and then they're going to feed me another thing that I want again after. YouTube is much more of a social media than Netflix is.So it's not shocked when you take a look at the stat of streaming being watched. It's the percentage of streaming people watched per day. It doesn't necessarily shock me that YouTube's higher.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, and the thing is, like, two points, right? So clearly, Netflix and YouTube dominating the space for teens, dominating, like you said, 29%-28%. A slight sort of win there for YouTube. And I think YouTube is sort of that's where it's at.If you think about like how Alex said, the Google search type way of modality of watching. I just saw that-- read up that the advertising was up 4.4% last quarter, and that actually was down the last three quarters, which is surprising to me. I'm like what's going on here?I'm not sure about that, but I'm not surprised that it's rebounding there. But that's where it's at, I think. That's where those ad dollars are going to go from linear TV because they're not watching linear TV. That's not happening.JOSH SCHAFER: Well, I think-- I mean, I talk about it a decent amount. I'm on the older end of Gen Z, and I experience some of these trends. I think a little bit differently than some people. And when I was in college, I had never used YouTube on a TV, like used YouTube on a smart TV to just search something and watch. And I found more and more people in the dorm rooms over my years there were doing that, and it was something--PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I do that now.JOSH SCHAFER: --yeah. And it was something I had never quite experienced, but I think more young people are doing that. You are with a group of people and you use YouTube as something to watch, rather than-- Netflix is a hard algorithm sometimes for group watching--ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: --and just wanting to watch something. I think YouTube sort of fills a little bit of a void there.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, I'm a fan of YouTube. I even think, just education-wise, I remember in college, I would look at YouTube--JOSH SCHAFER: Use it, yeah.ALEXANDRA CANAL: --use it when I was studying accounting.

For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: Well, in terms of stocks that we are watching on the day, a new report from the information, laying out how Netflix's advertising push may be proving tougher than the streaming giant expected-- shares of the company down by 3%. And they are trending on the Yahoo Finance platform.Now, the information, which covers the tech industry, reporting here that there are some personnel changes at Netflix, that the Ad Sales Chief Jeremi Gorman is being replaced with Amy Reinhart, which is-- who is a-- Netflix Executive. That's been there for a while.Josh, there's been sort of waves here up and down of the expectations that people had for Netflix's ad-supported offering. But it felt like the latest wave was pretty positive.JOSH LIPTON: Yeah, interesting that other-- I mean, folks reminding me actually that we've had some shuffles in that C-suite. [? You know, ?] last week, we named new executives take on the roles of Chief Product Officer, Chief Technology Officer. So there's been some movement there. Stock may not be, you know, doing a whole lot today. You can actually see us down more than 3%. But it's been a nice performer this year.Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: Yeah, it has in part on that optimism over this ad offering and what kind of revenue. They were incremental revenue [? they ?] were going to get from that. So it's interesting here to have this what-- purports to be this sort of behind the scenes reporting from the information, that maybe things there are not quite as solid as analysts had anticipated. But, as you say, it's still up 62% over the past year.JOSH LIPTON: Not a bad [? note. ?]JULIE HYMAN: Not at all.JOSH LIPTON: Shares of solar companies rising in Today's Trade. France-- announcing plans to boost solar power capacity in the country. And, meanwhile, California regulators delay a decision to cut incentives for rooftop solar panels installations for apartments, schools, and farms.And you can see these moves here, Julie. Look at SunPower, First Solar, Sunrun, SolarEdge-- huge moves in the space.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, huge moves, and it's a space that has been beat up recently or, at the very least, has been volatile recently. SolarEdge-- in particular, was catching my attention because it was one of the worst performers in the S&amp;P 500 yesterday. It is domiciled in Israel.JOSH LIPTON: Interesting, yeah.JULIE HYMAN: So it was swept up as well in the wave of stocks yesterday that were falling that had associations in that country as war breaks out there. But many of those stocks-- I've been watching others the likes of Mobileye, Fiverr. Many of the Israel-- Israeli-based stocks have been coming back today, likewise, many of these solar stocks coming back today.That California decision is just delayed until early November, that might cut incentives for solar panels and solar installations in various areas. But, nonetheless, it's-- the delay is enough to create some relief there in that group.JOSH LIPTON: All right, one to watch.JULIE HYMAN: Yes. And also, we're watching another one here. EA-- Electronic Arts, Bank of America upgrading that stock to buy from neutral. And the firm seeing the risk balance of EA's rebrand of its FIFA franchise-- now appearing attractive. Are you-- are you a gaming guy? Do you get--JOSH LIPTON: You know, I'm-- I'm not a gaming guy. I'm not anti-gaming. Some of my best friends are gamers. But it's never-- it's never found me. Interesting about this, too-- I remember we talked to Michael Pachter of Wedbush recently.JULIE HYMAN: Yes.JOSH LIPTON: And we were saying, with the Microsoft-- Microsoft Activision deal in the news so much, we did ask him, do you think like Electronic Arts or Take-Two could be next? And he said, with all the regulatory challenges, and headaches, and drama-- no chance.JULIE HYMAN: Interesting.JOSH LIPTON: Not on the target-- he doesn't think so.JULIE HYMAN: Well, I guess the folks over at Bank of America think so. They think that guidance will, quote, ""dispel investor skepticism over the sports franchises ability to grow next year."" So it looks like investors today, at least, are buying that thesis and buying the stock, which is up by nearly 3%.JOSH LIPTON: Electronic Arts has a new friend in Bank of America. Nice to see.]"

The Sussexes signed up to a multi-year deal to produce shows for Netflix in 2020, reportedly worth tens of millions of dollars.The popularity of programmes including Harry &amp; Meghan helped Netflix push through price rises without a drop-off in subscriber numbers.Netflix reported an increase in revenues per paying member of 14pc in the UK last year on the back of the price rises. It raised the price of its “basic” streaming tier in the UK by £1 to £6.99 last year and its premium plan by £2 to £15.99.Netflix has since scrapped its “basic” offer for new subscribers and replaced it with an advertising-supported service, which costs £4.99 per month. Its cheapest subscription without advertising is now £10.99 per month, as of August.Despite the price rises, the number of paying UK subscribers grew by 4pc across 2022. Its UK division reported an operating profit of £31.6m, up from £28.6m in 2021.The strong performance in Britain contrasts with struggles elsewhere. Last year, Netflix’s global business faced its first quarterly drop in subscriber numbers for more than a decade.Netflix does not disclose the exact number of UK subscribers it has, although figures from BARB suggest just over 17 million British households have access to a Netflix account.Story continuesAside from Harry &amp; Meghan, one of Netflix’s most popular UK releases last year was the return of The Crown according to data from FlixPatrol. The Crown’s latest season centred on the bitter divorce of Diana, Princess of Wales, and Prince Charles.Netflix revealed the size of its UK business for the first time last year. It had previously been wrapped into its wider European business, with separate British numbers not broken out.The new figures do not include the company’s separate British studios division. The UK is home to Netflix production centres at Shepperton and Longcross in Surrey, while shows such as Sex Education are filmed in Wales and a large part of The Crown is filmed in Scotland.A Netflix spokesman said: “The UK is our most important production hub outside North America and we are deeply committed to making Netflix series and films here. “Since 2020 we have invested almost $6bn in making shows like Heartstopper, The Crown, and Top Boy. This is an increase of nearly 50pc on what we originally anticipated and has created thousands of jobs right across the country.”The US giant is investing in British productions as it faces increasing competition from local broadcasters, as well as US rivals such as Disney, Paramount and Apple.ITV recently relaunched its streaming services as ITVX, which included a paid-for tier. The broadcaster reported digital subscriber revenues of £54m last year.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

With consumers becoming increasingly value-conscious, discount retailers are well-positioned to cater to this demand. The industry's resilience, especially during economic uncertainties, is bolstered by the sector's ability to offer cost-effective products.Moreover, the integration of advanced technologies like data analytics and artificial intelligence allows retailers to optimize their operations, personalize customer experiences and enhance overall efficiency, ensuring a competitive edge in the market. Additionally, retailers such as Costco Wholesale Corporation COST, The TJX Companies, Inc. TJX, Target Corporation TGT and Ross Stores, Inc. ROST have been deepening engagements with consumers and adding more compelling products.About the IndustryThe Retail - Discount Stores industry is a significant segment within the retail sector that caters to price-conscious consumers seeking value-for-money products. These stores specialize in offering a wide range of merchandise, including groceries, household items, apparel, electronics, cleaning products, pet supplies and more, at discounted prices compared to traditional retail outlets. Discount stores operate on a low-cost business model, focusing on cost-efficient operations, bulk purchasing, and streamlined supply chains to offer competitive pricing. These stores often carry both national and private-label brands, providing a mix of products to cater to a diverse customer base. The Retail - Discount Stores industry has shown resilience even during economic downturns, as consumers tend to prioritize value-oriented shopping.4 Key Industry Trends to WatchConsumers’ Willingness to Spend: The performance of the industry is closely tied to consumers’ purchasing power. Consumer spending, a key catalyst for the economy, has shown resilience despite a tough economic environment. August marked the fifth consecutive month of gains in retail sales. Retail sales in August rose 0.6% sequentially and 2.5% year over year. The backdrop of healthy employment and wage gains has so far bolstered consumer spending. With the holiday season approaching, retailers are all gearing up to walk the extra mile to capitalize on any potential upswing in demand. According to Mastercard SpendingPulse, U.S. retail sales, excluding automotive, are anticipated to increase 3.7% from a year earlier during the traditional holiday period from Nov 1 to Dec 24.Story continuesConsumers Seek Better Bargains: The strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped industry players draw customers in low-to-middle-income groups who have been seeking both value and convenience, particularly in the face of rising prices. Industry participants have been focusing on creating innovative and compelling products and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities to attract price-sensitive consumers.Digitization Is the Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns, industry participants have been evolving to play dual in-store and online roles. Initiatives, such as building omnichannel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing the supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at the store, are worth mentioning. Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, retailers have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Pressure on Margins to Linger: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. Further, the increasing dominance of e-commerce players has made the retail discount space highly competitive. This has compelled many players to strengthen their digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs. Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation. Nonetheless, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks and adopting effective pricing policies.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector.

RGLD announced that the Penasquito mine’s operator, Newmont Corporation NEM, has signed a preliminary agreement with the National Union of Mine, Metal and Allied Workers of the Mexican Republic. This is likely to bring an end to the strike called by the Union.On Oct 5, 2023, the Union's General Assembly approved the preliminary agreement. The deal is expected to be turned into a definitive agreement, wherein the parties must agree, approve, sign and file for final approval with the Federal Labor Tribunal for Collective Affairs in Mexico City. Its completion will allow Newmont to begin executing the return to work plan, permitting a safe restart of operations at the mine.On Jun 7, 2023, NEM received a strike notice demanding the profit-sharing bonus granted in the Collective Bargaining Agreement to be increased from 10% to 20%.

The company now expects revenues in 2023 to be around $93 billion. The new forecast is not only below the previous outlook of $97 billion but also much lower than 2022's actual figure.Management cited costs associated with the labor deal, inked with 330,000 unionized workers, and declining package volumes induced by the labor negotiations as reasons for lowering the outlook. The five-year deal with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters for better pay and working conditions is worth less than $30 billion. It is likely to keep labor cost at high levels.However, UPS is looking to drive growth in this uncertain scenario by improving efficiencies. Efforts to reward its shareholders also bode well for UPS.

The solid U.S. defense budgetary provisions should boost its business. Lockheed boasts strength in the international defense market.Yet, America and Turkey's tiff as a result of the latter accepting Russian products may hurt its component supply from Turkey.

125,fb56ae73-9192-309a-a026-a42cd50c222f,GD,2023-10-11,Lockheed (LMT) Wins Deal to Support Unmanned Undersea Vehicle,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lockheed-lmt-wins-deal-support-135900789.html,1696946340,STORY,"['LMT', 'GD', 'LDOS', 'BA']","[Lockheed Martin Corp.’s LMT business segment, Rotary and Mission Systems, recently clinched a modification contract to provide engineering support for Extra Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (UUV). The award has been offered by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.Valued at $11 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2024. Work related to this deal will be performed in Riviera Beach, FL.What’s Supporting Lockheed?The company has more than four decades of experience in developing unmanned and robotic systems for sea.Notably, LMT’s Marlin autonomous underwater vehicle system offers a range of civilian and military customers and a quick and safe way to conduct subsea surveys and inspections. The 10-feet-long submersible is highly maneuverable and can operate in tight spaces, sprint up to four knots and cruise for up to 18 hours. Marlin can perform up to four times faster inspections, delivering higher fidelity information in hours versus days.Moreover, in 2017, Lockheed was been selected to support the growth of the U.S. Navy’s family of unmanned undersea systems, under a design phase contract valued at $43.2 million for Orca, the U.S. Navy’s Extra Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (XLUUV).The proven expertise of LMT in the UUV space is likely to have led to a steady inflow of contracts for the company, like the latest one. This, in turn, should bolster its revenue generation prospects from the UUV product line.Growth ProspectusThe recent tiff between Ukraine and Russia has led other nations to strengthen their defense landscape to deter any war-like situation. In this context, it is imperative to mention that UUVs are noted for their ability to carry out dangerous maritime operations, such as mine countermeasure missions and harbor patrol. Therefore, as investments in undersea warfare capabilities have increased manifold in recent times, so has the demand for state-of-the-art UUVs.Looking ahead, with technological advancement, nations are more rapidly adopting artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to increase the autonomy of UUVs. As a result, hefty investments in the development and acquisition of autonomous marine systems can be expected in coming days, thereby boosting the UUV market. To this end, the Fortune Business Insights firm projects the global unmanned underwater vehicles market to witness a CAGR of 13.5% during 2023-2030.Story continuesSuch growth trends should boost Lockheed along with other defense primes like Boeing BA, General Dynamics GD and Leidos Holdings LDOS that have a strong presence in the unmanned underwater vehicle market.Boeing’s Echo Voyager is a fully autonomous XLUUV class UUV that can be used for a variety of missions, which were previously impossible due to traditional UUV limitations.Boeing’s long-term earnings growth rate is 4%. BA’s shares appreciated 42.9% in the past year.General Dynamics’ Bluefin SandShark is a one-person-portable, low-cost autonomous unmanned underwater vehicle designed to leverage today’s miniaturized sensors and emerge as the development platform for the next generation.General Dynamics boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.2%. GD’s shares rallied 5.8% in the past year.Leidos is a leading provider of maritime autonomy and sensor integration, with an extensive experience in naval architecture, hydrodynamics, survivability and modularity that assists the company in designing and developing the future generation of unmanned autonomous vessels. Its unmanned autonomous vessels are being designed to support numerous alternate naval missions, in addition to the as-designed anti-submarine warfare mission.Leidos’ long-term earnings growth rate is 7.9%. LDOS’ shares rose 2.7% in the past year.Price MovementShares of LMT rallied 6.2% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 1.7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankLockheed currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Per the terms of the deal, General Dynamics will provide support for the detailed design, prototyping and qualification of Virginia Class submarine’s capabilities.Work related to this contract will be executed in Groton, CT.Significance of Virginia-Class SubmarinesThe Virginia-class submarine is one of the most advanced nuclear-powered multisession stealth submarines suitable for marine warfare. It excels in littoral and open-ocean environments and collects intelligence critical to the full spectrum of warfare. The submarine is also capable of extended submerged operations with superior stealth, endurance, mobility and firepower.Such enhanced features have made the Virginia-class submarine a top choice for the U.S. Navy. These have also resulted in a steady order inflow for GD from the Pentagon, like the latest one. The submarine’s strong demand can be gauged by General Dynamics’ current backlog strength.The company is currently working on Blocks IV and V in the program, with 17 Virginia-class submarines in its backlog scheduled for delivery through 2032. The U.S. Navy procures these submarines in multi-boat blocks at a two-per-year rate.Such strong demand, along with an excellence in providing unique capabilities in submarines, should continue to boost GD’s order book in the long run, thereby enhancing its revenue generation prospects.Growth Prospects &amp; Peer MovesEfficient submarines, equipped with nuclear weapons, add to military capabilities and deter any potential nuclear attack in sea warfare missions. The advancement in submarine technology and its difficult-to-detect feature further add to its diverse advantages. These have invariably sparked increased spending by nations on military submarines to maintain an edge in undersea warfare.Story continuesLooking ahead, per a report from the Mordor Intelligence firm, the submarine market is projected to witness a CAGR of 4% during the 2023-2028 period. This trend should bolster General Dynamics’ Electric Boat segment’s growth as this unit is the prime contractor and lead shipyard on all U.S. Navy nuclear-powered submarine programs.Other defense majors poised to benefit from the expanding submarine market are BAE Systems BAESY, Northrop Grumman NOC and Huntington Ingalls Industries HII.BAE Systems’ Astute class submarines, the U.K.’s largest and most powerful attack submarines, can strike targets up to 621 miles from the coast with pinpoint accuracy.BAE Systems boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 14%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of BAESY’s 2023 sales calls for an increase of 33.6% from the prior-year reported figure.Northrop Grumman designs, develops and produces communication systems, sensors, signal processing and electronic warfare systems to counter the increasingly sophisticated sea-based threats. It also provides launch systems for submarines. NOC’s eject launch technology has powered more than 7,000 successful launches.The company’s long-term earnings growth rate is 3.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of NOC’s 2023 sales implies growth of 5.8% from the prior-year reported figure.Huntington Ingalls is a co-developer of the Virginia-class fast-attack nuclear submarines, along with Electric Boat. Its Newport News division participates in the design and construction of the Columbia-class (SSBN 826) submarine as a replacement for the current aging Ohio-class nuclear ballistic missile submarines.HII’s long-term earnings growth rate is 6.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of HII’s 2023 sales implies a year-over-year improvement of 3.5%.Price PerformanceShares of General Dynamics have risen 4.8% in the past year against the industry’s 1.7% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankGeneral Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The move was backed by solid volume with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This compares to the stock's 1% gain over the past four weeks.The recent attack made by Palestine’s Hamas group on Israel and the following retaliatory strike from the Israeli military in Gaza has once again created a war zone the Middle East. Such conflicts tend to boost investors’ confidence in weapons manufacturers, which in turn must have resulted in the latest uptick in GD’s share price.This defense contractor is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.87 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -12%. Revenues are expected to be $9.91 billion, down 0.7% from the year-ago quarter.While earnings and revenue growth expectations are important in evaluating the potential strength in a stock, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For General Dynamics, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.2% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. And a positive trend in earnings estimate revision usually translates into price appreciation.

The attack was a surprise for two reasons. First, though the two sides have gone back and forth with small attacks for years and volatility in the Middle East is nothing new, the scale, coordination, and number of attackers are unprecedented in modern times. Second, Israel, which is known for having one of the best defense systems in the world, was unable to detect or deter the surprise attack.Investing Profitability &amp; Emotion Mix Like Oil and WaterIt suffices to say that the majority of the world hopes for peace and a resolution, with thousands of causalities it is tough for anyone not to feel emotional and sad. However, from a strictly investing perspective, investors must find a way to separate emotions from themselves because emotions like fear and greed can cloud judgment and lead to impulsive and irrational decisions. Below are 3 things investors should know about markets and war:Markets Tend to Shrug Off Geopolitical EventsInvestors must defer to historical data to avoid making decisions based on emotions. While history doesn't always repeat itself, it does tend to rhyme. Each geopolitical event is new and unique; however, history tells us that US equities usually encounter short-term weakness, but tend to absorb and shake off these events in the long-term.Observe the Price Action vs. the NewsIf equity markets were easy, more investors would be profitable. Instead, Wall Street marches to the beat of its own drum and is forward-looking. For example, in late 2022, when inflation numbers hit their highest level in more than 40 years, markets reversed and finished higher on volume – marking the bear market low. Rather than taking news at face value, observe how equities react in the face of bad news.Story continuesPanic Rarely Pays Off Investors should always be vigilant and manage risk. That said, panic rarely pays off. Rather than blowing out positions in fear, more times than not, investors are best served to see how their positions absorb lousy news in the coming days. Remain vigilant, but never panic.3 Industries to WatchEnergy Obviously, energy is the biggest beneficiary of war in the Middle East. Even before war broke out, oil prices were enjoying multi-week rallies. To ""add fuel to the fire,"" the US Strategic Petroleum is at 40-year lows, and supply is waning for both commodities. Investors should also watch individual names such as Occidental Petroleum.Counter-terrorism Palantir is another beneficiary of unrest in the Middle East. The unique company specializes in software, security, and artificial intelligence solutions. Governments worldwide, including defense and intelligence agencies, use Palantir's software platforms to enhance their security and defense capabilities in several ways.Traditional Defense ContractorsDespite the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, defense contractors such as General Dynamics, Boeing and Lockheed Martin have been falling. However, now the defense juggernauts are enjoying a new catalyst and more reasonable valuations – a bullish combination.ConclusionThe recent large-scale attack by a Palestinian militant group on Israel is causing market volatility. Amidst the emotional impact of such events, investors are reminded to separate their emotions from investment decisions. Historical data suggests that while markets may experience short-term weakness during geopolitical events, they often recover in the long-term.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

And one veteran strategist thinks that even if the war spilled over into the broader region, with Iran being drawn into the conflict, oil prices would still be capped at $100 a barrel.That strategist is Ed Morse, global head of commodity strategy at Citi. He spoke to Yahoo Finance Live yesterday.“The good news for the market is that with the cuts that have been taken, we have a good 4.5 to 5 million barrels a day of capacity in the world,” he said. “Should prices get significantly higher, and by that I mean above $100, I think we can expect that the spare capacity that has been held back particularly by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Kuwait will find a place in the market.”Morse said that absent an escalation in the war, oil’s ceiling is still $100 a barrel — in part because of slower or no growth in regions from Europe to China to the US.Another longtime energy analyst, Pavel Molchanov, thinks it’s extremely unlikely that Iran will be drawn into a war with Israel.“It would be their biggest mistake in four decades, and I do not think the Iranian regime is suicidal,” Molchanov told Yahoo Finance Live. “So the odds that this war will have a physical effect on oil supply from the Middle East is very low.”Molchanov does see oil at $100 a barrel within six months.That may end up being a headache for drivers, and for the Federal Reserve if it feeds through in a sustained way into increased prices of other goods and services. But for now, the threat of a further price spike from the Mideast conflict doesn’t seem imminent.Story continuesmorning brief imageClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

That’s the biggest spread in dollar terms since the $60-a-barrel limit came into force after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in the first quarter of 2022.Oil rallied in the third quarter as OPEC+ leaders Russia and Saudi Arabia choked off some supply to tighten the market. That rally lifted benchmark prices even further above the price set by the cap — which is designed by the Group of Seven to meet the twin needs of seeking to limit the Kremlin’s crude-based income, while at the same time keeping Russian flows on the global market.The cap is constructed to bar access to critical western financing and insurance services for crude cargoes if shipments are valued above $60. Beyond that level, they are permitted, as long as buyers and sellers make alternative arrangements. India, a vast oil buyer, has been adept at doing so.US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently warned that the US is preparing to crack down on evasion of the G-7 cap on Russian oil, as recent market prices signal the mechanism may no longer be working as hoped. The US is looking at enforcement very carefully, Yellen told the Wall Street Journal.Story continuesOne of the architects of the plan, meanwhile, has proposed steps to fix the program. Ben Harris, a former senior official at the US Treasury who helped design the cap, said the G-7 and European Union need to both raise the price level, and crack down on Russia’s evasion.Since Indian refiners buy crude on a delivered basis, the responsibility of attesting it was bought below the cap falls on suppliers, according to Vandana Hari, founder of Vanda Insights.

(NYSE:ZTS) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Zoetis Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.45bUS$2.68bUS$3.11bUS$3.41bUS$3.63bUS$3.82bUS$3.98bUS$4.12bUS$4.26bUS$4.38bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x6Analyst x4Analyst x4Est @ 6.49%Est @ 5.19%Est @ 4.28%Est @ 3.64%Est @ 3.19%Est @ 2.88% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.2% US$2.3kUS$2.4kUS$2.6kUS$2.7kUS$2.7kUS$2.7kUS$2.6kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$25bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.4b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.2%– 2.2%) = US$112bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$112b÷ ( 1 + 6.2%)10= US$62bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$87b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$176, the company appears about fair value at a 7.0% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Zoetis as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for ZoetisStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Pharmaceuticals industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Pharmaceuticals market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, Jazz Pharmaceuticals has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Zoetis has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that JAZZ's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.JAZZ currently has a forward P/E ratio of 6.92, while ZTS has a forward P/E of 32.23. We also note that JAZZ has a PEG ratio of 0.77. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. ZTS currently has a PEG ratio of 2.81.Another notable valuation metric for JAZZ is its P/B ratio of 2.34. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ZTS has a P/B of 17.46.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help JAZZ earn a Value grade of A, while ZTS has been given a Value grade of D.JAZZ has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than ZTS, so it seems like value investors will conclude that JAZZ is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

144,f31724e2-ea2d-3a4e-9108-f08f26b8a245,PDCO,2023-10-11,7 Top Healthcare Stocks That Pay Dividends,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-top-healthcare-stocks-pay-000841744.html,1696464521,STORY,"['ABBV', 'UNH', 'JNJ', 'CAH', 'CVS', 'MDT', 'PDCO']","[Facing an uncertain market environment, investors ought to consider the top healthcare stocks that pay dividends. Sure, the Federal Reserve may be in a position to facilitate a soft landing for the economy, per bullish analysts. Genuinely, I hope that’s the case. But you can wish on one hand and, well, you know the rest.Primarily, the core benefit of top healthcare stocks that pay dividends centers on the “permanent” relevance of the underlying sector. To be clear, all sectors suffer the vulnerability of obsolescence sometime down the road. However, unless you anticipate a future where all diseases are eradicated, there’s a good chance healthcare will stick around.Second, top healthcare stocks that pay dividends naturally deliver passive income. Yes, the income itself can help bolster one’s portfolio, no doubt about it. But just the very fact that companies pay such dividends typically underscore consistent, predictable business models. With ambiguity being the rising theme of the moment, these are the top healthcare stocks that pay dividends.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsUnitedHealth (UNH)The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comA multinational managed healthcare and insurance provider, UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) is one of the most commonly cited top healthcare stocks that pay dividends. Undeniably, the company plays a significant role in the U.S. healthcare system thanks to its extensive range of services and vast customer base. As a result, it levers much influence on industry trends, costs, and service delivery.Financially, the company might not be particularly remarkable. For example, UNH trades at a forward earnings multiple of 18.24, which is extremely high. At the same time, in exchange for that lofty premium, you get a consistently profitable enterprise. In addition, UnitedHealth’s return on equity (ROE) pops at 27.14%, beating out 84.21% of its rivals.Regarding passive income, UNH carries a forward yield of 1.48%, which admittedly isn’t that generous. Nevertheless, its payout ratio sits at just under 27%. This provides confidence in yield sustainability. Finally, analysts peg UNH a strong buy with a $572.83 price target, implying over 12% upside potential.Story continuesCardinal Health (CAH)Cardinal Health (CAH) sign with bushes in front of itSource: ShutterstockAnother multinational healthcare services firm, Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) ranks among the top healthcare stocks that pay dividends based on revenue generation. Based in Dublin, Ohio, Cardinal specializes in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical products. Per its public profile, the company serves more than 100,000 locations. Since the beginning of this year, CAH gained a bit over 13% of its equity value.As with some of its rivals, Cardinal doesn’t exactly offer the most sterling financials ever. Notably, CAH trades at a forward earnings multiple of 12.98X. That’s a bit lower than the sector median of 13.97x but not by a whole lot. Still, the main positive here may be its top-line expansion. Its three-year revenue growth rate clocks in at 14.5%, above 78.57% of its peers.As for passive income, Cardinal Health posts a forward yield of 2.31%. Primarily, the takeaway here is that the company commands a history of 38 years of consecutive dividend increases. Lastly, analysts rate CAH a moderate buy with a $98.89 target, implying nearly 14% growth.AbbVie (ABBV)Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USASource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comA pharmaceutical giant, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) commands a diverse lineup of products for diseases. Among its most well-known therapeutics is Humira. However, the company has also made several strategic acquisitions to bolster its product portfolio. In particular, I’m fascinated with the Allergan buyout, which gives AbbVie control over Botox. Given society’s ultra-focused value on youth, Botox could be a huge moneymaker.Financially, ABBV symbolizes one of the top healthcare stocks that pay dividends because of its attractive valuation. Since the start of the year, ABBV dipped more than 9%. I think that’s a mistake, but whatever. The red ink now allows contrarian investors to pick up ABBV at only 13.41x forward earnings. Enticingly, this makes AbbVie rank favorably lower than 60.16% of its peers.Regarding passive income, AbbVie also sports a forward yield of 4.02%. That’s well above the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%. Also, the payout ratio is reasonable at 53.31%. To close, analysts peg ABBV as a moderate buy with a $169.50 target, implying 15% upside.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)Negative Press Presents a Buying Opportunity with JNJ StockSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comOne of the top healthcare stocks that pay dividends – or by any other measure – Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) needs no introduction. Recently, the company spun off its consumer healthcare products unit, allowing it to concentrate on its pharmaceutical and medical technology businesses. However, investors so far aren’t all that impressed with JNJ. Since the January opener, shares slipped almost 13%.Is the red ink a mistake? On the financials, the move downward contributed to JNJ being closer to a solid deal. For example, shares now trade at a forward earnings multiple of 14.25x. In contrast, the drug manufacturing industry sports a forward price-earnings ratio of 15.13x. However, for the long haul, I’m focused on strong margins and consistent profitability.Such robust stats play strongly into J&amp;J’s forward yield, which comes in at 3.06%. That’s a solid rate of passive income compared to the industry. Also, the company has enjoyed 62 years of consecutive dividend increases. Turning to Wall Street, analysts rate JNJ a moderate buy with a $178.64 target, implying 15% upside.Patterson Companies (PDCO)An image of a phone displaying the Patterson Companies, Inc. (PDCO) logoSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comA medical supplies conglomerate, Patterson Companies (NASDAQ:PDCO) primarily concentrates on the veterinary and dental products segments. Both specialties arguably make PDCO one of the top healthcare stocks that pay dividends. For example, the American Pet Products Association continues to release industry data that shows veterinary demand rising. As well, proper dental care is essential to overall wellbeing.Since the beginning of the year, PDCO gained just over 7%, which is a modest figure. As a result, an argument can be made that it’s undervalued. Right now, shares trade at a forward multiple of 11.94x. In contrast, the underlying medical distribution industry sports a forward PE ratio of 13.97X. This stat ranks favorably lower than 70.59% of the competition.Heading over to passive income, Patterson carries a forward yield of 3.49%. Notably, that’s also quite higher than the 1.58% average of the broader healthcare space. As well, the payout ratio sits comfortably at 38.76%. Looking to the Street, analysts rate PDCO a moderate buy with a $36.60 target, implying almost 23% growth.Medtronic (MDT)Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocksSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comHeading over to the riskiest ideas of top healthcare stocks that pay dividends, Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) is a medical device company. Earlier this year, the company suffered serious questions about its growth projections. More recently, MDT managed to swing higher – before slipping conspicuously – based on strong fiscal first-quarter results and boosted guidance. In the trailing month, however, MDT is down almost 5%.Naturally, prospective investors will want to carefully consider exposure to Medtronic. Over the past three years, its operational stats haven’t been exactly lighting up the board. That said, for contrarians, MDT now trades at a forward multiple of 15.04x. Enticingly, this stat comes in lower than 72.32% of its peers in the medical devices and instruments sector.Turning to passive income, Medtronic sports a forward yield of 3.61%. Notably, the company commands 47 years of consecutive dividend increases. As well, the payout ratio sits at 50.39%. Lastly, analysts peg MDT as a moderate buy with a $94 target, implying nearly 23% upside.CVS Health (CVS)The front sign for a CVS Pharmacy, CVS stockSource: Susan Montgomery / Shutterstock.comOne of the most recognizable names among top healthcare stocks that pay dividends, CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) owns CVS Pharmacy, a popular retail pharmacy chain. As well, it owns a pharmacy benefits manager (Caremark) and Aetna, a health insurance provider. Still, significant competitive pressures have pressured CVS stock, with investors wondering about its viability.Since the start of the year, shares lost more than 25% of equity value so the concerns are legitimate. Obviously, you want to think carefully about heavy exposure to this risky idea. Nevertheless, for contrarians, it’s worth pointing out that CVS now trades at a forward earnings multiple of 8.1X. This stat ranks lower than 77.78% of its peers in the healthcare plans industry.Looking at passive income, CVS commands a forward yield of 3.49%, which on the surface is quite attractive. Also, the payout ratio sits at 28.16%, providing some confidence for yield sustainability. On a final note, analysts peg CVS as a strong buy with a $91.53 target, implying over 32% upside.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

145,46d59507-ff22-32c4-b411-a7ff467cb2a6,BK,2023-10-11,Earnings Preview: The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-bank-york-mellon-140013173.html,1696946413,STORY,['BK'],"[The market expects The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 17, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.15 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -5%.Revenues are expected to be $4.31 billion, up 0.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.41% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation?For The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.41%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation would post earnings of $1.22 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.38, delivering a surprise of +13.11%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM), is soon expected to post earnings of $3.86 per share for the quarter ended September 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +23.7%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $39.11 billion, up 19.6% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. has been revised 0.8% up to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 1.18%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), this Earnings ESP indicates that JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

148,6d82175c-b689-38b4-8b3e-9b04f737dcd2,MA,2023-10-11,16 Best Growth Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/16-best-growth-stocks-buy-101804908.html,1697019484,STORY,"['AMD', 'DIS', 'ADBE', 'NOW', 'CRM', 'AAPL', 'TMO', 'LLY', 'NFLX', 'V', 'MA']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 16 best growth stocks to buy according to hedge funds. To skip our detailed analysis of the US markets today, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Growth Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.Is Now The Right Time To Invest?Equity investors in American stocks today might be wondering when the right time to invest in US stocks will come around. With market volatility and economic conditions across the world making most investors and businesses cautious about major decisions involving larger sums of money, this line of thinking is becoming more commonplace than some might have expected. At this moment, one thing investors can do to ensure they make sound investment decisions is to remain apprised of not only current events in the US markets but also of expert opinions on how to approach the market at present.On October 10, Paul Tudor Jones, the founder and Chief Investment Officer of Tudor Investment, joined CNBC's 'Squawk Box' to give his take on current market trends and more. Here are some of his comments:""The United States is probably in its weakest fiscal position since, certainly, World War II, with debt-to-GDP at a 122%. So, it's a really tough time for, I think, the moral voice of the world.""Geopolitical Tensions As A Barrier To InvestmentJones sees the current geopolitical environment of the world as ""the most threatening"" and ""challenging"" environment he has ever seen, with the recent developments in the Israel-Palestine crisis and the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian crisis. Here's what he had to say on these issues, alongside how they and US economic conditions are impacting equity investors in the US:""It's a really challenging time to wanna be an equity investor in US stocks right now, it's really hard, because again you've got the geopolitical uncertainty, which we, I think, have come to live with to a certain extent. Equally as much of a problem is the fiscal situation that we're facing in the United States, which is gonna require a completely different political mentality.""Story continuesAll in all, Jones highlighted the existing barriers and challenges that may hinder equity investors in the US markets from taking part in the investment cycles. However, investors can still remain active in the markets by carefully picking out reliable stocks with high growth potential, especially those stocks that have lived up to their growth potential in the past. These include several companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), among others that are considered to be stellar growth stock options today. Considering this, we have compiled a list of some of the best growth stocks for the next 10 years, alongside stocks to invest in 2023 for beginners.16 Best Growth Stocks To Buy According To Hedge FundsSource: pexelsOur MethodologyTo select the stocks for our list, we picked names from the Vanguard Growth Index Fund Admiral Shares ETF. The fund invests in large US growth stocks. We selected the stocks based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them according to Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the second quarter.

Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a pharmaceutical company based in Indianapolis, Indiana. It offers human pharmaceutical products for diabetes, non-small cell lung cancer, and a variety of other medical issues.On October 9, Louise Chen at Cantor Fitzgerald reiterated an Overweight rating on Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) shares alongside a $630 price target.There were 87 hedge funds long Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) in the second quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $5.1 billion.Like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is a growth stock many hedge funds are piling into today.15. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92Citadel Investment Group was the most prominent shareholder in The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) at the end of the second quarter, holding 9.4 million shares in the company.The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a communication services company based in Burbank, California. The company operates through two segments, Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution and Disney Parks, Experiences, and Products.David Joyce at Seaport Global initiated coverage on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shares on October 6 with a Buy rating and a $93 price target.The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) was spotted in the portfolios of 92 hedge funds in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $2.2 billion.14. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 93We saw 93 hedge funds long ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in the second quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $3.9 billion.ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a systems software company that provides enterprise cloud computing solutions. It is based in Santa Clara, California.A Buy rating and a $640 price target were reiterated on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) shares on October 3 by Brad Reback at Stifel.Lakehouse Capital mentioned ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its July 2023 investor letter:“US-based software company ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) delivered another impressive quarterly result that came in ahead of analysts expectations. Subscription revenues grew 25% year-on-year in constant currency terms to $2.1 billion and operating margins came in at 23.4%. Despite ongoing variability in the macro backdrop, ServiceNow continues to benefit from spend prioritisation within the IT tech stack as vendors look to consolidate back-office apps onto an integrated platform. The company’s operational metrics held firm, with remaining performance obligations growing 24% year-on-year to $14.2 billion and renewal rates ticking up to 99%. As we have mentioned before, the company’s renewal rates are noteworthy as not only are they best-in-class but they are also remarkably consistent, typically in the range of 97% to 99%. They speak to the mission critical nature of the platform and are a key driver of long term annuity value.Investors were also excited to hear management speak to the burgeoning artificial intelligence (AI) opportunity. Things are moving fast and the company plans to release new premium offerings of their workflow products – across IT, customer service and human resources – towards the back end of 2023 that will have new Generative AI capabilities embedded into them. Management also mentioned that they anticipate these new offerings could deliver a “minimum” 60%-plus list price uplift relative to its current Pro versions as they provide meaningful productivity improvements for end users. Whilst it’s still early days, ServiceNow appears well placed to capitalise on the Generative-AI opportunity and we believe it could be a meaningful driver for the company’s next phase of growth.”13. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 103Patrick Donnelly at Citigroup reiterated a Buy rating and a $625 price target on shares of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) on October 2.Based in Waltham, California, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is a life sciences tools and services company. It offers analytical instruments, specialty diagnostics, laboratory products, and biopharma services in the US and internationally.Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) had 103 hedge funds long its stock in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $7.2 billion.Weitz Investment Management said the following about Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Portfolio activity this quarter included opportunistically initiating a position in life sciences tool and equipment maker Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), a long-time holding of other Weitz portfolios, at an attractive valuation.”12. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109Citadel Investment Group was the largest shareholder in Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) at the end of the second quarter, holding 1.9 million shares in the company.As of September 15, Deutsche Bank analyst Brad Zelnick holds a Buy rating and a 610 price target on Adobe Inc.

The company operates through its Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising segments.Our hedge fund data for the second quarter shows 109 hedge funds long Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE). Their total stake value was $6.1 billion.Here's what Harding Loevner said about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Although the market initially feared that Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) would lose out to Al image-generating programs Dall-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, the design-software giant has since released its own generative Al model called Firefly. One feature of Firefly is that it can help designers generate ideas and create and manipulate images more quickly in Photoshop or Illustrator that can then be processed by other Adobe products for further development, fostering a seamless workflow. There’s more work involved when trying to manipulate images created by outside tools. Also, because Firefly is trained on Adobe’s vast inventory of stock images and other licensed content, it can generate professional-quality, commercially viable results, further setting it apart from generic models that are often trained on copyrighted content that isn’t properly licensed. These are just two examples of how Al enhances the Adobe suite, which should allow the company to raise subscription prices and upsell users.”11. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor company that offers x86 microprocessors and graphics processing units (GPUs). It is based in Santa Clara, California.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was seen in the 13F holdings of 112 hedge funds in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $6.9 billion.A Buy rating and a $145 price target were maintained on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) shares on August 3 by Cody Acree at Benchmark.This is what Artisan Partners said about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Among our top contributors were Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NU Holdings and Netflix. AMD’s data center CPUs are used in the cloud service provider (CSP) servers. In addition to the broader secular tailwind from cloud adoption, the company has a performance and pricing advantage over Intel, which we believe will enable it to continue capturing market share. However, the recent stock price rally was due to growing excitement around the company’s AI exposure. It will launch its new MI300 graphics processing unit (GPU) chip later this year to compete against the dominant market leader NVIDIA. Similar to its approach that won market share from Intel within the CPU market, AMD’s product will aim to provide similar performance at a more attractive price. AMD is already working with Microsoft and Meta, while Amazon publicly stated that it is evaluating AMD’s inferencing chips. Using assumptions around the total GPU market size, potential market share gains and price points, our research indicates this could be a $20 billion opportunity for AMD. That would nearly double its revenue. While the company has not historically missed many deadlines, there is execution risk as it works to manufacture and distribute these complex chips at scale, which, combined with an elevated valuation after the stock’s strong performance run, led us to trim the position.”10. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 114Seaport Global analyst David Joyce initiated coverage on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares with a Buy rating and a $482 price target on October 6.A total of 114 hedge funds were long Netflix, Inc.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) at the end of the second quarter, holding 5.9 million shares in the company.9. salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 122In total, 122 hedge funds were long salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) in the second quarter. Their total stake value was $7.2 billion.Truist Securities analyst Terry Tillman reiterated a Buy rating and a $275 price target on salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) shares on October 4.Based in San Francisco, California, salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) is an application software company. It provides Customer Relationship Management (CRM) technology.Harding Loevner said the following about salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), a company we’ve owned since 2019, recently added ChatGPT-like capabilities onto its existing Al module, Einstein, to support its internal sales efforts and customer-facing software. For example, Einstein GPT can help generate marketing emails tailored to specific clients by using Salesforce’s customer database and past email correspondence to learn the most effective approach for each client. Einstein GPT is also different from off-the-shelf LLMS in three important ways: It keeps personal identifiable information private and secure, compared with external tools that retain anything a user enters. It employs the latest data in Salesforce’s system, as opposed to the sometimes-stale public data that train generic models. And generative Al capabilities can be integrated with other Salesforce offerings; the company has already introduced Slack GPT and Tableau GPT, Al-equipped versions of its workplace collaboration and analytics tools.”8. Apple Inc.  (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 135Apple Inc.  (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology hardware, storage, and peripherals company based in Cupertino, California.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at QUALCOMM's (NASDAQ:QCOM) look very promising so lets take a look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for QUALCOMM:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.28 = US$11b ÷ (US$49b - US$8.5b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).So, QUALCOMM has an ROCE of 28%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Semiconductor industry average of 12%. View our latest analysis for QUALCOMM roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for QUALCOMM compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering QUALCOMM here  for free.So How Is QUALCOMM's ROCE Trending?QUALCOMM has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 152% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.Story continuesThe Bottom LineIn summary, we're delighted to see that QUALCOMM has been able to increase efficiencies and earn higher rates of return on the same amount of capital. And investors seem to expect more of this going forward, since the stock has rewarded shareholders with a 99% return over the last five years. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.On a separate note, we've found   1 warning sign for QUALCOMM   you'll probably want to know about.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

153,dcc63c8e-8532-3267-9edb-b5daf9b77f82,QCOM,2023-10-11,7 Metaverse Stocks to Move to Your Portfolio Trash Bin NOW,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-metaverse-stocks-move-portfolio-111040478.html,1696504240,STORY,"['META', 'QCOM', 'RBLX', 'VUZI', 'PTC', 'SNAP']","[I know what you’re thinking. It’s far too late to be figuring out which metaverse stocks to sell. The buzz and hype surrounding the metaverse or integrating the real and virtual worlds (via virtual reality/augmented reality technology) peaked quite a while ago.The “metaverse bubble,” which took shape in late 2021, peaked not that long after, and burst in 2022, has long since deflated. That does not mean the dust has settled for stocks with high exposure to this trend.Don’t get me wrong, many of the companies making the biggest bets on metaverse technologies, including Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), are not in this category. For these two “Magnificent Seven” stocks, other factors help to outweigh the disappointment with the metaverse trend.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFor other stocks, however, like these seven metaverse stocks to sell, there is still plenty of downside risk, due to both the metaverse bust, along with other negative factors. Consider steering clear of each of them to be your best move.Matterport (MTTR)Matterport Silicon Valley exterior sign and trademark logo.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comMatterport (NASDAQ:MTTR) was once one of the hottest stocks out there.After going public in 2021, the spatial data company (whose technology can be used to produce “digital twin” digital models of real life spaces) zoomed higher, due to the perceived metaverse tailwinds.Yet after soaring from $10 to prices over $30 per share, MTTR stock has in the nearly two years since fallen down to just over $2 per share. The fading of “metaverse mania,” and the 2022 tech stock sell-off played a big role in this sharp decline. So too has Matterport’s lackluster operating performance.The company continues to report double-digit revenue growth. Reaching profitability, however, remains a challenge. Negative earnings are expected to persist until at least 2025. With shares in fast-growing but unprofitable companies likely to stay out of favor until interest rates come back down, there’s little reason to go contrarian on MTTR today.Story continuesPTC (PTC)The PTC (PTC) website is displayed on an open laptop.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comBack in August, my InvestorPlace colleague Ian Bezek declared PTC (NASDAQ:PTC) one of the metaverse stocks to sell.Primarily, due to the diversified cloud software company’s rich valuation. In Bezek’s view, PTC’s forward earnings multiple of 33 seemed expensive, relative to analyst forecasts for 2023.Flash forward to now, and PTC stock has only moved slightly lower since then. Today, shares sport a forward multiple of 32.2 times this year’s estimated earnings. As sell-side forecasts call for big earnings growth next year and in 2025, one may counter that PTC’s valuation isn’t excessive.But if growth is just around the corner, why did Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK), a strategic partner and large investor in PTC, decide to completely sell its remaining stake in the company this summer?Alongside valuation, this is another red flag calling into question an investment in this stock.Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) sign near Qualcomm Research Silicon Valley office of San Diego based chip and semiconductor companySource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comJust like with PTC, the metaverse is a secondary catalyst for Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).Although the semiconductor company sells chips for metaverse hardware, AI seems to be where Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon sees the greatest level of growth opportunity.Still, while QCOM stock may be of a metaverse stock, and an aspiring top AI stock, in the market’s view it is just a floundering mobile chip stock. Yes, Qualcomm’s chip supply deal with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) unexpectedly extended last month, shares have recently found support.However, as Louis Navellier and the InvestorPlace Research Staff recently warned, QCOM is not yet out of the woods.Recent extension notwithstanding, Qualcomm is still scheduled to lose its largest customer (Apple) within a few years. Add in other issues, like another big customer loss (Huawei), as well as the slump in mobile chip demand, and chances are QCOM will keep floundering.Roblox (RBLX)Roblox Stock IPOSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.comRoblox (NYSE:RBLX) is another company that went public during the 2021 bull market, which spiked in price thanks to the metaverse trend.Shares in this metaverse gaming company have also been one of the stocks most hard hit by the metaverse bust.Since November 2021, RBLX stock has tumbled by nearly 79%, but even at substantially lower prices, it remains one of the top metaverse stocks to sell.After scaling up substantially during the pandemic lockdowns, top-line growth has since decelerated, although it continues to come in at around 15%.If Roblox were making up for this growth slowdown with greater profitability, this wouldn’t be much of an issue. However, the company continues to report losses, even on an EBITDA basis.With high uncertainty surrounding its timeline to (and the level of) future profitability, RBLX’s $17.5 billion valuation seems inflated, and at risk of a further compression.Snap (SNAP)Advertiser Appeal and Innovations Will Continue to Lift Snap StockSource: Christopher Penler / Shutterstock.comSnap (NYSE:SNAP) is first and foremost a social media stock, but this tech company’s involvement in augmented reality technology has made it somewhat of a metaverse play in recent years.That said, the company just shuttered its business-focused AR unit.Snap, like some of the other aforementioned metaverse plays, appears now to be pursuing opportunities in areas like generative AI. Yet while not afraid to make major changes, all bets are off whether the latest turnaround efforts will pay off for SNAP stock investors.Even as shares have already been knocked lower since July, when Snap issued weak guidance for the coming quarters, I wouldn’t assume that positive surprises are inevitable.An “also-ran” in the social media space, competing with larger rivals like Meta Platforms for ad dollars, Snap’s upcoming earnings release later this month (scheduled for Oct. 25) could lead to another sharp sell-off for shares.Unity Software (U)In this photo illustration the Unity Technologies (U) logo seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comUnity Software (NYSE:U) is another of the metaverse stocks to sell, for reasons that have little to do with the metaverse trend itself.As many may already know, Unity (which makes software for video game development) has been the subject of controversy lately.Pricing controversy, that is. The company was blasted by its customers, after a decision to change its pricing structure. Unity has since rolled back some of these changes.Analysts believe that the company’s operating performance still stands to materially improve, but you may not want to make that wager.Why? The valuation of U stock may seem sustainable, with room to grow. At least, based on forecasts calling for earnings growth of around 72% next year, and another 59% in 2025.However, the pricing changes (although backtracked somewhat) could still fail to drive this level of expected growth, leading to more disappointment/declines for U shares.Vuzix (VUZI)Vuzix (VUZI) branded AR glassesSource: zixia / Shutterstock.comNot surprisingly, the metaverse bust has been bad news for Vuzix (NASDAQ:VUZI) shares.Revenue growth has come in more gradually than once expected. Operating losses have ballooned as well. All of this justifies the stock’s drop from over $30 per share, all the way down deep into penny stock territory.However, even at around $3.50 per share today, VUZI stock has questionable upside potential, coupled with high downside risk. I’m far from the only one bearish on VUZI.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS), Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;UPS shares have lagged the broader market as well as rival FedEx (FDX) this year (-11.4% vs. +14.3% for the S&amp;P 500 &amp; +47.7% for FDX). The company now expects revenues in 2023 to be around $93 billion. The new forecast is not only below the previous outlook of $97 billion but also much lower than 2022's actual figure.Management cited costs associated with the labor deal, inked with 330,000 unionized workers, and declining package volumes induced by the labor negotiations as reasons for lowering the outlook. The five-year deal with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters for better pay and working conditions is worth less than $30 billion. It is likely to keep labor cost at high levels.However, UPS is looking to drive growth in this uncertain scenario by improving efficiencies. Efforts to reward its shareholders also bode well for UPS. The company's strong free cash flow generating ability is encouraging and supports its shareholder-friendly activities.(You can read the full research report on United Parcel here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Booking Holdings have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the year-to-date period (+49.3% vs. +33.2%). The company is benefiting from a substantial improvement in booking trends driven by growing demand for travel. This, in, turn, is helping lower cancellation rates.Booking Holdings expects room night growth to increase at a low double-digit rate on a year-on-year basis in the third quarter. Solid growth in domestic bookings is driving growth. The company is experiencing solid momentum in international regions, which is a positive. Strong growth in rental cars, airline ticket units and booked room nights is another positive.Solid momentum across the agency, merchant, advertising and other businesses is a tailwind. Further, strengthening alternative accommodation business and flight capabilities are major positives. However, intensifying competition is a headwind.Lockheed Martin shares have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+9.0% vs. -0.1%). The company keeps on securing big defense contracts from the Pentagon and other U.S. allies, which in turn add up to solid backlog count. Its strong backlog boosts long-term growth.Lockheed remains the largest U.S. defense contractor with a steady order flow from its leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs. The solid U.S. defense budgetary provisions should boost its business. Lockheed boasts strength in the international defense market.Yet, America and Turkey's tiff as a result of the latter accepting Russian products may hurt its component supply from Turkey. It is facing performance issues concerning some of its products, which may hurt its results.

Notable gains include Northrop Grumman (NOC) which has risen by over 8% in five days and Lockheed Martin (LMT) which is up 9% in the same time. Yahoo Finance hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith break down the numbers for defense sector staples.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Major defense stocks added around $20 billion in market cap yesterday, following the events over the last three days. Though Northrop Grumman and Lockheed among those still trending higher, these types of moves are not uncommon during times of war. Now a similar surge happened when Russia invaded Ukraine.And you're looking at some of the movement that we're seeing today. And Lockheed Martin, up just about 1% as well as Boeing RTX and Northrop also once again moving to the upside. Now these gains coming on like we just had a strong day for the stocks. Yesterday we saw a big jump. Northrop coming off its biggest daily gain since we've seen-- that we've seen since 2020. So just about three years there.But the thought process is just in terms of the amount of spending, what's going to be allocated towards some of these defense companies given the conflict and the risk that this war could widen over in the Middle East. That's why we're seeing the reaction play out in shares today.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. And from a technical perspective too. It'd be interesting to look at this for anyone who's trying to figure out if some of the spikes that take place after there are international conflicts or events of international conflict, where some of the defensive names continue to cyclically in this instance here, get some type of attention from investors.Time and time again there has been a little bit of a bottom-- a new bottom that gets set in here, for Lockheed Martin at least as of right now since. And I kind of point back to early 2022, when we were thinking about the initiation of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and what took place there. Shares jumped by about 25% in that instance. It's held on since then to the majority of that move since the beginning of 2022, until after that.And then additionally here, you think about the move higher that we've seen just over the past couple of days here at the beginning of October. Shares up by about 10%, Lockheed Martin, and then we had a few of the other key and core names to track.]"
158,ea25e46e-3985-3277-9e6d-55f30548fdf6,LMT,2023-10-11,Lockheed Martin (LMT) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q3 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lockheed-martin-lmt-expected-beat-140014766.html,1696946414,STORY,['LMT'],"[The market expects Lockheed Martin (LMT) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 17, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis aerospace and defense company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $6.66 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -3.1%.Revenues are expected to be $16.66 billion, up 0.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.01% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Lockheed?For Lockheed, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.15%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Lockheed will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Lockheed would post earnings of $6.43 per share when it actually produced earnings of $6.73, delivering a surprise of +4.67%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Lockheed appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

159,fb56ae73-9192-309a-a026-a42cd50c222f,LMT,2023-10-11,Lockheed (LMT) Wins Deal to Support Unmanned Undersea Vehicle,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lockheed-lmt-wins-deal-support-135900789.html,1696946340,STORY,"['LMT', 'GD', 'LDOS', 'BA']","[Lockheed Martin Corp.’s LMT business segment, Rotary and Mission Systems, recently clinched a modification contract to provide engineering support for Extra Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (UUV). The award has been offered by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.Valued at $11 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2024. Work related to this deal will be performed in Riviera Beach, FL.What’s Supporting Lockheed?The company has more than four decades of experience in developing unmanned and robotic systems for sea.Notably, LMT’s Marlin autonomous underwater vehicle system offers a range of civilian and military customers and a quick and safe way to conduct subsea surveys and inspections. The 10-feet-long submersible is highly maneuverable and can operate in tight spaces, sprint up to four knots and cruise for up to 18 hours. Marlin can perform up to four times faster inspections, delivering higher fidelity information in hours versus days.Moreover, in 2017, Lockheed was been selected to support the growth of the U.S. Navy’s family of unmanned undersea systems, under a design phase contract valued at $43.2 million for Orca, the U.S. Navy’s Extra Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (XLUUV).The proven expertise of LMT in the UUV space is likely to have led to a steady inflow of contracts for the company, like the latest one. This, in turn, should bolster its revenue generation prospects from the UUV product line.Growth ProspectusThe recent tiff between Ukraine and Russia has led other nations to strengthen their defense landscape to deter any war-like situation. In this context, it is imperative to mention that UUVs are noted for their ability to carry out dangerous maritime operations, such as mine countermeasure missions and harbor patrol. Therefore, as investments in undersea warfare capabilities have increased manifold in recent times, so has the demand for state-of-the-art UUVs.Looking ahead, with technological advancement, nations are more rapidly adopting artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to increase the autonomy of UUVs. As a result, hefty investments in the development and acquisition of autonomous marine systems can be expected in coming days, thereby boosting the UUV market. To this end, the Fortune Business Insights firm projects the global unmanned underwater vehicles market to witness a CAGR of 13.5% during 2023-2030.Story continuesSuch growth trends should boost Lockheed along with other defense primes like Boeing BA, General Dynamics GD and Leidos Holdings LDOS that have a strong presence in the unmanned underwater vehicle market.Boeing’s Echo Voyager is a fully autonomous XLUUV class UUV that can be used for a variety of missions, which were previously impossible due to traditional UUV limitations.Boeing’s long-term earnings growth rate is 4%. BA’s shares appreciated 42.9% in the past year.General Dynamics’ Bluefin SandShark is a one-person-portable, low-cost autonomous unmanned underwater vehicle designed to leverage today’s miniaturized sensors and emerge as the development platform for the next generation.General Dynamics boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.2%. GD’s shares rallied 5.8% in the past year.Leidos is a leading provider of maritime autonomy and sensor integration, with an extensive experience in naval architecture, hydrodynamics, survivability and modularity that assists the company in designing and developing the future generation of unmanned autonomous vessels. Its unmanned autonomous vessels are being designed to support numerous alternate naval missions, in addition to the as-designed anti-submarine warfare mission.Leidos’ long-term earnings growth rate is 7.9%. LDOS’ shares rose 2.7% in the past year.Price MovementShares of LMT rallied 6.2% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 1.7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankLockheed currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

We also reviewed Asness’ AQR Capital Management’s assets under management, performance and stock picks. You can skip our detailed discussion of AQR Capital Management and go straight to AQR Capital Management's Top 5 Stock Picks.Following record-breaking returns in 2022, AQR Capital Management's performance in 2023 has been exceptional, with several of its strategies outperforming the broader market indices. The investment philosophy of its founder, billionaire Cliff Asness, has been the driving force behind this success. Asness, who achieved great success for the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund in the 90s, is famous for his great work on developing models and algorithms that can explore market patterns. His investment strategy combines traditional and unconventional techniques while diversifying investments in equity, alternative, and multi-asset funds. As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, AQR's AUM was around $120 billion.Year to date, AQR Long-Short Equity Fund has generated a return of approximately 19%. Meanwhile, AQR Sustainable Long-Short Equity Carbon Aware Fund, AQR Style Premia Alternative Fund, AQR Equity Market Neutral Fund, and AQR Alternative Risk Premia Fund have posted year-to-date returns of 17%, 19%, 17.77%, and 15%, respectively. In addition, AQR Large Cap Multi-Style Fund and AQR Global Equity Fund from the equity segment have posted year-to-date returns of 14% and 13%, respectively. It's worth noting that none of the equity funds have generated negative returns so far in 2023.

Cliff Asness’ books that gained popularity include ""The Allocator's Edge: A Modern Guide to Alternative Investments and the Future of Diversification,"" ""Expected Returns: An Investor's Guide to Harvesting Market Rewards,"" and ""Hedge Fund Management.""Story continuesCliff Asness is frequently featured in television and podcasts, where he shares his insights on financial issues. In a Bloomberg podcast with Barry Ritholtz, Cliff Asness discussed quant value investing, offering a comprehensive overview of how he manages risks and rewards. In another Cliff Asness podcast, he expressed concern about buoyant stocks, warned of trouble in the commercial real estate market and also predicted a potential financial crisis. Here is what the billionaire investor said:""My biggest concern is stocks and bonds seem to be taking a very, very different view. Bonds are pricing in multiple, severe cuts over the next year to two years. That is a forecast for a recession, and not a mild one. Equities are whistling past the graveyard. If inflation stays sticky, or it comes down because we enter a non-trivial recession, it's equities that I think are a scary place. They're not priced very consistently with bonds, and we're going to find out who's right in the next year.""Cliff Asness' firm began with 10 employees in 1998 and has since grown to a team of over 700, with 65% of staff holding advanced degrees.

(NASDAQ:ADBE) would lose out to Al image-generating programs Dall-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, the design-software giant has since released its own generative Al model called Firefly. One feature of Firefly is that it can help designers generate ideas and create and manipulate images more quickly in Photoshop or Illustrator that can then be processed by other Adobe products for further development, fostering a seamless workflow. There’s more work involved when trying to manipulate images created by outside tools. Also, because Firefly is trained on Adobe’s vast inventory of stock images and other licensed content, it can generate professional-quality, commercially viable results, further setting it apart from generic models that are often trained on copyrighted content that isn’t properly licensed. These are just two examples of how Al enhances the Adobe suite, which should allow the company to raise subscription prices and upsell users.”12. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)Value of AQR Capital Management’s 13F Position: $332 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 79Cliff Asness’ investment firm increased its stake in Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

CVS has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by more than 40 percentage points over the past 12 months, impacted by a cloud of company-specific and legislative concerns. While we are not dismissive of these potential risks and headwinds, we believe the market has become overly pessimistic. This created an attractive opportunity to invest in what we view as a durable, competitively advantaged and well-managed enterprise at a high-single-digit multiple of earnings.”10.

All three stocks benefited from a renewed interest in growth stocks by investors in the first half of the year.Amazon had an impressive first half of the year as well with growth out of its retail segment but slightly slower growth in its cloud business. Customers optimized workloads for existing capacity they were already paying for rather than adding incremental capacity in the current environment. We remain very excited about the opportunity for the company to reduce the labor needs of its retail segment through the use of technology and automation in the future.”7. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Value of AQR Capital Management’s 13F Position: $483 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 178NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), like Amazon.com, Inc.

More companies- including, perhaps, some not yet in existence-will certainly join the ranks over time.In the meantime, NVIDIA has emerged as the unrivaled global leader in providing the technologies at the center of the Al arms race. NVIDIA’s competitive advantage is the result of investments that began two decades ago, when it recognized an early opportunity to repurpose its video-game graphics chips for the heavy-load computing done in scientific research. This led management to expand the GPU business. It also spent years and significant resources developing a free software platform that’s exclusive to its chips called CUDA that allows developers to easily program its GPUs for a variety of computationally intensive applications. Researchers then began using both NVIDIA’s chips and CUDA to train the human-brain-inspired neural networks that power Al models.Now, due to an explosion of demand related to generative Al and LLMs from across its customer base, NVIDIA projects that data-center revenue for its fiscal second quarter ending in July will surge to US$11 billion. Not only is that more than double last quarter’s total, but the forecast also shattered the average analyst estimate that called for about US$7 billion. Taking advantage of the stock’s meteoric rise, we reduced our holding (it has risen tenfold since we first purchased in 2018)…” (Click here to read the full text)6. Meta Platforms, Inc.

During the quarter, the company reported earnings that showed a return to growth and healthy user engagement metrics. Most importantly, profitability appears to have stabilized and is poised to improve as significant cost reduction actions implemented over the past six months begin to have an impact. Separate from fundamental performance, there is excitement over AI’s potential to help the company’s business. While Meta’s technology prowess and massively scaled media platform certainly position the company to take advantage of AI, we believe it’s far too early to estimate any discrete tangible benefits.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 17. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis world's biggest maker of health care products is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.52 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -1.2%.Revenues are expected to be $21.61 billion, down 9.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.62% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Johnson &amp; Johnson?For Johnson &amp; Johnson, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.20%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Johnson &amp; Johnson will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Johnson &amp; Johnson would post earnings of $2.61 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.80, delivering a surprise of +7.28%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Johnson &amp; Johnson doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Value stocks are back in the spotlight. Rising debt costs due to interest rate hikes make growth and tech less attractive for nervous investors. At the same time, a running bond bear market makes the once-safe asset allocation a losing proposition for those seeking a solution to stock market volatility.Value stocks are primed to explode in 2024, as companies typically boast superior financial management practices, positioning them to ride out economic unease. Simultaneously, as bond yields increase and even savings accounts return 4% or more, value stocks’ consistent commitment to dividends means investors can capture yield alongside capital gains.However, not all value stocks are created equally. Investors should look to the past when assessing financial management and consider future potential beyond simple belt-tightening. These seven value stocks to buy couple prudent financial management with fantastic prospects for 2024 and beyond.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsValue Stocks to Buy: Medtronic PLC (MDT)Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocksSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comMedical device manufacturer Medtronic PLC (NYSE:MDT) is typically one of the top value stocks to buy on investors’ lists. While the stock traded flat for most of this year, losing about 2% since January, it’s been more stable than the wider market in recent weeks. To that end, though, Medtronic’s 2024 prospects are as exciting as ever, and today’s pricing presents investors with a perfect entry point. MDT’s most recent earnings point to strong growth in the previous quarter. Revenue climbed 6% year-over-year (YOY) while the company accommodated tighter budgets by cutting research and development spending. While Medtronic’s financial management is consistently strong, its future potential lies largely in artificial intelligence (AI) healthcare solutions. Medtronic and Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) early-2023 partnership to develop a range of AI platforming solutions will likely begin bearing fruit in early 2024, rewarding patient investors who held through the stock’s relatively flat range this year. Story continuesMedtronic’s trailing dividend yield is 3.58%, reinforcing its position as an ideal value stock today and into the new year. Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comWarren Buffett’s favorite oil and gas company, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), struggled slightly this year in light of volatile global energy markets. But the company’s position at the fore of carbon reduction and sustainability position it to capture a broad range of new revenue streams in 2024.Last month, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced a new deal with an OXY subsidiary focused on carbon capture. The partnership, which analysts expect could eventually cost Amazon $150 million, leverages OXY’s emerging direct air capture plant to reduce Amazon’s hefty carbon footprint. The plant is one of the first nationally after the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law earmarked $3.5 billion for plant development and will let OXY expand its income streams as more corporate entities seek to offset their carbon footprint. As sustainability demands increase, legacy oil and gas companies must adapt – and OXY is one of the first (and only) in the sector to proactively lean into the trend. OXY’s total trailing yield, including stock buybacks, is a hefty 7.39%. Warren Buffett’s preference for the stock should be a green flag for investors, and its 2024 prospects look bright. Value Stocks to Buy: General Motors (GM)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is a bit of a gamble in light of the ongoing labor strikes, but this car manufacturer tops the list of best value stocks to buy in the sector. Research firm EquitySet pegs the current price at nearly 50% below fair value, driven chiefly by losses caused by uncertainty surrounding the United Auto Workers strike. Still, if the company’s management and labor leaders come to a deal soon, GM could soar in 2024.Despite the strike, the company’s most recent quarter report included a 21% sales jump. This is notable beyond the strike, as today’s tightened economy means household budgets are shrinking. If GM can keep moving cars off the line and into consumers’ hands despite a down economy, its prospects are bright as we move past this rocky period. Most importantly for GM’s 2024 prospects, its electric vehicle (EV) offerings are increasingly popular, and sales for that segment jumped 33% YOY. GM now has six EV vehicles on the market, with more to come, cementing its second-place standing firmly, though it lags Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) by a wide margin.Investors should expect stock buybacks to slow or stop in light of ongoing labor disputes (buybacks are a focal point for detractors pointing to misallocated funds). Still, the stock’s 8.95% total yield is an attractive selling point, even if it falls slightly in the coming months. Banco Santander SA (SAN)A hand holding a pencil pointing to a series of arrows on a stock chart, indicating value stocks.Source: Gsign76 / ShutterstockBanco Santander SA (NYSE:SAN) is less well-known of these value stocks to buy, but its Latin American market means the company has plenty of upside potential in a growing customer base. Furthermore, the company’s commitment to shareholder value drives a new buyback initiative, which will see the company repurchase $1.38 billion of its shares by January 2024. Couple that with a 3.3% trailing dividend yield, and Banco Santander is an ideal cheap value stock at today’s pricing. Investors should note a degree of uncertainty within SAN’s organization today. It could cause short-term distress – but will likely play out beneficially in the long run. The company’s CEO is running an aggressive restructuring initiative. The operational realignment should boost profitability as it cuts down on inefficiency but might cause short-term volatility as the stock shakes things up. The Latin American banking market, SAN’s primary target, has plenty of room to grow despite global economic unease. Banco Santander is an ideal value play for investors interested in geographic diversification to expose their portfolio to global banking. Value Stocks to Buy: Whirlpool (WHR)the Whirlpool (WHR) logo on a corporate buildingSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.comBullish sentiment is bubbling up around Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR), making it another perfect value play for 2024. Institutional investors are also taking notice, as one investment management firm recently snatched up $1.474 million worth of Whirlpool stock. Much of the bullish sentiment comes from a recent earnings beat. Whirlpool reported $4.21 EPS, beating expectations by 45 cents. At the same time, Whirlpool generated a 29.70% return on equity, notable considering the economic challenges facing the firm nationally. The company’s 5.46% trailing dividend yield will excite income investors as bond yields make fixed-income investing a more viable strategy, positioning Whirlpool as a perfect equity alternative to bonds and bond funds for those maximizing yield today.H&amp;R Block (HRB)Image of a yellow building featuring the H&amp;R Block (HRB) logoSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comIt’s almost tax time, meaning H&amp;R Block (NYSE:HRB) is ready to rise to the occasion in 2024. The stock struggled earlier this year as rumors swirled, implying that the Internal Revenue Service would unveil a national, free filing solution. Today, though, HRB bounced back and is positioned to capture the tax return market alongside a slew of other revenue opportunities.To buffer the cyclical effects of tax season on its revenue, HRB unveiled a mobile banking initiative in January. As of April, the mobile banking platform saw 291,000 customers jump on board, collectively depositing more than $280 million. Likewise, the company’s small-business accounting platform grew 10% YOY. Maintaining consistent cash flow has always been a struggle for HRB and similar tax-centric companies. Still, these initiatives pay dividends as more customers leverage the company’s tech year-round. Speaking of dividends, the company boasts a massive 12.27% total yield between buybacks and distributions – that’s a hard stat to beat in today’s market, making HRB a perfect financial play for savvy investors. Nintendo (NTDOY, NTDOF)Value stocks: A hand places wooden cutouts of the letters in the word ""value"" on a surface.Source: patpitchaya / Shutterstock.comNintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY, OTCMKTS:NTDOF) is a perfect blend of growth and value, and recent Nintendo news points to a substantial upside in 2024. Rumors began flying fast last month, as a leaked partnership between Nintendo and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) pointed to new possibilities in virtual reality. The leak, which is still unconfirmed by both parties, says the partnership will create a new virtual reality gaming platform. The gaming platform could leverage Nintendo’s industry dominance and Google’s next-generation micro-LED technology. Soon after, email leaks from an ongoing Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) court case revealed substantial executive interest in a high-level partnership or acquisition of Nintendo. While the emails were from 2020, nothing has yet materialized. Still, the massive corporate interest in Nintendo means the company is well-positioned to leverage its brand and holdings to explode in 2024.Nintendo’s financial management is beyond reproach, which executives at Microsoft mentioned in the leaked emails. Today, the company sits on a ton of cash, meaning it’s positioned to weather economic uncertainty and take advantage of opportunities as they arise. The company’s trailing 3.24% dividend yield also benefits value investors as they wait for potential partnerships to play out. On the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

167,f31724e2-ea2d-3a4e-9108-f08f26b8a245,MDT,2023-10-11,7 Top Healthcare Stocks That Pay Dividends,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-top-healthcare-stocks-pay-000841744.html,1696464521,STORY,"['ABBV', 'UNH', 'JNJ', 'CAH', 'CVS', 'MDT', 'PDCO']","[Facing an uncertain market environment, investors ought to consider the top healthcare stocks that pay dividends. Sure, the Federal Reserve may be in a position to facilitate a soft landing for the economy, per bullish analysts. Genuinely, I hope that’s the case. But you can wish on one hand and, well, you know the rest.Primarily, the core benefit of top healthcare stocks that pay dividends centers on the “permanent” relevance of the underlying sector. To be clear, all sectors suffer the vulnerability of obsolescence sometime down the road. However, unless you anticipate a future where all diseases are eradicated, there’s a good chance healthcare will stick around.Second, top healthcare stocks that pay dividends naturally deliver passive income. Yes, the income itself can help bolster one’s portfolio, no doubt about it. But just the very fact that companies pay such dividends typically underscore consistent, predictable business models. With ambiguity being the rising theme of the moment, these are the top healthcare stocks that pay dividends.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsUnitedHealth (UNH)The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comA multinational managed healthcare and insurance provider, UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) is one of the most commonly cited top healthcare stocks that pay dividends. Undeniably, the company plays a significant role in the U.S. healthcare system thanks to its extensive range of services and vast customer base. As a result, it levers much influence on industry trends, costs, and service delivery.Financially, the company might not be particularly remarkable. For example, UNH trades at a forward earnings multiple of 18.24, which is extremely high. At the same time, in exchange for that lofty premium, you get a consistently profitable enterprise. In addition, UnitedHealth’s return on equity (ROE) pops at 27.14%, beating out 84.21% of its rivals.Regarding passive income, UNH carries a forward yield of 1.48%, which admittedly isn’t that generous. Nevertheless, its payout ratio sits at just under 27%. This provides confidence in yield sustainability. Finally, analysts peg UNH a strong buy with a $572.83 price target, implying over 12% upside potential.Story continuesCardinal Health (CAH)Cardinal Health (CAH) sign with bushes in front of itSource: ShutterstockAnother multinational healthcare services firm, Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) ranks among the top healthcare stocks that pay dividends based on revenue generation. Based in Dublin, Ohio, Cardinal specializes in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical products. Per its public profile, the company serves more than 100,000 locations. Since the beginning of this year, CAH gained a bit over 13% of its equity value.As with some of its rivals, Cardinal doesn’t exactly offer the most sterling financials ever. Notably, CAH trades at a forward earnings multiple of 12.98X. That’s a bit lower than the sector median of 13.97x but not by a whole lot. Still, the main positive here may be its top-line expansion. Its three-year revenue growth rate clocks in at 14.5%, above 78.57% of its peers.As for passive income, Cardinal Health posts a forward yield of 2.31%. Primarily, the takeaway here is that the company commands a history of 38 years of consecutive dividend increases. Lastly, analysts rate CAH a moderate buy with a $98.89 target, implying nearly 14% growth.AbbVie (ABBV)Closeup of AbbVie (ABBV) building corporate office, an American biopharmaceutical company with its headquarters in Lake Bluff, Illinois, USASource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.comA pharmaceutical giant, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) commands a diverse lineup of products for diseases. Among its most well-known therapeutics is Humira. However, the company has also made several strategic acquisitions to bolster its product portfolio. In particular, I’m fascinated with the Allergan buyout, which gives AbbVie control over Botox. Given society’s ultra-focused value on youth, Botox could be a huge moneymaker.Financially, ABBV symbolizes one of the top healthcare stocks that pay dividends because of its attractive valuation. Since the start of the year, ABBV dipped more than 9%. I think that’s a mistake, but whatever. The red ink now allows contrarian investors to pick up ABBV at only 13.41x forward earnings. Enticingly, this makes AbbVie rank favorably lower than 60.16% of its peers.Regarding passive income, AbbVie also sports a forward yield of 4.02%. That’s well above the healthcare sector’s average yield of 1.58%. Also, the payout ratio is reasonable at 53.31%. To close, analysts peg ABBV as a moderate buy with a $169.50 target, implying 15% upside.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)Negative Press Presents a Buying Opportunity with JNJ StockSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comOne of the top healthcare stocks that pay dividends – or by any other measure – Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) needs no introduction. Recently, the company spun off its consumer healthcare products unit, allowing it to concentrate on its pharmaceutical and medical technology businesses. However, investors so far aren’t all that impressed with JNJ. Since the January opener, shares slipped almost 13%.Is the red ink a mistake? On the financials, the move downward contributed to JNJ being closer to a solid deal. For example, shares now trade at a forward earnings multiple of 14.25x. In contrast, the drug manufacturing industry sports a forward price-earnings ratio of 15.13x. However, for the long haul, I’m focused on strong margins and consistent profitability.Such robust stats play strongly into J&amp;J’s forward yield, which comes in at 3.06%. That’s a solid rate of passive income compared to the industry. Also, the company has enjoyed 62 years of consecutive dividend increases. Turning to Wall Street, analysts rate JNJ a moderate buy with a $178.64 target, implying 15% upside.Patterson Companies (PDCO)An image of a phone displaying the Patterson Companies, Inc. (PDCO) logoSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comA medical supplies conglomerate, Patterson Companies (NASDAQ:PDCO) primarily concentrates on the veterinary and dental products segments. Both specialties arguably make PDCO one of the top healthcare stocks that pay dividends. For example, the American Pet Products Association continues to release industry data that shows veterinary demand rising. As well, proper dental care is essential to overall wellbeing.Since the beginning of the year, PDCO gained just over 7%, which is a modest figure. As a result, an argument can be made that it’s undervalued. Right now, shares trade at a forward multiple of 11.94x. In contrast, the underlying medical distribution industry sports a forward PE ratio of 13.97X. This stat ranks favorably lower than 70.59% of the competition.Heading over to passive income, Patterson carries a forward yield of 3.49%. Notably, that’s also quite higher than the 1.58% average of the broader healthcare space. As well, the payout ratio sits comfortably at 38.76%. Looking to the Street, analysts rate PDCO a moderate buy with a $36.60 target, implying almost 23% growth.Medtronic (MDT)Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocksSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comHeading over to the riskiest ideas of top healthcare stocks that pay dividends, Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) is a medical device company. Earlier this year, the company suffered serious questions about its growth projections. More recently, MDT managed to swing higher – before slipping conspicuously – based on strong fiscal first-quarter results and boosted guidance. In the trailing month, however, MDT is down almost 5%.Naturally, prospective investors will want to carefully consider exposure to Medtronic. Over the past three years, its operational stats haven’t been exactly lighting up the board. That said, for contrarians, MDT now trades at a forward multiple of 15.04x. Enticingly, this stat comes in lower than 72.32% of its peers in the medical devices and instruments sector.Turning to passive income, Medtronic sports a forward yield of 3.61%. Notably, the company commands 47 years of consecutive dividend increases. As well, the payout ratio sits at 50.39%. Lastly, analysts peg MDT as a moderate buy with a $94 target, implying nearly 23% upside.CVS Health (CVS)The front sign for a CVS Pharmacy, CVS stockSource: Susan Montgomery / Shutterstock.comOne of the most recognizable names among top healthcare stocks that pay dividends, CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) owns CVS Pharmacy, a popular retail pharmacy chain. As well, it owns a pharmacy benefits manager (Caremark) and Aetna, a health insurance provider. Still, significant competitive pressures have pressured CVS stock, with investors wondering about its viability.Since the start of the year, shares lost more than 25% of equity value so the concerns are legitimate. Obviously, you want to think carefully about heavy exposure to this risky idea. Nevertheless, for contrarians, it’s worth pointing out that CVS now trades at a forward earnings multiple of 8.1X. This stat ranks lower than 77.78% of its peers in the healthcare plans industry.Looking at passive income, CVS commands a forward yield of 3.49%, which on the surface is quite attractive. Also, the payout ratio sits at 28.16%, providing some confidence for yield sustainability. On a final note, analysts peg CVS as a strong buy with a $91.53 target, implying over 32% upside.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NYSE:MRK) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/78-institutional-ownership-merck-co-110031251.html,1697022031,STORY,['MRK'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Merck implies that they have significant influence over the company's share priceA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 44% ownership Insiders have sold recently A look at the shareholders of Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 78% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Merck. See our latest analysis for Merck ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Merck?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Merck. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Merck's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Merck is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.6% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.1% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.7% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of MerckThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Merck &amp; Co., Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$175m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 22% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Merck. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Merck better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   4 warning signs  we've spotted with Merck .If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

We also reviewed Asness’ AQR Capital Management’s assets under management, performance and stock picks. You can skip our detailed discussion of AQR Capital Management and go straight to AQR Capital Management's Top 5 Stock Picks.Following record-breaking returns in 2022, AQR Capital Management's performance in 2023 has been exceptional, with several of its strategies outperforming the broader market indices. The investment philosophy of its founder, billionaire Cliff Asness, has been the driving force behind this success. Asness, who achieved great success for the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund in the 90s, is famous for his great work on developing models and algorithms that can explore market patterns. His investment strategy combines traditional and unconventional techniques while diversifying investments in equity, alternative, and multi-asset funds. As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, AQR's AUM was around $120 billion.Year to date, AQR Long-Short Equity Fund has generated a return of approximately 19%. Meanwhile, AQR Sustainable Long-Short Equity Carbon Aware Fund, AQR Style Premia Alternative Fund, AQR Equity Market Neutral Fund, and AQR Alternative Risk Premia Fund have posted year-to-date returns of 17%, 19%, 17.77%, and 15%, respectively. In addition, AQR Large Cap Multi-Style Fund and AQR Global Equity Fund from the equity segment have posted year-to-date returns of 14% and 13%, respectively. It's worth noting that none of the equity funds have generated negative returns so far in 2023. Furthermore, the Multi-Asset fund has posted a year-to-date return of over 6%.According to AQR Capital Management’s LinkedIn account, Cliff Asness is also a managing principal and chief investment officer.

Cliff Asness’ books that gained popularity include ""The Allocator's Edge: A Modern Guide to Alternative Investments and the Future of Diversification,"" ""Expected Returns: An Investor's Guide to Harvesting Market Rewards,"" and ""Hedge Fund Management.""Story continuesCliff Asness is frequently featured in television and podcasts, where he shares his insights on financial issues. In a Bloomberg podcast with Barry Ritholtz, Cliff Asness discussed quant value investing, offering a comprehensive overview of how he manages risks and rewards. In another Cliff Asness podcast, he expressed concern about buoyant stocks, warned of trouble in the commercial real estate market and also predicted a potential financial crisis. Here is what the billionaire investor said:""My biggest concern is stocks and bonds seem to be taking a very, very different view. Bonds are pricing in multiple, severe cuts over the next year to two years. That is a forecast for a recession, and not a mild one. Equities are whistling past the graveyard. If inflation stays sticky, or it comes down because we enter a non-trivial recession, it's equities that I think are a scary place. They're not priced very consistently with bonds, and we're going to find out who's right in the next year.""Cliff Asness' firm began with 10 employees in 1998 and has since grown to a team of over 700, with 65% of staff holding advanced degrees. AQR Capital Management's salaries for its employees are among the highest in the industry, and it has been named one of the Best Places to Work in Money Management from 2017 to 2022.

Nevertheless, we maintain a positive outlook on the company, which is bolstered by the resilience of its core virology commercial business and the increasingly compelling oncology portfolio. We believe Gilead’s strategic transformation into a more diversified biopharmaceutical entity, expanding its focus from virology to oncology, provides a strong foundation for its future growth.”13. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) Value of AQR Capital Management’s 13F Position: $331 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 113AQR Capital sold 21% of its stake in Adobe Inc.

(NASDAQ:ADBE). Here is what the firm stated about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE):“Although the market initially feared that Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) would lose out to Al image-generating programs Dall-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, the design-software giant has since released its own generative Al model called Firefly. One feature of Firefly is that it can help designers generate ideas and create and manipulate images more quickly in Photoshop or Illustrator that can then be processed by other Adobe products for further development, fostering a seamless workflow. There’s more work involved when trying to manipulate images created by outside tools. Also, because Firefly is trained on Adobe’s vast inventory of stock images and other licensed content, it can generate professional-quality, commercially viable results, further setting it apart from generic models that are often trained on copyrighted content that isn’t properly licensed. These are just two examples of how Al enhances the Adobe suite, which should allow the company to raise subscription prices and upsell users.”12. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)Value of AQR Capital Management’s 13F Position: $332 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 79Cliff Asness’ investment firm increased its stake in Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

The company owns the #1 pharmacy benefit manager, #1 retail pharmacy, #1 specialty pharmacy, #3 commercial health insurer and #3 Medicare Advantage organization in the U.S. Managed care and pharmacy benefits management have proven to be good businesses over time, characterized by healthy underlying growth and excellent free cash flow generation. CVS has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by more than 40 percentage points over the past 12 months, impacted by a cloud of company-specific and legislative concerns. While we are not dismissive of these potential risks and headwinds, we believe the market has become overly pessimistic. This created an attractive opportunity to invest in what we view as a durable, competitively advantaged and well-managed enterprise at a high-single-digit multiple of earnings.”10.

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft were also positive contributors, up 55.19% and 42.66%, respectively. All three stocks benefited from a renewed interest in growth stocks by investors in the first half of the year.Amazon had an impressive first half of the year as well with growth out of its retail segment but slightly slower growth in its cloud business. Customers optimized workloads for existing capacity they were already paying for rather than adding incremental capacity in the current environment. We remain very excited about the opportunity for the company to reduce the labor needs of its retail segment through the use of technology and automation in the future.”7. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Value of AQR Capital Management’s 13F Position: $483 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 178NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), like Amazon.com, Inc.

Here is what the firm stated about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA):NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the biggest beneficiary this year in terms of its stock run and projected revenue gains. More companies- including, perhaps, some not yet in existence-will certainly join the ranks over time.In the meantime, NVIDIA has emerged as the unrivaled global leader in providing the technologies at the center of the Al arms race. NVIDIA’s competitive advantage is the result of investments that began two decades ago, when it recognized an early opportunity to repurpose its video-game graphics chips for the heavy-load computing done in scientific research. This led management to expand the GPU business. It also spent years and significant resources developing a free software platform that’s exclusive to its chips called CUDA that allows developers to easily program its GPUs for a variety of computationally intensive applications. Researchers then began using both NVIDIA’s chips and CUDA to train the human-brain-inspired neural networks that power Al models.Now, due to an explosion of demand related to generative Al and LLMs from across its customer base, NVIDIA projects that data-center revenue for its fiscal second quarter ending in July will surge to US$11 billion. Not only is that more than double last quarter’s total, but the forecast also shattered the average analyst estimate that called for about US$7 billion. Taking advantage of the stock’s meteoric rise, we reduced our holding (it has risen tenfold since we first purchased in 2018)…” (Click here to read the full text)6. Meta Platforms, Inc.

(NASDAQ:META), Alphabet and Heidelberg Materials. Meta was the largest contributor to performance. Its shares have almost fully recovered from last year’s declines, rising 35% during the quarter and 138% YTD. During the quarter, the company reported earnings that showed a return to growth and healthy user engagement metrics. Most importantly, profitability appears to have stabilized and is poised to improve as significant cost reduction actions implemented over the past six months begin to have an impact. Separate from fundamental performance, there is excitement over AI’s potential to help the company’s business. While Meta’s technology prowess and massively scaled media platform certainly position the company to take advantage of AI, we believe it’s far too early to estimate any discrete tangible benefits. Overall, we view AI as one of several drivers that will contribute to Meta’s continued growth.”Like Walmart Inc. (NASDAQ:WMT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of AQR Capital Management’s top stock picks.

(AP) — Boeing deliveries of new airline jets slumped in the third quarter as the company struggled with production problems that are cutting into its ability to generate cash.Boeing said Tuesday that it delivered 27 planes in September, including 15 of its best-seller, the 737 Max.That was far behind European rival Airbus, which delivered 55 planes last month. It brought the Arlington, Virginia, company’s quarterly total to 105 deliveries, down from 112 in the same period last year.Boeing gets the largest share of the purchase price when it delivers planes, so the dip hurts cash flow. The pace of Max deliveries is also falling short of the company’s goal of producing 38 new 737s per month.Production and deliveries of the Max and the 787 Dreamliner have been affected by production flaws, notably at Spirit AeroSystems, which builds the fuselages for many Boeing planes. In the most recent example, the companies said in August that improperly drilled fastener holes would delay deliveries of 737s.Despite the production stumbles, strong demand from airlines such as United continued to bolster orders for new Boeing jets. The company said that after cancellations it received orders for 214 planes in September.Boeing’s orders beat Airbus, which said Monday that it took 23 net new orders in September.Boeing is scheduled to report third-quarter financial results on Oct. 25.]"

One student describes her summer experienceOriginally published on Illumina News CenterNORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / October 10, 2023 / When Adee Newman started her summer as a research associate Intern at Illumina in June 2023, she had no prior industry experience. Originally from Palo Alto, California, she spent two years at De Anza College before transferring to University of California, San Diego (UCSD). Currently, she is a master's student in biology with a research emphasis of epigenetics and genomics at UCSD.Newman's internship was based in San Diego, but she was able to work remotely. We caught up with her at the end of her internship last month to hear about her experience.How did you first become aware of Illumina? Why did you apply for an internship? Adee Newman: We use Illumina sequencers in the lab that I do research in, which is how I first learned about Illumina. I saw a few ads for the internship on LinkedIn and Handshake and applied when I got a message from a recruiter. I was curious about experiencing industry so I can make an informed decision about my next career decision-so this felt like the perfect opportunity!Has anything surprised you about working in industry? AN: I wasn't sure what to expect the day-to-day to be like, but it has been wonderful. I appreciate the independent work, but it doesn't get lonely either, as we collaborate a lot. I've learned about organizational structures and various other career paths. There is no ""right way"" to go about your career path and you should keep an open mind when you are starting out! In speaking with people within the company I've received a lot of advice and fresh perspectives, which is unbelievably valuable to me at this point in my career.What kind of work are you doing? AN: I'm interning with the Clinical Affairs team and I've learned so much about clinical trials. My internship project was creating a process map of all the actions and activities that are required during a clinical trial, as well as reviewing the standard operating procedures and work instructions for the various activities. I also met with subject matter experts from various Clinical Affairs teams-protocol and clinical study report writing from Medical Writing, data handling from Clinical Data Management, and others-to better understand the process and better create a process map.Story continuesWhat did you learn about clinical trials? AN: My favorite thing I learned is that we're able to have a direct impact on people and health outcomes much sooner just with how clinical trials work-it's so complex and has so much cross-functional collaboration, it basically looks like a Chutes and Ladders game. You can take some steps that can move you through the board faster, but if someone wants to change something or if there's an issue with a specific aspect, you might hit a chute and it could take you back almost to the start! Because of that, teamwork and collaboration are extremely important, and I love that about Clinical Affairs.Are you interested in pursuing any specific area in biotech? AN: I'd love to work on and support various clinical trials that focus on improving aspects of human health on a large scale. I think it would be amazing to work on a project that would help or provide a solution for a problem that affects a large population. It would also be great to work on oncology and companion diagnostics.Has your internship experience helped you determine the next steps in your career? AN: Yes! Hearing everyone's experiences has helped me decide that I will likely work for a few years before deciding if I want to continue or go back to academia. If you want to pursue academia, you should be passionate about it-otherwise it may not be the right career choice for you.What advice would you give students contemplating moving from academia to industry? AN: Give it a try! If you are curious about it, you should experience it for yourself so you know what you will be doing. It's one thing to hear from people, but another thing to see it for yourself. Don't be scared of stepping out of your comfort zone.Illumina's internship program introduces students to the corporate world while remaining centered around learning: learning about yourself, learning about the biotech and genomics industries, and learning from experienced professionals and leaders in your field. Each summer, our interns apply their knowledge to impactful projects and discover the various career paths available to them. The hands-on work, professional development workshops, and simple conversations with mentors and peers can influence one's path forward. Interested in experiencing life at Illumina?

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Right now, Ligand Pharmaceuticals is sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Illumina has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell). This means that LGND's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.LGND currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.56, while ILMN has a forward P/E of 165.51. We also note that LGND has a PEG ratio of 0.58. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. ILMN currently has a PEG ratio of 7.46.Another notable valuation metric for LGND is its P/B ratio of 1.53. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ILMN has a P/B of 3.32.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to LGND's Value grade of B and ILMN's Value grade of D.LGND is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

Fluor has supported the nation’s security for nearly 80 years.The company has been focusing on its new strategy, “Building a Better Future,” within which it has outlined four strategic priorities for driving shareholder value.

As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's look into Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc's dividend performance and assess its sustainability.What Does Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc Do?High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' PortfolioThis Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 YearsHow to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc, or MAA, is a real estate investment trust engaged in the acquisition, operation, and development of multifamily apartment communities located in southeastern and southwestern United States. The company operates two reportable segments; Same Store and Non-Same Store and Other. The Same Store segment includes communities that the company has owned and have been stabilized for at least a full 12 months as of the first day of the calendar year. The Non-Same Store and Other segment includes recently acquired communities, communities being developed or in lease-up, communities that have been disposed of, communities that have experienced a significant casualty loss, and stabilized communities that do not meet the requirements to be Same Store communities. The key revenue comes from the Same Store segment.Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc's Dividend AnalysisA Glimpse at Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc's Dividend HistoryMid-America Apartment Communities Inc has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 1994. Dividends are currently distributed on a quarterly basis. The company has increased its dividend each year since 1994, earning it the title of a dividend aristocrat, a distinction given to companies that have increased their dividend each year for at least the past 29 years.Story continuesMid-America Apartment Communities Inc's Dividend AnalysisBreaking Down Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc's Dividend Yield and GrowthAs of today, Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 4.11% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 4.21%. This suggests an expectation of increased dividend payments over the next 12 months.Over the past three years, Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc's annual dividend growth rate was 6.80%. Extended to a five-year horizon, this rate decreased to 5.40% per year. And over the past decade, Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc's annual dividends per share growth rate stands at 5.50%.Based on Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost of Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc stock as of today is approximately 5.35%.Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc's Dividend AnalysisThe Sustainability Question: Payout Ratio and ProfitabilityTo assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-06-30, Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc's dividend payout ratio is 1.04. This may suggest that the company's dividend may not be sustainable.Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc's profitability 8 out of 10 as of 2023-06-30, suggesting good profitability prospects. The company has reported positive net income for each of the years over the past decade, further solidifying its high profitability.Growth Metrics: The Future OutlookTo ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc's growth rank of 8 out of 10 suggests that the company's growth trajectory is good relative to its competitors.Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc's revenue has increased by approximately 8.00% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 78.04% of global competitors.The company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc's earnings increased by approximately 21.30% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 71.75% of global competitors.Lastly, the company's 5-year EBITDA growth rate of 17.10%, which outperforms approximately 77.24% of global competitors.ConclusionIn conclusion, Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc has demonstrated a consistent track record of dividend payments. However, its high payout ratio raises concerns about the sustainability of future dividends. On the other hand, the company's strong profitability and growth metrics suggest that it has the potential to continue its dividend payments. Investors should monitor these factors closely to make informed decisions.GuruFocus Premium users can screen for high-dividend yield stocks using the High Dividend Yield Screener.This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

We also reviewed Asness’ AQR Capital Management’s assets under management, performance and stock picks. You can skip our detailed discussion of AQR Capital Management and go straight to AQR Capital Management's Top 5 Stock Picks.Following record-breaking returns in 2022, AQR Capital Management's performance in 2023 has been exceptional, with several of its strategies outperforming the broader market indices. The investment philosophy of its founder, billionaire Cliff Asness, has been the driving force behind this success. Asness, who achieved great success for the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund in the 90s, is famous for his great work on developing models and algorithms that can explore market patterns. His investment strategy combines traditional and unconventional techniques while diversifying investments in equity, alternative, and multi-asset funds. As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, AQR's AUM was around $120 billion.Year to date, AQR Long-Short Equity Fund has generated a return of approximately 19%. Meanwhile, AQR Sustainable Long-Short Equity Carbon Aware Fund, AQR Style Premia Alternative Fund, AQR Equity Market Neutral Fund, and AQR Alternative Risk Premia Fund have posted year-to-date returns of 17%, 19%, 17.77%, and 15%, respectively. In addition, AQR Large Cap Multi-Style Fund and AQR Global Equity Fund from the equity segment have posted year-to-date returns of 14% and 13%, respectively. It's worth noting that none of the equity funds have generated negative returns so far in 2023. Furthermore, the Multi-Asset fund has posted a year-to-date return of over 6%.According to AQR Capital Management’s LinkedIn account, Cliff Asness is also a managing principal and chief investment officer. He is an active researcher and has authored numerous financial articles for several publications, including The Journal of Portfolio Management and Financial Analysts Journal. Cliff Asness has also authored several books. Cliff Asness’ books that gained popularity include ""The Allocator's Edge: A Modern Guide to Alternative Investments and the Future of Diversification,"" ""Expected Returns: An Investor's Guide to Harvesting Market Rewards,"" and ""Hedge Fund Management.""Story continuesCliff Asness is frequently featured in television and podcasts, where he shares his insights on financial issues. In a Bloomberg podcast with Barry Ritholtz, Cliff Asness discussed quant value investing, offering a comprehensive overview of how he manages risks and rewards. In another Cliff Asness podcast, he expressed concern about buoyant stocks, warned of trouble in the commercial real estate market and also predicted a potential financial crisis. Here is what the billionaire investor said:""My biggest concern is stocks and bonds seem to be taking a very, very different view. Bonds are pricing in multiple, severe cuts over the next year to two years. That is a forecast for a recession, and not a mild one. Equities are whistling past the graveyard. If inflation stays sticky, or it comes down because we enter a non-trivial recession, it's equities that I think are a scary place. They're not priced very consistently with bonds, and we're going to find out who's right in the next year.""Cliff Asness' firm began with 10 employees in 1998 and has since grown to a team of over 700, with 65% of staff holding advanced degrees. AQR Capital Management's salaries for its employees are among the highest in the industry, and it has been named one of the Best Places to Work in Money Management from 2017 to 2022.

Nevertheless, we maintain a positive outlook on the company, which is bolstered by the resilience of its core virology commercial business and the increasingly compelling oncology portfolio. We believe Gilead’s strategic transformation into a more diversified biopharmaceutical entity, expanding its focus from virology to oncology, provides a strong foundation for its future growth.”13. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) Value of AQR Capital Management’s 13F Position: $331 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 113AQR Capital sold 21% of its stake in Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) during the second quarter to capitalize on recent gains, but the firm still owned a $331 million stake in the company. Adobe Inc.

(NASDAQ:ADBE) would lose out to Al image-generating programs Dall-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, the design-software giant has since released its own generative Al model called Firefly. One feature of Firefly is that it can help designers generate ideas and create and manipulate images more quickly in Photoshop or Illustrator that can then be processed by other Adobe products for further development, fostering a seamless workflow. There’s more work involved when trying to manipulate images created by outside tools. Also, because Firefly is trained on Adobe’s vast inventory of stock images and other licensed content, it can generate professional-quality, commercially viable results, further setting it apart from generic models that are often trained on copyrighted content that isn’t properly licensed. These are just two examples of how Al enhances the Adobe suite, which should allow the company to raise subscription prices and upsell users.”12. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)Value of AQR Capital Management’s 13F Position: $332 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 79Cliff Asness’ investment firm increased its stake in Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

The company owns the #1 pharmacy benefit manager, #1 retail pharmacy, #1 specialty pharmacy, #3 commercial health insurer and #3 Medicare Advantage organization in the U.S. Managed care and pharmacy benefits management have proven to be good businesses over time, characterized by healthy underlying growth and excellent free cash flow generation. CVS has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by more than 40 percentage points over the past 12 months, impacted by a cloud of company-specific and legislative concerns. While we are not dismissive of these potential risks and headwinds, we believe the market has become overly pessimistic. This created an attractive opportunity to invest in what we view as a durable, competitively advantaged and well-managed enterprise at a high-single-digit multiple of earnings.”10. The Cigna Group (NASDAQ:CI)Value of AQR Capital Management’s 13F Position: $365 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 76Like Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) is outperforming. Here is what the firm stated about Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN):“Regarding stock selection in the first half, Nvidia (NVDA) was a massive outperformer, up 189.54%. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft were also positive contributors, up 55.19% and 42.66%, respectively. All three stocks benefited from a renewed interest in growth stocks by investors in the first half of the year.Amazon had an impressive first half of the year as well with growth out of its retail segment but slightly slower growth in its cloud business. Customers optimized workloads for existing capacity they were already paying for rather than adding incremental capacity in the current environment. We remain very excited about the opportunity for the company to reduce the labor needs of its retail segment through the use of technology and automation in the future.”7. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Value of AQR Capital Management’s 13F Position: $483 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 178NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), like Amazon.com, Inc.

Here is what the firm stated about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA):NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the biggest beneficiary this year in terms of its stock run and projected revenue gains. More companies- including, perhaps, some not yet in existence-will certainly join the ranks over time.In the meantime, NVIDIA has emerged as the unrivaled global leader in providing the technologies at the center of the Al arms race. NVIDIA’s competitive advantage is the result of investments that began two decades ago, when it recognized an early opportunity to repurpose its video-game graphics chips for the heavy-load computing done in scientific research. This led management to expand the GPU business. It also spent years and significant resources developing a free software platform that’s exclusive to its chips called CUDA that allows developers to easily program its GPUs for a variety of computationally intensive applications. Researchers then began using both NVIDIA’s chips and CUDA to train the human-brain-inspired neural networks that power Al models.Now, due to an explosion of demand related to generative Al and LLMs from across its customer base, NVIDIA projects that data-center revenue for its fiscal second quarter ending in July will surge to US$11 billion. Not only is that more than double last quarter’s total, but the forecast also shattered the average analyst estimate that called for about US$7 billion. Taking advantage of the stock’s meteoric rise, we reduced our holding (it has risen tenfold since we first purchased in 2018)…” (Click here to read the full text)6. Meta Platforms, Inc.

(NASDAQ:META), Alphabet and Heidelberg Materials. Meta was the largest contributor to performance. Its shares have almost fully recovered from last year’s declines, rising 35% during the quarter and 138% YTD. During the quarter, the company reported earnings that showed a return to growth and healthy user engagement metrics. Most importantly, profitability appears to have stabilized and is poised to improve as significant cost reduction actions implemented over the past six months begin to have an impact. Separate from fundamental performance, there is excitement over AI’s potential to help the company’s business. While Meta’s technology prowess and massively scaled media platform certainly position the company to take advantage of AI, we believe it’s far too early to estimate any discrete tangible benefits. Overall, we view AI as one of several drivers that will contribute to Meta’s continued growth.”Like Walmart Inc. (NASDAQ:WMT), Amazon.com, Inc.

This will help it deliver better care to its provider network with active collaboration and create better, meaningful, and standard metrics for behavioral healthcare.This move bodes well for Evernorth as it would improve health outcomes of patients in the provider network and help with client retention. Evernorth Health Services segment aims to bring value or measurement-based care to behavioral health, which has existed for a long time in physical health. As providers and payers continue their journey toward value-based care, programs to improve the quality of care and reduce administrative costs should poise Cigna’s Evernorth well for growth. The company expects the Evernorth Health Services segment to report adjusted operating income on a pretax basis of a minimum of $6.4 billion in 2023.Through this initiative, Evernorth will strengthen its interventions with patients and improve its relationship with providers. A lack of consistent and repeatable measures marks this program as a time opportune one, as this would reduce administrative work and ensure trust from providers. This new program aims to align the measurement of treatments, improving quality of care while reducing costs. Collaborating with providers and establishing measurement touchpoints would benefit patients and clients as well as solidify Evernorth’s core value proposition.Evernorth will work with 44,000 providers, including behavioral health coaches, therapists etc, and build on its existing metrics, like the time taken for a patient to get an appointment, to ensure high-quality care is provided. Tracking such information will aid providers in focusing on patient care and improve outcomes for patients and providers. Shared metrics can be used by providers and payers to get insights into a patient’s journey and improve the value-based care provided.Story continuesShares of Cigna have gained 8.7% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 1.4% growth.

Never miss another market-moving headline.Corning shares fall on JPMorgan downgradeCorning (NYSE:GLW) shares fell nearly 2% pre-market today after JPMorgan slashed the specialty-glass and ceramics maker to Neutral from Overweight, and cut its price target to $36 from $43, as reported in real-time on InvestingPro.The analysts say they now expect a more prolonged economic recovery than they initially did, and say this is expected to mute Corning earnings upside in the near to medium term.“The direct consequence of a milder recovery is considerable downside to current consensus estimates that embed sequential earnings growth in 4Q23E, as well as downside to consensus expectations of +25% y/y EPS growth in 2024E,” wrote JPMorgan.While still forecasting a 17% year-over-year earnings growth in 2024, driven by various profitability-enhancing actions, the analysts perceive that variability in the timing of revenue recovery across Corning's end markets will limit the opportunity to deliver the strong earnings growth indicated by the Wall Street consensus.Shares were nearly breakeven in recent trading at $29.48.Qorvo and Skyworks Solutions cut to Sell at CitiBoth Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) and Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) were downgraded to Sell from Neutral by Citi. For both smartphone chipmakers - each a major supplier to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) - Citi cited increased to their China operations after the Huawei Mate 60 phone launch, which it believes will likely use domestic RF/connectivity chips.“While QRVO/SWKS China sales have already come down over the last 1+ year due to weak China smartphone demand or ~21%/~11% of last reported FY,"" wrote Citi, ""we believe increasing competition from Chinese domestic RF component makers will lead to potential share losses at OVX (Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi) and weak sales recovery in 2024.""Story continuesQorvo's price target was slashed by nearly one-third, to $78 from the prior $116.00, and Skyworks Solutions' price target is now $87 at Citi, also from a prior $116.Qorvo shares were down 1.9% to $93.08 in recent trading. Skyworks sank at the open after rough premarket trading, but clawed its way back to a fractional uptick to $98.59 about an hour post-open.Juniper Networks stock slips after JPMorgan downgradeJuniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) shares were falling 1.6% Tuesday after JPMorgan downgraded the company to Neutral from Overweight and cut its price target by $3 to $29.JPMorgan cited a number of challenges, including a lack of leverage to Hyperscale investments in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure.Analysts also pointed to headwinds in relation to Service Provider capex moderation, which they say position Juniper as the most challenged on a relative basis among its networking peers like Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET).JPMorgan added:""While the overall drivers in relation to elevated backlog in conjunction with moderating orders is likely similar for Juniper as it is for other Networking companies like Cisco and Arista, we expect the magnitude of the headwinds are much greater for Juniper relative to the peer group due to exposure to Service providers as well as Cloud exposure in relation to WAN layers, which remain at a lower priority relative to switching layers as well as AI infrastructure related ramps.""Shares of Juniper were recently changing hands at $26.37.***Amid whipsaw markets and a slew of critical headlines, seize on the right timing to protect your profits: Always be the first to know with InvestingPro.Related ArticlesCorning slashed at JPMorgan on tepid recovery: 4 big analyst cutsU.S. stocks jump after dovish rate comments by Fed officials; yields fallCalifornia enforces stringent climate laws, demanding large corporations to report greenhouse gas emissions]"

Notable gains include Northrop Grumman (NOC) which has risen by over 8% in five days and Lockheed Martin (LMT) which is up 9% in the same time. Yahoo Finance hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith break down the numbers for defense sector staples.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Major defense stocks added around $20 billion in market cap yesterday, following the events over the last three days. Though Northrop Grumman and Lockheed among those still trending higher, these types of moves are not uncommon during times of war. Now a similar surge happened when Russia invaded Ukraine.And you're looking at some of the movement that we're seeing today. And Lockheed Martin, up just about 1% as well as Boeing RTX and Northrop also once again moving to the upside. Now these gains coming on like we just had a strong day for the stocks. Yesterday we saw a big jump. Northrop coming off its biggest daily gain since we've seen-- that we've seen since 2020. So just about three years there.But the thought process is just in terms of the amount of spending, what's going to be allocated towards some of these defense companies given the conflict and the risk that this war could widen over in the Middle East. That's why we're seeing the reaction play out in shares today.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. And from a technical perspective too. It'd be interesting to look at this for anyone who's trying to figure out if some of the spikes that take place after there are international conflicts or events of international conflict, where some of the defensive names continue to cyclically in this instance here, get some type of attention from investors.Time and time again there has been a little bit of a bottom-- a new bottom that gets set in here, for Lockheed Martin at least as of right now since. And I kind of point back to early 2022, when we were thinking about the initiation of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and what took place there. Shares jumped by about 25% in that instance. It's held on since then to the majority of that move since the beginning of 2022, until after that.And then additionally here, you think about the move higher that we've seen just over the past couple of days here at the beginning of October. Shares up by about 10%, Lockheed Martin, and then we had a few of the other key and core names to track.]"

Per the terms of the deal, General Dynamics will provide support for the detailed design, prototyping and qualification of Virginia Class submarine’s capabilities.Work related to this contract will be executed in Groton, CT.Significance of Virginia-Class SubmarinesThe Virginia-class submarine is one of the most advanced nuclear-powered multisession stealth submarines suitable for marine warfare. It excels in littoral and open-ocean environments and collects intelligence critical to the full spectrum of warfare. The submarine is also capable of extended submerged operations with superior stealth, endurance, mobility and firepower.Such enhanced features have made the Virginia-class submarine a top choice for the U.S. Navy. These have also resulted in a steady order inflow for GD from the Pentagon, like the latest one. The submarine’s strong demand can be gauged by General Dynamics’ current backlog strength.The company is currently working on Blocks IV and V in the program, with 17 Virginia-class submarines in its backlog scheduled for delivery through 2032. The U.S. Navy procures these submarines in multi-boat blocks at a two-per-year rate.Such strong demand, along with an excellence in providing unique capabilities in submarines, should continue to boost GD’s order book in the long run, thereby enhancing its revenue generation prospects.Growth Prospects &amp; Peer MovesEfficient submarines, equipped with nuclear weapons, add to military capabilities and deter any potential nuclear attack in sea warfare missions. The advancement in submarine technology and its difficult-to-detect feature further add to its diverse advantages. These have invariably sparked increased spending by nations on military submarines to maintain an edge in undersea warfare.Story continuesLooking ahead, per a report from the Mordor Intelligence firm, the submarine market is projected to witness a CAGR of 4% during the 2023-2028 period. This trend should bolster General Dynamics’ Electric Boat segment’s growth as this unit is the prime contractor and lead shipyard on all U.S. Navy nuclear-powered submarine programs.Other defense majors poised to benefit from the expanding submarine market are BAE Systems BAESY, Northrop Grumman NOC and Huntington Ingalls Industries HII.BAE Systems’ Astute class submarines, the U.K.’s largest and most powerful attack submarines, can strike targets up to 621 miles from the coast with pinpoint accuracy.BAE Systems boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 14%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of BAESY’s 2023 sales calls for an increase of 33.6% from the prior-year reported figure.Northrop Grumman designs, develops and produces communication systems, sensors, signal processing and electronic warfare systems to counter the increasingly sophisticated sea-based threats. It also provides launch systems for submarines. NOC’s eject launch technology has powered more than 7,000 successful launches.The company’s long-term earnings growth rate is 3.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of NOC’s 2023 sales implies growth of 5.8% from the prior-year reported figure.Huntington Ingalls is a co-developer of the Virginia-class fast-attack nuclear submarines, along with Electric Boat. Its Newport News division participates in the design and construction of the Columbia-class (SSBN 826) submarine as a replacement for the current aging Ohio-class nuclear ballistic missile submarines.HII’s long-term earnings growth rate is 6.6%.

So $46 a share would be-- midway through, we're hearing $44 to $49 was the expected range, Josh.So it looks like here, that this is what we could get. At the top of the range, that would have been a valuation of around $9.2 billion. So it's not quite at the top of the range. But still, it's big valuation for a maker of shoes.JOSH LIPTON: A maker of shoes. As you know, two pair with a Lipton household as we speak. We're fans.I would say-- so the trickle continues.

For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptJOSH SCHAFER: I want to focus on another part of the Piper Sandler survey. Because one thing that always stands out is me, and you see this in the fall, and the spring, you see this year over year, is the consistent brands, the powerful brands. You know what brands are going to be at the top of this survey. Guess what teens' favorite brand was? I'm wearing them right now. Nike. Nike was their favorite retail brand. And guess what phones they use? They use iPhones. They use Apple.And I think that is the biggest takeaway I have from this Piper Sandler survey when you think about it from an investor perspective. We talk a lot about the potential consumer slowdown coming, what brands survive, what brands thrive. It is companies like a Nike or an Apple. That was the analyst takeaway from Nike earnings a couple weeks ago was, hey. Guess what? Even if the slowdown does come, it's not going to be for Nike. It's going to be for other retail brands. But teens still love Nike. Teens still love Lululemon. They still love Apple.ALEXANDRA CANAL: You are--JOSH SCHAFER: I'm using all three brands right now in full Gen Z-- in full Gen Z form.ALEXANDRA CANAL: You are Gen Z though.JOSH SCHAFER: I'm wearing Lululemon pants and a shirt.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: And we're streaming.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And we're streaming.JOSH SCHAFER: And I'm wearing Nikes.ALEXANDRA CANAL: On YouTube.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yes. Yes.ALEXANDRA CANAL: By the way.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: [INAUDIBLE]Story continuesALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, I was just going to say, this makes sense to me. At a time when you're seeing inflation high, consumers pulling back across the board, what are you going to spend money on? The brands that people know and care about. You don't want to be a teenager texting your crush and you have a green bubble and not a blue bubble. You want to--JOSH SCHAFER: You can't have a green.ALEXANDRA CANAL: You can't have a green. That's a major no, no. So you want to be in on what is in, essentially. And you're going to pay up for those types of products.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I got to say, New Balance is rising up. They're beating Vans in the teen survey. Also, I want to talk about Apple. You mentioned Apple. Check this out. 88% expect their next phone to be an iPhone. 87% actually own one right now. 34% have an Apple Watch. The overall market share of all Americans in the US is 45%. 45% Android. They means they're-- teens are doubling up on iPhone on Apple. That's just simply remarkable. They're dominating the space there. And I got to say, [INAUDIBLE]. This is Yahoo Finance's, right? If I'm Apple shareholder, I'm happy about this.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: And the other thing, Pras, I'd add to that too that really stuck out to me about Apple too, and you think about the future of Apple and where they're trying to go, that services part, right? If you look at payments, top payment apps for teens, Apple Pay, 43% of teens saying they're using Apple Pay significantly higher than Cash App, significantly higher than Venmo, et cetera. Look at all the major banks. Look at Zelle, which Pras probably uses, right in the middle there. And--PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I'm Venmo. I'm Venmo.JOSH SCHAFER: But Apple Pay, I think, has just become so synonymous with the way we pay for things. You just tap your phone.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I would say it's not even just teenagers at this point. I'd be curious actually what the older, older generation.JOSH SCHAFER: People in the city, I feel like, it's a very big thing. You can use it on the subway.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I was a recent adopter to Apple Pay. I was the girl that took out her credit card. But now that I've done it, I can't-- it's the best thing ever.JOSH SCHAFER: Allie's been paying in cash for the past [INAUDIBLE].ALEXANDRA CANAL: Under the table. No, no.

(Brian Snyder/REUTERS) (Brian Snyder / reuters)Whether US banks are properly prepared for an extended period of high rates will be a central theme running through the third quarter earnings season that kicks off Friday with results from giants JPMorgan (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC).The Federal Reserve made it clear in September that it expects rates to stay higher for longer. That stance will continue to place pressure on banks by making deposits more expensive, deepening paper losses on bonds held for investment, and making it more difficult for bank borrowers to pay back their loans.A focus for many investors in the coming weeks will be what banks say about a key measure of profitability known as net interest income, which measures the difference between what banks earn on their loans and pay for deposits.Those margins have been under pressure from the Fed’s campaign to cool inflation and the intense competition for depositors that followed the chaos of the spring, when the failures of three sizable regional banks stoked panic throughout the financial world.""The length of time we stay at these levels is a critical factor,"" Scott Siefers, a large bank analyst for Piper Sandler, told Yahoo Finance. ""If rates stay up here for years, it'll just be this grind higher where banks have to pay more to every incremental account.""Hammered during the regional banking crisis in March, bank stocks have notably lagged the S&amp;P 500 this year, even as they've recovered from their lows reached back in May.As of Tuesday, the S&amp;P Bank Index ETF (KBE) and the S&amp;P Regional Bank Index ETF (KRE) were down more than 18% and 29% year to date, respectively. The S&amp;P 500, in contrast, has gained nearly 13% this year.Story continuesGerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC who covers large banks, told Yahoo Finance that if the Fed is done with its interest rate hikes, stocks are likely ""bottoming out."" But the risk, he said, is that the Fed can’t get inflation under control and has to take rates above 7% in 2024.""That's the bear case for the banks,"" Cassidy said about the possibility of more hikes, calling it “long-tail risk” for the industry.September forecasts from the Federal Reserve suggested one additional rate hike would be necessary in 2023 before rate cuts begin next year.The lessons of 2008The big bank that appears to be best positioned for an era of higher rates is JPMorgan, which signaled as early as 2020 that it wasn’t willing to take a lot of risk with an influx of deposits that flooded into all banks during the early days of the pandemic.Some of JPMorgan’s rivals began investing that money in longer-dated securities in a search for higher yield, only to see the value of those holdings go down once the Fed began raising rates.The unrealized losses that piled up were partly responsible for the fall of Silicon Valley Bank, which attempted in March to sell large amounts of its bonds at a loss in a last-ditch effort to gain more liquidity.Dimon, according to a person familiar with his thinking, is concerned that some banks didn’t do enough to fix their balance sheets following the events of this spring. JPMorgan in May purchased operations from another lender seized by regulators, First Republic.The current period reminds him, this person said, of the months following the March 2008 fall of Wall Street investment bank Bear Stearns, which JPMorgan also purchased with help from the US government.Not enough institutions used that March 2008 warning to fix their balance sheets, leaving them vulnerable to a systemwide crisis that roiled the global economy in September of that year.When JPMorgan releases its third quarter results this Friday, its profits are expected to outshine other large banks.It is the only one of the big four banks expected to show a rise in net interest income when compared with the second quarter. Its jump when compared to the third quarter of 2022 is also expected to far outpace those at Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo.Bank of America is among the lenders that are now paying for a decision to pile hundreds of billions into longer-dated Treasurys and mortgage bonds during the pandemic. Those holdings were down by more than $100 billion on paper as of June 30.The unrealized losses are a big reason investors have pushed Bank of America’s stock near a 52-week low.Analysts don’t expect Bank of America to have a need to sell those holdings, and therefore book a loss.But smaller banks may not have as many options, which could create new concern among investors. All banks held $309.6 billion in unrealized losses as of the second quarter, a 9% rise from the first quarter and a 28% rise from last year.“An institution that has very large unrealized losses without enough explanation could generate concern and that's what we saw in the spring,” Eric Rosengren, the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, told Yahoo Finance.There will be other challenges to look for in third quarter results. Analysts expect banks big and small to set aside more money for future loan losses and take higher charge-offs as borrowers begin to struggle to repay their debts.Big banks with sizable Wall Street operations, such as Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), will also be trying to show that a two-year slump in dealmaking is finally waning.The drought is far from over, however, according to Dealogic data. Global investment banking revenue is expected to be down by 10% from last quarter and 17% from a year ago.High rates are not all bad for the industry, some analysts said. They do allow bankers to charge more for their loans, and that could help some institutions when demand for new borrowings picks up.And bank stocks could recover in 2024 if it’s clear the Fed is done with its campaign to cool inflation.Aside from the risk that loan losses mount, ""higher for longer, ultimately, should be a positive for bank fundamentals,"" David Chiaverini, regional and midsized bank analyst for Wedbush, told Yahoo Finance.David Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking and crypto.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

One area of focus will be how these big financial institutions are coping with the Federal Reserve's high for longer interest rate policy. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter David Hollerith gives a preview of what investors can expect.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptJOSH LIPTON: And big bank earnings kicking off on Friday as big name players, such as JP Morgan and Citi, gear up to report their quarterly results. Let's get right to Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith with a preview on what investors can expect.DAVID HOLLERITH: Yeah. So Josh, the outlook for banks has changed a lot sort of in the last few weeks of Q3. Deposit outflows don't really look as much of an issue as they were for Q2. But the Federal Reserve's signal to keep interest rates higher for longer is obviously going to pressure banking profitability going forward. And this is sort of a time for banks to come out and show investors that they can hang with a higher for longer environment.And now, I would also point out that given the rise in the 10 and 30-year bond yields, the unrealized losses that banks keep on their balance sheets are going to be worse this quarter. Taken together, obviously, bank stocks have widely underperformed the S&amp;P year-to-date. And, you know, there's going to be a big question here about whether or not this is sort of the bottom, so to speak.Three of the big four banks report Friday. And JPMorgan Chase is expected to steal the show as being the lender that is best positioned to withstand higher rates for longer. It's the only one that's expected to show a jump in core revenue compared to last quarter. It's also supposed to outpace peers on the year-ago period. Bank of America and then Charles Schwab and then Truist are among the larger banks that have higher unrealized losses. So they're going to be needing to thread the needle here.Story continuesAgain, this has been framed by analysts as more of a stock performance issue than a liquidity issue like we saw in the spring. But investors are clearly very mindful of this. So we'll want to see what management says about that.And then I think just going forward on the bank credit side of things, which is sort of the looming issue commercial, you know, real estate. I think that is not looking to be noticeably worse, although we are expecting to see most banks sort of take higher net charge-offs, meaning they're going to be marking down more loans as having borrowers that are unlikely to repay. So all that taken together, we're kind of at an inflection point where, you know, we're staring at the worst of what bank lending is looking like. And most is hinging on the forward outlook for the next couple of quarters.Results actually do not appear to be that bad. But again, it's going to hinge a lot on how banks are looking to the future.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. A lot to consider here as we come up against this quarter. It will really be interesting to see if it's the bottom for some of these banks in terms of performance around rates. David Hollerith-- and if it's the bottom rates for that matter. David Hollerith, appreciate it.]"

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on South Korea's economic transition, you may go to the 5 Best Places to Retire in South Korea.South Korea’s Economic TransitionSouth Korea is one of the largest economies in Asia. Back in the 1960s, it was just a struggling nation on the road to recovery from a devastating war. However, it now stands amongst the largest economies in the world. As of 2022, its GDP in nominal terms was $1.65 trillion. Economists note that two critical drivers have been behind South Korea’s successful economic growth: technology upgrading and management efficiency. As such, it's significant investments in the R&amp;D sector have particularly proved to be beneficial for the economy. From investing 4% of its GDP for the first time in 2014, to continuing the trend in years 2019 and 2020, the country has certainly come a long way. Today, the country has managed to become a global player in mobile phones, electric vehicles, semiconductors, automobiles, and even premium consumer goods.Another major force behind South Korea's successful economy are the corporate powerhouses called chaebols. Chaebols are large industrial conglomerates in South Korea that are run by individuals or families. The most prominent chaebols that have been responsible for South Korea's success are the Samsung Group, the largest South Korean company by market capitalization; SK, an energy, telecommunications, and semiconductors company; Hyundai, a multinational automotive manufacturer; LG, a multinational conglomerate; and Lotte, a food business group. According to the Bank of South Korea, these chaebols represented 44% of GDP in 2019. Meanwhile, in 2022, the ten largest chaebols in South Korea made up 60% of the country’s GDP.These chaebols have been under fire for the past many years, accused of fostering a culture of corruption and fraud. However, recent years have witnessed them cleaning up their acts and making some serious amends. While Samsung and Hyundai are committing billions of dollars to new semiconductor and EV factories in the US, others are signing deals with the US in other arenas. In particular, Samsung Biologics has announced two deals with Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) in July 2023 worth a total of $897 million. The agreement involves the long-term manufacturing of Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)'s multi-product portfolio. Samsung will use its newest facility Plant 4 located in Incheon, South Korea, to facilitate the production.Story continues“Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is excited to continue our strategic partnership with Samsung Biologics Ltd. that aims to enable greater access to medicines for more patients across the world. This commitment is a reflection of Pfizer’s trust in the Korean Pharmaceutical industry to address emerging health challenges.”Mike McDermott, Chief Global Supply Officer, Executive Vice President, PfizerIn other news, South Korean companies have been pouring in billions of dollars in the US. A memorandum of understanding has been signed, as of May 2023, in order to expedite the on-shoring of EV battery manufacturing to the country. The US non-profit battery trade association founder states that South Korea has the best available manufacturing technology to build a supply chain for lithium-based batteries. South Korea’s investment of $100 billion has helped make it a key stakeholder in America’s transition to a clean energy economy.An Attractive Retirement DestinationOwing to its booming economy, technological prowess, and global business arrangements; South Korea has successfully managed to present itself as an attractive retirement destination. High-quality healthcare, rich cultural heritage, and scenic beauty make it one of the best countries to retire to in Asia. There is a strong education system for retirees to engage in lifelong learning, plenty of social and recreational opportunities, and delicious cuisine to explore and relish along the way.With regards to retirement in the country, one common question that we get asked is: can a foreigner retire in South Korea? The answer is that the country does not have a specific retirement visa for foreigners. However, individuals may find other ways to qualify for a long-term visa. Another common question asked pertaining to retirement is: how much money do you need to retire in South Korea? Well, seniors will be pleased to know that the cost of living in the country is much lower than that of the United States of America. On average, the monthly cost of living for an individual retiree to live in major cities such as Seoul is $1,400.

But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.HPE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 7.88, while IBM has a forward P/E of 15.07. We also note that HPE has a PEG ratio of 1.98. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. IBM currently has a PEG ratio of 3.61.Another notable valuation metric for HPE is its P/B ratio of 1.05. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, IBM has a P/B of 5.82.Based on these metrics and many more, HPE holds a Value grade of A, while IBM has a Value grade of C.Story continuesBoth HPE and IBM are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that HPE is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company is scheduled to release its earnings on October 31, 2023. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $7, reflecting a 10.37% decrease from the same quarter last year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $34.27 billion, showing a 27.44% drop compared to the year-ago quarter.Looking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $22.98 per share and revenue of $140.65 billion. These totals would mark changes of -12.16% and -21.84%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Marathon Petroleum should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.Empirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance.

That is because the Nov 17, 2023 $29.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for AES Corporation shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, AES Corporation is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Utility - Electric Power industry that ranks in the Top 26% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimate for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 48 cents per share to 49 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about AES Corporation right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

The legacy automaker agreed to include battery cell workers in its national agreement.Shawn Fain, president of UAW, threatened to shut down GM’s highly profitable Arlington Assembly plant, but the last-minute proposal by the automaker changed the union’s mind.Fain called the proposal a win, but GM declined to comment on it. General Motors said that it aims to reach an agreement that rewards its employees without compromising on the company’s future.The proposal by GM is likely to put pressure on its arch-rival Ford and Stellantis to do the same.The union alleged that the automakers have formed joint ventures with battery manufacturers to cast the union out of the new factories. The joint venture-owned battery plants are not covered by the automakers’ agreements with the union. However, the union wants to protect its members through agreements as the industry transitions to electric vehicles.Amid the UAW strike, Detroit 3 automakers are laying off thousands of workers. Ford recently laid off 70 workers, bringing its total layoff figures to 1,865 since the commencement of the strike.Stellantis has laid off a total of 640 workers, including 520 workers at Trenton, MI, engine plant and 50 workers at an Indiana casting plant, during the same period. Stellantis cited storage constraint as the main reason behind the layoffs.A total of 2,300 GM workers are impacted by the layoff.

The top line is likely to have been aided by a solid recovery in air-travel demand (post the pandemic-led slump). Per our estimate, total passenger revenues are likely to increase 14.3% in third-quarter 2023 from third-quarter 2022 actuals.UAL expects revenues for the September quarter to grow 10-13% year over year. Capacity is anticipated to improve 16% from the year-ago reported figure.Driven by the rosy air-travel-demand scenario, UAL projects quarterly earnings per share in the $3.85-$4.35 band. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.39. Management has lifted its EPS forecast for 2023 and now expects the metric in the range of $11-12 (prior view: $10-$12).United Airlines Holdings Inc Price and EPS SurpriseUnited Airlines Holdings Inc Price and EPS SurpriseUnited Airlines Holdings Inc price-eps-surprise | United Airlines Holdings Inc QuoteOn the flip side, high fuel costs per gallon are likely to have hurt the bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter. The fuel price has come down from the highs witnessed earlier, yet it remains at an elevated level. UAL now expects fuel cost per gallon in the $2.95 -$3.05 band (earlier guidance was in the $2.50 - $2.80 range). Our estimate is currently pegged at 3.01.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for United Airlines this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. This is absolutely not the case here.

UAL’s revenues jumped 17.1% year over year due to upbeat air-travel demand.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks from the broader Zacks Transportation sector that investors may consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on their third-quarter 2023 earnings.Old Dominion Freight Line ODFL has an Earnings ESP of +0.87% and a Zacks Rank #2.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 17, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis airline is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.39 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +20.6%.Revenues are expected to be $14.44 billion, up 12.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 21.99% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for United?For United, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.45%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that United will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that United would post earnings of $3.99 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.03, delivering a surprise of +26.07%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.United doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsDelta Air Lines (DAL), another stock in the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.92 for the quarter ended September 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +27.2%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $14.89 billion, up 6.6% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Delta has been revised 8.4% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, an equal Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Delta will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

232,7d078aef-4ef2-3941-9848-aa88bfe58b16,PNC,2023-10-11,Key Factors to Affect PNC Financial (PNC) in Q3 Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/key-factors-affect-pnc-financial-165100123.html,1696956660,STORY,['PNC'],"[The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. PNC is scheduled to report its third-quarter 2023 earnings before the opening bell on Oct 13. The company’s revenues and earnings are expected to have witnessed year-over-year declines.In the last reported quarter, its earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate on an increase in net interest income (NII), supported by higher rates and loan growth. However, rising expenses and higher provisions were headwinds.Notably, PNC Financial has a decent earnings surprise history. It surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, delivering an earnings surprise of 0.93%, on average.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc Price and EPS Surprise The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc Price and EPS SurpriseThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc price-eps-surprise | The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc Quote PNC’s activities in the to-be-reported quarter were inadequate to win analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings of $3.28 has moved marginally downward in the past week, reflecting the bearish sentiments of analysts. Further, the figure indicates a 15.6% dip from the year-ago reported number.Also, the consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $5.33 billion, suggesting year-over-year fall of 3.9%.  Management expects the top line to be up approximately 1% sequentially.Now, let’s discuss factors likely to have impacted PNC Financial’s third-quarter performance.Loans and NII: The pace of loan growthare likely to have moderated in the quarter under review, as the challenging macroeconomic backdrop and high-interest rates affected consumer spending. Demand for commercial and industrial loans remained muted in July and August, per Fed’s latest data. Moreover, commercial real estate loans declined in July and August from the second-quarter end. Nonetheless, consumer loans were stable in August from the second-quarter 2023 end.Given PNC’s high exposure to total commercial loans (nearly 68% as of Jun 30, 2023), the company is expected to have seen a decline in its lending book during the quarter. Accordingly, management expects average loans to decrease 1% sequentially during the quarter.Story continuesSuch a tumble in lending activities is likely to affect NII in the quarter under review. Further, in July 2023, Fed raised interest rates by 25 basis points to a target of 5.25-5.5%, marking the 11th time FOMC has hiked interest rates in a tightening process that began in March 2022. Interest rate was the highest in around 22 years.A rise in rates is likely to have inflated funding costs. This is expected to have adversely impacted NII to some extent as interest rates continued to remain high.Management projects NII to decrease 3-4% sequentially. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII (on a fully taxable-equivalent or FTE basis) of $3.41 billion indicates a sequential decline of 3.6%. We predict NII on FTE basis of $3.48 billion.Non-Interest Revenues: The high inflation is expected to have increased transactions and spending volumes, thereby supporting PNC’s card fees in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for card and cash management revenues of $707 million suggests a sequential increase of 1.4%.The consensus estimate of $355 million for asset management and brokerage revenues implies a marginal rise sequentially.Merger and acquisition activities continued to be depressed in the third quarter, with total deal value declining from the prior year. High interest rates, increased antitrust scrutiny, fears of a global recession and looming U.S. federal government shutdown are likely to have acted as headwinds for merger and acquisition deals. Thus, the company’s capital markets and advisory revenues are likely to have been negatively impacted. Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same of $227 million indicates 6.6% growth sequentially.In the third quarter, mortgage rates continued to ascend, with the rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage reaching 7.31% in September, the highest level in nearly 23 years. The climb in mortgage rates, which kept home buyers on the sidelines, led to a smaller origination market, both purchase and refinancing, compared with the prior-year quarter.Thus, these factors are expected to have hurt PNC Financial’s residential and commercial mortgage revenues. Nonetheless, improvement in mortgage servicing rights valuation is likely to have offered support. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same of $131 million suggests a rise of 33.7% sequentially.Overall, management envisions fee income to jump 10-11% sequentially. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for non-interest income is pegged at $1.92 billion, suggesting an 8% increase sequentially. Our estimate for the metric is pegged at $1.96 billion.Expenses: Technology investments and general inflationary pressures are likely to have inflated costs, while wage inflation is anticipated to have escalated personnel expenses. Such a rise in expenses is expected to have limited bottom-line growth in the third quarter. Nonetheless, its focus on cost-containment measures is likely to have reduced expenses to some extent, offering support.Management predicts non-interest expenses to be sequentially stable. Our estimate for the metric is pegged at $3.38 billion, indicating a sequential gain of 0.3%.Asset Quality: PNC Financial is expected to have set aside substantial money for potential bad loans, given expectations of a worsening macroeconomic outlook, growing recession risk, slower GDP growth and the likelihood of deteriorating employment conditions. Nonetheless, with credit cost normalizing, modest reserve built during the quarter is expected to have weighed on PNC’s bottom-line growth. Our estimate for provision for credit losses is pegged at $245.6 million for the third quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for non-performing loans of $2.17 billion implies a 13.4% increase sequentially.What the Zacks Model RevealsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for PNC Financial this time around. This is because it has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) — to increase the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for PNC Financial is +1.60%.Zacks Rank: PNC currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookFirst Citizens BancShares, Inc. FCNCA and M&amp;T Bank Corporation MTB are a couple of stocks that you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this season.The Earnings ESP for FCNCA is +3.95% and currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

PNC's support includes a $1 million equity equivalent investment (EQ2) and a $1.5 million line of credit. The financing will be leveraged to address the statewide deficit of over 120,000 housing units needed for individuals and families in low- and moderate-income areas that have historically been undervalued and overlooked.""As a national main street bank, PNC is focused on making a real impact in communities throughout Indiana,"" said Patricia Gamble-Moore, PNC Community Development Banking market manager for Indiana. ""This EQ2 investment enables us to provide low-cost capital solutions to solve for Indiana's affordable housing shortage and reinforces our commitment to work with leading organizations like Intend Indiana to address the housing affordability gap and economic vitality of the communities we serve.""The $1 million EQ2 is PNC Bank's first equity equivalent investment in Indiana created to increase affordable housing options, and the first for Intend. An EQ2 is a deeply subordinated loan product with features that allow it to work like revolving equity and help investors like Intend to support longer-term lending activities of Community Development Financial Institutions. PNC's investment will help accelerate Intend's community development-related initiatives, in particular housing for those experiencing or at risk of experiencing homelessness.""Intend Indiana is incredibly thankful to PNC for making this substantial investment into our organization so we can deliver on our mission of connecting people to opportunity,"" says Steven Meyer, chief executive officer of Intend Indiana. ""PNC's commitment will help expand our ability to make a long-term impact in our communities by providing security and stability for those who need it most.""Story continuesOne of the first projects PNC's investment will help fund is The Passage, a multifamily development supported by Intend's Edge Fund. Edge Fund is a mission-driven community development financial institution (CDFI) that helps increase affordable housing options in Indianapolis by providing mortgages, construction loans and bridge loans for both single and multi-family housing. The Passage will provide 39 affordable housing units for low-income individuals and those with intellectual and developmental disabilities in Indianapolis. Eight units will be set aside for permanent supportive housing units integrated throughout the property.""Market rents and homeownership are often beyond what many individuals and families can afford in Indiana,"" added Gamble-Moore. ""At PNC, we are proud of the work we are doing with local developers and fund investors to increase and preserve the supply of affordable housing.""PNC's investment stems from its $88 billion Community Benefits Plan, which provides loans, investments and other financial support to bolster economic opportunity for low- and moderate-income (LMI) individuals, communities, and people of color over a four-year period that began Jan. 1, 2022. As part of the allotted $88 billion, PNC has committed to provide at least $14.5 billion in community development loans and investments across all markets, including at least $400 million for Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) that help meet the banking and financial service needs of traditionally underserved communities.About Intend Indiana Intend Indiana, Inc.

With consumers becoming increasingly value-conscious, discount retailers are well-positioned to cater to this demand. The industry's resilience, especially during economic uncertainties, is bolstered by the sector's ability to offer cost-effective products.Moreover, the integration of advanced technologies like data analytics and artificial intelligence allows retailers to optimize their operations, personalize customer experiences and enhance overall efficiency, ensuring a competitive edge in the market. Additionally, retailers such as Costco Wholesale Corporation COST, The TJX Companies, Inc. TJX, Target Corporation TGT and Ross Stores, Inc. ROST have been deepening engagements with consumers and adding more compelling products.About the IndustryThe Retail - Discount Stores industry is a significant segment within the retail sector that caters to price-conscious consumers seeking value-for-money products. These stores specialize in offering a wide range of merchandise, including groceries, household items, apparel, electronics, cleaning products, pet supplies and more, at discounted prices compared to traditional retail outlets. Discount stores operate on a low-cost business model, focusing on cost-efficient operations, bulk purchasing, and streamlined supply chains to offer competitive pricing. These stores often carry both national and private-label brands, providing a mix of products to cater to a diverse customer base. The Retail - Discount Stores industry has shown resilience even during economic downturns, as consumers tend to prioritize value-oriented shopping.4 Key Industry Trends to WatchConsumers’ Willingness to Spend: The performance of the industry is closely tied to consumers’ purchasing power. Consumer spending, a key catalyst for the economy, has shown resilience despite a tough economic environment. August marked the fifth consecutive month of gains in retail sales. Retail sales in August rose 0.6% sequentially and 2.5% year over year. The backdrop of healthy employment and wage gains has so far bolstered consumer spending. With the holiday season approaching, retailers are all gearing up to walk the extra mile to capitalize on any potential upswing in demand. According to Mastercard SpendingPulse, U.S. retail sales, excluding automotive, are anticipated to increase 3.7% from a year earlier during the traditional holiday period from Nov 1 to Dec 24.Story continuesConsumers Seek Better Bargains: The strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped industry players draw customers in low-to-middle-income groups who have been seeking both value and convenience, particularly in the face of rising prices. Industry participants have been focusing on creating innovative and compelling products and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities to attract price-sensitive consumers.Digitization Is the Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns, industry participants have been evolving to play dual in-store and online roles. Initiatives, such as building omnichannel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing the supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at the store, are worth mentioning. Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, retailers have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Pressure on Margins to Linger: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. Further, the increasing dominance of e-commerce players has made the retail discount space highly competitive. This has compelled many players to strengthen their digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs. Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation. Nonetheless, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks and adopting effective pricing policies.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #78, which places it in the top 31% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects.

It delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 21.7%.Healthy Growth PotentialThe 2023 Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.45, indicating a 7.5% increase compared with the previous year’s levels. Further, earnings are expected to experience a 6.3% growth in 2024.Estimates NorthboundThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Koppers for 2023 has increased by around 1.1% in the past two months.

Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to be within the range of $250 million to $260 million, up from the previous projection of $250 million and an increase from the $228.1 million reported in the prior year. Adjusted EPS is also expected to be in the range of $4.30-$4.60 per share, compared to the earlier estimate of $4.40, signifying growth from the prior year's $4.14 per share.Story continuesThis positive outlook is supported by various factors, including strong demand for utility poles and wood preservatives in residential and industrial sectors, strategic pricing enhancements in the rail business, and the impressive resilience shown by the Carbon Materials and Chemicals segment in managing unforeseen market disruptions. These factors collectively instill confidence that adjusted EBITDA will exceed the $250 million milestone, aligning with the company's determined path toward its ambitious long-term objective of achieving $300 million in adjusted EBITDA by 2025, reaffirming its commitment to sustained success.In the second quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.26, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.08 and increasing from 97 cents in the prior year. Total revenues reached $577.2 million, up 15% year over year and exceeding the consensus estimate of $531 million.

With consumers becoming increasingly value-conscious, discount retailers are well-positioned to cater to this demand. The industry's resilience, especially during economic uncertainties, is bolstered by the sector's ability to offer cost-effective products.Moreover, the integration of advanced technologies like data analytics and artificial intelligence allows retailers to optimize their operations, personalize customer experiences and enhance overall efficiency, ensuring a competitive edge in the market. Additionally, retailers such as Costco Wholesale Corporation COST, The TJX Companies, Inc. TJX, Target Corporation TGT and Ross Stores, Inc. ROST have been deepening engagements with consumers and adding more compelling products.About the IndustryThe Retail - Discount Stores industry is a significant segment within the retail sector that caters to price-conscious consumers seeking value-for-money products. These stores specialize in offering a wide range of merchandise, including groceries, household items, apparel, electronics, cleaning products, pet supplies and more, at discounted prices compared to traditional retail outlets. Discount stores operate on a low-cost business model, focusing on cost-efficient operations, bulk purchasing, and streamlined supply chains to offer competitive pricing. These stores often carry both national and private-label brands, providing a mix of products to cater to a diverse customer base. The Retail - Discount Stores industry has shown resilience even during economic downturns, as consumers tend to prioritize value-oriented shopping.4 Key Industry Trends to WatchConsumers’ Willingness to Spend: The performance of the industry is closely tied to consumers’ purchasing power. Consumer spending, a key catalyst for the economy, has shown resilience despite a tough economic environment. August marked the fifth consecutive month of gains in retail sales. Retail sales in August rose 0.6% sequentially and 2.5% year over year. The backdrop of healthy employment and wage gains has so far bolstered consumer spending. With the holiday season approaching, retailers are all gearing up to walk the extra mile to capitalize on any potential upswing in demand. According to Mastercard SpendingPulse, U.S. retail sales, excluding automotive, are anticipated to increase 3.7% from a year earlier during the traditional holiday period from Nov 1 to Dec 24.Story continuesConsumers Seek Better Bargains: The strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped industry players draw customers in low-to-middle-income groups who have been seeking both value and convenience, particularly in the face of rising prices. Industry participants have been focusing on creating innovative and compelling products and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities to attract price-sensitive consumers.Digitization Is the Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns, industry participants have been evolving to play dual in-store and online roles. Initiatives, such as building omnichannel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing the supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at the store, are worth mentioning. Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, retailers have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.Pressure on Margins to Linger: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. Further, the increasing dominance of e-commerce players has made the retail discount space highly competitive. This has compelled many players to strengthen their digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs. Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. Of late, the industry participants have been dealing with product cost inflation. Nonetheless, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges. These include streamlining operational structures, optimizing supply networks and adopting effective pricing policies.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Retail – Discount Stores industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #78, which places it in the top 31% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

To skip our detailed analysis of the US markets today, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Growth Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.Is Now The Right Time To Invest?Equity investors in American stocks today might be wondering when the right time to invest in US stocks will come around. With market volatility and economic conditions across the world making most investors and businesses cautious about major decisions involving larger sums of money, this line of thinking is becoming more commonplace than some might have expected. At this moment, one thing investors can do to ensure they make sound investment decisions is to remain apprised of not only current events in the US markets but also of expert opinions on how to approach the market at present.On October 10, Paul Tudor Jones, the founder and Chief Investment Officer of Tudor Investment, joined CNBC's 'Squawk Box' to give his take on current market trends and more. Here are some of his comments:""The United States is probably in its weakest fiscal position since, certainly, World War II, with debt-to-GDP at a 122%. So, it's a really tough time for, I think, the moral voice of the world.""Geopolitical Tensions As A Barrier To InvestmentJones sees the current geopolitical environment of the world as ""the most threatening"" and ""challenging"" environment he has ever seen, with the recent developments in the Israel-Palestine crisis and the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian crisis. Here's what he had to say on these issues, alongside how they and US economic conditions are impacting equity investors in the US:""It's a really challenging time to wanna be an equity investor in US stocks right now, it's really hard, because again you've got the geopolitical uncertainty, which we, I think, have come to live with to a certain extent. Equally as much of a problem is the fiscal situation that we're facing in the United States, which is gonna require a completely different political mentality.""Story continuesAll in all, Jones highlighted the existing barriers and challenges that may hinder equity investors in the US markets from taking part in the investment cycles. However, investors can still remain active in the markets by carefully picking out reliable stocks with high growth potential, especially those stocks that have lived up to their growth potential in the past.

(NYSE:NOW) in its July 2023 investor letter:“US-based software company ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) delivered another impressive quarterly result that came in ahead of analysts expectations. Subscription revenues grew 25% year-on-year in constant currency terms to $2.1 billion and operating margins came in at 23.4%. Despite ongoing variability in the macro backdrop, ServiceNow continues to benefit from spend prioritisation within the IT tech stack as vendors look to consolidate back-office apps onto an integrated platform. The company’s operational metrics held firm, with remaining performance obligations growing 24% year-on-year to $14.2 billion and renewal rates ticking up to 99%. As we have mentioned before, the company’s renewal rates are noteworthy as not only are they best-in-class but they are also remarkably consistent, typically in the range of 97% to 99%. They speak to the mission critical nature of the platform and are a key driver of long term annuity value.Investors were also excited to hear management speak to the burgeoning artificial intelligence (AI) opportunity. Things are moving fast and the company plans to release new premium offerings of their workflow products – across IT, customer service and human resources – towards the back end of 2023 that will have new Generative AI capabilities embedded into them. Management also mentioned that they anticipate these new offerings could deliver a “minimum” 60%-plus list price uplift relative to its current Pro versions as they provide meaningful productivity improvements for end users. Whilst it’s still early days, ServiceNow appears well placed to capitalise on the Generative-AI opportunity and we believe it could be a meaningful driver for the company’s next phase of growth.”13.

(NASDAQ:ADBE). Their total stake value was $6.1 billion.Here's what Harding Loevner said about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Although the market initially feared that Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) would lose out to Al image-generating programs Dall-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, the design-software giant has since released its own generative Al model called Firefly. One feature of Firefly is that it can help designers generate ideas and create and manipulate images more quickly in Photoshop or Illustrator that can then be processed by other Adobe products for further development, fostering a seamless workflow. There’s more work involved when trying to manipulate images created by outside tools. Also, because Firefly is trained on Adobe’s vast inventory of stock images and other licensed content, it can generate professional-quality, commercially viable results, further setting it apart from generic models that are often trained on copyrighted content that isn’t properly licensed. These are just two examples of how Al enhances the Adobe suite, which should allow the company to raise subscription prices and upsell users.”11. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMD) shares on August 3 by Cody Acree at Benchmark.This is what Artisan Partners said about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Among our top contributors were Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NU Holdings and Netflix. AMD’s data center CPUs are used in the cloud service provider (CSP) servers. In addition to the broader secular tailwind from cloud adoption, the company has a performance and pricing advantage over Intel, which we believe will enable it to continue capturing market share. However, the recent stock price rally was due to growing excitement around the company’s AI exposure. It will launch its new MI300 graphics processing unit (GPU) chip later this year to compete against the dominant market leader NVIDIA. Similar to its approach that won market share from Intel within the CPU market, AMD’s product will aim to provide similar performance at a more attractive price. AMD is already working with Microsoft and Meta, while Amazon publicly stated that it is evaluating AMD’s inferencing chips. Using assumptions around the total GPU market size, potential market share gains and price points, our research indicates this could be a $20 billion opportunity for AMD. That would nearly double its revenue. While the company has not historically missed many deadlines, there is execution risk as it works to manufacture and distribute these complex chips at scale, which, combined with an elevated valuation after the stock’s strong performance run, led us to trim the position.”10.

(NYSE:CRM), a company we’ve owned since 2019, recently added ChatGPT-like capabilities onto its existing Al module, Einstein, to support its internal sales efforts and customer-facing software. For example, Einstein GPT can help generate marketing emails tailored to specific clients by using Salesforce’s customer database and past email correspondence to learn the most effective approach for each client. Einstein GPT is also different from off-the-shelf LLMS in three important ways: It keeps personal identifiable information private and secure, compared with external tools that retain anything a user enters. It employs the latest data in Salesforce’s system, as opposed to the sometimes-stale public data that train generic models. And generative Al capabilities can be integrated with other Salesforce offerings; the company has already introduced Slack GPT and Tableau GPT, Al-equipped versions of its workplace collaboration and analytics tools.”8.

250,c7ae14a7-43a7-3a5c-8ee9-feaae3eeacf7,APH,2023-10-11,Calculating The Fair Value Of Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-amphenol-corporation-140039166.html,1696946439,STORY,['APH'],"[Key InsightsAmphenol's estimated fair value is US$69.48 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$83.11 suggests Amphenol is potentially trading close to its fair valueOur fair value estimate is 26% lower than Amphenol's analyst price target of US$94.34Does the October share price for Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Amphenol Is Amphenol Fairly Valued?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.93bUS$2.16bUS$2.23bUS$2.37bUS$2.47bUS$2.57bUS$2.65bUS$2.73bUS$2.81bUS$2.88bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 4.51%Est @ 3.81%Est @ 3.31%Est @ 2.96%Est @ 2.72%Est @ 2.55% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.7% US$1.8kUS$1.9kUS$1.8kUS$1.8kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$16bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.9b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.7%– 2.2%) = US$53bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$53b÷ ( 1 + 7.7%)10= US$25bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$41b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$83.1, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Amphenol as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.116. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for AmphenolStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Electronic industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Electronic market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS), Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;UPS shares have lagged the broader market as well as rival FedEx (FDX) this year (-11.4% vs. +14.3% for the S&amp;P 500 &amp; +47.7% for FDX). The company now expects revenues in 2023 to be around $93 billion. The new forecast is not only below the previous outlook of $97 billion but also much lower than 2022's actual figure.Management cited costs associated with the labor deal, inked with 330,000 unionized workers, and declining package volumes induced by the labor negotiations as reasons for lowering the outlook. The five-year deal with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters for better pay and working conditions is worth less than $30 billion. It is likely to keep labor cost at high levels.However, UPS is looking to drive growth in this uncertain scenario by improving efficiencies. Efforts to reward its shareholders also bode well for UPS. The company's strong free cash flow generating ability is encouraging and supports its shareholder-friendly activities.(You can read the full research report on United Parcel here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Booking Holdings have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the year-to-date period (+49.3% vs. +33.2%). The company is benefiting from a substantial improvement in booking trends driven by growing demand for travel. This, in, turn, is helping lower cancellation rates.Booking Holdings expects room night growth to increase at a low double-digit rate on a year-on-year basis in the third quarter. Solid growth in domestic bookings is driving growth. The company is experiencing solid momentum in international regions, which is a positive. Strong growth in rental cars, airline ticket units and booked room nights is another positive.Solid momentum across the agency, merchant, advertising and other businesses is a tailwind. Further, strengthening alternative accommodation business and flight capabilities are major positives. However, intensifying competition is a headwind.Lockheed Martin shares have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+9.0% vs. -0.1%). The company keeps on securing big defense contracts from the Pentagon and other U.S. allies, which in turn add up to solid backlog count. Its strong backlog boosts long-term growth.Lockheed remains the largest U.S. defense contractor with a steady order flow from its leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs. The solid U.S. defense budgetary provisions should boost its business. Lockheed boasts strength in the international defense market.Yet, America and Turkey's tiff as a result of the latter accepting Russian products may hurt its component supply from Turkey. It is facing performance issues concerning some of its products, which may hurt its results. An uncertainty regarding the possible sanction by China on Lockheed might impact the latter.(You can read the full research report on Lockheed Martin here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include CME Group Inc.

254,e10a389f-43f9-3e18-9d65-bb4dca3de71f,MAR,2023-10-11,Defense stocks surge amid Israel-Hamas conflict,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/defense-stocks-surge-amid-israel-140356081.html,1696946636,VIDEO,"['LMT', 'NOC']","[Shares of companies in the defense sector have surged amidst the continued conflict in the Middle East, adding almost $20 billion in market cap. Notable gains include Northrop Grumman (NOC) which has risen by over 8% in five days and Lockheed Martin (LMT) which is up 9% in the same time. Yahoo Finance hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith break down the numbers for defense sector staples.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Major defense stocks added around $20 billion in market cap yesterday, following the events over the last three days. Though Northrop Grumman and Lockheed among those still trending higher, these types of moves are not uncommon during times of war. Now a similar surge happened when Russia invaded Ukraine.And you're looking at some of the movement that we're seeing today. And Lockheed Martin, up just about 1% as well as Boeing RTX and Northrop also once again moving to the upside. Now these gains coming on like we just had a strong day for the stocks. Yesterday we saw a big jump. Northrop coming off its biggest daily gain since we've seen-- that we've seen since 2020. So just about three years there.But the thought process is just in terms of the amount of spending, what's going to be allocated towards some of these defense companies given the conflict and the risk that this war could widen over in the Middle East. That's why we're seeing the reaction play out in shares today.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. And from a technical perspective too. It'd be interesting to look at this for anyone who's trying to figure out if some of the spikes that take place after there are international conflicts or events of international conflict, where some of the defensive names continue to cyclically in this instance here, get some type of attention from investors.Time and time again there has been a little bit of a bottom-- a new bottom that gets set in here, for Lockheed Martin at least as of right now since. And I kind of point back to early 2022, when we were thinking about the initiation of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and what took place there. Shares jumped by about 25% in that instance. It's held on since then to the majority of that move since the beginning of 2022, until after that.And then additionally here, you think about the move higher that we've seen just over the past couple of days here at the beginning of October. Shares up by about 10%, Lockheed Martin, and then we had a few of the other key and core names to track.]"
255,ea25e46e-3985-3277-9e6d-55f30548fdf6,MAR,2023-10-11,Lockheed Martin (LMT) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q3 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lockheed-martin-lmt-expected-beat-140014766.html,1696946414,STORY,['LMT'],"[The market expects Lockheed Martin (LMT) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 17, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis aerospace and defense company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $6.66 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -3.1%.Revenues are expected to be $16.66 billion, up 0.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.01% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Lockheed?For Lockheed, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.15%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Lockheed will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Lockheed would post earnings of $6.43 per share when it actually produced earnings of $6.73, delivering a surprise of +4.67%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Lockheed appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

256,fb56ae73-9192-309a-a026-a42cd50c222f,MAR,2023-10-11,Lockheed (LMT) Wins Deal to Support Unmanned Undersea Vehicle,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lockheed-lmt-wins-deal-support-135900789.html,1696946340,STORY,['MAR'],"[Lockheed Martin Corp.’s LMT business segment, Rotary and Mission Systems, recently clinched a modification contract to provide engineering support for Extra Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (UUV). The award has been offered by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.Valued at $11 million, the contract is expected to be completed by September 2024. Work related to this deal will be performed in Riviera Beach, FL.What’s Supporting Lockheed?The company has more than four decades of experience in developing unmanned and robotic systems for sea.Notably, LMT’s Marlin autonomous underwater vehicle system offers a range of civilian and military customers and a quick and safe way to conduct subsea surveys and inspections. The 10-feet-long submersible is highly maneuverable and can operate in tight spaces, sprint up to four knots and cruise for up to 18 hours. Marlin can perform up to four times faster inspections, delivering higher fidelity information in hours versus days.Moreover, in 2017, Lockheed was been selected to support the growth of the U.S. Navy’s family of unmanned undersea systems, under a design phase contract valued at $43.2 million for Orca, the U.S. Navy’s Extra Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (XLUUV).The proven expertise of LMT in the UUV space is likely to have led to a steady inflow of contracts for the company, like the latest one. This, in turn, should bolster its revenue generation prospects from the UUV product line.Growth ProspectusThe recent tiff between Ukraine and Russia has led other nations to strengthen their defense landscape to deter any war-like situation. In this context, it is imperative to mention that UUVs are noted for their ability to carry out dangerous maritime operations, such as mine countermeasure missions and harbor patrol. Therefore, as investments in undersea warfare capabilities have increased manifold in recent times, so has the demand for state-of-the-art UUVs.Looking ahead, with technological advancement, nations are more rapidly adopting artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to increase the autonomy of UUVs. As a result, hefty investments in the development and acquisition of autonomous marine systems can be expected in coming days, thereby boosting the UUV market. To this end, the Fortune Business Insights firm projects the global unmanned underwater vehicles market to witness a CAGR of 13.5% during 2023-2030.Story continuesSuch growth trends should boost Lockheed along with other defense primes like Boeing BA, General Dynamics GD and Leidos Holdings LDOS that have a strong presence in the unmanned underwater vehicle market.Boeing’s Echo Voyager is a fully autonomous XLUUV class UUV that can be used for a variety of missions, which were previously impossible due to traditional UUV limitations.Boeing’s long-term earnings growth rate is 4%. BA’s shares appreciated 42.9% in the past year.General Dynamics’ Bluefin SandShark is a one-person-portable, low-cost autonomous unmanned underwater vehicle designed to leverage today’s miniaturized sensors and emerge as the development platform for the next generation.General Dynamics boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.2%. GD’s shares rallied 5.8% in the past year.Leidos is a leading provider of maritime autonomy and sensor integration, with an extensive experience in naval architecture, hydrodynamics, survivability and modularity that assists the company in designing and developing the future generation of unmanned autonomous vessels. Its unmanned autonomous vessels are being designed to support numerous alternate naval missions, in addition to the as-designed anti-submarine warfare mission.Leidos’ long-term earnings growth rate is 7.9%. LDOS’ shares rose 2.7% in the past year.Price MovementShares of LMT rallied 6.2% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 1.7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankLockheed currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The move by the congressional news startup is meant to generate more revenue by making its content more available to those who aren’t D.C. insiders.D.C.-based media companies have seen their valuations rise in recent years. In fact, Axios sold for $525 million in August 2022.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIf you look closely, there’s something to cheer about if you work for a media company. All is not doom and gloom.With regards to the print media, there are several publicly traded companies I could have chosen, but they wouldn’t be suitable investments. Here are three that are.The New York Times (NYT)The headquarters of the New York Times (NYT) at night.Source: Osugi / Shutterstock.comThe New York Times (NYSE:NYT) is having an excellent year in the market, up nearly 24%, more than double the S&amp;P 500.I subscribe to the Times. While I joined to help me write better about the markets, a lot of the non-business stuff is very interesting and informative. That said, I’m not picking up the paper’s print version, but I would if I were in New York, if only for nostalgia’s sake.I also subscribed to The Athletic before the NYT acquired it last year for $550 million. Sadly, as part of the acquisition, the Times closed its sports section, moving sports cover over to The Athletic. While that stings, it’s a financial decision that makes total sense. The duplication was unnecessary.The company reported Q2 2023 results in August. They were reasonably good, with revenues 6.3% higher to $590.9 million, with an adjusted operating profit of $92.2 million, 21% higher year-over-year.Its total subscribers were 9.88 million at the end of the second quarter, up from 9.17 million a year ago, with digital-only accounting for 93%. Its average revenue per user (ARPU) was $9.15 during Q2 2023, 11 cents higher than Q1 2023 and 32 cents more than a year ago.Story continuesThe bundled subscription is working for the Times. Down from its all-time high of around $55, it’s got room to move higher.News Corporation (NWSA)News Corp. (NWSA_ Building frontSource: ShutterstockNews Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA) is another media company whose products I subscribe to. I currently have subscriptions for both Barron’s and MarketWatch. I refuse to subscribe to the Wall Street Journal because of its shameless editorials in support of former President Donald Trump. But that’s okay; I’ve also got Bloomberg to keep me informed.And, yes, I realize News Corp owns both Barron’s and MarketWatch, but they don’t veer off the business path too often.In September, Rupert Murdoch announced he was stepping down as leader of both News Corp and Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA), leaving the CEO chores to his son Lachlan, who’s a much younger 52. That makes sense.Once Murdoch Sr. dies, the real fireworks will start as the kids inherit their father’s voting shares. Rupert holds 40% of News’ and 43% of Fox’s voting shares. They will control both businesses.News Corp’s business isn’t nearly as strong as the Times.In fiscal 2023, its sales fell 5% to $9.88 billion, with a 15% decline in segment earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), to $1.42 billion.However, its Dow Jones unit, which operates the Wall Street Journal, etc., had an excellent year, growing 7% in revenue and 14% in EBITDA. Across the board, Dow Jones’ subscriptions were significantly higher in the fourth quarter. It finished the year with 5.24 million total subscribers, up from 4.90 million a year earlier.Business is good.Nexstar Media Group (NXST)Nexstar Media Group logo on a phone screenSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comI picked Nexstar Media Group (NASDAQ:NXST) primarily because of its focus on local news. However, it’s technically not a print media company using digital means to reach 106 million estimated consumers.Nexstar’s digital operations are spread across 125 websites and 239 mobile apps. Comscore ranks Nexstar’s digital assets as a top 10 U.S. digital news and information property. It does that aided by its 200 owned or partner local broadcast stations in 116 U.S. markets, reaching 68% of households.Now, it could be ready to land a massive fish by acquiring ABC from Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS). The two companies are currently in early talks about a possible sale. However, given complications, such as ESPN’s relationship with ABC and the fact that Nexstar’s TV stations are primarily Fox, NBC or CBS affiliates, things need to be worked out before any actual numbers are discussed.Estimates put the sale of ABC and its eight TV stations at $4 billion, or about 7x EBITDA. Nexstar currently has a market cap of just $4.7 billion. So, any deal would be difficult to swing for the Texas-based media business.Nonetheless, its focus on local media will continue to resonate with Americans.

260,82a8005f-03c2-344c-b3d6-b854db24b3bb,KLAC,2023-10-11,A Look At The Fair Value Of KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-kla-corporation-110037547.html,1697022037,STORY,['KLAC'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for KLA is US$435 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$474 suggests KLA is potentially trading close to its fair valueOur fair value estimate is 18% lower than KLA's analyst price target of US$533Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for KLA What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$3.53bUS$3.12bUS$2.88bUS$3.71bUS$4.07bUS$4.33bUS$4.56bUS$4.75bUS$4.92bUS$5.08bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 6.49%Est @ 5.19%Est @ 4.28%Est @ 3.64%Est @ 3.19% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.8% US$3.2kUS$2.6kUS$2.2kUS$2.7kUS$2.7kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$26bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.1b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (8.8%– 2.2%) = US$78bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$78b÷ ( 1 + 8.8%)10= US$34bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$59b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$474, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at KLA as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.325. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for KLAStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year is below its 5-year average.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

One such stock that merits attention is Stanley Black &amp; Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK). The stock, which is currently priced at 80.9, recorded a gain of 2.51% in a day and a 3-month decrease of 11.73%. The stock's fair valuation is $193.35, as indicated by its GF Value.Understanding the GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with SWK. Click here to check it out. SWK 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of SWKThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors:Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at.GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.Future estimates of the business performance.The GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Is Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapStanley Black &amp; Decker: A Potential Value Trap?However, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Stanley Black &amp; Decker should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 1.72. These indicators suggest that Stanley Black &amp; Decker, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Story continuesUnderstanding the Altman Z-ScoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Company Snapshot: Stanley Black &amp; DeckerStanley Black &amp; Decker is a leading manufacturer of hand and power tools. The company operates in two reportable segments, namely Tools and Outdoor and Industrial. The Tools and Outdoor segment is comprised of the Power Tools Group (PTG), Hand Tools, Accessories and Storage (HTAS), and Outdoor Power Equipment (Outdoor) businesses. Geographically, it derives a majority of its revenue from the United States.Is Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapStanley Black &amp; Decker's Low Altman Z-Score: A Breakdown of Key DriversA dissection of Stanley Black &amp; Decker's Altman Z-score reveals Stanley Black &amp; Decker's financial health may be weak, suggesting possible financial distress:The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio provides insights into a company's capability to reinvest its profits or manage debt. Evaluating Stanley Black &amp; Decker's historical data, 2021: 0.35; 2022: 0.30; 2023: 0.36, we observe a recent decline following an initial increase in this ratio. This downward movement indicates Stanley Black &amp; Decker's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt. Consequently, it exerts a negative impact on its Z-Score.The EBIT to Total Assets ratio serves as a crucial barometer of a company's operational effectiveness, correlating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to total assets. An analysis of Stanley Black &amp; Decker's EBIT to Total Assets ratio from historical data (2021: 0.09; 2022: 0.03; 2023: 0.00) indicates a descending trend. This reduction suggests that Stanley Black &amp; Decker might not be utilizing its assets to their full potential to generate operational profits, which could be negatively affecting the company's overall Z-score.ConclusionDespite its seemingly undervalued price, Stanley Black &amp; Decker's low Altman Z-Score and declining financial ratios suggest that the company might be a potential value trap. Investors should therefore exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence before making an investment decision.GuruFocus Premium members can find stocks with high Altman Z-Score using the following Screener: Walter Schloss Screen .This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

We also reviewed Asness’ AQR Capital Management’s assets under management, performance and stock picks. You can skip our detailed discussion of AQR Capital Management and go straight to AQR Capital Management's Top 5 Stock Picks.Following record-breaking returns in 2022, AQR Capital Management's performance in 2023 has been exceptional, with several of its strategies outperforming the broader market indices. The investment philosophy of its founder, billionaire Cliff Asness, has been the driving force behind this success. Asness, who achieved great success for the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund in the 90s, is famous for his great work on developing models and algorithms that can explore market patterns. His investment strategy combines traditional and unconventional techniques while diversifying investments in equity, alternative, and multi-asset funds. As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, AQR's AUM was around $120 billion.Year to date, AQR Long-Short Equity Fund has generated a return of approximately 19%. Meanwhile, AQR Sustainable Long-Short Equity Carbon Aware Fund, AQR Style Premia Alternative Fund, AQR Equity Market Neutral Fund, and AQR Alternative Risk Premia Fund have posted year-to-date returns of 17%, 19%, 17.77%, and 15%, respectively. In addition, AQR Large Cap Multi-Style Fund and AQR Global Equity Fund from the equity segment have posted year-to-date returns of 14% and 13%, respectively. It's worth noting that none of the equity funds have generated negative returns so far in 2023. Furthermore, the Multi-Asset fund has posted a year-to-date return of over 6%.According to AQR Capital Management’s LinkedIn account, Cliff Asness is also a managing principal and chief investment officer. He is an active researcher and has authored numerous financial articles for several publications, including The Journal of Portfolio Management and Financial Analysts Journal. Cliff Asness has also authored several books. Cliff Asness’ books that gained popularity include ""The Allocator's Edge: A Modern Guide to Alternative Investments and the Future of Diversification,"" ""Expected Returns: An Investor's Guide to Harvesting Market Rewards,"" and ""Hedge Fund Management.""Story continuesCliff Asness is frequently featured in television and podcasts, where he shares his insights on financial issues. In a Bloomberg podcast with Barry Ritholtz, Cliff Asness discussed quant value investing, offering a comprehensive overview of how he manages risks and rewards. In another Cliff Asness podcast, he expressed concern about buoyant stocks, warned of trouble in the commercial real estate market and also predicted a potential financial crisis. Here is what the billionaire investor said:""My biggest concern is stocks and bonds seem to be taking a very, very different view. Bonds are pricing in multiple, severe cuts over the next year to two years. That is a forecast for a recession, and not a mild one. Equities are whistling past the graveyard. If inflation stays sticky, or it comes down because we enter a non-trivial recession, it's equities that I think are a scary place. They're not priced very consistently with bonds, and we're going to find out who's right in the next year.""Cliff Asness' firm began with 10 employees in 1998 and has since grown to a team of over 700, with 65% of staff holding advanced degrees.

Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD),Value of AQR Capital Management’s 13F Position: $324 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 56AQR Capital Management increased its stake in Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) during the second quarter. It appears that the firm was attempting to capitalize on the dip in the share price of Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD). Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) shares are down about 12% so far in 2023. Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) was in 56 hedge fund portfolios at the end of the second quarter, according to Insider Monkey data.

(NASDAQ:GILD):“Lastly, shares of biopharmaceutical company, Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), declined in the quarter on investor concerns over positioning of their drug, Trodelvy, amidst a crowded competitive landscape. Nevertheless, we maintain a positive outlook on the company, which is bolstered by the resilience of its core virology commercial business and the increasingly compelling oncology portfolio. We believe Gilead’s strategic transformation into a more diversified biopharmaceutical entity, expanding its focus from virology to oncology, provides a strong foundation for its future growth.”13. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) Value of AQR Capital Management’s 13F Position: $331 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 113AQR Capital sold 21% of its stake in Adobe Inc.

The number of hedge fund positions increased to 113 at the end of the second quarter, up from 100 the previous quarter. In the second quarter investor letter, Harding Loevner, an asset management company, expressed confidence in Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE). Here is what the firm stated about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE):“Although the market initially feared that Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) would lose out to Al image-generating programs Dall-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, the design-software giant has since released its own generative Al model called Firefly. One feature of Firefly is that it can help designers generate ideas and create and manipulate images more quickly in Photoshop or Illustrator that can then be processed by other Adobe products for further development, fostering a seamless workflow. There’s more work involved when trying to manipulate images created by outside tools. Also, because Firefly is trained on Adobe’s vast inventory of stock images and other licensed content, it can generate professional-quality, commercially viable results, further setting it apart from generic models that are often trained on copyrighted content that isn’t properly licensed. These are just two examples of how Al enhances the Adobe suite, which should allow the company to raise subscription prices and upsell users.”12. Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)Value of AQR Capital Management’s 13F Position: $332 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 79Cliff Asness’ investment firm increased its stake in Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

While we are not dismissive of these potential risks and headwinds, we believe the market has become overly pessimistic. This created an attractive opportunity to invest in what we view as a durable, competitively advantaged and well-managed enterprise at a high-single-digit multiple of earnings.”10.

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft were also positive contributors, up 55.19% and 42.66%, respectively. All three stocks benefited from a renewed interest in growth stocks by investors in the first half of the year.Amazon had an impressive first half of the year as well with growth out of its retail segment but slightly slower growth in its cloud business. Customers optimized workloads for existing capacity they were already paying for rather than adding incremental capacity in the current environment. We remain very excited about the opportunity for the company to reduce the labor needs of its retail segment through the use of technology and automation in the future.”7. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Value of AQR Capital Management’s 13F Position: $483 million Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 178NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), is a major contributor to AQR Capital Management's performance. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares are up 215% year to date, thanks to strong demand for its AI-powered chips.

The number of hedge fund positions in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) increased to 178 in the second quarter, up from 132 in the previous quarter.In the second quarter investor letter, Harding Loevner, an asset management company, highlighted reasons why shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) soared. Here is what the firm stated about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA):NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the biggest beneficiary this year in terms of its stock run and projected revenue gains. More companies- including, perhaps, some not yet in existence-will certainly join the ranks over time.In the meantime, NVIDIA has emerged as the unrivaled global leader in providing the technologies at the center of the Al arms race. NVIDIA’s competitive advantage is the result of investments that began two decades ago, when it recognized an early opportunity to repurpose its video-game graphics chips for the heavy-load computing done in scientific research. This led management to expand the GPU business. It also spent years and significant resources developing a free software platform that’s exclusive to its chips called CUDA that allows developers to easily program its GPUs for a variety of computationally intensive applications. Researchers then began using both NVIDIA’s chips and CUDA to train the human-brain-inspired neural networks that power Al models.Now, due to an explosion of demand related to generative Al and LLMs from across its customer base, NVIDIA projects that data-center revenue for its fiscal second quarter ending in July will surge to US$11 billion. Not only is that more than double last quarter’s total, but the forecast also shattered the average analyst estimate that called for about US$7 billion. Taking advantage of the stock’s meteoric rise, we reduced our holding (it has risen tenfold since we first purchased in 2018)…” (Click here to read the full text)6. Meta Platforms, Inc.

During the quarter, the company reported earnings that showed a return to growth and healthy user engagement metrics. Most importantly, profitability appears to have stabilized and is poised to improve as significant cost reduction actions implemented over the past six months begin to have an impact. Separate from fundamental performance, there is excitement over AI’s potential to help the company’s business. While Meta’s technology prowess and massively scaled media platform certainly position the company to take advantage of AI, we believe it’s far too early to estimate any discrete tangible benefits. Overall, we view AI as one of several drivers that will contribute to Meta’s continued growth.”Like Walmart Inc. (NASDAQ:WMT), Amazon.com, Inc.

However, the parameter as a measure of continuous oxygen delivery has not received the FDA’s clearance and is not currently available in the United States.Notably, the use of LiDCO has been shown to reduce postoperative complications, costs and mortalities at 30 and 180 days after surgery in clinical studies.The latest regulatory clearance is expected to significantly strengthen Masimo’s patient monitoring business on a global scale.Significance of the ApprovalThe LiDCO BIC module is designed to connect to multi-patient monitoring platforms, like the Masimo Root Patient Monitoring and Connectivity Hub, to provide advanced hemodynamic monitoring. With this solution, clinicians are expected to be able to easily add LiDCO hemodynamic monitoring, with its unique PulseCO algorithm, to their Root patient monitoring hubs.Following the receipt of the EU MDR CE Mark, there will likely be a solution that can enable hemodynamic monitoring alongside other supported parameters without having a dedicated hemodynamic monitoring box.Per an expert familiar with the LiDCO module, the introduction of the module is expected to deliver dynamic hemodynamic monitoring with a known documented positive impact on patient outcomes.Management believes that bringing LiDCO’s beat-to-beat advanced hemodynamic monitoring to Masimo Root will likely open up the possibility of providing a more complete, continuous picture of cardiac output (CO) and oxygen delivery. Currently, clinicians receive only half of the information as hemodynamic monitors can provide continuous analysis of blood pressure information but rely on intermittent data from other monitors for oxygenation.Per management, using both Masimo’s non-invasive rainbow SET Pulse CO-Oximetry parameters and LiDCO’s PulseCO algorithm, clinicians are now expected to be able to view a continuous and simultaneous display of all the components that make up a patient’s oxygen delivery.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global patient monitoring market is anticipated to grow from $43,808.29 million in 2023 to $62,571.34 million by 2028 at a CAGR of approximately 7.4%. Factors like the rising burden of chronic diseases due to lifestyle changes, growth in the elderly population, increasing preference for home and remote monitoring and the ease of use of portable devices are expected to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest regulatory clearance is likely to provide a significant boost to Masimo’s business.Notable DevelopmentsIn August, Masimo announced the full U.S. market release of the Stork smart home baby monitoring system.The same month, Masimo announced the findings of a prospective, randomized study in which researchers assessed the use of non-invasive, continuous Masimo pleth variability index, as part of goal-directed fluid therapy, to guide intraoperative fluid administration during gastrointestinal surgery on elderly patients by comparing it to conventional fluid therapy. The findings were published in Perioperative Medicine.Also, in August, Masimo reported its second-quarter 2023 results, wherein it registered an expansion of its installed base. Management confirmed that the company gained new hospital customers during the quarter at a record level. The expansion of both margins in the quarter was also recorded.Price PerformanceShares of Masimo have lost 35.3% in the past year against the industry’s 2.4% rise and the S&amp;P 500’s 21.2% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Masimo carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc.

SRDX has been gaining from its solid prospects in the thrombectomy business over the past few months. The optimism led by a solid third-quarter fiscal 2023 performance and its consistent efforts to boost research and development (R&amp;D) are expected to contribute further. Yet, regulatory headwinds and data security threats persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has gained 3.5% against the 3.3% decline of the industry. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 21.2% growth in the said time frame.The renowned medical device and in-vitro diagnostics technology provider has a market capitalization of $445.1 million. Surmodics projects 76.8% growth for fiscal 2023, expecting to maintain its strong performance. SRDX’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average earnings surprise being 71.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Consistent Efforts to Boost R&amp;D: Surmodics’ solid efforts to improve its R&amp;D stature have been a key growth driver, which raises our optimism. The company’s whole product solutions pipeline and sirolimus-based below-the-knee drug-coated balloon program deserve mention. Surmodics has been making progress using its internally developed .014 balloon platform.For the first nine months of fiscal 2023, R&amp;D expenses reflected continued investment in medical device product development, including in Surmodics’ Pounce thrombectomy and Sublime radial access product platforms and costs associated with its SurVeil drug-coated balloon (DCB).Thrombectomy Prospects Bright: Surmodics’ aim to leverage its proprietary Pounce thrombectomy platform technology to develop products raises our optimism. On the third quarter of fiscal 2023 earnings call in August, Surmodics’ management stated that sales of its Pounce Arterial Thrombectomy and Sublime Radial products were an important contributor to the 38% medical device business product sales growth achieved in the quarter.Story continuesIn June, Surmodics received the FDA’s approval for the SurVeil DCB.Strong Q3 Results: Surmodics registered a solid uptick in the overall top and bottom lines in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The company recorded robust revenues from its Medical Device segment and primary sources. During the quarter, Surmodics witnessed strong contributions from sales of its Pounce and Sublime products, indicating their continued solid demand.DownsidesRegulatory Headwinds: Surmodics’ facilities and procedures are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to determine compliance with the latter’s requirements. On account of non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations, the FDA could ban such medical devices. Any adverse regulatory action can potentially have a negative impact on Surmodics' business practices and operations.Data Security Threats: Surmodics collects and stores sensitive data, including its proprietary business information, on its networks. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to its operations and business strategy. Despite Surmodics’ security measures, its information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers, resulting from employee error or other disruptions.Estimate TrendSurmodics is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for fiscal 2023.

276,f7d262a1-35ec-3fd1-b2fb-410eef9dcb2f,MCK,2023-10-11,4 Stocks to Buy From the Prospering Dental Supplies Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-buy-prospering-dental-135000045.html,1696945800,STORY,"['ALGN', 'WST', 'HSIC', 'MCK', '^GSPC']","[The Zacks Medical - Dental Supplies industry in the Medical sector has shown a positive trend in 2023 as product sales grew again. The rebound in sales of dental products and services is mainly due to the easing of pandemic-related restrictions in the past few years. Also, the major players in the industry have been taking initiatives to improve their margins post the pandemic, including cost cutting and price improvement. The dental market is also driven by the high rate of oral diseases, an aging population, the increasing demand for cosmetic dentistry and technological innovations. It is expected to keep growing as the dental industry adapts and develops new treatments and procedures to meet the changing needs of patients. Going by the Fortune Business Insight data, the global dental industry is expected to reach $63.93 billion by 2029 at a CAGR of 7.4% (from the 2022 level).However, the current rising interest rate regime will continue to increase the cost of capital. Other macro headwinds like supply-chain constraints are hurting the margins of the industry players. These are likely to continue in 2023, subduing earnings growth. Industry participants like McKesson MCK, West Pharmaceutical Services WST, Align Technology ALGN and Henry Schein HSIC have shown encouraging trends amid uncertain times and are likely to gain from the existing market opportunities.Industry DescriptionThe global dental industry consists of companies that design, develop, make and market dental products, such as consumables, laboratory products and specialty items. Some of these companies also offer software and systems for practice management, patient education and office administration. Dental stocks have been attracting attention amid recovery in sales after the weakness faced amid the pandemic-induced disruptions. The market has been recovering and maintaining its position. Notably, dental care is being provided safely, following the advice and recommendations of the American Dental Association and CDC. Thanks to the rebound seen by the companies in this space, patient volume has been increasing steadily despite the COVID-19 uncertainty.Story continuesMajor Trends Shaping the Future of the Medical Dental Supplies IndustryIncreasing Burden of Oral Diseases and an Aging Population: The dental equipment market in the United States is being driven by the country's growing geriatric population. This group is a significant demographic in dental surgeries and other dental practices. Per the United States Census Bureau, the country had 54.1 million people aged 65 and above in 2020. Old age increases the likelihood of dental issues such as cavities, root and coronal caries, and periodontitis. Consequently, the rising number of seniors in the country is a key contributor to the growth of the market.Demand for Esthetic and Cosmetic Dentistry: The dental equipment market in the United States is growing due to the demand for esthetic and cosmetic dentistry. People, influenced by Internet strategies, current trends and media coverage, want to improve their dental appearance. Cosmetic dentistry, which started in the United States, has led to many innovations in the field. Patients in the country are looking for procedures that can enhance their smile, as well as restore dental function. This trend is boosting the growth of the U.S. dental equipment market.Technological Advancements: Dental procedures are changing with new technologies like digital imaging, laser dentistry and CAD/CAM systems. These technologies make treatments more accurate and effective, leading to better results. Also, new materials have been developed that are stronger, more compatible and attractive, giving dental practitioners more options for supplies.Zacks Industry RankThe Zacks Medical Dental Supplies industry falls within the broader Zacks Medical sector.It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #56, which places it in the top 22% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few dental supply stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry PerformanceThe industry has outperformed its sector as well as the S&amp;P 500 Composite in the past year.Stocks in this industry have collectively gained 22.5% compared with the Zacks Medical sector’s growth of 2.2%. The S&amp;P 500 has gained 13.6% in the same time frame.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing medical stocks, the industry is currently trading at 18.3X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 18.4X and the sector’s 21.3X.Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 20.97X and as low as 14.9X, with the median being 18.6X, as the charts show.Price-to-Earnings Forward Twelve Months (F12M)Price-to-Earnings Forward Twelve Months (F12M)4 Promising Dental Supply StocksMcKesson is a healthcare services and information technology company, McKesson operates through two segments. The Distribution Solutions segment distributes branded and generic pharmaceutical drugs, along with other healthcare-related products worldwide. The segment also provides practice management, technology, clinical support and business solutions to community-based oncology and other specialty practices. It also provides specialty pharmaceutical solutions for pharmaceutical manufacturers. The Technology Solutions segment provides enterprise-wide clinical, patient care, financial, supply-chain and strategic management software solutions.Strong growth in the U.S. markets, especially for pharmaceutical and specialty solutions, drove McKesson’s top line by 10.9% year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems, and increased contributions from its generics program aided the top-line improvement. However, inflationary pressure continues to hurt margins. The company expects adjusted earnings per share (EPS) in the range of $26.55-$27.35 for fiscal 2024.For this San Francisco, CA-based company, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 revenues indicates growth of 10.9% from the year-ago reported figure, while the same for earnings implies an increase of 4.4%. McKesson has a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 8.10%. Presently, the company carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Price and Consensus: MCKWest Pharmaceutical Services is a leading global manufacturer with respect to the design and production of technologically advanced, high-quality, integrated containment and delivery systems for injectable drugs and healthcare products. It operates under two segments — Proprietary Products and Contract-Manufactured Products.

The Contract-Manufactured Products segment acts as a fully-integrated business, which remains committed toward the design, manufacture and automated assembly of complex devices.Continued strong demand for WST’s high-value products fueled its top-line growth in the second quarter of 2023. The Pharma and Generics market units demonstrated robust organic growth during the quarter. However, declining sales related to COVID-19 vaccines continue to hurt the Biologics market unit.West Pharmaceutical Services expects EPS in the $7.65-$7.80 range for 2023.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 revenues indicates growth of 3.3% from the year-ago reported figure, while the same for earnings implies a decline of 8.5%. WST has a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 12.47%. It carries a Zacks Rank of 2 at present.Price and Consensus: WSTAlign Technology manufactures and markets a system of clear aligner therapy, intra-oral scanners and CAD/CAM digital services used in dentistry, orthodontics and dental records storage.

Revenues from the Clear Aligner segment reflected higher volumes, increased Average Selling Prices and higher non-case revenues. Meanwhile, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against nearly every other major currency hampered Align Technology’s revenues in the international markets. The company expects total revenue growth of 11-13.5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. ALGN anticipates its adjusted operating margin to be slightly up on a sequential basis as it continues to prioritize investments in R&amp;D and go-to-market activities.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 earnings and revenues indicates year-over-year growth of 6.6% and 13.1%, respectively. Currently, the company holds a Zacks Rank of 2.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

277,d2b98e60-f6ee-3500-9773-db51561af52c,APD,2023-10-11,10 Best Natural Resources ETFs,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-natural-resources-etfs-172450529.html,1696958690,STORY,"['LIN', 'XLB', 'APD', 'SCCO', 'DHR', 'ALB', 'PNR']","[In this article, we discuss 10 best natural resources ETFs to buy. If you want to skip our discussion on the natural resources market, head directly to 5 Best Natural Resources ETFs To Buy. As the world accelerates its efforts to innovate and transform itself in technology and lifestyle, our dependence on natural resources only grows. The natural resources sector is made up of a number of industries involved in the research, mining, extraction, commercialization, and utilization of naturally occurring materials. These resources can be classified into three main categories – renewable resources, non-renewable resources, and environmental services and conservation. This article discusses ETFs involved across all these categories. According to PwC, the revenue for the top 40 mining companies amounted to roughly $711 billion in 2022. Coal remained the largest contributor, with over 28% of total revenues being attributed to coal mining. With the inflation rising and the industry focused on a net-zero emissions policy, the demand for minerals continues to rise. To this effect, roughly 66% of the top 40 mergers &amp; acquisitions in 2022 have been critical-mineral deals. Since 2003, the market capitalization for the top 40 miners has tripled from $400 billion to $1.2 trillion in 2022. Over the past few years, the world has rightfully shifted its focus on generating clean energy. This rapid focus has caused governments to legislate to secure mining supply, while introducing fund initiatives that help stabilize mineral supplies. The Global Mining Leader for PwC Australia, Mr. Paul Bendall, stated: “Mining is playing a fundamental role in underpinning the global transition to clean energy, but the path ahead is rocky. A net zero world requires more mined critical minerals, not less, and the flow of industry dealmaking clearly reflects this. But the increasing rise of geopolitics as an influencing factor in global mining may complicate operations in an increasingly complex world with new actors.”Story continuesDespite the governmental efforts, the inflationary pressure and other global supply chain issues have certainly impacted the natural resources industry as a whole. As per PwC’s annual CEO survey, over 41% of respondents believe that their business would not be profitable in a decade, if these conditions were to continue. The Inflation Reduction Act committed an additional $40 billion dollars for the generation of clean energy. With the government’s injection of public funds in the sector, the industry remains concerned about generating an adequate level of return on these investments. According to the International Energy Agency, the total investment in clean energy is forecasted to grow to $1.7 trillion during this year. While the annual investment in clean energy was expected to increase by 24% from 2021 to 2023, fossil fuel investment was estimated to increase by 15%. The demand for clean energy can be mainly attributed to the renewables and electric vehicles sector. Moreover, residential demand for solar energy is at a record high. The United States managed to raise its solar generation capacity to 5.7 gigawatts (GW), while the wind capacity grew to 7.5 GW, in the first 8 months of 2022. Furthermore, the private investment in renewables crossed $10 billion in the past year, as investors were encouraged by 10-year tax credits. This article discusses some of the best natural resources ETFs that provide investors with access to market leaders like Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE:SCCO), Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR), and Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB).Best Natural Resources ETFsPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur Methodology We used an ETF screener and filtered out the best performing natural resources ETFs based on 5-year share price performance.

To skip our detailed analysis of the US markets today, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Growth Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.Is Now The Right Time To Invest?Equity investors in American stocks today might be wondering when the right time to invest in US stocks will come around. With market volatility and economic conditions across the world making most investors and businesses cautious about major decisions involving larger sums of money, this line of thinking is becoming more commonplace than some might have expected. At this moment, one thing investors can do to ensure they make sound investment decisions is to remain apprised of not only current events in the US markets but also of expert opinions on how to approach the market at present.On October 10, Paul Tudor Jones, the founder and Chief Investment Officer of Tudor Investment, joined CNBC's 'Squawk Box' to give his take on current market trends and more. Here are some of his comments:""The United States is probably in its weakest fiscal position since, certainly, World War II, with debt-to-GDP at a 122%. So, it's a really tough time for, I think, the moral voice of the world.""Geopolitical Tensions As A Barrier To InvestmentJones sees the current geopolitical environment of the world as ""the most threatening"" and ""challenging"" environment he has ever seen, with the recent developments in the Israel-Palestine crisis and the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian crisis. Here's what he had to say on these issues, alongside how they and US economic conditions are impacting equity investors in the US:""It's a really challenging time to wanna be an equity investor in US stocks right now, it's really hard, because again you've got the geopolitical uncertainty, which we, I think, have come to live with to a certain extent. Equally as much of a problem is the fiscal situation that we're facing in the United States, which is gonna require a completely different political mentality.""Story continuesAll in all, Jones highlighted the existing barriers and challenges that may hinder equity investors in the US markets from taking part in the investment cycles. However, investors can still remain active in the markets by carefully picking out reliable stocks with high growth potential, especially those stocks that have lived up to their growth potential in the past. These include several companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Subscription revenues grew 25% year-on-year in constant currency terms to $2.1 billion and operating margins came in at 23.4%. Despite ongoing variability in the macro backdrop, ServiceNow continues to benefit from spend prioritisation within the IT tech stack as vendors look to consolidate back-office apps onto an integrated platform. The company’s operational metrics held firm, with remaining performance obligations growing 24% year-on-year to $14.2 billion and renewal rates ticking up to 99%.

They speak to the mission critical nature of the platform and are a key driver of long term annuity value.Investors were also excited to hear management speak to the burgeoning artificial intelligence (AI) opportunity. Things are moving fast and the company plans to release new premium offerings of their workflow products – across IT, customer service and human resources – towards the back end of 2023 that will have new Generative AI capabilities embedded into them. Management also mentioned that they anticipate these new offerings could deliver a “minimum” 60%-plus list price uplift relative to its current Pro versions as they provide meaningful productivity improvements for end users. Whilst it’s still early days, ServiceNow appears well placed to capitalise on the Generative-AI opportunity and we believe it could be a meaningful driver for the company’s next phase of growth.”13. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 103Patrick Donnelly at Citigroup reiterated a Buy rating and a $625 price target on shares of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

(NASDAQ:ADBE). Their total stake value was $6.1 billion.Here's what Harding Loevner said about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Although the market initially feared that Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) would lose out to Al image-generating programs Dall-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, the design-software giant has since released its own generative Al model called Firefly. One feature of Firefly is that it can help designers generate ideas and create and manipulate images more quickly in Photoshop or Illustrator that can then be processed by other Adobe products for further development, fostering a seamless workflow. There’s more work involved when trying to manipulate images created by outside tools. Also, because Firefly is trained on Adobe’s vast inventory of stock images and other licensed content, it can generate professional-quality, commercially viable results, further setting it apart from generic models that are often trained on copyrighted content that isn’t properly licensed. These are just two examples of how Al enhances the Adobe suite, which should allow the company to raise subscription prices and upsell users.”11. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor company that offers x86 microprocessors and graphics processing units (GPUs).

(NASDAQ:AMD) shares on August 3 by Cody Acree at Benchmark.This is what Artisan Partners said about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Among our top contributors were Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NU Holdings and Netflix. AMD’s data center CPUs are used in the cloud service provider (CSP) servers. In addition to the broader secular tailwind from cloud adoption, the company has a performance and pricing advantage over Intel, which we believe will enable it to continue capturing market share. However, the recent stock price rally was due to growing excitement around the company’s AI exposure. It will launch its new MI300 graphics processing unit (GPU) chip later this year to compete against the dominant market leader NVIDIA. Similar to its approach that won market share from Intel within the CPU market, AMD’s product will aim to provide similar performance at a more attractive price. AMD is already working with Microsoft and Meta, while Amazon publicly stated that it is evaluating AMD’s inferencing chips. Using assumptions around the total GPU market size, potential market share gains and price points, our research indicates this could be a $20 billion opportunity for AMD. That would nearly double its revenue. While the company has not historically missed many deadlines, there is execution risk as it works to manufacture and distribute these complex chips at scale, which, combined with an elevated valuation after the stock’s strong performance run, led us to trim the position.”10. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 114Seaport Global analyst David Joyce initiated coverage on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares with a Buy rating and a $482 price target on October 6.A total of 114 hedge funds were long Netflix, Inc.

(NYSE:CRM), a company we’ve owned since 2019, recently added ChatGPT-like capabilities onto its existing Al module, Einstein, to support its internal sales efforts and customer-facing software. For example, Einstein GPT can help generate marketing emails tailored to specific clients by using Salesforce’s customer database and past email correspondence to learn the most effective approach for each client. Einstein GPT is also different from off-the-shelf LLMS in three important ways: It keeps personal identifiable information private and secure, compared with external tools that retain anything a user enters. It employs the latest data in Salesforce’s system, as opposed to the sometimes-stale public data that train generic models. And generative Al capabilities can be integrated with other Salesforce offerings; the company has already introduced Slack GPT and Tableau GPT, Al-equipped versions of its workplace collaboration and analytics tools.”8.

One of the key takeaways from the poll was respondents wanted businesses to treat employees more fairly, providing them with adequate wages and healthcare, in addition to other benefits.Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian, Josh Schafer, and Alexandra Canal break down the poll's findings, relating the data to brands that have come under fire for their social and political statements.For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.Video TranscriptPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: It turns out people don't want their brands to sort of be taking on big political sort of stances. A new poll by Gallup and Bentley University finds that 48% of-- sorry. 41% of Americans say businesses in general should take stances on current events down from 48% last year, with declines across the board, different ethnic groups, things like that.It turns out that some minority groups and some marginalized groups do like their brands to take stances on political issues. But it's not really the case for most people. What they do want, though, they want companies to make positive impacts on employees with fair wages, health care, and bridging the pay gap? So--ALEXANDRA CANAL: That's stuck out to me.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah. Yes.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Especially because we are in this moment where we're seeing labor strikes across the board in Hollywood, the auto strike, which I know you're covering closely. Fair wages, treat your employees well. At the end of the day, you're a business. Operate as efficiently as you can as a business. And that was a very big takeaway for me.JOSH SCHAFER: I mean, this just reaffirmed what we've seen with Bud Light. Right? Yeah, this just was the Bud Light story in a poll, which is-- It's definitely interesting to see and sort of adds to the narrative. But it is exactly what played out with Bud Light. You had a group of people, I think, that were drinking Bud Light, and would have just preferred not necessarily that they took the opposite stance of what Bud Light did, but just that they didn't participate in the conversation.Story continuesBud Light, I think that's part of the lesson that came out of that was not necessarily, have an opinion, or don't have an opinion, or use certain people, or don't use certain people. Just they wanted Bud Light to not participate in that, and they would have kept drinking it.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Right. And then conversely, look at Disney and DeSantis. DeSantis is the one that sort of came out for Disney. And actually, you know what? People actually agree more with what Disney was saying than what Florida and DeSantis wanted. And that sort of blew up in his face. Right? And now they're enmired in some sort of lawsuit. The-- Florida wants to drop it. Disney says, no, we're going to go to court on this. We're going to take you to court on this.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah. But it's very split. I report on Disney all the time. I get a lot of angry emails to me talking about how Disney is woke, and has to completely change the mission. So as a company, we're in a space and time in our country where it's very divided. And as a brand, you want to appeal to everyone. And when you can't do that, it's that push and pull of when and how you wade into certain political issues.]"

The terms of the new agreement will run from Sept. 25, 2023, through May 1, 2026.""Through solidarity and determination, we have ratified a contract with meaningful gains and protections for writers in every sector of our combined membership,” WGA West president Meredith Stiehm said in a statement. “Together we were able to accomplish what many said was impossible only six months ago.""The guild was successful in achieving many of its demands, which included increased regulations surrounding the use of artificial intelligence, minimum staffing requirements, viewership-based streaming bonuses, more data transparency, higher health and pension contribution rates, a boost to streaming residuals, and more.The guild was also able to achieve a 5% wage increase this year, which will be followed by a 4% jump in 2024 and a 3.5% boost in 2025.The Hollywood writers strike lasted nearly 150 days.

Both the companies will operate under a transition services agreement for 90 days. Post that period, Lumen plans to discontinue its CDN services. Customers will be able to work with Akamai for all their CDN requirements.Akamai is a leading provider of CDN services as its platform handles approximately 2 trillion web interactions on a daily basis. Its solutions help customers to address the challenges of bandwidth constraints and Internet traffic along with reducing the need for additional hardware to manage traffic loads.LUMN continues to simplify its business operations and the sale of CDN contacts is part of that process. The company remains focused on its Quantum Fiber business as well as “cloudifying” network.Lumen had 877,000 Quantum Fiber subscribers at the end of the second quarter while Quantum Fiber penetration was 26%. Management anticipates adding subscribers at a faster rate in the second half of 2023 driven by increasing investments in quantum marketing.

Management uses non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes, to measure executive compensation and to evaluate Akamai's financial performance. The non-GAAP financial measure used in this release is non-GAAP net income per diluted share.Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure reflects Akamai's ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business, as it facilitates comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of our peer companies. Management also believes that this non-GAAP financial measure enables investors to evaluate Akamai's operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management. The non-GAAP net income per diluted share metric may exclude expenses and gains that may be unusual in nature, infrequent or not reflective of Akamai's ongoing operating results.This non-GAAP financial measure does not replace the presentation of Akamai's GAAP financial measures and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, Akamai's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. Akamai has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in its financial reporting and investor presentations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. This reconciliation captioned ""Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" can be found on the Investor Relations section of Akamai's website.Akamai provides forward-looking statements in the form of guidance and other expressions of expectations about future performance. This guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis and cannot be reconciled to the closest GAAP measure without unreasonable effort because of the unpredictability of the amounts and timing of events affecting the items we exclude from non-GAAP measures. For example, stock-based compensation is unpredictable for Akamai's performance-based awards, which can fluctuate significantly based on current expectations of future achievement of performance-based targets. Amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs are all impacted by the timing and size of potential future actions, which are difficult to predict. In addition, from time to time, Akamai excludes certain items that occur infrequently, which are also inherently difficult to predict and estimate. It is also difficult to predict the tax effect of the items we exclude and to estimate certain discrete tax items, such as the resolution of tax audits or changes to tax laws. As such, the costs that are being excluded from non-GAAP guidance are difficult to predict and a reconciliation or a range of results could lead to disclosure that would be imprecise or potentially misleading. Material changes to any one of the exclusions could have a significant effect on our guidance and future GAAP results.Akamai's definition of the non-GAAP measure used in this press release is outlined below:Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, or EPS – Non-GAAP net income divided by weighted average diluted common shares outstanding. Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding are adjusted in non-GAAP per share calculations for the shares that would be delivered to Akamai pursuant to the note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the issuances of $1,265 million of convertible senior notes due 2029 and $1,150 million of convertible senior notes due 2027 and 2025, respectively. Under GAAP, shares delivered under hedge transactions are not considered offsetting shares in the fully-diluted share calculation until they are delivered. However, the Company would receive a benefit from the note hedge transactions and would not allow the dilution to occur, so management believes that adjusting for this benefit provides a meaningful view of operating performance. With respect to the convertible senior notes due in each of 2029, 2027 and 2025, unless Akamai's weighted average stock price is greater than $126.31, $116.18 and $95.10, respectively, the initial conversion price, there will be no difference between GAAP and non-GAAP diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.Non-GAAP net income – GAAP net income adjusted for the following tax-affected items: amortization of acquired intangible assets; stock-based compensation; amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation; acquisition-related costs; restructuring charges; amortization of debt issuance costs; amortization of capitalized interest expense; certain gains and losses on investments; income and losses from equity method investment; and other non-recurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time.The non-GAAP adjustments, and Akamai's basis for excluding them from non-GAAP financial measures, are outlined below:Amortization of acquired intangible assets – Akamai has incurred amortization of intangible assets, included in its GAAP financial statements, related to various acquisitions Akamai has made. The amount of an acquisition's purchase price allocated to intangible assets and term of its related amortization can vary significantly and is unique to each acquisition; therefore, Akamai excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets from its non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with a consistent basis for comparing pre- and post-acquisition operating results.Stock-based compensation and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation – Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation paid to Akamai's employees, the grant date fair value varies based on the stock price at the time of grant, varying valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. This makes the comparison of Akamai's current financial results to previous and future periods difficult to interpret; therefore, Akamai believes it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation from its non-GAAP financial measures in order to highlight the performance of Akamai's core business and to be consistent with the way many investors evaluate its performance and compare its operating results to peer companies.Acquisition-related costs – Acquisition-related costs include transaction fees, advisory fees, due diligence costs and other direct costs associated with strategic activities, as well as certain additional compensation costs payable to employees acquired from the Linode acquisition if employed for a certain period of time. The additional compensation cost was initiated by and determined by the seller, and is in addition to normal levels of compensation, including retention programs, offered by Akamai. Acquisition-related costs are impacted by the timing and size of the acquisitions, and Akamai excludes acquisition-related costs from its non-GAAP financial measures to provide a useful comparison of operating results to prior periods and to peer companies because such amounts vary significantly based on the magnitude of the acquisition transactions and do not reflect Akamai's core operations.Restructuring charge – Akamai has incurred restructuring charges from programs that have significantly changed either the scope of the business undertaken by the Company or the manner in which that business is conducted. These charges include severance and related expenses for workforce reductions, impairments of long-lived assets that will no longer be used in operations (including right-of-use assets, other facility-related property and equipment and internal-use software) and termination fees for any contracts canceled as part of these programs. Akamai excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating its continuing business performance as such items vary significantly based on the magnitude of the restructuring action and do not reflect expected future operating expenses. In addition, these charges do not necessarily provide meaningful insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of its business.Amortization of debt issuance costs and amortization of capitalized interest expense – In August 2023, Akamai issued $1,265 million of convertible senior notes due 2029 with a coupon interest rate of 1.125%. In August 2019, Akamai issued $1,150 million of convertible senior notes due 2027 with a coupon interest rate of 0.375%. In May 2018, Akamai issued $1,150 million of convertible senior notes due 2025 with a coupon interest rate of 0.125%. The issuance costs of the convertible senior notes are amortized to interest expense and are excluded from Akamai's non-GAAP results because management believes the non-cash amortization expense is not representative of ongoing operating performance.Gains and losses on investments – Akamai has recorded gains and losses from the disposition, changes to fair value and impairment of certain investments. Akamai believes excluding these amounts from its non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as the types of events giving rise to these gains and losses are not representative of Akamai's core business operations and ongoing operating performanceIncome and losses from equity method investment – Akamai records income or losses on its share of earnings and losses from its equity method investment. Akamai excludes such income and losses because it does not have direct control over the operations of the investment and the related income and losses are not representative of its core business operations.Income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments and certain discrete tax items – The non-GAAP adjustments described above are reported on a pre-tax basis. The income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments is the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP income tax expense. Non-GAAP income tax expense is computed on non-GAAP pre-tax income (GAAP pre-tax income adjusted for non-GAAP adjustments) and excludes certain discrete tax items (such as recording or releasing of valuation allowances), if any. Akamai believes that applying the non-GAAP adjustments and their related income tax effect allows Akamai to highlight income attributable to its core operations.Akamai Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform ActThis release contains statements that are not statements of historical fact and constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, but not limited to, statements about expected future financial performance, expectations, plans and prospects of Akamai.

The drop adds to Tuesday’s 0.5% decline in the US crude benchmark.“Going into the new trading day, moving below $82.35 would increase the bearish bias with the next support (being) at the low (of) last week, at $81.56,” markets’ analyst Greg Michalowski said in a posting on the ForexLive forum.London-traded Brent crude for the most-active December contract settled down $1.83, or 2.1%, at $86.48 after an intraday bottom of $85.23. The global crude benchmark finished the previous session down 0.6%.The market had been on weak footing since Tuesday on signs it may have run up too much, too fast without proof that the counterstrikes between Israeli and Palestine forces — ignited by Saturday’s initial attacks carried out by Palestine militant group Hamas — will materially impact oil shipped from the region.While producer group OPEC+ had been quick to assure that its output cuts would continue — with Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman making that pledge on Sunday itself and Russian President Vladimir Putin reinforcing it on Wednesday — traders remained unconvinced of the need to send crude prices any higher.Saudis assure full cargoes required by North Asia Their resolve was strengthened after Reuters reported that state oil firm Saudi Aramco (TADAWUL:2222) told at least four refiners in North Asia that it would supply them with the full contractual volumes nominated for November.Story continuesThat seemed to challenge the notion that Saudi priority was about keeping the market tight, not assuring that supplies were generously available as needed.“The party line on this is that supply and demand for Saudi oil is stable despite the high prices now, given that Saudi OSP itself has been raised,” John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital, said, referring to the kingdom’s official selling price for its Arab Light crude.“What the market sees instead is Saudi oil readily available to anyone outside of the US who wants it. All the kingdom wants are higher OSPs. In the real market where oil is bought and sold, no one talks of export cuts or market balancing, not the Saudis especially, because if they don’t provide their customers with full cargoes, there’ll be Russian and even US supplies to fulfill that.”Market participants are also on the lookout for US weekly oil inventory data, due after market settlement from the API, or the American Petroleum Institute.The API will release at approximately 16:30 ET (21:30 GMT) a snapshot of closing balances on US crude, gasoline and distillates for the week ended Oct. 6. The numbers serve as a precursor to official inventory data on the same due from the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday.For last week, analysts tracked by Investing.com expect the EIA to report a crude stockpile drop of 0.37 million barrels, versus the 2.224-million barrel reduction reported during the week to Sept. 29.On the gasoline inventory front, the consensus is for a draw of 1.5M barrels over the 6.481M-barrel jump in the previous week. Automotive fuel gasoline is the No. 1 U.S. fuel product.With distillate stockpiles, the expectation is for a drop of 1.5M barrels versus the prior week’s drop of 1.269M. Distillates are refined into heating oil, diesel for trucks, buses, trains and ships and fuel for jets.Related ArticlesOil down over 3% in 2 days, shredding ‘war premium’ as Saudis assure supplyUS home heating bills seen flat to lower this winter -EIAUS natgas output and demand to hit record highs in 2023 -EIA]"

It is worth considering Colgate-Palmolive (CL), which belongs to the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry.When looking at the last two reports, this consumer products maker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 3.48%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, Colgate-Palmolive was expected to post earnings of $0.75 per share, but it reported $0.77 per share instead, representing a surprise of 2.67%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.70 per share, while it actually produced $0.73 per share, a surprise of 4.29%.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Colgate-Palmolive. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Colgate-Palmolive has an Earnings ESP of +0.20% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Despite these figures, the company's Earnings Per Share (EPS) stands at 1.25. This raises the question: is the stock modestly undervalued? To answer this, we need to delve into a thorough valuation analysis. Read on to uncover the intrinsic value of Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR).A Brief Introduction to Juniper NetworksWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with JNPR. Click here to check it out. JNPR 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of JNPRJuniper Networks Inc is a pioneer in the technology industry, specializing in high-performance network products and services. The company's offerings include routing, switching, Wi-Fi, network security, AI-enabled enterprise networking operations (AIOps), and software-defined networking (SDN) technologies. Juniper also provides a variety of services, including maintenance and support, professional services, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), and education and training programs. With a stock price of $26.15 and a GF Value of $33.96, it seems the company's stock could be modestly undervalued.Decoding Juniper Networks (JNPR)'s Valuation: A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market WorthUnderstanding the GF Value of Juniper NetworksThe GF Value is a unique valuation model that estimates a stock's intrinsic value based on historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates. According to this model, if the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if the stock price is significantly below the GF Value Line, it is undervalued and its future return will likely be higher. Based on this model, Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR), with a market cap of $8.40 billion, appears to be modestly undervalued.As Juniper Networks is relatively undervalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Story continuesDecoding Juniper Networks (JNPR)'s Valuation: A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market WorthLink: These companies may deliever higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial Strength of Juniper NetworksBefore investing in a company, it's crucial to assess its financial strength. Companies with poor financial strength pose a higher risk of permanent loss. A good way to understand a company's financial strength is by looking at its cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage. Juniper Networks has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.73, which is worse than 63.1% of the companies in the Hardware industry. However, the overall financial strength of Juniper Networks is 7 out of 10, indicating fair financial health.Decoding Juniper Networks (JNPR)'s Valuation: A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market WorthProfitability and Growth of Juniper NetworksCompanies that have been consistently profitable over the long term offer less risk for investors. Juniper Networks has been profitable 9 out of the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $5.70 billion and an Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $1.25. Its operating margin is 11.24%, which ranks better than 79.09% of the companies in the Hardware industry. Overall, the profitability of Juniper Networks is ranked 7 out of 10, indicating fair profitability.Growth is a critical factor in the valuation of a company. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of Juniper Networks is 8%, which ranks better than 60.43% of the companies in the Hardware industry. However, the 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 6.4%, which ranks worse than 58.6% of the companies in the Hardware industry.ROIC vs WACC of Juniper NetworksComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted cost of capital (WACC) is another way to evaluate its profitability. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, Juniper Networks's ROIC was 7.44, while its WACC came in at 9.16.Decoding Juniper Networks (JNPR)'s Valuation: A Comprehensive Analysis of Its Market WorthConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) appears to be modestly undervalued. The company's financial condition is fair, and its profitability is fair. Its growth ranks worse than 58.6% of the companies in the Hardware industry.

The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other information about the fund. Contact your financial professional or visit pgiminvestments.com for a prospectus and summary prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.Past performance is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results.Investing involves risk. Some investments have more risk than others. The investment return and principal value will fluctuate, and investors’ shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. Asset allocation and diversification do not assure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets. There is no guarantee a Fund’s objectives will be achieved. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund’s respective prospectus. TIPS may experience greater losses than other fixed income securities with similar durations. Unique risks associated with real estate and commodities may cause these investments to react differently to market conditions than traditional investments. Commodities may be speculative and more volatile than investments in more traditional equity and debt securities.The target date is the approximate year in which investors plan to retire. The funds are designed for investors who plan to gradually withdraw assets from the fund over a moderate time period following retirement. Each fund invests in underlying funds that provide exposure to fixed income, equity and nontraditional asset classes. The asset allocation of the target date funds will become more conservative as the target date approaches and for 10 years after the target date by lessening the equity exposure and increasing the exposure in fixed income investments. The principal value of an investment in a target date fund is not guaranteed at any time, including the target date. There is no guarantee that the fund will provide adequate income through retirement.A target date fund should not be selected solely based on age or retirement date. Before investing, participants should carefully consider the fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses, as well as their age, anticipated retirement date, risk tolerance, other investments owned, and planned withdrawals.The stated asset allocation may be subject to change. It is possible to lose money in a target date fund, including losses near and following retirement. These risks may be increased to the extent investors begin to make withdrawals from the fund significantly before the target date. Investments in the funds are not deposits or obligations of any bank and are not insured or guaranteed by any governmental agency or instrumentality. For investors close to or in retirement, the fund’s equity exposure may result in investment volatility that could reduce an investor’s available retirement assets when they are needed. For investors farther from retirement, there is a risk that a fund may invest too much in investments designed to ensure capital conservation and/or current income, which may prevent the investor from meeting his/her retirement goals.© 2023 Prudential Financial, Inc. and its related entities.

Launched in September 2023, the Oracle Database@Azure is a new joint offering from Oracle Corporation ORCL and Microsoft Corporation MSFT.Notably, Oracle partnered with Microsoft last month to deliver Oracle database services running on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (“OCI”) in Microsoft Azure data centers with Oracle Database@Azure. With this collaboration, Oracle has now co-located a portion of its infrastructure in the Azure cloud.On Monday, Amdocs stated that the launch of Oracle Database@Azure will now provide telecom service providers with the option to migrate their Amdocs classic applications to Azure or OCI, based on their need or choice.

The company ended the third quarter of fiscal 2023 with a 12-month backlog of $4.14 billion, up $30 million sequentially and $190 million year over year.Currently, Amdocs' growth momentum is anticipated to continue due to its initiatives aimed at aiding digital, media, and network and cloud transformation of its clients. Our estimate for Amdocs’ top line indicates a CAGR of 7.2% over the next three fiscal years.However, the company is highly susceptible to foreign currency exchange rate risks. It expects foreign exchange fluctuations to continue affecting its top-line performance in the near term.Additionally, Amdocs’ near-term prospects might be hurt by softening IT spending. Rising interest rates and inflationary pressures are hurting consumer spending. Meanwhile, enterprises are postponing their large IT spending plans due to a weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues.Story continuesOn its third-quarter fiscal 2023 conference call, the company pointed out that current macroeconomic uncertainty has started weighing on customers’ spending decisions, which is presenting some headwinds to revenue growth.Amdocs' shares have underperformed the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry in the year-to-date (YTD) period.

Never miss another market-moving headline.Rivian upped to Buy at UBS after long fallUBS upgraded EV maker Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) to Buy from Neutral, although with a slightly lower price target of $24 (from the prior $26), as reported in real time on InvestingPro.The analysts say they see an ""improved set-up"" for the stock after a 20% plunge from last week on a $1.5 billion green convertible note issue. They say that, with that capital raise out of the way, ""the market can refocus on improving fundamentals.""They also believe the company won't have further need for a capital raise until the end of 2025.Shares were jumping 4.8% to $19.68 in recent trading.EA upgraded to Buy at BofA on 'unwarranted' discountBofA upgraded Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) to Buy from Neutral, bumping its price target by $5 to $150.The analysts said that after a tough period for the company, the balance of risk again looks appealing because of a five-year trough in relative valuation, as well as early stats suggesting that the ""EA SPORTS FC"" rebranding (from the prior FIFA) may result in upside to current Street estimates and guidance.They also believe ""FY25 and out year estimates could see a string of upward revisions as EA benefits from above trend growth in the PC/Console game market in CY24 and beyond.""Shares were recently adding 3% to $128.35.AutoZone started with Outperform at TD CowenTD Cowen initiated coverage on AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) with an Outperform rating and a price target of $2,975.00.""We are constructive on AZO’s catalysts which should support strong revenue growth,"" wrote the analyst, adding that they project revenue rising at a compound annual growth rate of 7.7% between FY23-FY27, ""which is +140bps above trends in the decade prior to the pandemic.""Story continuesThe analysts expect that growth to be driven by the rebound of their commercial ""do-it-for-me"" (DIFM) business; stable +1-2% comparable-store sales for its ""do-it-yourself"" (DIY) business; a lift from accelerating international openings; and the ongoing expansion of their so-called mega hubs (facilities that are a mix of retail and distribution and support nearby locations)TD Cowen is also bullish on initiatives to improve delivery speed, ""which we think will be a major long-term unlock,"" the analysts wrote.Shares were lately up 0.6% to $2,581.36.EXACT Sciences gets Overweight rating at PiperEXACT Sciences (NASDAQ:EXAS) shares were up more than 3% Tuesday after Piper Sandler upgraded the early-stage-cancer-detection company to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $90, some 40% higher than Monday's close.Piper highlighted the robust year-over-year growth of Cologuard, the company's at-home colon cancer screening test, estimated at 29% for all of 2023. Overall it foresees EXACT's annual revenue exceeding 10% growth for at least the next five years.The analysts also believe the stock's 36% slide from its July peak is a compelling entry point, and that there could be upside to even their own EBITDA estimates of $518 million in 2025E.They also wrote the company will likely ""be only lightly impacted by macroeconomic factors,"" or by such regulatory factors as the Food and Drug Administration's rules around laboratory-developed tests (LDTs).Shares were recently climbing 3.2% to $66.49.Oracle upgraded to Outperform Evercore ISI upgraded Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) to Outperform from In Line on Monday and raised its price target by $4 to $135.Evercore sees the recent stock pullback as an attractive entry point given Oracle's improved position for delivering more consistent revenue and earnings growth, primarily driven by higher revenue from its cloud solutions. The analysts believe the apps and infrastructure cloud businesses are contributing significantly to revenue, and that they are expected to drive future high single-digit total revenue growth.The firm also said Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) represents a potential long-term growth opportunity, with estimated growth rates (50% CAGR from fiscal 2023-2026) that could prove conservative.They believe the macroeconomic environment is favorable to integrated software suites, which they say should support steady growth in Oracle's applications segment and potentially drive database/OCI revenue as legacy customers transition to the cloud.***In fast-moving markets, every second counts - and InvestingPro subscribers are always one step ahead with lightning-quick updates.Related ArticlesRivian ripe for the picking after last week's plunge: 5 big analyst picksBMW EV sales surge in 3QXPeng suspends supply chain head for corruption investigation]"

317,2cb8726d-4e4e-3efd-8b06-442c33e5c28a,HAS,2023-10-11,Hasbro (HAS) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Q3 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hasbro-earnings-expected-grow-know-140016643.html,1696946416,STORY,['HAS'],"[Hasbro (HAS) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis toy maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.77 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +24.7%.Revenues are expected to be $1.7 billion, up 1.4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.96% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Hasbro?For Hasbro, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.36%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Hasbro will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Hasbro would post earnings of $0.58 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.49, delivering a surprise of -15.52%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Hasbro doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

318,e37a3b41-7387-31b0-9f5f-30a2e7efd62f,YUM,2023-10-11,Why You Should Bet on These 5 Top-Ranked Stocks With Rising P/E,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-bet-5-top-ranked-114600079.html,1696938360,STORY,"['AMC', 'TRIP', '^GSPC', 'YUM']","[Investors often opt for a stock-picking approach that involves stocks with a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. This strategy is based on the notion that the lower the P/E ratio, the higher the stock value. The reasoning behind this is straightforward — when a stock's current market price does not adequately reflect its higher earnings, it suggests potential for growth.But there is more to this whole P/E story. Because not only low P/E, stocks with a rising P/E can also fetch strong returns. In this regard, investors can bet on the likes of AMC Entertainment AMC, Yum Brands YUM, Inter Parfums IPAR, TripAdvisor TRIP and Sera Prognostics SERA.Rising P/E: A Useful ToolThe concept is that as earnings rise, so should the price of the stock. As forecasts for expected earnings come in higher, strong demand for the stock should continue to push up its prices. After all, astock's P/E gives an indication of how much investors are ready to shell out per dollar of earnings.Suppose an investor wants to buy a stock with a P/E ratio of 30. This means that he is willing to shell out $30 for only $1 worth of earnings as he expects the earnings of the company to rise at a faster pace in the future owing to strong fundamentals.So, if the P/E of a stock is rising steadily, it means that investors are assured of its inherent strength and expect some strong positives out of it.Also, studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P/E ratios jump over 100% from their breakout point in the cycle. So, if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle, you can end up seeing considerable gains.Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P/E, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year’s actual growthPercentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal zero(These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years.)Story continuesPercentage change in price over four weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 12 weeksPercentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks(These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes.)Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S&amp;P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S&amp;P 500Percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S&amp;P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S&amp;P 500(Here, the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S&amp;P 500.)Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20% higher than or equal to the percentage price change for 24 weeks, but it should not exceed 100%(A 20% increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend. But a jump of over 100% indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and the stock might be due for a reversal.)In addition, we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) can get through.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just 64.Here are five out of the 64 stocks:AMC Entertainment: The Zacks Rank #2 operates as a theatrical exhibition company primarily in the United States and internationally. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The average earnings surprise of AMC for the past four quarters is 44.22%.Yum Brands: The Zacks Rank #2 company is the global leader in multi-branding and offers consumers more choice and convenience at one outlet.The average earnings surprise of YUM for the past four quarters is 2.01%.Inter Parfums: This Zacks Rank #2 company is engaged in the manufacturing, distribution and marketing of a wide range of fragrances and related products.The average earnings surprise of IPAR for the past four quarters is 45.87%.TripAdvisor: This is one of the largest online travel research companies in the world. Currently, TRIP carries a Zacks Rank #2.The average earnings surprise of TRIP for the past four quarters is 62.59%.Sera Prognostics: This Zacks Rank #2 company is engaged in women's health diagnostics.The average earnings surprise of SERA for the past four quarters is 10.39%.You can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

Thus, the addition of Kentro to the acquirer’s portfolio will add specialty capabilities as well as consolidate its presence in London.Brown &amp; Brown and its subsidiaries continuously make strategic acquisitions to expand globally, add capabilities and boost operations. Also, these strategic buyouts help Brown &amp; Brown increase commissions and fees, which, in turn, drive revenues.

DPZ is scheduled to report third-quarter 2023 results on Oct 12, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.3%.Q3 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $3.29 per share, suggesting 17.9% growth from the prior-year quarter. Over the past 60 days, earnings estimates have remained stable. The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $1.05 billion, indicating a decline of 1.6% from the year-ago reported figure.Factors to NoteDomino's fiscal third-quarter results are likely to gain from robust same store sales growth, unit expansion, new menu addition and strong digitalization. DPZ continues to benefit from strong carryout and delivery businesses. It has been focusing on Car Side Delivery 2-Minute Guarantee with awareness campaigns. However, the company’s top line is expected to have been hurt by a decline in sales of U.S. stores and supply-chain revenues.Our model predicts total U.S. store revenues to dip 0.1% to $355.3 million year over year. Moreover, our model estimates supply-chain revenues to fall 3.3% year over year to $624.7 million.     An ease in inflationary pressure is likely to have aided the company’s margin. Our model projects U.S. company-owned stores and supply-chain cost of sales to decrease 23.6% and 4.5% year over year, respectively.

The stock outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.52%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.4%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 0.58%.The industrial real estate developer's stock has dropped by 10.4% in the past month, falling short of the Finance sector's loss of 3.1% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 2.61%.Market participants will be closely following the financial results of Prologis in its upcoming release. The company plans to announce its earnings on October 17, 2023. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $1.26, marking a 27.17% fall compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $1.71 billion, showing a 48.36% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.PLD's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $5.59 per share and revenue of $6.74 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +8.33% and +37.09%, respectively.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Prologis should also be noted by investors. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Empirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

324,705c40ea-781f-3dff-ba2c-9b01713ce92c,PLD,2023-10-11,Smart Defense: 7 REITs to Shield Your Portfolio From Today’s Turbulence,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smart-defense-7-reits-shield-003059279.html,1696465859,STORY,"['WELL', 'PLD', 'AVB', 'IIPR', 'O', 'STAG']","[Even with the allure and the rising potential of a soft landing, investors ought to consider the benefits of certain REITs to buy. With real estate investment trusts (REITs), investors generally enjoy a wide footprint of business exposure. As well, their legal structure requires that they pay 90% or more of their taxable profits to shareholders in the form of dividends.To be sure, the focus about REITs to buy isn’t about robust capital gains. To use a football analogy, you’re not the quarterback attempting to throw 60-yard bombs. Instead, you’re the defensive back, a free safety in a prevent defense. As the last line of defense, it’s your job to make sure the ball doesn’t go behind you.Put another way, you’re going to give up garbage yards to the opposing offense. That’s fine. What you’re doing with REITs to buy is not so much about scoring points but rather managing the game. Thanks to the lead you’ve built from high-flying innovators, you’re trying to hold the lead going into the fourth quarter. On that note, below are the REITs to buy to shield your portfolio from today’s turbulence.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsREITs to Buy: Welltower (WELL)WellTower (WELL) logo displayed on a website and magnifiedSource: ShutterstockOne of the top REITs to buy based on compelling fundamentals, Welltower (NYSE:WELL) primarily invests in properties related to healthcare infrastructure. Specifically, the company specializes in senior living, including offering senior housing communities, post-acute care facilities and outpatient medical properties. Given the vast number of baby boomers retiring and entering their golden years, WELL should offer significant viability for years.To be fair, Welltower isn’t exactly the greatest deal in town. Conspicuously, WELL trades at 25.57x funds from operations (FFO). That’s well above the REIT sector’s median value of 12.55X. However, on the positive side, it’s a consistently profitable enterprise. And just to reiterate, the longer-term framework of serving baby boomers is compelling.Story continuesAt the moment, Welltower carries a forward yield of 3.08%. Combined with its capital gains potential – it’s up over 18% year-to-date – WELL brings an intriguing package to the table. Finally, analysts peg WELL a moderate buy with an $88.45 price target, implying almost 12% upside potential.Stag Industrial (STAG)stocks to buy: warehouse interior with shelves, pallets and boxes DSource: Don Pablo / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, Stag Industrial (NYSE:STAG) ranks among the popular REITs to buy thanks to ongoing relevance. Focused on the acquisition and operation of industrial properties throughout the U.S., Stag primarily targets warehouses and distribution centers. That’s significant thanks to the e-commerce revolution.While Stag isn’t a direct player in the e-commerce ecosystem, the rise of online sales has significantly increased demand for warehousing, distribution centers and logistics hubs. After incurring a post-pandemic lull, since the second quarter of 2022, e-commerce as a percentage of total retail sales jumped from 14.4% to 15.4% in Q2 of this year.Put another way, even with challenges to consumer sentiment during the post-pandemic period, people still turn to online transactions. Therefore, investors should be able to at least somewhat trust the 4.41% forward yield. Lastly, analysts rate STAG a moderate buy with a $39 price target, implying nearly 17% growth potential.REITs to Buy: AvalonBay (AVB)AVB stock: an Avalon sign in a garden next to a roadSource: Andriy Blokhin / Shutterstock.comAs one of the best REITs to buy in the apartment space, AvalonBay (NYSE:AVB) symbolizes a love-hate affair. Thanks to the record lows in interest rates immediately following the initial impact of the Covid-19 crisis, those with means were able to secure real estate at compelling borrowing costs. However, those without robust means were forced to rent. Naturally, landlords took advantage of this dynamic.In fairness, AvalonBay presents high risks because it’s quite possible that the consumer base may have hit a breaking point. Since the start of the year, AVB gained under 4%. Much of this modest return stems from its trailing one-month loss of nearly 7%. Therefore, caution is key.Still, for contrarians, the buy argument may center on AvalonBay’s three-year revenue growth rate of 3.6%, beating out 62.6% of its peers. It’s also consistently profitable as you might imagine. Analysts rate AVB as a moderate buy with a $198.08 target, implying over 18% growth.Apple Hospitality (APLE)an empty, sunlit hotel roomSource: ShutterstockPerhaps a controversial idea – and undoubtedly risky – Apple Hospitality (NYSE:APLE) deserves to be on your radar if you have an adventurous (and patient) personality. Based in Richmond, Virginia, the other “fruit” company owns one of the largest and most diverse portfolios of upscale, rooms-focused hotels in the U.S.Now, I say Apple Hospitality may be controversial not because of anything sordid but rather, the relevance (or lack thereof) underlying the business. With consumers facing pressures associated with stubbornly high interest rates – along with persistent mass layoffs – the hospitality sector faces risks. If anything, the trade-down effect can rear its ugly head.That said, if you’re a contrarian, you might be interested in the value proposition. Since the start of the year, APLE lost about 5% of equity value. However, that also means APLE trades at 9.2x FFO, below the sector median 12.55x. Also, analysts peg APLE a moderate buy with an $18 price target, implying nearly 22% upside potential.REITs to Buy: Prologis (PLD)The Prologis (PLD) logo displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in San Francisco, California, Prologis (NYSE:PLD) invests in logistics facilities. From its public profile, Prologis’ strategy centers on acquiring warehouses located close to large urban areas where land is scarce. Presently, the company serves approximately 6,600 tenants. Interestingly, Prologis began expanding its non-real estate business called Essentials, offering customers solar power, racking systems and forklifts, among other equipment.To be sure, PLD isn’t exactly a sterling hidden gem. For example, shares trade at 19.38x FFO, which ranks worse than nearly 78% of the competition. At the same time, for that premium, you get an enterprise with a three-year revenue growth rate of 13.1%. That’s above 87.8% of sector rivals. Also, during the same period, its EBITDA growth rate impresses at 14.2%.In terms of passive income, Prologis offers a forward yield of 3.24%. That’s a bit lower than other REITs to buy, with the sector average hitting 4.46%. However, the company also enjoys 10 years of consecutive dividend increases. In closing, analysts peg PLD a strong buy with a $145.13 target, implying 35% growth.Realty Income (O)realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browserSource: ShutterstockRanking among the most popular REITs to buy, Realty Income (NYSE:O) invests in free-standing, single-tenant commercial properties in the U.S. As well, its footprint has expanded to Spain and the U.K. Notably, retail investors look to Realty Income because it offers monthly dividends. Naturally, a monthly payout is useful for income purposes because it aligns with other billing cycles.On a fundamental level, O could be one of the top REITs to buy during the present market turbulence because of consumer relevance. Per its website, Realty’s top three holdings are convenience stores, grocery stores and discount dollar stores. Should economic headwinds bite, households will almost invariably look to save money. Thus, Realty Income could rise higher.To be fair, O is volatile, losing over 23% since the January opener. Still, that also means that its price-to-FFO ratio declined from 17.11x in Q2 2022 to its current 12.01x. For some contrarians, that might be too hard to ignore. Lastly, analysts rate O a moderate buy with a $68.13 target, implying over 39% upside.REITs to Buy: Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR)A close-up shot of a marijuana growhouse.Source: ShutterstockPerhaps the riskiest name among REITs to buy on this list, Innovative Industrial Properties (NYSE:IIPR) simultaneously offers a compelling narrative. For cannabis advocates, Innovative Industrial may well be the most compelling real estate company. Specializing in leased properties to state-licensed cannabis operators, the enterprise depends heavily on legislative momentum.After peaking in November 2021, IIPR has crashed hard. Much of the volatility stems from the Federal Reserve raising interest rates. Subsequently, the spike in borrowing costs killed business expansionary incentives. Even this year, IIPR has shed just over 26% of equity value since the January opener. It’s a tough ride, no doubt about it.However, high-level governmental rumblings have materialized regarding marijuana legalization. It’s too early to make any serious prognostications. Still, if the green flag drops, the sector could rebound from its long-term slump. That would be quite helpful for IIPR. On a final note, analysts rate shares a hold. Still, the price target stands at a lofty $118, implying almost 63% upside.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NYSE:RHI) Suggests It's 31% Undervalued,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-robert-half-inc-102511506.html,1697019911,STORY,['RHI'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Robert Half fair value estimate is US$111Current share price of US$76.65 suggests Robert Half is potentially 31% undervalued Analyst price target for RHI is US$74.08 which is 33% below our fair value estimateIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Robert Half Inc. (NYSE:RHI) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Robert Half What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$499.7mUS$555.2mUS$558.5mUS$564.2mUS$571.9mUS$581.1mUS$591.3mUS$602.5mUS$614.3mUS$626.7mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 1.03%Est @ 1.36%Est @ 1.60%Est @ 1.76%Est @ 1.88%Est @ 1.96%Est @ 2.02% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.6% US$469US$489US$461US$437US$415US$396US$378US$361US$345US$331(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$4.1bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$627m× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.6%– 2.2%) = US$14bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$14b÷ ( 1 + 6.6%)10= US$7.6bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$12b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$76.7, the company appears quite good value at a 31% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Robert Half as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.891. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Robert HalfStrengthCurrently debt free.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Professional Services market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

A new survey conducted by Protiviti and The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) reveals which risks are keeping IT auditors up at night.Protiviti logo. (PRNewsFoto/Protiviti) (PRNewsfoto/Protiviti)The 11th annual ""Global Technology Audit Risks Survey"" polled a group of over 550 Chief Audit Executives (CAEs) and IT audit professionals on the technology risks their companies face over near-term (12 month) and medium-term (two to three year) time horizons. The survey revealed a number of key risks that the internal audit function is most concerned about, including:  1. Cybersecurity is the top priority by a wide margin.Nearly 75% of respondents, and an even higher percentage (82%) of CAEs and technology audit leaders, consider cybersecurity to be a high-risk area over the next 12 months. To address this risk, leaders and executives need to put mitigation plans into place. With the increased integration of emerging technologies into business functions, organizations anticipate that next-gen cyber threats pose the most significant risks over the next two to three years.2. AI is an emerging risk with significant gaps in organizational preparedness and internal audit proficiency. Only 28% of respondents indicate the use of AI (including generative AI) and machine learning (ML) as posing significant threats over the next 12 months. However, while AI may not be perceived as an immediate threat, it is rising rapidly on the risk horizon. Specifically, 54% of our survey participants believe advanced AI systems, including generative AI, present substantial risks in the coming two to three years. As the technology becomes more widely accepted and integrated into business operations, the complexities and uncertainties it introduces will become more pressing. Few organizations believe their level of preparedness or the proficiency of their technology audit group in handling AI/GenAI and ML risks are at acceptable levels.Story continues3. The talent gap in IT is a growing concern. For companies to address cyber- and AI-related risks, they need to hire talent with a deep understanding of these spaces at a time when such talent and skills are scarce. Companies must focus on hiring the leaders and team members they need as well as retaining and upskilling the existing talent pool. Companies with insufficient talent and intellectual capital in areas like cyber and AI will find themselves exposed when these risks become reality.Other areas that the audit function identifies as significant threats over the next twelve months include third parties/vendors (60%), data privacy and compliance (58%), and transformations and system implementations (55%).""When it comes to technology challenges, not only are companies facing a wide range of threats, but each of these threats is changing at an alarming rate,"" said Angelo Poulikakos, global leader of the firm's Technology Audit and Advisory practice. ""Risks related to cyber and AI look radically different than a few years ago, and will surely continue to evolve. Companies that conduct internal audits more frequently and integrate advanced analytical tools and techniques into their audit processes will be more on top of these changes and consequently more prepared when real issues arise. Many organizations are now dealing with the strategic risks of the long-term talent gap, which is why we're seeing more CAEs and auditors recognize this challenge.""""IT auditors play a critical role in helping their companies see around corners when it comes to technology risks across the enterprise,"" said Brad J. Monterio, IIA EVP of Member Competency and Learning. ""This survey offers valuable insights to CAEs and their teams on where they may need to concentrate their efforts in the coming years as they shape their audit plans. It also helps identify the areas where organizations should consider strategically investing in talent to bolster their risk preparedness.""This report is based on a survey, fielded from June through July of 2023, of 559 chief audit executives (CAEs) and IT audit professionals, representing a wide range of industries globally.

Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.05 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels. Furthermore, the company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 52.72, which is above Joel Tillinghast's warning level of 4 and is worse than 98.24% of 1362 companies in the Consumer Packaged Goods industry.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where Newell Brands Inc seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. The company's revenue has declined by -0.4 per year over the past three years, which underperforms worse than 73.17% of 1711 companies in the Consumer Packaged Goods industry. Stagnating revenues may pose concerns in a fast-evolving market. Lastly, Newell Brands Inc predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.Unraveling the Future of Newell Brands Inc (NWL): A Deep Dive into Key MetricsConclusionGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GF Score highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While Newell Brands Inc has a rich history and a diverse product portfolio, its financial health and growth prospects raise concerns about its future performance.

332,d05aad2a-c9ad-3d27-8d5f-194d51700351,UPS,2023-10-11,Possible Bearish Signals With United Parcel Service Insiders Disposing Stock,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-united-parcel-120056852.html,1697025656,STORY,['UPS'],"[Over the past year, many United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for United Parcel Service United Parcel Service Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP and President of International, Kathleen Gutmann, for US$10m worth of shares, at about US$190 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$156). So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.In the last year United Parcel Service insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.United Parcel Service Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at United Parcel Service. Specifically, Executive VP &amp; President of U.S. Nando Cesarone ditched US$3.9m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. United Parcel Service insiders own about US$96m worth of shares. That equates to 0.07% of the company. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.So What Do The United Parcel Service Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider hasn't bought United Parcel Service stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. Insiders own shares, but we're still pretty cautious, given the history of sales. We're in no rush to buy! While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 2 warning signs with United Parcel Service and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS), Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;UPS shares have lagged the broader market as well as rival FedEx (FDX) this year (-11.4% vs. +14.3% for the S&amp;P 500 &amp; +47.7% for FDX). The company now expects revenues in 2023 to be around $93 billion. The new forecast is not only below the previous outlook of $97 billion but also much lower than 2022's actual figure.Management cited costs associated with the labor deal, inked with 330,000 unionized workers, and declining package volumes induced by the labor negotiations as reasons for lowering the outlook. The five-year deal with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters for better pay and working conditions is worth less than $30 billion. It is likely to keep labor cost at high levels.However, UPS is looking to drive growth in this uncertain scenario by improving efficiencies. Efforts to reward its shareholders also bode well for UPS.

Solid growth in domestic bookings is driving growth. The company is experiencing solid momentum in international regions, which is a positive. Strong growth in rental cars, airline ticket units and booked room nights is another positive.Solid momentum across the agency, merchant, advertising and other businesses is a tailwind. Further, strengthening alternative accommodation business and flight capabilities are major positives. However, intensifying competition is a headwind.Lockheed Martin shares have outperformed the Zacks Aerospace - Defense industry over the past year (+9.0% vs. -0.1%). The company keeps on securing big defense contracts from the Pentagon and other U.S. allies, which in turn add up to solid backlog count. Its strong backlog boosts long-term growth.Lockheed remains the largest U.S. defense contractor with a steady order flow from its leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs. The solid U.S. defense budgetary provisions should boost its business. Lockheed boasts strength in the international defense market.Yet, America and Turkey's tiff as a result of the latter accepting Russian products may hurt its component supply from Turkey. It is facing performance issues concerning some of its products, which may hurt its results. An uncertainty regarding the possible sanction by China on Lockheed might impact the latter.(You can read the full research report on Lockheed Martin here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include CME Group Inc.

This is likely to continue throughout 2023.Organic Growth Aids Cencora (COR) Amid CompetitionPer the Zacks analyst, Cencora should benefit from continued solid organic revenue growth, World Courier unit and Specialty distribution business amid cutthroat competition in the Medtech space.High Data-Center Demand, Expansions Aid Digital Realty (DLR)Per the Zacks analyst, solid demand for Digital Realty's assets amid growth in digital infrastructure and cloud adoption, and expansion efforts bode well.

But the silver lining is the stock is up over five years. Unfortunately its return of 45% is below the market return of 68%.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for American Express In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, American Express managed to grow its earnings per share at 21% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 8% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of American Express' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for American Express the TSR over the last 5 years was 56%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAmerican Express shareholders are up 10% for the year (even including dividends). But that was short of the market average. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 9% over half a decade This could indicate that the company is winning over new investors, as it pursues its strategy. Investors who like to make money usually check up on insider purchases, such as the price paid, and total amount bought.

The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of NiSource, it has a TSR of 22% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveNiSource shareholders are up 6.2% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. The silver lining is that the gain was actually better than the average annual return of 4% per year over five year. This could indicate that the company is winning over new investors, as it pursues its strategy. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand NiSource better, we need to consider many other factors. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for NiSource   (of which 1 is a bit concerning!) you should know about.NiSource is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

If you want to skip our discussion on the natural resources market, head directly to 5 Best Natural Resources ETFs To Buy. As the world accelerates its efforts to innovate and transform itself in technology and lifestyle, our dependence on natural resources only grows. The natural resources sector is made up of a number of industries involved in the research, mining, extraction, commercialization, and utilization of naturally occurring materials. These resources can be classified into three main categories – renewable resources, non-renewable resources, and environmental services and conservation. This article discusses ETFs involved across all these categories. According to PwC, the revenue for the top 40 mining companies amounted to roughly $711 billion in 2022. Coal remained the largest contributor, with over 28% of total revenues being attributed to coal mining. With the inflation rising and the industry focused on a net-zero emissions policy, the demand for minerals continues to rise. To this effect, roughly 66% of the top 40 mergers &amp; acquisitions in 2022 have been critical-mineral deals. Since 2003, the market capitalization for the top 40 miners has tripled from $400 billion to $1.2 trillion in 2022. Over the past few years, the world has rightfully shifted its focus on generating clean energy. This rapid focus has caused governments to legislate to secure mining supply, while introducing fund initiatives that help stabilize mineral supplies. The Global Mining Leader for PwC Australia, Mr. Paul Bendall, stated: “Mining is playing a fundamental role in underpinning the global transition to clean energy, but the path ahead is rocky. A net zero world requires more mined critical minerals, not less, and the flow of industry dealmaking clearly reflects this. But the increasing rise of geopolitics as an influencing factor in global mining may complicate operations in an increasingly complex world with new actors.”Story continuesDespite the governmental efforts, the inflationary pressure and other global supply chain issues have certainly impacted the natural resources industry as a whole. As per PwC’s annual CEO survey, over 41% of respondents believe that their business would not be profitable in a decade, if these conditions were to continue. The Inflation Reduction Act committed an additional $40 billion dollars for the generation of clean energy. With the government’s injection of public funds in the sector, the industry remains concerned about generating an adequate level of return on these investments. According to the International Energy Agency, the total investment in clean energy is forecasted to grow to $1.7 trillion during this year. While the annual investment in clean energy was expected to increase by 24% from 2021 to 2023, fossil fuel investment was estimated to increase by 15%. The demand for clean energy can be mainly attributed to the renewables and electric vehicles sector. Moreover, residential demand for solar energy is at a record high. The United States managed to raise its solar generation capacity to 5.7 gigawatts (GW), while the wind capacity grew to 7.5 GW, in the first 8 months of 2022. Furthermore, the private investment in renewables crossed $10 billion in the past year, as investors were encouraged by 10-year tax credits. This article discusses some of the best natural resources ETFs that provide investors with access to market leaders like Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE:SCCO), Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR), and Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB).Best Natural Resources ETFsPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur Methodology We used an ETF screener and filtered out the best performing natural resources ETFs based on 5-year share price performance.

This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Pentair Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$715.7mUS$802.0mUS$842.8mUS$872.3mUS$897.3mUS$921.0mUS$944.0mUS$966.6mUS$989.1mUS$1.01bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 2.86%Est @ 2.65%Est @ 2.50%Est @ 2.39%Est @ 2.32%Est @ 2.27% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.7% US$658US$679US$656US$625US$591US$559US$527US$496US$467US$440(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$5.7bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.0b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (8.7%– 2.2%) = US$16bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$16b÷ ( 1 + 8.7%)10= US$6.9bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$13b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$63.7, the company appears about fair value at a 16% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Pentair as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.107. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for PentairStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Machinery market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Pentair, we've compiled three further items you should further examine:Risks: Be aware that  Pentair is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...Future Earnings: How does PNR's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

The truffles recently made their debut in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Australia, as well as airport duty-free stores in key markets. They will expand to other countries next year.Tiny Toblerone packs are expanding to U.S. retailers, making the premium chocolate brand, once available predominantly in airports, accessible to a wider range of U.S. consumers.

Launched last year, www.toblerone.co.uk allows customers to choose from a curated assortment of formats, flavors, and sleeve designs, as well as adding their own personal message on packaging.Story continuesThe updated creative approach for the brand shines through in U.K. advertisements promoting Toblerone Truffles, which feature the gemstone-shaped chocolates as luxury jewelry. Additional creative elements will roll out in other markets in the coming months. An example of the “Never Square” creative can be viewed here, and a 30-second Toblerone Truffles campaign here.Along with updating the brand’s positioning, offering Toblerone in these smaller sizes supports the company’s goal of continuing to provide a wide variety of portion sizes and shareable options to help people enjoy chocolate as part of a balanced lifestyle and mindful diet. In Mondelēz’s 2022 State of Snacking Report, 78% of survey respondents across 12 countries said they take time to savor indulgent snacks, and 61% said they take time to portion out snacks before eating them.“Savoring an appropriate portion of a treat like chocolate and focusing on truly experiencing it with all your senses can help make it easier to fully enjoy snacking as part of a balanced lifestyle,” said Michelle Pickering, Senior Vice President, Research &amp; Development for Global Chocolate and Cocoa at Mondelēz International.Mondelēz previously announced its ambition to generate 90 percent of revenue through its core categories of chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks. Because premium chocolate is fast growing, the company is significantly accelerating its focus in this space with additional Toblerone offerings, including pralines similar to the U.K. truffles and personalized gifting options, rolling out in numerous markets.About Mondelēz InternationalMondelēz International, Inc.

Exxon believes that this will result in a ""much more stable, or less cyclical"" that is less prone to commodity price swings through predictable, long-term contracts with customers aiming to lower their own carbon footprint.But that does not mean America’s biggest fossil fuel company plans to ditch or scale back its legacy business anytime soon.Indeed, the Wall Street Journal has reported that Exxon is planning a takeover of fellow shale operator Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) in a giant $60B deal. Exxon held preliminary, informal talks with Pioneer earlier in the year about a possible acquisition and also discussed a potential tie-up with at least one other company as it seeks to expand its already formidable operations in the U.S. shale patch.The offer ""could contain a good deal of stock and that Exxon will maintain price discipline,"" CNBC's David Faber said on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter. A merger with Pioneer would be Exxon's largest M&amp;A deal since its purchase of Mobil in 1999 and the second in recent months after it agreed in July to buy Denbury Resources (NYSE:DEN) for almost $5 billion in all-stock deal.Pioneer is currently the second-largest producer in the Permian Basin by oil production, and an entity formed by the two merged companies would make Exxon the largest producer in the Permian with production potential of ~1.2 million boe/day, overtaking current leader Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY).Story continuesRelated: U.S. Oil Exports Hit Record In H1: EIAIncidentally, in another universe, the crown of Permian’s largest producer belongs to none other than Exxon Mobil’s largest peer, Chevron Inc. (NYSE:CVX). WSJ has reported that Chevron was exploring a merger with Occidental earlier in the year, but has shifted its focus to smaller targets in recent months.Meanwhile, WSJ has revealed that ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is also looking at potential deals in the shale patch, adding that smaller producers are increasingly signaling a willingness to be bought if the price is right. To wit, CrownRock, one of the Permian's biggest private producers, has hired bankers to advise it on a potential deal with an asking price of $10 billion to $15 billion,""M&amp;A has been sort of heating up. I generally think you are going to see some more deals. I think the bottom line is we are kind of in a sweet spot for oil prices. I think you've got more sellers coming out of the woodwork now because the view is that the global economy could turn south over the next year and it's probably a decent time for us to put our companies up for sale,""Roth MKM analyst Leo Mariani said in an interview on Friday on CNBC.Mariani has picked Matador Resources (NYSE:MTDR), Permian Resources Corp. (NYSE:PR) and DiamondBack Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) as potential consolidation candidates in the Permian.Exxon To Receive $2B Earnings BoostExxon Mobil is likely to post a good earnings report after disclosing it received a $2.1 billion boost to third quarter earnings from higher oil prices and robust refining margins, only partially offset by a fall in profits by its chemicals segment. According to the company,  rising crude prices contributed to a gain of ~ $1.1 billion over the previous quarter, while refining profits increased by ~$1 billion, the company revealed in a filing on Wednesday. Meanwhile, an increase in gas prices added ~$400 million to the bottom line, which was unfortunately offset by a decline in chemicals profits by a similar margin. Exxon will report Q3 2023 earnings on October 27, 2023 before the market opens.According to John Royall, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Exxon’s latest guidance suggests it will report $2.33 earnings per share (eps), a figure in-line with the Wall Street consensus. Analysts estimate Exxon’s Q3 2023 earnings will increase from the second quarter, marking the first sequential increase after three consecutive decreases, the company’s longest losing streak since the crash in oil prices from 2014 to 2016. Exxon is the first oil major to post third-quarter earnings expectations, with similar updates expected from Chevron, BP Plc (NYSE:BP), Shell Plc (NYSE:SHEL) and TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE).In other news, Reuters has reported that Exxon is considering selling its 70.7% stake in Italy's main LNG terminal to giant asset manager BlackRock. According to Reuters, at least four international buyers  have expressed interest in buying the Adriatic LNG terminal, currently valued at ~€800M (~$881M). Italy plans to increase its LNG imports to replace what it previously received via pipeline from Russia.By Alex Kimani for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Tesla Vehicles Now Priced To Compete With Traditional ICE VehiclesArmenia Joins Rome Statute, Ignoring Russian WarningsThe Permian Oil Boom Isn’t Over Just YetRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

The attack was a surprise for two reasons. First, though the two sides have gone back and forth with small attacks for years and volatility in the Middle East is nothing new, the scale, coordination, and number of attackers are unprecedented in modern times. Second, Israel, which is known for having one of the best defense systems in the world, was unable to detect or deter the surprise attack.Investing Profitability &amp; Emotion Mix Like Oil and WaterIt suffices to say that the majority of the world hopes for peace and a resolution, with thousands of causalities it is tough for anyone not to feel emotional and sad. However, from a strictly investing perspective, investors must find a way to separate emotions from themselves because emotions like fear and greed can cloud judgment and lead to impulsive and irrational decisions. Below are 3 things investors should know about markets and war:Markets Tend to Shrug Off Geopolitical EventsInvestors must defer to historical data to avoid making decisions based on emotions. While history doesn't always repeat itself, it does tend to rhyme. Each geopolitical event is new and unique; however, history tells us that US equities usually encounter short-term weakness, but tend to absorb and shake off these events in the long-term.Observe the Price Action vs. the NewsIf equity markets were easy, more investors would be profitable. Instead, Wall Street marches to the beat of its own drum and is forward-looking. For example, in late 2022, when inflation numbers hit their highest level in more than 40 years, markets reversed and finished higher on volume – marking the bear market low. Rather than taking news at face value, observe how equities react in the face of bad news.Story continuesPanic Rarely Pays Off Investors should always be vigilant and manage risk. That said, panic rarely pays off. Rather than blowing out positions in fear, more times than not, investors are best served to see how their positions absorb lousy news in the coming days. Remain vigilant, but never panic.3 Industries to WatchEnergy Obviously, energy is the biggest beneficiary of war in the Middle East. Even before war broke out, oil prices were enjoying multi-week rallies. To ""add fuel to the fire,"" the US Strategic Petroleum is at 40-year lows, and supply is waning for both commodities. Investors should also watch individual names such as Occidental Petroleum.Counter-terrorism Palantir is another beneficiary of unrest in the Middle East. The unique company specializes in software, security, and artificial intelligence solutions. Governments worldwide, including defense and intelligence agencies, use Palantir's software platforms to enhance their security and defense capabilities in several ways.Traditional Defense ContractorsDespite the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, defense contractors such as General Dynamics, Boeing and Lockheed Martin have been falling. However, now the defense juggernauts are enjoying a new catalyst and more reasonable valuations – a bullish combination.ConclusionThe recent large-scale attack by a Palestinian militant group on Israel is causing market volatility. Amidst the emotional impact of such events, investors are reminded to separate their emotions from investment decisions. Historical data suggests that while markets may experience short-term weakness during geopolitical events, they often recover in the long-term.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

345,71e76a11-eaea-38ad-b4df-c962d2e89e5b,COF,2023-10-11,7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Loading Up on Before They Soar,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-warren-buffett-loading-140833031.html,1696428513,STORY,"['DHI', 'BRK-A', 'BRK-B', 'JPM', 'SYY', 'COF', 'KO', 'OXY']","[Warren Buffett, the legendary investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B), has a keen eye for value stocks that are poised for growth. In recent months, he has been selectively adding to positions in companies he believes are undervalued and have significant upside potential. According to Berkshire Hathaway’s latest 13F filing, Buffett boosted his stakes in just five stocks during the second quarter of 2023. However, given how rapidly market conditions can change, some of the best Buffett stocks to buy now likely extend beyond these recent purchases.In this article, I will explore seven stocks that the Oracle of Omaha has been accumulating ahead of what he anticipates will be strong growth. Specifically, I will look at some of the five companies he added to based on the latest regulatory filings, along with a couple of stealth investments uncovered by my research into his other portfolios. While Buffett’s reputation is built on long-term investments, the stocks covered here appear poised for immediate gains as well.Of course, it is important to point out that even the best investors can be wrong about market movements. So, we will analyze each pick carefully, including the likely investment thesis as well as the potential risks. Notably, what Buffett bought a few months ago isn’t necessarily a good buy right now, at least in my opinion. Thus, I will be excluding picks that don’t make sense right now. Let’s have a look at the following seven Warren Buffet stocks to buy right now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B)The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comWithout a doubt, Berkshire Hathaway stock is Warren Buffett’s favorite stock to buy, as he has been consistently buying up shares of his own company. Berkshire Hathaway’s performance has been undeniable, and the time-tested company has continued to outperform in 2023. In the second quarter alone, Berkshire repurchased over $1.4 billion worth of its own shares.Story continuesBuffett clearly sees Berkshire as undervalued and an attractive investment opportunity even at current levels. The conglomerate reported a stunning $71.4 billion in operating earnings in the first half of 2023, showcasing the earnings power of Berkshire’s wide-moat businesses like Geico, BNSF Railway, and its manufacturing, service, and retail operations. Furthermore, Berkshire’s $147 billion cash pile gives it an “elephant gun” for hunting down whole companies or other major investments at good prices. With Buffett at the helm, Berkshire Hathaway remains a long-term compounding machine.Capital One Financial (COF)A street view of a Capital One (COF) bank location in New York City.Source: Northfoto / Shutterstock.comCapital One (NYSE:COF) is one of the five companies Warren Buffett boosted his stake in during Q2 2023, based on recent regulatory filings. He increased his position by more than 25%, making it among Berkshire’s top 25 holding. I’m unsure if Buffett is completely bullish with this name, even considering his current additions. However, I believe this is a great long-term pick due to its cheap valuation. The stock price has almost halved over the last two years, and now trades at just 8-times forward earnings.Sure, there are fears about the banking and financial sector in general. However, with the Federal Reserve showing willingness to bail out banks earlier this year, I believe the fears are a little excessive. Capital One reported strong Q2 earnings, with revenue topping estimates. It is aggressively cutting expenses to protect margins in a challenging environment. Furthermore, its consumer business remains robust, with ending loans and revenue up 18% each year-over-year. As macroeconomic uncertainty eventually fades, the market may realize Capital One is undervalued, providing upside for investors buying at today’s prices.Coca-Cola (KO)coca-cola bottles and cans. coke is a blue-chip stocksSource: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.comCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is one of the most consistent Warren Buffett stocks (evidenced by its low beta), and while Berkshire Hathaway did not add to its position in KO stock this past quarter, Warren Buffett’s New England Asset Management did. This consumers staples company will continue churning out cash and paying dividends, making it a great buy right now, even if it faces some short-term selling pressure. Coca-Cola reported strong Q2 2023 earnings, with 11% organic revenue growth and earnings per share growth of 11% as well.The company continues to gain market share globally, and has pricing power even in the face of inflation. Coca-Cola also pays a dividend yielding around 3.3%, and is less susceptible to economic downturns than other sectors. With its diversified portfolio of beverages and presence across 200 countries worldwide, Coca-Cola has what it takes to deliver stable returns regardless of market conditions. While not the most exciting stock, it is a core Buffett holding for good reason.Sysco (SYY)Best Stocks for Students: Sysco (SYY)Source: ShutterstockSysco (NYSE:SYY) is another stock Warren Buffett’s NEAM has been stockpiling that is poised for strong growth. His firm expanded its position in this name by 15%. Sysco has lost nearly 20% of its value from its peak, and now sits well below its pre-pandemic highs. Further short-term downside risk remains as inflation could continue squeezing margins.However, entering this stock at today’s levels will likely lead to juicy long-term gains. Sysco is the global leader in food distribution, giving it economies of scale and pricing power that smaller rivals lack. The reopening of restaurants, hotels, and other hospitality businesses Sysco serves also provides a multi-year tailwind. Notably, the company has also been cutting costs and improving efficiency.This is reflected in the company’s recent results, in which Sysco reported sales growth of more than 4%, and earnings per share that beat estimates. Notably, SYY stock provides a dividend yield which is now an attractive 3% as well. With that in mind, its dominance and margin drivers make it one of the best Warren Buffet stocks to own for the long-run.JPMorgan Chase (JPM)Source: ShutterstockJPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is one of the top lending institutions globally. Rest assured, I am almost certain that this business will not go underwater, no matter what. JPMorgan has been one of the strongest financial stocks, which is why it is also one of Berkshire Hathaway’s holdings and one of the stocks that NEAM bought in its latest reported quarter.In the most recent quarter, JPMorgan Chase reported earnings per share of $4.75 on revenue of $41.31 billion, handily beating estimates. The company has produced stellar results this year, even in a challenging macroeconomic environment, thanks to strength across business lines, including investment banking, trading, consumer banking, and more. Revenue soared 34% year-over-year.JPMorgan Chase increased its net interest income guidance for the full year 2023 to approximately $87 billion, driven by higher rates and slower deposit repricing than previously assumed. The bank grew its CET1 capital ratio to 13.8% and received approval for a lower Stress Capital Buffer requirement of 2.9% starting in its Q4 2023. This will allow JPMorgan Chase to return more capital to shareholders.While uncertainties remain relating to the forward economic outlook, competition for deposits, and pending finalization of Basel III rules, JPMorgan Chase remains optimistic about generating continued excellence through diverse conditions. The company has an unmatched competitive position and balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase currently trades at around 10-times forward earnings, which is toward the lower end of its historical range.Given its dominant position and ability to produce consistent returns across cycles, JPMorgan Chase stock appears attractively valued. This Buffett stock remains a long-term compounder to own. It is definitely one of the top Warren Buffett stocks to buy right now.D.R. Horton (DHI)In this photo illustration the D.R. Horton (DRI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comI believe D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) stock offers substantial upside, but it is also quite risky right now due to its connection with the housing market. My personal rating here would be “hold” because it could make strong moves either way, considering where the broader economy goes.In its fiscal 2023 third quarter, D.R. Horton generated $3.90 of earnings per share on revenues of $9.73 billion, soundly beating estimates. The company continues to see strong demand conditions, with consolidated net sales orders up 10.7% year-over-year. D.R. Horton also drove gross margin expansion and reduced construction cycle times by over a month.However, the housing market faces considerable uncertainty looking ahead. Rising mortgage rates have impacted affordability, slowing the frenetic pace of demand over the past couple of years. D.R. Horton has adapted by lowering prices and increasing buyer incentives. But if demand were to drop more meaningfully, it would likely pressure homebuilding profit margins.On the other hand, D.R. Horton maintains a fortress balance sheet with ample liquidity and low leverage. This gives it the flexibility to invest in growth and weather downturns better than rivals. D.R. Horton also has an industry-leading scale, geographic diversification, and an efficient operating model that produces industry-topping returns on capital.With its wide moat, D.R. Horton seems poised to continue taking market share profitably despite housing market fluctuations. But this uncertainty merits caution, until we gain more clarity on the economy and housing market. This makes DHI stock a “hold” for now.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comLikewise, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is also a little speculative, but could soar in the coming weeks. It all depends on the price of oil. Should the economy see the so-called “soft landing” economists think is possible, we will likely see elevated oil prices for quite some time. Conversely, a recession or economic slump could imply at least a 30% downside from here, in my opinion. However, I still believe this stock is a buy over the long-run due to the company’s oil reserves, as well as its impressive dividend.In Q2 2023, Occidental generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.68, missing expectations. However, total production beat guidance by 42,000 BOE per day, as operational execution continued humming. Occidental raised its full-year 2023 production outlook and generated over $1 billion of free cash flow, even with planned maintenance downtime.Occidental bought also back $425 million of common shares in Q2 and has now completed about 40% of its $3 billion repurchase program. It also redeemed another $520 million of preferred equity. Occidental believes it can sustain shareholder payouts above $4 per common share at oil prices of $75 per barrel or above. Yet, shares trade very cheaply at just 7-times earnings.

Earlier this summer, PepsiCo rival, Coca Cola (NYSE: KO) also lifted its full-year revenues fueled by a stronger-than-expected second quarter performance that included price hikes of around 10% across the board, which offset flat overall case volumes.Fiscal Third Quarter HighlightsFor the quarter ended in September, the packaged foods and beverage maker reported revenue grew 6.7% to $23.45 billion, topping LSEG’s estimate of $23.39 billion, while organic revenue that excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, rose 8.8%. PepsiCo made a net income of $3.09 billion, or $2.24 per share. Adjusted earnings amounted to $2.25, also topping the expected $2.15.Yet, PepsiCo’s volume, which strips out pricing and currency changes, fell again this quarter as inflation harmed product demand. In response, Pepsi has been shrinking portions and making smaller value packs to provide consumers with more affordable options. During the quarter, Pepsi executed price increases of about 11%.Food Performed Better Than BeveragesNorth American food divisions outperformed the beverages unit that contracted 6%. In North America, Quaker Foods experienced a 1% volume rise as its brands gained market share in key categories, while Frito-Lay’s volume was flat.2024 OutlookOrganic revenue growth has been guided at the high end of 4% to 6% with core constant currency earnings per share growing in high single digits.Consumers Digested Higher Prices Of SnacksPepsi reported added another successful round of price increases to its solid organic sales growth, allowing to drinks and snacks giant to lift its full year profit forecast for the third consecutive quarter.Story continuesThe Threat Of Weight Loss DrugsLast Thursday, shares of both PepsiCo and Coca Cola got smashed when Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) executive John Furner told Bloomberg that new generation of weight loss drugs are causing consumers to cut back on groceries and beverages that are high in calories. Coca Cola shares had a rough week that added to a challenging year. But Coca Cola has a balance sheet that is literally built to weather the worst possible recession with ease. With net debt is only about two times its annual net income, Coca Cola can navigate through challenging times but besides the commentary of the Walmart executive, even analysts have expressed concerns regarding the implications of the growing popularity of anti-obesity drugs. Although the Walmart executive spoke mainly of a changing consumer behavior in terms of the changes in customers’ baskets, these drugs reduce appetite and cravings, therefore altering the physiology that goes on within the body and possibly even eliminate the need for snacks altogether. Considering that about 45% of the U.S. population is deemed as obese with as much as 70% categorized as overweight, the weight loss craze will undoubtedly have a profound impact on PepsiCo and Coca Cola, as well as Walmart, as they will all be forced to alter their offerings to fit their consumers.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

This positive sentiment reflects the nation’s ongoing recovery from the pandemic, offering stability to consumers and businesses. For speculative stocks a flourishing economy typically attracts risk-tolerant investors. When the going is good, investors are often willing to buy into a higher risk stock with the potential for higher rewards. These three speculative stock predictions are ready to grow thanks to reduced inflationary concerns and Yellen’s remarks creating a favorable backdrop.Airbus (EADSY)image of a plane flying in the sky representing airline stocksSource: ShutterstockAirbus (OTCMKTS:EADSY) is one of the leading companies for designing and manufacturing aerospace-related products. In 2023, the aerospace manufacturing industry is expected to reach a valuation of $271.76 billion which is forecast to continue growing to $1.22 trillion in 2030. That is an impressive 9.8% CAGR. Q2 2023 resulted in a strong financial outlook for Airbus. Revenue grew 24.12% year-over-year (YOY) to $15.9 billion. Net income and diluted EPS reached $1.06 billion and $1.34. That’s a 55.42% and 54.02% YOY increase, respectively.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe largest driving catalyst for Airbus in 2024 is the creation and release of the newest airplane, the A321XLR. The plane, which is planned to be commercially available in 2024, is projected to improve on current models in nearly every metric. Furthermore, sales are already guaranteed as airlines are already in line to purchase inventory. Assuming the near-guaranteed commercial success of the product, Airbus’ stock valuation should skyrocket once it hits the market. Right now analysts EADSY stock predictions have it hitting $41 in the next 12 months.Intuit (INTU)Person holding cellphone with logo of US financial software company Intuit Inc.

361,ea288bcd-c326-3f52-8f2f-15159ecebe47,DVA,2023-10-11,Masimo's (MASI) LiDCO to Boost Hemodynamic Monitoring Post CE Mark,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/masimos-masi-lidco-boost-hemodynamic-155700928.html,1696953420,STORY,"['MASI', 'DVA', 'ITGR', 'MCK']","[Masimo Corporation MASI recently received the CE mark, under the European Union Medical Device Regulation (EU MDR), for the LiDCO board-in-cable (BIC) module. However, the parameter as a measure of continuous oxygen delivery has not received the FDA’s clearance and is not currently available in the United States.Notably, the use of LiDCO has been shown to reduce postoperative complications, costs and mortalities at 30 and 180 days after surgery in clinical studies.The latest regulatory clearance is expected to significantly strengthen Masimo’s patient monitoring business on a global scale.Significance of the ApprovalThe LiDCO BIC module is designed to connect to multi-patient monitoring platforms, like the Masimo Root Patient Monitoring and Connectivity Hub, to provide advanced hemodynamic monitoring. With this solution, clinicians are expected to be able to easily add LiDCO hemodynamic monitoring, with its unique PulseCO algorithm, to their Root patient monitoring hubs.Following the receipt of the EU MDR CE Mark, there will likely be a solution that can enable hemodynamic monitoring alongside other supported parameters without having a dedicated hemodynamic monitoring box.Per an expert familiar with the LiDCO module, the introduction of the module is expected to deliver dynamic hemodynamic monitoring with a known documented positive impact on patient outcomes.Management believes that bringing LiDCO’s beat-to-beat advanced hemodynamic monitoring to Masimo Root will likely open up the possibility of providing a more complete, continuous picture of cardiac output (CO) and oxygen delivery. Currently, clinicians receive only half of the information as hemodynamic monitors can provide continuous analysis of blood pressure information but rely on intermittent data from other monitors for oxygenation.Per management, using both Masimo’s non-invasive rainbow SET Pulse CO-Oximetry parameters and LiDCO’s PulseCO algorithm, clinicians are now expected to be able to view a continuous and simultaneous display of all the components that make up a patient’s oxygen delivery.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global patient monitoring market is anticipated to grow from $43,808.29 million in 2023 to $62,571.34 million by 2028 at a CAGR of approximately 7.4%. Factors like the rising burden of chronic diseases due to lifestyle changes, growth in the elderly population, increasing preference for home and remote monitoring and the ease of use of portable devices are expected to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest regulatory clearance is likely to provide a significant boost to Masimo’s business.Notable DevelopmentsIn August, Masimo announced the full U.S. market release of the Stork smart home baby monitoring system.The same month, Masimo announced the findings of a prospective, randomized study in which researchers assessed the use of non-invasive, continuous Masimo pleth variability index, as part of goal-directed fluid therapy, to guide intraoperative fluid administration during gastrointestinal surgery on elderly patients by comparing it to conventional fluid therapy. The findings were published in Perioperative Medicine.Also, in August, Masimo reported its second-quarter 2023 results, wherein it registered an expansion of its installed base. Management confirmed that the company gained new hospital customers during the quarter at a record level. The expansion of both margins in the quarter was also recorded.Price PerformanceShares of Masimo have lost 35.3% in the past year against the industry’s 2.4% rise and the S&amp;P 500’s 21.2% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Masimo carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc.

SRDX has been gaining from its solid prospects in the thrombectomy business over the past few months. The optimism led by a solid third-quarter fiscal 2023 performance and its consistent efforts to boost research and development (R&amp;D) are expected to contribute further. Yet, regulatory headwinds and data security threats persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has gained 3.5% against the 3.3% decline of the industry. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 21.2% growth in the said time frame.The renowned medical device and in-vitro diagnostics technology provider has a market capitalization of $445.1 million. Surmodics projects 76.8% growth for fiscal 2023, expecting to maintain its strong performance. SRDX’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average earnings surprise being 71.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Consistent Efforts to Boost R&amp;D: Surmodics’ solid efforts to improve its R&amp;D stature have been a key growth driver, which raises our optimism. The company’s whole product solutions pipeline and sirolimus-based below-the-knee drug-coated balloon program deserve mention. Surmodics has been making progress using its internally developed .014 balloon platform.For the first nine months of fiscal 2023, R&amp;D expenses reflected continued investment in medical device product development, including in Surmodics’ Pounce thrombectomy and Sublime radial access product platforms and costs associated with its SurVeil drug-coated balloon (DCB).Thrombectomy Prospects Bright: Surmodics’ aim to leverage its proprietary Pounce thrombectomy platform technology to develop products raises our optimism. On the third quarter of fiscal 2023 earnings call in August, Surmodics’ management stated that sales of its Pounce Arterial Thrombectomy and Sublime Radial products were an important contributor to the 38% medical device business product sales growth achieved in the quarter.Story continuesIn June, Surmodics received the FDA’s approval for the SurVeil DCB.Strong Q3 Results: Surmodics registered a solid uptick in the overall top and bottom lines in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The company recorded robust revenues from its Medical Device segment and primary sources. During the quarter, Surmodics witnessed strong contributions from sales of its Pounce and Sublime products, indicating their continued solid demand.DownsidesRegulatory Headwinds: Surmodics’ facilities and procedures are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to determine compliance with the latter’s requirements. On account of non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations, the FDA could ban such medical devices. Any adverse regulatory action can potentially have a negative impact on Surmodics' business practices and operations.Data Security Threats: Surmodics collects and stores sensitive data, including its proprietary business information, on its networks. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to its operations and business strategy. Despite Surmodics’ security measures, its information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers, resulting from employee error or other disruptions.Estimate TrendSurmodics is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for fiscal 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its loss per share has narrowed from $1.84 to 22 cents.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $26 million, suggesting a 0.02% improvement from the year-ago reported number.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc.

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company value investors might notice is Addus HomeCare (ADUS). ADUS is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A.We also note that ADUS holds a PEG ratio of 1.45. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. ADUS's industry has an average PEG of 2.14 right now. Over the last 12 months, ADUS's PEG has been as high as 2.50 and as low as 1.43, with a median of 2.11.We should also highlight that ADUS has a P/B ratio of 2.03. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. ADUS's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.64. Within the past 52 weeks, ADUS's P/B has been as high as 2.95 and as low as 2.01, with a median of 2.56.Finally, we should also recognize that ADUS has a P/CF ratio of 19.88. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. ADUS's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 23.14. Within the past 12 months, ADUS's P/CF has been as high as 30.54 and as low as 19.67, with a median of 26.68.Story continuesInvestors could also keep in mind DaVita (DVA), an Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare stock with a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and Value grade of A.DaVita is currently trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 11.73 while its PEG ratio sits at 0.93. Both of the company's metrics compare favorably to its industry's average P/E of 17.71 and average PEG ratio of 2.14.Over the last 12 months, DVA's P/E has been as high as 15.73, as low as 7.30, with a median of 12.91, and its PEG ratio has been as high as 1.87, as low as 0.87, with a median of 1.16.Furthermore, DaVita holds a P/B ratio of 6.78 and its industry's price-to-book ratio is 2.64. DVA's P/B has been as high as 12.74, as low as 6.78, with a median of 8.25 over the past 12 months.These are just a handful of the figures considered in Addus HomeCare and DaVita's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that ADUS and DVA is an impressive value stock right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

366,052a91b1-510b-334f-914d-da9612971215,WHR,2023-10-11,7 Value Stocks Getting Ready to Vault Higher,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-value-stocks-getting-ready-120352409.html,1696507432,STORY,"['MDT', 'NTDOY', 'SAN', 'GM', 'WHR', 'HRB', 'OXY']","[If you’re searching for the best value stocks to buy now, look no further. Value stocks are back in the spotlight. Rising debt costs due to interest rate hikes make growth and tech less attractive for nervous investors. At the same time, a running bond bear market makes the once-safe asset allocation a losing proposition for those seeking a solution to stock market volatility.Value stocks are primed to explode in 2024, as companies typically boast superior financial management practices, positioning them to ride out economic unease. Simultaneously, as bond yields increase and even savings accounts return 4% or more, value stocks’ consistent commitment to dividends means investors can capture yield alongside capital gains.However, not all value stocks are created equally. Investors should look to the past when assessing financial management and consider future potential beyond simple belt-tightening. These seven value stocks to buy couple prudent financial management with fantastic prospects for 2024 and beyond.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsValue Stocks to Buy: Medtronic PLC (MDT)Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocksSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comMedical device manufacturer Medtronic PLC (NYSE:MDT) is typically one of the top value stocks to buy on investors’ lists. While the stock traded flat for most of this year, losing about 2% since January, it’s been more stable than the wider market in recent weeks. To that end, though, Medtronic’s 2024 prospects are as exciting as ever, and today’s pricing presents investors with a perfect entry point. MDT’s most recent earnings point to strong growth in the previous quarter. Revenue climbed 6% year-over-year (YOY) while the company accommodated tighter budgets by cutting research and development spending. While Medtronic’s financial management is consistently strong, its future potential lies largely in artificial intelligence (AI) healthcare solutions. Medtronic and Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) early-2023 partnership to develop a range of AI platforming solutions will likely begin bearing fruit in early 2024, rewarding patient investors who held through the stock’s relatively flat range this year. Story continuesMedtronic’s trailing dividend yield is 3.58%, reinforcing its position as an ideal value stock today and into the new year. Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comWarren Buffett’s favorite oil and gas company, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), struggled slightly this year in light of volatile global energy markets. But the company’s position at the fore of carbon reduction and sustainability position it to capture a broad range of new revenue streams in 2024.Last month, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced a new deal with an OXY subsidiary focused on carbon capture. The partnership, which analysts expect could eventually cost Amazon $150 million, leverages OXY’s emerging direct air capture plant to reduce Amazon’s hefty carbon footprint. The plant is one of the first nationally after the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law earmarked $3.5 billion for plant development and will let OXY expand its income streams as more corporate entities seek to offset their carbon footprint. As sustainability demands increase, legacy oil and gas companies must adapt – and OXY is one of the first (and only) in the sector to proactively lean into the trend. OXY’s total trailing yield, including stock buybacks, is a hefty 7.39%. Warren Buffett’s preference for the stock should be a green flag for investors, and its 2024 prospects look bright. Value Stocks to Buy: General Motors (GM)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is a bit of a gamble in light of the ongoing labor strikes, but this car manufacturer tops the list of best value stocks to buy in the sector. Research firm EquitySet pegs the current price at nearly 50% below fair value, driven chiefly by losses caused by uncertainty surrounding the United Auto Workers strike. Still, if the company’s management and labor leaders come to a deal soon, GM could soar in 2024.Despite the strike, the company’s most recent quarter report included a 21% sales jump. This is notable beyond the strike, as today’s tightened economy means household budgets are shrinking. If GM can keep moving cars off the line and into consumers’ hands despite a down economy, its prospects are bright as we move past this rocky period. Most importantly for GM’s 2024 prospects, its electric vehicle (EV) offerings are increasingly popular, and sales for that segment jumped 33% YOY. GM now has six EV vehicles on the market, with more to come, cementing its second-place standing firmly, though it lags Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) by a wide margin.Investors should expect stock buybacks to slow or stop in light of ongoing labor disputes (buybacks are a focal point for detractors pointing to misallocated funds). Still, the stock’s 8.95% total yield is an attractive selling point, even if it falls slightly in the coming months. Banco Santander SA (SAN)A hand holding a pencil pointing to a series of arrows on a stock chart, indicating value stocks.Source: Gsign76 / ShutterstockBanco Santander SA (NYSE:SAN) is less well-known of these value stocks to buy, but its Latin American market means the company has plenty of upside potential in a growing customer base. Furthermore, the company’s commitment to shareholder value drives a new buyback initiative, which will see the company repurchase $1.38 billion of its shares by January 2024. Couple that with a 3.3% trailing dividend yield, and Banco Santander is an ideal cheap value stock at today’s pricing. Investors should note a degree of uncertainty within SAN’s organization today. It could cause short-term distress – but will likely play out beneficially in the long run. The company’s CEO is running an aggressive restructuring initiative. The operational realignment should boost profitability as it cuts down on inefficiency but might cause short-term volatility as the stock shakes things up. The Latin American banking market, SAN’s primary target, has plenty of room to grow despite global economic unease. Banco Santander is an ideal value play for investors interested in geographic diversification to expose their portfolio to global banking. Value Stocks to Buy: Whirlpool (WHR)the Whirlpool (WHR) logo on a corporate buildingSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.comBullish sentiment is bubbling up around Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR), making it another perfect value play for 2024. Institutional investors are also taking notice, as one investment management firm recently snatched up $1.474 million worth of Whirlpool stock. Much of the bullish sentiment comes from a recent earnings beat. Whirlpool reported $4.21 EPS, beating expectations by 45 cents. At the same time, Whirlpool generated a 29.70% return on equity, notable considering the economic challenges facing the firm nationally. The company’s 5.46% trailing dividend yield will excite income investors as bond yields make fixed-income investing a more viable strategy, positioning Whirlpool as a perfect equity alternative to bonds and bond funds for those maximizing yield today.H&amp;R Block (HRB)Image of a yellow building featuring the H&amp;R Block (HRB) logoSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comIt’s almost tax time, meaning H&amp;R Block (NYSE:HRB) is ready to rise to the occasion in 2024. The stock struggled earlier this year as rumors swirled, implying that the Internal Revenue Service would unveil a national, free filing solution. Today, though, HRB bounced back and is positioned to capture the tax return market alongside a slew of other revenue opportunities.To buffer the cyclical effects of tax season on its revenue, HRB unveiled a mobile banking initiative in January. As of April, the mobile banking platform saw 291,000 customers jump on board, collectively depositing more than $280 million. Likewise, the company’s small-business accounting platform grew 10% YOY. Maintaining consistent cash flow has always been a struggle for HRB and similar tax-centric companies. Still, these initiatives pay dividends as more customers leverage the company’s tech year-round. Speaking of dividends, the company boasts a massive 12.27% total yield between buybacks and distributions – that’s a hard stat to beat in today’s market, making HRB a perfect financial play for savvy investors. Nintendo (NTDOY, NTDOF)Value stocks: A hand places wooden cutouts of the letters in the word ""value"" on a surface.Source: patpitchaya / Shutterstock.comNintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY, OTCMKTS:NTDOF) is a perfect blend of growth and value, and recent Nintendo news points to a substantial upside in 2024. Rumors began flying fast last month, as a leaked partnership between Nintendo and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) pointed to new possibilities in virtual reality. The leak, which is still unconfirmed by both parties, says the partnership will create a new virtual reality gaming platform. The gaming platform could leverage Nintendo’s industry dominance and Google’s next-generation micro-LED technology. Soon after, email leaks from an ongoing Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) court case revealed substantial executive interest in a high-level partnership or acquisition of Nintendo. While the emails were from 2020, nothing has yet materialized. Still, the massive corporate interest in Nintendo means the company is well-positioned to leverage its brand and holdings to explode in 2024.Nintendo’s financial management is beyond reproach, which executives at Microsoft mentioned in the leaked emails. Today, the company sits on a ton of cash, meaning it’s positioned to weather economic uncertainty and take advantage of opportunities as they arise. The company’s trailing 3.24% dividend yield also benefits value investors as they wait for potential partnerships to play out. On the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

IR is gaining from its solid product portfolio, innovation capabilities and focus on boosting its aftermarket businesses despite cost inflation, supply-chain constraints and forex woes.Key Factors Driving IRBusiness Strength: Solid demand and higher orders should drive the company’s Industrial Technologies &amp; Services segment. The company continues to see higher orders across its product portfolio of compressors, vacuum and blowers, and power tools and lifting within the Industrial Technologies &amp; Services unit.For 2023, the company expects segmental revenues to increase 9-11% organically. Pricing actions and acquired assets are driving the Precision &amp; Science Technologies segment’s performance.

The company anticipates Precision &amp; Science Technologies revenues to climb 5-7% organically in 2023.Expansion Efforts: Ingersoll Rand has been strengthening its business through acquisitions. In August 2023, the company completed the acquisition of Howden Roots for approximately $300 million. The acquisition expanded IR’s low-pressure compression and vacuum product offerings and added centrifugal compression capabilities. Roots is a part of IR’s Industrial Technologies &amp; Services segment.In January 2023, the company completed the acquisition of SPX FLOW’s Air Treatment business, which boosted its core compressor product offering through a complementary product portfolio of energy-efficient compressed air dryers, filters and other consumables.

In the first six months of 2023, the company paid out dividends of $16.2 million and repurchased shares worth $132.8 million. In 2022, IR returned $294 million to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.In light of the above-mentioned positives, we believe, investors should retain IR stock for now, as suggested by its current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Technological advancements like 5G, blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) have further driven industry expansion. Additionally, increased concerns about data security have acted as a catalyst for industry growth.Thomson Reuters Corporation TRI, Marvell Technology, Inc. MRVL, Trane Technologies plc TT, and Aptiv PLC APTV are poised to gain from the prevailing trends of the industry.About the IndustryThe Zacks Technology Services industry encompasses companies involved in producing, developing and designing various software support, data processing, computing hardware and communications equipment. These offerings range from integrated powertrain technologies, advanced analytics, technology solutions, and contract research services to semiconductor packaging and interconnect technologies, collaboration software, specialty printers and data acquisition and analysis systems. This industry caters to consumer and business markets and serves diverse end markets and customer segments. Additionally, some industry players offer advanced analytics, clinical research services, data storage technology and solutions and technology-enabled financial services for consumers and small business owners.Factors Structuring the Future of Technology ServicesRising Demand Environment: The industry has been gaining traction over the past year, thanks to recent technological advancements and the onset of remote work. Revenues, income and cash flows have been growing in the past year, aiding many industry players to pay out stable dividends.Cloud Computing Gains Traction: Per a report by Grand View Research, the global cloud computing market was valued at USD 483.98 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 14.1% from 2023 to 2030. Factors driving this growth include the cloud's ability to enhance business performance, increasing demand for hybrid and Omni-cloud systems and pay-as-you-go models. Government efforts to safeguard data and the adoption of hybrid work models post the COVID-19 pandemic are also contributing. However, data security concerns constrain growth, while large enterprises embrace the cloud to reduce costs and manage data efficiently, especially with pay-as-you-go models. Large businesses are rapidly adopting cloud services due to their on-demand availability.Story continuesTechnological Advancement Take Centre Stage: The global shift towards digitization creates opportunities in various markets, including 5G, blockchain, and artificial intelligence (AI). The United States, a significant player in the IT sector, is positioned for growth due to the widespread adoption of smart technologies and increased investments in security. Companies increasingly adopt AI, ML, blockchain, and data science to gain a competitive advantage. According to Statista, the worldwide artificial intelligence market was worth $142.3 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach $207.9 billion in 2023. It is anticipated to reach a staggering $1.85 trillion by 2030. This indicates a substantial Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 41.75% from 2022 to 2030. MLis is anticipated to experience significant growth, increasing from $140 billion to $2 trillion by 2030.Cybersecurity, talk of the town: The rapid adoption of technology services has brought about some negative consequences. The FBI, for instance, has reported a 300% surge in cybersecurity cases. Nevertheless, the industry benefits from the growing demand for data security and privacy protection solutions. The increasing frequency of cyberattacks and associated security threats is anticipated to sustain the industry's growth. Per Statista, Revenue is expected to show an annual growth rate (CAGR 2023-2028) of 10.48%, resulting in a market volume of $273.60 billion by 2028. According to Statista, the IT Services market is projected to reach $1,204 billion in 2023, with the market volume expected to reach $1,570 billion.

But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. But Sempra (NYSE:SRE) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 19% over five years, which is below the market return. Unfortunately the share price is down 7.2% in the last year.Since the stock has added US$2.0b to its market cap in the past week alone, let's see if underlying performance has been driving long-term returns. See our latest analysis for Sempra While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the five years of share price growth, Sempra moved from a loss to profitability. That's generally thought to be a genuine positive, so we would expect to see an increasing share price. Given that the company made a profit three years ago, but not five years ago, it is worth looking at the share price returns over the last three years, too. Indeed, the Sempra share price has gained 8.1% in three years. In the same period, EPS is up 3.1% per year. That makes the EPS growth rather close to the annualized share price gain of 2.6% over the same period. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Arguably the share price is reflecting the earnings per share.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Sempra has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Sempra's TSR for the last 5 years was 40%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in Sempra had a tough year, with a total loss of 4.1% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 20%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 7%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Sempra (1 can't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing here.But note: Sempra may not be the best stock to buy.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Vulcan Materials (VMC) holds a Zacks Rank #2 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.25 a share 16 days away from its upcoming earnings release on October 26, 2023.Vulcan Materials' Earnings ESP sits at 2.74%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.25 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.19.VMC is part of a big group of Construction stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Emcor Group (EME) as well.Slated to report earnings on October 26, 2023, Emcor Group holds a #2 (Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $2.74 a share 16 days from its next quarterly update.Emcor Group's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 1.11% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.71.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, VMC and EME could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

377,baedccbe-a795-305b-a575-9b55af3b5019,VLO,2023-10-11,"Valero Energy (VLO) Could Find a Support Soon, Here's Why You Should Buy the Stock Now",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/valero-energy-vlo-could-support-135504827.html,1696946104,STORY,['VLO'],"[The price trend for Valero Energy (VLO) has been bearish lately and the stock has lost 8.1% over the past week. However, the formation of a hammer chart pattern in its last trading session indicates that the stock could witness a trend reversal soon, as bulls might have gained significant control over the price to help it find support.While the formation of a hammer pattern is a technical indication of nearing a bottom with potential exhaustion of selling pressure, rising optimism among Wall Street analysts about the future earnings of this oil refiner is a solid fundamental factor that enhances the prospects of a trend reversal for the stock.What is a Hammer Chart and How to Trade It?This is one of the popular price patterns in candlestick charting. A minor difference between the opening and closing prices forms a small candle body, and a higher difference between the low of the day and the open or close forms a long lower wick (or vertical line). The length of the lower wick being at least twice the length of the real body, the candle resembles a 'hammer.'In simple terms, during a downtrend, with bears having absolute control, a stock usually opens lower compared to the previous day's close, and again closes lower. On the day the hammer pattern is formed, maintaining the downtrend, the stock makes a new low. However, after eventually finding support at the low of the day, some amount of buying interest emerges, pushing the stock up to close the session near or slightly above its opening price.When it occurs at the bottom of a downtrend, this pattern signals that the bears might have lost control over the price. And, the success of bulls in stopping the price from falling further indicates a potential trend reversal.Hammer candles can occur on any timeframe -- such as one-minute, daily, weekly -- and are utilized by both short-term as well as long-term investors.Like every technical indicator, the hammer chart pattern has its limitations. Particularly, as the strength of a hammer depends on its placement on the chart, it should always be used in conjunction with other bullish indicators.Story continuesHere's What Makes the Trend Reversal More Likely for VLOThere has been an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions for VLO lately, which can certainly be considered a bullish indicator on the fundamental side. That's because a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.The consensus EPS estimate for the current year has increased 6.9% over the last 30 days. This means that the Wall Street analysts covering VLO are majorly in agreement about the company's potential to report better earnings than what they predicted earlier.If this is not enough, you should note that VLO currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. And stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 usually outperform the market. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Moreover, a Zacks Rank of 2 for Valero Energy is a more conclusive indication of a potential trend reversal, as the Zacks Rank has proven to be an excellent timing indicator that helps investors identify precisely when a company's prospects are beginning to improve.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

TITN, PVH Corp. PVH, Unum Group UNM, AAR Corp. AIR and Valero Energy Corp. VLO.4 Value Stocks with Impressive EV-to-EBITDA Ratios to Snap UpThe price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple enjoys wide-scale popularity among investors seeking stocks trading at a bargain. In addition to being a widely used tool for screening stocks, P/E is a popular metric to work out the fair market value of a firm. But even this ubiquitously used valuation multiple has a few limitations.Although P/E is the most popular valuation metric, a more complicated multiple called EV-to-EBITDA works even better. Often considered a better alternative to P/E, it gives the true picture of a company's valuation and earnings potential, and has a more complete approach to valuation. While P/E considers a firm's equity portion, EV-to-EBITDA determines its total value.Titan Machinery Inc., PVH Corp., Unum Group, AAR Corp. and Valero Energy Corp. are some stocks with attractive EV-to-EBITDA ratios.What Makes EV-to-EBITDA a Better Alternative?EV-to-EBITDA is essentially the enterprise value (EV) of a stock divided by its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). EV is the sum of a company's market capitalization, its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents.The other component of the multiple, EBITDA, gives a better idea of a company's profitability as it removes the impact of non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings. It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows.Just like P/E, the lower the EV-to-EBITDA ratio, the more attractive it is. A low EV-to-EBITDA ratio could signal that a stock is potentially undervalued.EV-to-EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company's balance sheet that P/E ratio does not. Due to this reason, EV-to-EBITDA is generally used to value the potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume. Stocks boasting a low EV-to-EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates.Story continuesAnother shortcoming of P/E is that it can't be used to value a loss-making firm. A company's earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. On the other hand, EV-to-EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and can also be used to value companies making losses but are EBITDA-positive.EV-to-EBITDA is also a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation. Moreover, it can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt.However, EV-to-EBITDA is not devoid of shortcomings and alone cannot conclusively determine a stock's inherent potential and future performance. The multiple varies across industries and is usually not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries, given their diverse capital expenditure requirements.Hence, a strategy entirely based on EV-to-EBITDA might not yield the desired results. But you can club it with other major ratios such as price-to-book (P/B), P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) to screen value stocks.Here are our five picks out of the 12 stocks that passed the screen:Titan Machinery operates a network of full-service agricultural and construction equipment dealer locations in North America and Europe.

The consensus mark remained stable over the past week. The consensus estimate for third-quarter revenues of $91.4 billion indicates a 13% increase from the year-ago reported figure.UnitedHealth beat the consensus estimate for earnings in all the prior four quarters, with the average being 3.4%. This is depicted in the graph below:UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseaUnitedHealth Group Incorporated Price and EPS SurpriseUnitedHealth Group Incorporated price-eps-surprise | UnitedHealth Group Incorporated QuoteBefore we get into what to expect for the to-be-reported quarter in detail, it’s worth taking a look at UNH’s previous-quarter performance first.Q2 Earnings RewindThe healthcare plan provider reported adjusted earnings of $6.14 per share for the last quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.7% on the back of an expanding customer base under UNH’s value-based care arrangements. The solid performance of Optum’s sub-units also contributed to the quarterly results. However, the upside was partly offset by an elevated expense level.Now, let’s see how things have shaped up before the third-quarter earnings announcement.Q3 Factors to NoteUnitedHealth's third-quarter results are estimated to have been bolstered by elevated premiums, which were underpinned by robust growth in its membership base. Our estimation of premium revenues indicates a year-over-year increase exceeding 9%, primarily attributable to higher premiums generated from both Optum Health and its health benefits business.While our estimate for product revenues indicates 2% year-over-year growth, the same for services revenues predicts a 33.6% jump from the year-ago level. UNH's third-quarter top-line performance is expected to have been boosted by increased service revenues across the board.Story continuesWe expect revenues from UnitedHealthcare, UNH’s largest segment that sells insurance, to have increased on higher memberships in selected programs. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealthcare’s total commercial customers signals 3.1% year-over-year growth. Our estimate for segmental revenues indicates a more than 8% year-over-year growth. Furthermore, investments and other income are estimated to have witnessed a nearly 47% surge from the year-ago level.We are looking for higher contributions from each of the sub-segments of the Optum business segment, in the third quarter. A rise in the number of people being catered to in value-based care arrangements and the growing strength of affiliated physicians are major tailwinds.Our estimate for operating income from the Optum business segment suggests a 21% year-over-year increase. This is expected to have positioned the company for year-over-year growth in the bottom line.However, rising medical and operating costs are expected to have elevated UnitedHealth’s overall expense level in the quarter. We expect higher costs of products sold to have reduced its margins. Seniors undergoing elective procedures, which were delayed due to the pandemic, are expected to have accelerated medical costs.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UNH’s medical care ratio is pegged at 82.82%, up from 81.60% in the year-ago quarter. Our estimates for medical and operating costs indicate 10.5% and 7.4% year-over-year increases, respectively. These are expected to have affected its profit levels in the third quarter, making an earnings beat uncertain.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for UnitedHealth this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate currently stands at $6.33 per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: UnitedHealth currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for UnitedHealth, here are some companies from the broader Medical space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. APLS has an Earnings ESP of +59.37% and is a Zacks #2 Ranked player. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Apellis’ earnings per share for the to-be-reported quarter indicates a 44.6% year-over-year improvement.

388,71e76a11-eaea-38ad-b4df-c962d2e89e5b,DHI,2023-10-11,7 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Loading Up on Before They Soar,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-warren-buffett-loading-140833031.html,1696428513,STORY,"['DHI', 'BRK-A', 'BRK-B', 'JPM', 'SYY', 'COF', 'KO', 'OXY']","[Warren Buffett, the legendary investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B), has a keen eye for value stocks that are poised for growth. In recent months, he has been selectively adding to positions in companies he believes are undervalued and have significant upside potential. According to Berkshire Hathaway’s latest 13F filing, Buffett boosted his stakes in just five stocks during the second quarter of 2023. However, given how rapidly market conditions can change, some of the best Buffett stocks to buy now likely extend beyond these recent purchases.In this article, I will explore seven stocks that the Oracle of Omaha has been accumulating ahead of what he anticipates will be strong growth. Specifically, I will look at some of the five companies he added to based on the latest regulatory filings, along with a couple of stealth investments uncovered by my research into his other portfolios. While Buffett’s reputation is built on long-term investments, the stocks covered here appear poised for immediate gains as well.Of course, it is important to point out that even the best investors can be wrong about market movements. So, we will analyze each pick carefully, including the likely investment thesis as well as the potential risks. Notably, what Buffett bought a few months ago isn’t necessarily a good buy right now, at least in my opinion. Thus, I will be excluding picks that don’t make sense right now. Let’s have a look at the following seven Warren Buffet stocks to buy right now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B)The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comWithout a doubt, Berkshire Hathaway stock is Warren Buffett’s favorite stock to buy, as he has been consistently buying up shares of his own company. Berkshire Hathaway’s performance has been undeniable, and the time-tested company has continued to outperform in 2023. In the second quarter alone, Berkshire repurchased over $1.4 billion worth of its own shares.Story continuesBuffett clearly sees Berkshire as undervalued and an attractive investment opportunity even at current levels. The conglomerate reported a stunning $71.4 billion in operating earnings in the first half of 2023, showcasing the earnings power of Berkshire’s wide-moat businesses like Geico, BNSF Railway, and its manufacturing, service, and retail operations. Furthermore, Berkshire’s $147 billion cash pile gives it an “elephant gun” for hunting down whole companies or other major investments at good prices. With Buffett at the helm, Berkshire Hathaway remains a long-term compounding machine.Capital One Financial (COF)A street view of a Capital One (COF) bank location in New York City.Source: Northfoto / Shutterstock.comCapital One (NYSE:COF) is one of the five companies Warren Buffett boosted his stake in during Q2 2023, based on recent regulatory filings. He increased his position by more than 25%, making it among Berkshire’s top 25 holding. I’m unsure if Buffett is completely bullish with this name, even considering his current additions. However, I believe this is a great long-term pick due to its cheap valuation. The stock price has almost halved over the last two years, and now trades at just 8-times forward earnings.Sure, there are fears about the banking and financial sector in general. However, with the Federal Reserve showing willingness to bail out banks earlier this year, I believe the fears are a little excessive. Capital One reported strong Q2 earnings, with revenue topping estimates. It is aggressively cutting expenses to protect margins in a challenging environment. Furthermore, its consumer business remains robust, with ending loans and revenue up 18% each year-over-year. As macroeconomic uncertainty eventually fades, the market may realize Capital One is undervalued, providing upside for investors buying at today’s prices.Coca-Cola (KO)coca-cola bottles and cans. coke is a blue-chip stocksSource: Fotazdymak / Shutterstock.comCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is one of the most consistent Warren Buffett stocks (evidenced by its low beta), and while Berkshire Hathaway did not add to its position in KO stock this past quarter, Warren Buffett’s New England Asset Management did. This consumers staples company will continue churning out cash and paying dividends, making it a great buy right now, even if it faces some short-term selling pressure. Coca-Cola reported strong Q2 2023 earnings, with 11% organic revenue growth and earnings per share growth of 11% as well.The company continues to gain market share globally, and has pricing power even in the face of inflation. Coca-Cola also pays a dividend yielding around 3.3%, and is less susceptible to economic downturns than other sectors. With its diversified portfolio of beverages and presence across 200 countries worldwide, Coca-Cola has what it takes to deliver stable returns regardless of market conditions. While not the most exciting stock, it is a core Buffett holding for good reason.Sysco (SYY)Best Stocks for Students: Sysco (SYY)Source: ShutterstockSysco (NYSE:SYY) is another stock Warren Buffett’s NEAM has been stockpiling that is poised for strong growth. His firm expanded its position in this name by 15%. Sysco has lost nearly 20% of its value from its peak, and now sits well below its pre-pandemic highs. Further short-term downside risk remains as inflation could continue squeezing margins.However, entering this stock at today’s levels will likely lead to juicy long-term gains. Sysco is the global leader in food distribution, giving it economies of scale and pricing power that smaller rivals lack. The reopening of restaurants, hotels, and other hospitality businesses Sysco serves also provides a multi-year tailwind. Notably, the company has also been cutting costs and improving efficiency.This is reflected in the company’s recent results, in which Sysco reported sales growth of more than 4%, and earnings per share that beat estimates. Notably, SYY stock provides a dividend yield which is now an attractive 3% as well. With that in mind, its dominance and margin drivers make it one of the best Warren Buffet stocks to own for the long-run.JPMorgan Chase (JPM)Source: ShutterstockJPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is one of the top lending institutions globally. Rest assured, I am almost certain that this business will not go underwater, no matter what. JPMorgan has been one of the strongest financial stocks, which is why it is also one of Berkshire Hathaway’s holdings and one of the stocks that NEAM bought in its latest reported quarter.In the most recent quarter, JPMorgan Chase reported earnings per share of $4.75 on revenue of $41.31 billion, handily beating estimates. The company has produced stellar results this year, even in a challenging macroeconomic environment, thanks to strength across business lines, including investment banking, trading, consumer banking, and more. Revenue soared 34% year-over-year.JPMorgan Chase increased its net interest income guidance for the full year 2023 to approximately $87 billion, driven by higher rates and slower deposit repricing than previously assumed. The bank grew its CET1 capital ratio to 13.8% and received approval for a lower Stress Capital Buffer requirement of 2.9% starting in its Q4 2023. This will allow JPMorgan Chase to return more capital to shareholders.While uncertainties remain relating to the forward economic outlook, competition for deposits, and pending finalization of Basel III rules, JPMorgan Chase remains optimistic about generating continued excellence through diverse conditions. The company has an unmatched competitive position and balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase currently trades at around 10-times forward earnings, which is toward the lower end of its historical range.Given its dominant position and ability to produce consistent returns across cycles, JPMorgan Chase stock appears attractively valued. This Buffett stock remains a long-term compounder to own. It is definitely one of the top Warren Buffett stocks to buy right now.D.R. Horton (DHI)In this photo illustration the D.R. Horton (DRI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comI believe D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) stock offers substantial upside, but it is also quite risky right now due to its connection with the housing market. My personal rating here would be “hold” because it could make strong moves either way, considering where the broader economy goes.In its fiscal 2023 third quarter, D.R. Horton generated $3.90 of earnings per share on revenues of $9.73 billion, soundly beating estimates. The company continues to see strong demand conditions, with consolidated net sales orders up 10.7% year-over-year. D.R. Horton also drove gross margin expansion and reduced construction cycle times by over a month.However, the housing market faces considerable uncertainty looking ahead. Rising mortgage rates have impacted affordability, slowing the frenetic pace of demand over the past couple of years. D.R. Horton has adapted by lowering prices and increasing buyer incentives. But if demand were to drop more meaningfully, it would likely pressure homebuilding profit margins.On the other hand, D.R. Horton maintains a fortress balance sheet with ample liquidity and low leverage. This gives it the flexibility to invest in growth and weather downturns better than rivals. D.R. Horton also has an industry-leading scale, geographic diversification, and an efficient operating model that produces industry-topping returns on capital.With its wide moat, D.R. Horton seems poised to continue taking market share profitably despite housing market fluctuations. But this uncertainty merits caution, until we gain more clarity on the economy and housing market. This makes DHI stock a “hold” for now.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comLikewise, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is also a little speculative, but could soar in the coming weeks. It all depends on the price of oil. Should the economy see the so-called “soft landing” economists think is possible, we will likely see elevated oil prices for quite some time. Conversely, a recession or economic slump could imply at least a 30% downside from here, in my opinion. However, I still believe this stock is a buy over the long-run due to the company’s oil reserves, as well as its impressive dividend.In Q2 2023, Occidental generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.68, missing expectations. However, total production beat guidance by 42,000 BOE per day, as operational execution continued humming. Occidental raised its full-year 2023 production outlook and generated over $1 billion of free cash flow, even with planned maintenance downtime.Occidental bought also back $425 million of common shares in Q2 and has now completed about 40% of its $3 billion repurchase program. It also redeemed another $520 million of preferred equity. Occidental believes it can sustain shareholder payouts above $4 per common share at oil prices of $75 per barrel or above. Yet, shares trade very cheaply at just 7-times earnings.

(NYSE:FCX) Stock A Sign That The Market Could be Wrong Given Its Strong Financial Prospects?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weakness-freeport-mcmoran-inc-nyse-120107344.html,1697025667,STORY,['FCX'],"[Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) has had a rough three months with its share price down 8.4%. But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Freeport-McMoRan's  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Freeport-McMoRan How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Freeport-McMoRan is:13% = US$3.3b ÷ US$26b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.13 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Freeport-McMoRan's Earnings Growth And 13% ROETo begin with, Freeport-McMoRan seems to have a respectable ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 12%. This probably goes some way in explaining Freeport-McMoRan's significant 21% net income growth over the past five years amongst other factors. However, there could also be other drivers behind this growth. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Freeport-McMoRan's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 29% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for FCX? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Freeport-McMoRan Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Freeport-McMoRan's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 13%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 87% of its profits. So it looks like Freeport-McMoRan is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business, which shows in its earnings growth.Additionally, Freeport-McMoRan has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 29% over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that Freeport-McMoRan's future ROE will rise to 16% even though the the company's payout ratio is expected to rise. We presume that there could some other characteristics of the business that could be driving the anticipated growth in the company's ROE.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that Freeport-McMoRan's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Wall Street Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 5 Stocks.As financial landscapes evolve in response to economic forces and global dynamics, the delicate interplay of credit becomes an ever-more crucial orchestrator, shaping the fortunes of businesses, consumers, and entire economies. Credit is crucial for the smooth functioning of the U.S. economy, facilitating major purchases like cars and homes. Businesses also heavily rely on credit through loans, lines of credit, and equipment loans. Credit availability is essential for economic growth, and its scarcity can impede the purchasing of vehicles, homes, and equipment, hindering business inventories and overall economic expansion. Recent data from the Federal Reserve's ""Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices"" indicates tighter credit standards for both consumer and business loans, reflecting lenders' concerns about an uncertain economic outlook. According to Wells Fargo Advisors, this trend is expected to persist, further tightening credit conditions. Despite better-than-expected consumer spending, a significant portion is driven by borrowing, with credit card debt surpassing $1 trillion. However, the savings levels for most households remain below pre-pandemic levels. This suggests that consumers' ability to propel the economy forward is weakening, indicating a potential economic slowdown. Given expectations of stumbling consumer spending and tighter credit conditions, investors are advised to adopt a more defensive portfolio approach. Anticipating more equity downside from current levels, better buying opportunities are foreseen in the future.On October 10, in response to remarks from Federal Reserve officials suggesting a potential pause in policy adjustments until year-end, both Treasuries and Asian stocks experienced notable movements. The yield on the two-year Treasury, sensitive to policy changes, witnessed its most significant drop since late August. Simultaneously, the benchmark 10-year Treasury had its strongest performance since March. Traders, interpreting these developments, increased speculation that the U.S. tightening cycle might be nearing its conclusion. Additionally, concerns surrounding the Israel-Hamas conflict contributed to heightened demand for safe-haven assets. This combination of factors has created a dynamic market environment with implications for both fixed-income and equity markets. After experiencing its most significant gain in six months, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil pulled back, dropping below $86 a barrel. The surge, triggered by attacks from Hamas on Israel, led to a 4.3% increase on Monday. However, concerns escalated as Israel declared that its retaliation had just commenced, heightening the potential for increased instability in the Middle East.Story continuesOn the stock market front, analysts are bearish on stocks such as Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) by trimming their price targets.

(NYSE:DPZ)Price Reaction after the Price Target Cut: +8.58 (+2.51%)On October 9, BofA Securities analyst Sara Senatore made adjustments to the price target for Domino's Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ), revising it downward from $483.00 to $461.00. Despite the reduction in the target price, Senatore maintained a favorable buy rating for the company. This move reflects the analyst's updated evaluation of Domino's Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) within the broader context of the industry. In her assessment, Senatore considered various factors influencing the company's performance, considering market dynamics and potential challenges within the pizza industry. While adjusting the price target, the analyst acknowledges the broader economic landscape and industry trends that may impact Domino's Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) in the foreseeable future. It's worth noting that the decision to maintain a buy rating suggests that, despite the revised price target, BofA Securities sees long-term growth potential in Domino's Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ).LRT Capital made the following comment about Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) in its October investor letter:“Domino’s Pizza, Inc. (NYSE:DPZ) is the world’s largest franchisor of pizza restaurants with over 13,800 locations in 85 countries. As for any restaurant operator, the key metric to consider for Domino’s Pizza is same-store-sales (SSS) growth. Growing same-store-sales are ultimately how a restaurant business increases earnings from its existing assets. The company continues to impress in this criterion with SSS having grown in the U.S. for 40 consecutive quarters, and an astounding 109 straight quarters internationally.Two-thirds of the company’s stores are currently abroad, and the international segment remains the company’s largest growth opportunity, as the penetration of convenient fast food remains lower abroad than in the United States. Pizza is a product with exceptionally high gross margins, one that “translates” well across different cultures, and one that literally “travels well”, not losing much of its appeal when delivered in a cardboard box. The rise of 3rd party delivery platforms such as Uber Eats, Doordash and Grubhub is challenging the pizza category as it has expanded the number of choices consumers have for convenient takeout. However, the economics of food delivery remain challenging for most restaurants and platforms alike25, while pizza delivery continues to be highly profitable. Regardless of how the “delivery wars” currently playing out end, Domino’s financial results show little impact of this increased competition, and the company continues to deliver exceptional financial performance…” (Click here to read the full text)09. DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH)Price Reaction after the Price Target Cut: +0.12 (+2.40%)In line with a bearish outlook, analysts are lowering price targets for DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH), mirroring similar trends seen with Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP). On October 9, Barclays analyst Kanna Venkateshwar made notable adjustments to the outlook for DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH). Venkateshwar lowered the price target on DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH) from $10.00 to $5.00, concurrently sustaining an Equal Weight rating. This move reflects a recalibration of Barclays' assessment of DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH) potential within the context of the broader telecommunications and media industry. As of the latest available data, DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH) current market price stands at $5.12, marking a 2.4% increase. The decision to maintain an Equal Weight rating by Barclays suggests that DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH) is expected to perform in line with the overall market despite the revised price target.ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy made the following comment about DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:“DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH) was lower for more idiosyncratic reasons. The pay-TV provider, with unique potential to become a viable fourth wireless carrier, continues to face challenges executing its wireless buildout in a higher rate environment where a leveraged balance sheet is a liability. We believe there is still value to be captured for Dish, but it is clearly taking longer to realize, and we are monitoring the stock closely.”08. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Price Reaction after the Price Target Cut: +4.44 (+1.16%)On October 9, Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan revised the outlook for Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), adjusting the price target while maintaining a Neutral rating. The updated target has been lowered from $400.00 to $390.00. As of the latest data, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) current market price is $385.95, indicating a marginal increase of 1.2%. Goldman Sachs' decision to maintain a Neutral rating suggests a stance of cautious optimism, indicating that the stock is expected to perform in line with market trends. This adjustment in the price target reflects Sheridan's reassessment of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) potential within the context of the dynamic and competitive landscape of the entertainment and streaming industry.Polen Focus Growth Strategy made the following comment about Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“In 2022, some of our holdings had difficulty achieving revenue growth in line with their long-term trends because of difficult comparisons and changing COVID dynamics. Now, most of these companies have experienced a rebound in revenue growth and have also shown a newfound willingness to control their operating expenditures, yielding substantial margin expansion and earnings growth. For example, Amazon and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) (two of our top three absolute contributors to our return in 2Q) are exercising more stringent spending discipline while revenue growth accelerates, a powerful combination for earnings growth in our view.The top absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance in the second quarter were Amazon, Netflix, and Microsoft. As mentioned, Amazon and Netflix are seeing their revenue growth accelerate after a difficult 2022 while keeping expense growth in check. We expect robust earnings growth for both companies in 2023 and growth rates in the mid-teens or higher well into the future.”07. Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D)Price Reaction after the Price Target Cut: +0.48 (+1.15%)Similar to Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) is facing a bearish sentiment from analysts who are lowering their price targets. On October 9, 2023, Guggenheim adjusted the target for Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D), reducing it from $56.00 to $49.00. Despite this target reduction, Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) current market price is $42.18, reflecting a modest increase of 1.2%. This revision in the target by Guggenheim suggests a reassessment of their outlook on Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) performance within the context of the energy industry. The timing of this adjustment is particularly relevant for investors seeking to understand market sentiments and Guggenheim's perspective on Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) during this specific period.Carillon Eagle Growth &amp; Income Fund made the following comment about Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D) traded lower following the surprise announcement of the company’s strategic review. The company is likely to sell several business units, which will impact future earnings. As a result of earnings uncertainty, we decided to sell the stock.”06. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)Price Reaction after the Price Target Cut: +2.93 (+0.93%)On October 9, Wells Fargo &amp; Company took a stance on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), adjusting its outlook by lowering the price target from $389.00 to $372.00. Despite this reduction, the current market price for Meta stands at $318.36, indicating a modest increase of 0.9%. Wells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski, in light of a higher spending outlook, made this adjustment while maintaining an overweight rating. The decision to uphold an overweight rating suggests that Wells Fargo anticipates Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) outperforming the broader market, even with the revised price target.Artisan Global Value Fund made the following comment about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Our best performing stocks this quarter were Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet and Heidelberg Materials. Meta was the largest contributor to performance. Its shares have almost fully recovered from last year’s declines, rising 35% during the quarter and 138% YTD. During the quarter, the company reported earnings that showed a return to growth and healthy user engagement metrics. Most importantly, profitability appears to have stabilized and is poised to improve as significant cost reduction actions implemented over the past six months begin to have an impact. Separate from fundamental performance, there is excitement over AI’s potential to help the company’s business. While Meta’s technology prowess and massively scaled media platform certainly position the company to take advantage of AI, we believe it’s far too early to estimate any discrete tangible benefits. Overall, we view AI as one of several drivers that will contribute to Meta’s continued growth.” Click to continue reading and see Wall Street Analysts Just Trimmed Price Targets for These 5 Stocks. Suggested articles:15 Biggest Agricultural Companies in the US10 Best Regional Bank ETFs10 Best Infrastructure ETFsDisclosure: None.

(Operator Instructions) And with that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.Story continuesQuestion and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.Bryan Douglass SpillaneSo my question is just around volume. There's been a lot of focus on that topic, not just for Pepsi, but just, I think, more broadly. So I know in the prepared remarks, there's a little bit -- there's some commentary about a shift to small packs. But maybe, Ramon, if you could touch on what was happening specifically volumetrically for PBNA in the quarter? And then kind of relative to what your outlook was for volumes coming out of 2Q, just how that might have evolved as the quarter progressed?Ramon Luis LaguartaLet me step back beyond PBNA to the broader company. We're seeing sequential volume improvement, if you take the last few quarters. So globally, we're improving our volume. But more philosophically how we're thinking about how we're managing the company. There's there's two big variables that we're trying to optimize. One is consumer interaction with our brands. And the proxy we're using for that is units or specific purchasing act. And then the other one is obviously margin for the overall business. And those are the two variables that we're maximizing. In both cases, units are growing much faster than volume. And we're seeing that -- you mentioned consumers moving to a smaller packs. We're also in a way, facilitating that through our pricing and mix strategy. And then we're obviously optimizing margin that, as you saw it was a good improvement in our margin across the company and the particular businesses that you referred to. So that's how we're thinking about volume and margin. When it comes to PBNA, we've been a bit more aggressive than in the other businesses with regards to volume optimization. And we've made some decisions, especially around take home water that we're able to prune some promotions that were not profitable for the business, and that has almost 2.5 points of volume impact. So that's how we're managing volume. It's clearly an important variable for us, but for efficiency in the plants and some others that unit transaction and consumer interaction with the brands are the metrics that we're trying to maximize as we're making these trade-offs between volume -- net revenue and margin expansion.OperatorOur next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.Lauren Rae LiebermanCarrying on Bryan's question, but taking it a little bit further out into 2024, and it was great to get kind of some preliminary perspective on next year, so early. But I was also curious how you're thinking about that balancing volume and price mix as we go into next year because price mix has continued to outperform? And so just kind of thinking about that more forward look as well.Ramon Luis LaguartaYes, Lauren, we'll give you more details, obviously, in February when it comes to the actual composition of some of our key metrics. But what I would tell you at this point, as we've obviously seen all the commercial plans from the different markets and our innovation plans and our productivity plans and our cost trends that there will be still a higher inflation in our business. And therefore, there will be higher price mix versus not the last couple of years, but if you think about the historical price mix that we had in the past, I think '24 will have a bit more elevated price mix in the equation than in the previous years that.Hugh F. JohnstonYes. So right, to add a finer point to Ramon's comments, Lauren, if you think of pre-pandemic inflation being kind of in that 2%, 3% range, inflation is going to be a little elevated relative to that. And our pricing will be roughly in line with inflation. So that should at least give you a rough sense as to how things might shake out.OperatorOur next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.Andrea Faria TeixeiraSo going back to your comments about volumes in PBNA, was that specific to the quarter? Or should we still see about this 2.5% headwind to volumes you included and potentially into the first half of 2024? And if you can also comment on the volumes in Latin America, how we should be thinking towards the end of the year and potentially into 2024?Ramon Luis LaguartaYes, Andrea. So with regards to PBNA, we continue to optimize the portfolio. So we should be probably thinking about a few -- a couple more quarters where we will continue to see volume decisions that, again, we're trying to maximize units and transactions. And we're trying to continue to optimize the margin of the business. And you saw that this quarter and the balance of the year, we feel very good about the margin expansion in PBNA. Now when it comes to LatAm, there is mostly our snack business, what you see there in our numbers. And we've been making, again, decisions around affordability making sure that our brands continue to be within affordable price points to consumers that we know that this possible income is limited, and they make decisions a lot based on price points. So we've been reducing size -- portion size of our products, making sure that we're still very affordable. And that has a repercussion on -- has an impact on the actual volume. But again, the transactions are much healthier. And that's a metric that we used to assess the health of the business with regards to consumer along with brand equity and some other metrics that we use, obviously, to understand full consumer picture. So we'll continue to make optimizations, Andrea, as we need to absorb inflation and make sure that our brands remain a choice for consumers that are clearly more limited in their responsible income.OperatorOur next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.Dara Warren MohsenianCould you just discuss the motivation behind the decision to provide guidance for 2024 a bit earlier than is typical? What do you think your level of visibility is at this point versus a typical year? And as you look out maybe what are some of the areas that give you confidence and what might be some of the areas where there's more uncertainty particularly given the volatile consumer environment here?Hugh F. JohnstonDara, I can answer that one. I think in general, as we build the plans, we're focused on a couple of things. Number one is obviously the level of commodity inflation, and you know we buy forward about 9 months. So that's roughly in line with the past. Number two is the balance of the PepsiCo cost structure. And as we've talked about the last couple of quarters, we've put even higher focus than we've had in the past on driving productivity and driving out unnecessary costs using the tools that we've discussed, the investments in digitalization, the investments in global business services, the investments in driving out overlaps within the organization. Because that work has been going on for a longer period of time, I think that gave us earlier line of sight into what we would expect our cost outcome to be for next year. And then number three, we're in a good spot in many of the developed markets in terms of our commercial plans. We do joint business planning with our customers. And we're probably in line to maybe even a little ahead of where we've been historically with all of that. So given the information was available to us a little bit earlier and given there was undoubtedly questions in the investment community on what '24 look like given the evolving pricing and inflationary environment, we thought it was prudent to at least give some indication of what guidance would look like in '24. So that's what drove the decision.OperatorOur next question comes from Peter Grom with UBS.Peter K. GromI actually wanted to follow up on Dara's question there. But just more in the context of your actual performance versus your initial expectations historically because it's really been a while since organic revenue growth has actually fallen short of your initial outlook. So can you maybe just characterize your confidence in the '24 outlook at this stage and really whether or not you've embedded enough conservatism just given what remains a pretty choppy backdrop for the consumer?Hugh F. JohnstonSure. Happy to address that. We obviously have a long history here of meeting or exceeding expectations, both our internal expectations as well as the guidance, including this quarter, where we beat revenue and we beat EPS. In fact, we've now met or beat consensus for 55 straight quarters. So we tend to be, I think, appropriately conservative in the way that we communicate to you all. So from that perspective, I think you can go into 2024 with a similar expectation that we should at least achieve the numbers that we've laid out for you.OperatorOur next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.Sunil Harshad ModiHugh, I was hoping maybe you can just provide some of the macro underpinnings that kind of go into your 2024 viewpoints at this point? Just would love to kind of get your state of the union on the consumer or the economy and kind of how you guys are thinking that will shape up as you go through 2024?Hugh F. JohnstonSure. Why don't I start and then Ramon, obviously, you're super deep on the consumer as well, but I'm happy to start on this one. Number one, I do think that we see the consumer right now being more selective, and you see it in a variety of ways, right? You see some trade down in terms of channels of trade that they're purchasing products in, you see some orientation toward value. At the same time, the things that I usually look at with the consumer to detect whether there's high stress, we see good results in there. Number one is the convenience store channel. Typically, when gas prices are up and consumer incomes are stressed, you see revenue in those channels under stress as well. For Q3, we saw revenue up 5% in beverages and 8% in foods in the convenience channel. Number two is food service, that's also typically a leading indicator, that's still growing double digits. So I think we've gone into the year with an approach that says, given all that I laid out during Dara's question, we expect the consumer to continue to be cautious. And to the degree that they are worse than that, we've got cost plans in place that we would use to mitigate whatever challenges we face. But we think our revenue outlook accommodates an increasingly cautious consumer next year.Ramon Luis LaguartaYes. And the other thing I would say is all the long-term structural tailwinds of our categories will continue. If you think about urbanization, demographic shifts, lifestyles, et cetera, that have been driving our snacking categories or beverage category, they move from package-to-package. All those things will continue, and they drive a lot of our confidence in our categories, then obviously, we have almost completed. By now, our innovation plans, our commercial plans are -- I think we've got better affordability and premiumization of our portfolio. So we think our share of market will be good next year as well. So that's what's driving our kind of confidence for next year.OperatorOur next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. It looks like they didn't have a question. Do you want me to go and move on to the next person?Ravi PamnaniYes, please.OperatorOur next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo.Christopher Michael CareyThe inflation got a bit worse quarter-over-quarter in the PBNA segment, specifically, whereas in the rest of the segments, the trend is for continued easing. Can you just comment on some of the puts and takes that you're seeing from a commodity inflation standpoint in this segment, particularly and how the beverage side is driving the inflation expectations going into next year relative to food? I'm really speaking to Hugh's comments on above average inflation next year. And just given what we see from commodities in general, I'm trying to parse out where exactly that outlook is coming from?Hugh F. JohnstonYes. Chris, we don't get into by commodity levels of dissecting the numbers and guidance. That's something that historically we haven't done. As you know, the beverage segment is a little more packaging exposed in foods is just by virtue of the nature of the products. But I'd rather not go any further than that to get into the specifics of individual commodities for competitive reasons.OperatorOur next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI.Robert Edward OttensteinI just want to shift a little bit more kind of to the long term. And I was just wondering if you can kind of give us a sense of the vision -- your vision for the business, the beverage business and the food business in the U.S. in light of your large investment in Instacart what you're trying to accomplish there? And other kind of strategic moves you're doing on the digital side and the -- all the underlying work that you're doing in terms of automation and productivity. Just kind of what do you see the business looking like in the future? And how does Instacart play into it?Ramon Luis LaguartaYes. Good question. Obviously, as Hugh was saying, we continue to drive the transformation of the business with automation at the center of it and digitalization as well. With digitalization, we're trying to obviously give much more precision to our decision-making across everything we do from how we talk to consumers, how we invest in our pricing with our customers? How we run our end-to-end operations from agro to the consumers? How we run our routing and everything all these activities that we do to generate value for our consumers. That is an investment we've been making over time. And we continue -- that still is the priority of the company to make the company more precise on intelligence and empower our front line to make better decisions all the time. with the best information possible real-time and ideally forward information. So that is a continuous investment. Now when it comes to Instacart, there is a commercial relationship trying to enhance the capabilities of our DSD system with the shoppers that they have in store, and that is a continuous focus. I think DSD continues to be a competitive advantage. And I think we can enhance that capability with supporting activities from the Instacart shoppers. And that commercial relation led to a very minor investment in Instacart. And just to reinforce the commitment to the commercial relationship, there's nothing more than that in terms of a strategic long-term intentionality with that investment.OperatorOur next question comes from Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank.Stephen Robert R. PowersTwo questions, if I could. One, just following up on the '24 outlook given the visibility you have on cost and the commercial planning at this point. Should we be expecting a relatively even performance and cadence of growth, both top and bottom line throughout the year? Or is there a reason to see that growth weighted first half versus second half? And then I did want to ask on Gatorade because the improvement we saw this quarter sequentially volumetrically did occur. It just didn't occur at quite the level of improvement that we were expecting from a shipment perspective. I think we went from down high single digits in the second quarter to down mid in the third. So I just would love some perspective on how you view that business performing?Ramon Luis LaguartaListen, we will not go into more details on '24. We'll cover that in February and June time. When it comes to Gatorade, we're very pleased with the G2 DSD or the movement of Gatorade to the DSD platform over the summer. We're seeing sequential improvement in the performance of the brand. better performance in August that we saw early in the summer, et cetera, inventory on display and a number of secondary location, et cetera. So that move is working. On the velocity of the brand, we also saw that the brand is improving its velocity. It is true that the emergence of Prime in the category took some share from Gatorade less than other brands in the category or less proportionally to the size of the brand. But I would say Prime impacted Gatorade in a way, some transactions during the peak of the season. We're seeing that the size of Prime in the category getting smaller as we go into the fall, which gives us very good optimism that with the new infrastructure we have with our DSD business, some of the innovation with G Fit, Gatorlyte, G Zero, our powders and tablets that are being very well received by consumers that we have a very good -- we're going to have a very good '24 for Gatorade. So we have a stronger foundation to go into next year with potentially weaker competition. But obviously, I don't know what their plans are.OperatorOur next question comes from Filippo Falorni with Citi.Filippo FalorniSo clearly, there's been a lot of concern in the market around adoption of GLP-1 drugs in the U.S. and the potential impact on your business. So maybe can you comment a bit on what you've seen so far based on your consumer studies, both on the beverage and food side? And how you're thinking that can evolve over the next couple of years, change in consumer behaviors? And then from a Pepsi-specific standpoint, what changes can you make to adopt your portfolio to these new consumer preferences that could emerge if the option is greater than that?Ramon Luis LaguartaGood question. Listen, obviously, we're looking at this along with many other positive and negative potential risk for our business and our category. So far, the impact is negligible in our business. Overall, if you take global consumption, there are obviously a lot of question marks with regards to the obesity drugs when it comes to medical testing or scalability of the usage of this or what is the impact really on consumer choices. So a lot of question marks. We continue to believe that all the structural positive trends that we had to our categories remain, as I mentioned, I referred to that earlier in the conversation. So we're seeing urbanization as a big driver of adoption of our categories. We're seeing middle class development. We're seeing lifestyle and the people snacking to eat, some meals becoming more mini-meals and much more unstructured during the day, being a big driver of our categories, both beverages and snacks. So we're seeing a lot of tailwinds that will continue to drive our categories. Of course, we're observing the growth of these new drugs and its potential impact. The other thing we're looking at is our strategy sound when it comes to portfolio transformation. And everything we've been doing for the last 5, 6 years when it comes to reducing sodium, reducing fat, reducing sugar, reducing the portions of our products, adding some new cooking methods to our snacks, those are all very positive trends that will help us pivot the portfolio if needed in the future. We'll continue to do it. Obviously, it's one of our key strategic pillars. So again, negligible impact today, a lot of these structural trends that are in our category, I think, remain very solid and even we see them accelerating. And our portfolio strategy, we think, is very solid when it comes to a potential protection against some of these future developments 5, 10 years from now.OperatorOur last question comes from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge.Brett Young CooperA question for you on the North American Beverage business. You've said in the past that your our goal is to hold share in that business. when you begin to add CELSIUS in organic business, I'd love to hear how you assess the beverage performance. Are you looking at a whole share with the own portfolio or you distributed brands with component to hold share?Ramon Luis LaguartaYes. Sorry, we missed a little bit of the question, but hopefully, we got what you're trying to ask. CELSIUS obviously is part of our energy drink strategy. We said we had multiple pillars and our ability to distribute in our system, some third-party brands is part of that strategy. Obviously, CELSIUS continues to grow. We've doubled the distribution and the presence in store of the brand in the last year or so, especially in the convenience channel, which is a key channel for energy consumption. That participation of CELSIUS in our drive, makes our full system more efficient. It makes our salesmen more relevant in the store. It makes our cooler more a go-to cooler in the store, and those are all positive that eventually have a halo effect as well in the rest of our portfolio. So I don't know if I'm answering the question because really I couldn't -- we couldn't hear it very well. But I guess you get a sense of the importance of sell-through in our energy strategy and the value we get from both the actual monetization of that distribution, but also the halo it has in the rest of the portfolio.Okay. So thank you very much for your questions and for joining us today. And especially thank you for the confidence you've placed in us. with your investment. We hope you all stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.]"

But the flight to safety has made Treasury yields fall enough to push up equities,"" Tuz said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 134.65 points, or 0.4%, to 33,739.3, the S&amp;P 500 gained 22.58 points, or 0.52%, to 4,358.24 and the Nasdaq Composite added 78.61 points, or 0.58%, to 13,562.84.Ten of the S&amp;P 500's 11 major sectors advanced with utilities leading gains, while the biggest laggard was energy down 0.02% after its 3.5% rally on Monday.Late on Tuesday, Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari said he believes the U.S. economy is on track for a soft landing in which inflation falls back to the Fed's 2% goal but the unemployment rate does not rise sharply.But while Kashkari said recent gains in Treasury yields could reduce the need for more rate hikes he cautioned that if yields are higher due to changing expectations about Fed policy, it might ""need to follow through"" to maintain those yields.Fed Governor Christopher Waller reiterated the U.S. central bank's determination to reduce inflation to its 2% target.Traders put the chance of interest rates remaining unchanged in November and December at around 86% and 73%, respectively, according to CME's FedWatch tool.Later in the week, investor focus will turn to inflation data, including September producer and consumer prices as well as the Fed's September meeting minutes. Friday is when third-quarter earnings season kicks off in earnest.Among individual stocks PepsiCo climbed 1.9% after the soft drinks company raised its annual profit forecast for a third time this year. Rival Coca-Cola gained 2.2%.Truist Financial shares rallied 6.6% after a report that the bank is in talks to sell its insurance brokerage unit to private equity firm Stone Point for about $10 billion.Rivian Automotive added 4.6% after UBS upgraded the EV maker's stock to ""buy"" from ""neutral"".Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.08-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.12-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&amp;P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 51 new highs and 178 new lows.On U.S. exchanges 9.91 billion shares changed hands compared with the 10.70 billion moving average from the last 20 sessions.

You can skip and read the 5 Most Socially Advanced Countries in the World.In today's interconnected world, the success and attractiveness of a nation to global businesses isn't just a reflection of its GDP or the size of its stock market. Social advancement plays a crucial role in shaping a nation's appeal to both foreign investors and multinational corporations. This is especially significant when businesses consider long-term investment or setting up base in a new country.Take, for instance, the tech titan Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). When deciding on locations for its new campuses and stores, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) doesn't merely evaluate the economic robustness of a region. The company's Environmental Progress Report shows its keen interest in regions that prioritize sustainable initiatives and education. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s extensive educational programs and partnerships, such as its collaboration with educational institutions in countries with a strong focus on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math), further solidify this stance.Social advancements such as poverty reduction, gender quality, and sustainability have been linked with improved economic growth as well.For instance, gender quality is a significant factor in social advancement, which could have a positive or negative impact on economic growth. According to the World Bank, around 2.4 billion women don’t have equal income opportunities and only 12 countries worldwide provide 100% equal legal standing to women across different measures, such as entrepreneurship, workplace, mobility, pension, marriage, and more.However, the European Institute of Gender Equality (EIGE) believes that promoting gender equality can significantly boost GDP per capita, thus leading to improved economic development. It believes that initiatives in gender equality could produce up to 10.5 million additional jobs by 2050.Story continuesWhen we talk about social advancement in the global economic scenario, it’s clear that businesses taking responsibility for their environmental and social impacts are likely to perform better. A 2020 report confirms this, revealing that companies with high ESG scores were more likely to outperform their counterparts in the stock market.Another meta-analysis of over 1,000 studies on ESG by the Stern School of Business found a positive correlation between ESG and the company’s financial performance for 58% of the analyzed studies. According to another global survey, more than $30 trillion is now invested in assets that have some ESG criteria, a significant rise from a decade ago.With these facts, companies are now focusing on complying with ESG standards to attract more investors. One such example is Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS). The company introduced the P.A.C.E program to empower women in the global garment industry. Over 1.3 million women across 19 countries participated in this program, yielding high returns for female garment workers, their families, and the companies they work for. Moreover, Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS)’s 75% of employees are women, which shows its commitment to closing the gender gap. This dedication to social responsibility, among other factors, positions Gap Inc. (NYSE:GPS) as a dominant global retailer, with outlets in more than 40 countries.Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSF) is another example of a dedication to ESG principles. With a goal to be carbon-negative by 2030, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSF) contracted the removal of 1.44 million metric tons of carbon in FY 2022 alone. By the same year's end, the company provided nearly a million people with clean water and sanitation solutions. Additionally, since its founding, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSF) has earmarked over $600 million from its Climate Innovation Fund for impactful investments. This holistic ESG strategy has likely played a part in its robust financial performance and appeal to investors. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSF)’s current market cap stands at around $2.74 trillion, making it one of the most valuable companies globally.This shift is a reflection of a global community that's becoming increasingly conscious of its impact and responsibilities. Whether it's nations optimizing their socio-economic standards or businesses rethinking their strategies, the path forward is clear: economic prosperity and social responsibility must go hand in hand.20 Most Socially Advanced Countries in the WorldCopyright: rawpixel / 123RF Stock PhotoMethodologyFor our list of the 20 most socially advanced countries in the world, we used Insider Monkey’s research and rankings on the most civilized countries, most feminist countries, freest countries, least racist countries, most educated countries, and most LGBTQ-friendly countries.

Trusted European partners manage and store encryption keys in local data centers. By isolating the encryption key management in the EU, customers have greater control over the security of their User-Generated Information, including meeting recordings and transcripts, messages, shared files, and voicemails. This adds an enhanced layer of protection to Webex's built-in privacy and security features and the EU data residency program, enabling customers to meet their needs through trusted EU partners.""This new feature demonstrates Webex's commitment to deliver cloud solutions that meet evolving European privacy and security requirements"", said Javed Khan, senior vice president and general manager of Cisco Collaboration. ""It paves the way for future sovereignty solutions for Government, highly-regulated industries, and the upcoming EUCS certification scheme.""Story continuesLeading the Way in Innovation and Data EncryptionThis solution will offer organizations a way to leverage the latest cloud and collaboration innovations while keeping their content encrypted within the EU, with sovereign management over data encryption. Customers will be able to choose a European cloud provider that they know and trust, without the complexity or cost of hosting their own encryption keys, while maintaining control of their data. Customers will have the option to purchase technical support where service requests are managed by EU nationals located in the EU.""We are proud to enable Webex customers to raise the level of control on their sensitive data by using our Encryption Services powered by Eviden's in-house Trustway Proteccio™ hardware security module (HSM), the only HSM granted the Reinforced Qualification by the French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI), in addition to Common Criteria EAL4+ certification and EU Restricted agreement,"" says Zeina Zakhour, vice president CTO Digital Security at Eviden. ""Developed, manufactured, and operated in Europe, our HSM is securely hosted in a data center outside the cloud.""Webex has been leading in end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for years, delivering Zero-Trust End-to-End Encryption for meetings as an option, as well as E2EE for user-generated content. This extra layer of state-of-the-art security will safeguard data from interception. Data is encrypted in transit and at rest so that customers are the only ones who have access to their meeting content throughout its lifecycle.Building upon strong privacy and security featuresWebex already offers EU data residency, enabling customers to comply with data regionalization needs and requirements. In addition, Webex is the first and currently only collaboration and conferencing solution to achieve the highest level of adherence with the EU Cloud Code of Conduct (EU Cloud CoC), a transnational framework for cloud service providers to demonstrate compliance with the EU GDPR.Further, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) has confirmed that the use of Webex by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), meets the rigorous rules for the processing of personal data by the EU's institutions and bodies.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) On Your Watch List?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-53-92-time-put-130030616.html,1696942830,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$57.84 and falling to the lows of US$50.38. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Cisco Systems' current trading price of US$53.92 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Cisco Systems’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Cisco Systems Is Cisco Systems Still Cheap?Great news for investors – Cisco Systems is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $76.42, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. Cisco Systems’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach its true value, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.What kind of growth will Cisco Systems generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 15% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Cisco Systems. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since CSCO is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on CSCO for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy CSCO. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.Diving deeper into the forecasts for Cisco Systems mentioned earlier will help you understand how analysts view the stock going forward.
