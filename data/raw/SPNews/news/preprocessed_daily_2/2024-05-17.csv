This has powered a stock market rally as all three major indices set new records. In fact, the S&P 500 closed above 5,300 for the first time ever.Investors seeking to capitalize on this trend could invest in growth ETFs. While there are many ETFs in the space targeting the growth segment, we have highlighted the five most popular options. These have a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy), suggesting their continued outperformance. These include Invesco QQQ QQQ, Vanguard Growth ETF VUG, iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF IWF, iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF IVW and Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF SCHG.Low rates are generally favorable for growth stocks as they reduce the cost of borrowing, often needed to finance the expansion of companies. Lower rates typically reduce the attractiveness of fixed-income investments like bonds, leading investors to seek higher returns in the equity markets.

Gasoline prices shot up 2.8%, while shelter prices, which make up about one-third of the CPI weighting, increased 0.4% for the third month.On the other hand, food prices were flat month over month in April. Food at home decreased 0.2%, while food away from home rose 0.3%. Prices for some grocery store staples such as eggs, meat, fish, fruits and vegetables and nonalcoholic beverages fell in April. Used cars and truck prices dropped for a second consecutive month. New motor vehicle prices clocked a third straight monthly decline. Prices for household furnishings and operations also fell.The so-called core inflation, which strips out volatile components such as food and energy prices, increased 3.6% year over year, the slowest pace since April 2021 and followed a 3.8% annual rise in March. On a month-on-month basis, core inflation increased 0.3%, below 0.4% growth seen in March.The data has bolstered hopes of the Fed interest rate cuts in September.

After experiencing a surge in demand due to the pandemic, which was subsequently followed by a sharp downturn caused by prolonged COVID lockdowns in China, a war in Eastern Europe, and broader macroeconomic slowdowns that dampened cloud computing demand, collectively, the HDD and SSD sectors are now poised for a cyclical recovery.', 'That is the conclusion reached by Citigroup’s Asiya Merchant, who has been assessing the digital storage sector’s prospects. “Following several quarters of storage digestion, capex cuts and workforce reductions, we expect the storage media industry dynamics to improve from here with the return of pent-up storage demand led by hyperscalers,” the 5-star analyst said. “Total revenues for the storage media industry are poised to grow by ~25% CAGR over the next 3 years, largely driven by total PB growth of ~30% CAGR. Enterprise data is expected to continue to grow at 40%+ CAGR as AI becomes an incremental driver for data creation, storage, and data management.”', 'Against this backdrop, let’s follow Merchant’s argument in detail and examine two storage stocks in particular that she’s recommending to play this shift in demand. A look at the Street’s broader perspective on them, through the TipRanks platform, will also provide us with additional color. Here are the details.', 'Western Digital (WDC)', 'The first company we’ll look at here is Western Digital. The San Jose, California-based firm boasts a market cap of nearly $25 billion, and specializes in memory storage. Its product lines include PC hard drives, SSDs, memory cards, USB flash drives, and data center memory systems. In addition, the company owns the popular SanDisk brand, which is well known for its portable memory products.', 'Western Digital’s products are found in a wide range of applications, including SSD hard drive replacements, embedded flash memory, high-capacity HDDs and platforms for data centers, storage for smart video surveillance systems, and memory for high-end gaming upgrades. The company offers memory solutions for every need, from small thumb drives to multi-terabyte backup memories and storage.', 'Of particular interest to today’s investor, Western Digital’s memory products have found application in cloud computing and AI systems. These technologies lean heavily on high-speed computing – but also on increasingly large storage capacity.', 'On the business side, Western Digital recently reported its financial results from the fiscal third quarter of 2024. The company brought in a total of $3.46 billion at the top line, a figure that was up more than 23% year-over-year and beat the forecast by $110 million. The company realized a bottom line of 63 cents per share by non-GAAP measures, an impressive 48 cents per share better than had been anticipated. The company’s results were driven by a 45% year-over-year increase in the Cloud Revenue segment. We can note here that WDC stock has gained 44.5% year-to-date, outstripping the NASDAQ’s 13% returns by a substantial margin.', 'In another recent announcement that investors should watch closely, Western Digital in March gave an update on its plans to split into two independent public companies. The split will form a separation between the HDD and Flash businesses and is on track to take place during the second half of 2024. Management expects that the split will put each segment in a better position to focus on its own attributes and assets – and to thereby unlock advantages for investors.', 'For Citigroup’s Merchant, who is ranked among the Street’s top 5% of analysts by TipRanks, the return of growth in the storage market is reason for optimism here: “We initiate Western Digital shares with a Buy rating given our view of a cyclical recovery in the storage market which coupled with our view of AI driven storage demand growth and rational capacity additions should enable the company to sustain higher revenue and earnings growth ahead.”', 'The analyst goes on to look at the synergies of the upcoming split, saying, “We believe the business remains extremely attractive given the potential to spinoff the company and unlock value. At current prices and assuming the HDD business trades at a 15% discount to Seagate’s HDD business to reflect higher debt levels and no dividend, implies the flash business trades at a significant (~75%) discount to their peer group. We believe the spin-off should create substantial value for investors.”', 'In addition to starting out her coverage with a Buy, the top-ranked analyst also sets a $90 price target to point toward a one-year upside potential of 19%. (To watch Merchant’s track record, click here)', 'Western Digital has picked up 17 recent analyst reviews, including 13 Buys and 4 Holds, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are selling for $75.69, and the average price target, at $88.81, implies a potential gain of 17% for the coming year. (See WDC stock forecast)', 'Seagate Technology (STX)', 'The second Citi pick is Seagate Technology, another storage company with a focus on hard disk drives. Seagate got its start in the 1980s when it developed the 5.25-inch HDD – back when hard disks were truly disks. Today, Seagate is known for lines of external and internal hard drives and solid-state disks (SSDs), along with data storage systems for professional and personal use, network storage, and solutions for cloud, edge, and data center storage. Seagate’s products are found in a wide range of applications, from backup and recovery to telecom and video analytics.', 'Seagate today can boast of a $20.7 billion market cap and expertise in developing hardware that supports secure and scalable cloud computing systems and data backup infrastructure.

Given Seagate’s opex discipline we model EPS of $6.10 in FY25E and $8.19 in FY26E.”', 'Following her Buy rating, Merchant sets a price target of $110, suggesting that the stock will appreciate by 11.5% this year.', 'Turning now to the rest of the Street, where based on an additional 9 Buys and 7 Holds, the stock claims a Moderate Buy consensus rating.

The new array detects most extended and rare blood groups, tissue (HLA) and platelet (HPA) types in a single, high-throughput assay, supporting future advancements in donor blood matching for extended phenotypes.', 'The latest development is expected to enhance the company’s Life Sciences Solutions segment, which offers advanced microarray solutions for various applications such as predictive genomics, reproductive health and oncology research.', 'Blood typing is a critical medical service used to match blood and tissue types ahead of transfusions and transplants. When an individual receives incompatible blood, they can form antibodies that can increase the risk of a severe, even life-threatening, reaction to future transfusions. This risk increases significantly for people who receive frequent transfusions, such as patients undergoing chemotherapy and people with inherited blood disorders such as sickle cell disorder.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'While testing for the four main blood types (A, B, AB and O) and determining if the blood is Rh positive or negative is common practice, there are many more blood group systems, including some extremely rare blood types. Therefore, research is critical to bring extended blood typing to strategies to mitigate potential risks of hemolytic transfusion reactions in the future. In this regard, Thermo Fisher’s Axiom BloodGenomiX Array and Software are considered to be a cost-effective, high-throughput solution for extended blood typing research.', 'The Array covers more than 40 genes and 260 antigens across 38 blood group systems in addition to HLA and HPA types. It was developed in collaboration with the Blood Transfusion Genomics Consortium, an international partnership of blood services, research institutions and industry leaders that aims to improve the safety and efficacy of blood and platelet transfusion. In a validation study using 14,000 diverse DNA samples from the national blood services of Australia, Canada, England, Finland, the Netherlands, South Africa and the New York Blood Center, the array showed a high level of concordance (99.89%) with participants’ blood group antigen types.', 'For a complete workflow, the BloodGenomiX Array can be coupled with Applied Biosystems BloodGenomiX Reporter Software and the Applied Biosystems GeneTitan MC Instrument, helping alleviate pain points with automated analysis, reporting and quality control. The workflow requires minimal hands-on time and can be run by existing lab staff.

Plank', ""Thank you, Lance, and to everyone joining us this morning. We've got a lot to get through on today's call, including some extended prepared remarks, so let's dive right in. Four-plus years removed from the President and CEO role at Under Armour, I am bringing a clear sense of purpose and 100% commitment with 0 distractions from making UA excellent. I've gained a unique perspective from the Executive Chair Board seat. And while I've maintained a presence in the business throughout, that role was very different from the responsibility and opportunity I now have as CEO to affect the day-to-day decisions of this brand. I look forward to applying these lessons with renewed approach to leadership. During this time, our industry has undergone significant changes, including a global pandemic that tested the resilience of the consumer value chain and increased competition with many new capable entrants that have altered shopping behavior and preferences. However, our aspiration to build the world's best athletic performance brand has not changed. Our goal has always been to be a premium brand of choice driven by industry-leading athletic performance products, inspirational storytelling and elevated consumer experiences. Yet, we have not consistently nor holistically delivered on this ambition. A lack of continuity, increased complexity have challenged our execution with several CEOs and heads of product marketing in North America over the past half decade. Ongoing turnover of critical leadership has been central to our inability to stay agile and decisive. From uneven execution across product and marketing to suboptimal segmentation, wholesale relationships and DTC performance, there remains a significant opportunity to activate more effectively across the dimensions that matter to drive improved brand affinity and therefore, demand. With several of our executive team being new to their roles, my top priority is to bring clarity and stability to our business. Said better, we must make the complex simple and the simple compelling. To address this, we will reconstitute Under Armour's brand strength over the next 18 months by focusing on brand-building fundamentals like making great products, telling the best story about those products and servicing every aspect of delivering our business while building the best team. As a podium brand, meaning 1 of just 3 or 4 global brands that have the credibility of being recognized worldwide as an authentic on-field, court and pitch athletic performance brand, we have an incredible foundation from which to reconstitute a winning culture. And while I have no delusions that this is to be a repeat of how this brand was built the first time, there are certainly parts that will rhyme. And I plan to use every tool of resource or experience available to me and UA to make us successful. That said, I do not arrive at the next part of the call easily, but it is where we are today. We had a confluence of factors, including lower wholesale orders, proactive decisions to restore brand health to our eCommerce and lead times to bring new products to market. We are at crossroads of defensive necessity and offensive opportunity. Therefore, before driving forward, we'll be taking a larger step back in fiscal '25 with an expectation that our revenue will be down at a low double-digit rate. This includes an approximate 15% to 17% decline in North America driven by 3 factors that I will go into later in the call as we work to meaningfully reset this business while navigating an environment made more challenging by our execution in the past. In our international regions, we expect revenue to be down at a low single-digit rate due to some conservative macro consumer trends we see as well as applying lessons learned here in North America to ensure that we protect the brand strength that we've built in EMEA, APAC and Latin America. From a channel perspective, we see our wholesale business to be down at a low double-digit rate and direct-to-consumer to be down approximately 10% due to proactive actions to significantly reduce the discounting level within our own eCommerce business. This reflects some of the foundational steps in our ambition to create a more premium stance for our brand. By product, we expect apparel and footwear sales to be down at a low double-digit rate and our accessories business to remain essentially flat year-over-year. Even with this revenue contraction, we expect a gross margin improvement of 75 to 100 basis points due to the material reduction in promotional and discounting activities through our DTC business and proactive product and costing initiatives. Turning to SG&A. As we work to streamline our business further, we anticipate our expenses to be down 2% to 4% in fiscal '25. This includes a Board-approved restructuring plan to help strengthen and support additional financial and operational efficiencies. While Dave will provide more detail, we expect to incur total estimated pretax restructuring and related charges of approximately $70 million to $90 million. Excluding the midpoint of this restructuring range, we expect $130 million to $150 million in adjusted operating income, representing $0.18 to $0.21 of adjusted diluted earnings per share. This is not where I envisioned Under Armour playing at this point in our journey. That said, we'll use this turbulence to reconstitute our brand and business, giving athletes, retail customers and shareholders bigger and better reasons to care about and believe in Under Armour's potential, a potential backed by nearly 1,900 retail stores and a worldwide presence in almost 100 countries, respected by athletes as a podium brand with a distinctive positioning of innovation and performance that is truly unique. From a product perspective, we're not just chasing the low-hanging fruit of sportswear. We're reinvigorating our culture of blowing athletes' minds with a consistent drumbeat of innovation. We must become a brand of launches, creating products that solve athlete problems while communicating the story of how and why our products deliver. The good news is that we're already doing this. For example, we delivered 6 new footwear drops in February alone: Infinite Pro and Infinite Elite, SlipSpeed Mega, Curry color drops at the NBA All-Star game, the Apparition from UA sportswear and the Drive Pro in golf. The larger problem is that you've probably never heard about any or most of them. We'll make sure that if a product is important enough for us to make and release, it's also important enough to celebrate with storytelling or plainly, we just won't make it. So giving stakeholders reasons to believe begs the question, how do we plan to strengthen the Under Armour brand? It starts by reminding everyone, ourselves included, why we're here. Under Armour is a sports house. This is our reason for being. It's our DNA and identity. Under Armour is about athletes and innovation, leading with team sports. We equip those athletes to push the boundaries of what is possible by inspiring them with performance solutions they never knew they needed and once they've tried them, cannot imagine living without. At the backbone of all this is an authentic passion with an identity of grit. Under Armour was not born on that podium, but of an underdog spirit, the long shot, the athlete without all the gifts who some way, somehow finds a way to persevere. That underdog grit is our differentiator, and we will embrace this mentality in this chapter as a brand.With this brand positioning recentered and solidified, we're narrowing and simplifying our Protect This House strategy to rebuild our core through 3 main priorities: first is delivering better products and storytelling, to amplify demand and loyalty; second is running smarter plays by simplifying, modernizing and optimizing our systems, structure and processes so we harness efficiency for effectiveness; and third, is elevating consumer experiences, mandating excellence where, when and how athletes choose to engage with our brand and transact. So starting with delivering better products and storytelling. This is about the constant and a [movement] with troika, of athlete, product and story, particularly in our North American business. This balance of this triad has been underserved for quite some time.In our largest market, we have become a brand that, well, competes primarily on price versus our core competency, which is performance and technical innovation, an aspect of UA that has frankly gone untold for too long. To correct this, we must reprioritize our innovation agenda by reminding athletes that our products perform like no other in the industry, a flawless balance of science, function and style made to empower them to be the best at whatever they do from Monday to Sunday. We are eliminating products that do not meet our standard to sell much more of much fewer products accomplished by editing more intentionally. Led by our Chief Product Officer, Yassine Saidi, we are committed to this vision, but it requires having one point of view with considerably improved design language, a reduced but more intentional fabric library that includes a clear good, better, best segmentation for distribution, trend-right colorways and standardized fits across all the athletes we serve. Dissecting our execution further, too many areas of our product strategy have been designated as priorities. This has caused operational inefficiency and a strain on resources, which has diluted our ability to have a consumer-centric point of view, consistent storytelling and an effective go-to-market process. Over the past few years, it's also evident that we've taken our eyes off of our core men's apparel business, which, particularly in North America, has permitted this business to become more promotional and commoditized. That has significantly impacted our brand's perception. We will rectify this. This focus does not mean that we are deprioritizing our footwear or women's business per se, but from a sequencing perspective, men's apparel will be our highest priority. We're also reorganizing our product and marketing teams around our largest revenue sports categories of training, running, sportswear, golf and basketball while ensuring that the authenticator of team sports is still our front porch in every region where we compete. Here in North America, the United States, that means our presence in American football, soccer, baseball, softball, volleyball, lacrosse as the core sports we'll speak to and solve problems for with our amazing performance innovation. The specific core sport authenticators will, of course, vary by region. So given the newness of our leadership and product lead times, the critical mass of elevated offerings won't fully come to market until our fall/winter '25 collection, which is the second half of our fiscal '26. However, as we work through this in-between period, I challenge the team to adjust our operating and go-to-market models in 3 actionable ways. First, refine our product assortment and reduce our SKU or style count by roughly 25% over the next 18 months, intentionally decreasing our good discounted level mix while scaling our better and best offerings to drive balance into our segmentation. This will significantly reduce workloads for our teams and allow them to focus and prioritize on making any product that comes from our engine excellent with a product and story that we will be proud of. Secondly, our current go-to-market has only one gear with an 18-month process to get a product from an idea to the selling floor. This is just plain uncompetitive in the 2024 landscape. That said, we'll be pursuing a faster 6- and 12-month go-to-market capability, which was recently demonstrated with the release of the world's first true performance headwear that immediately sold out, the StealthForm Uncrushable hat, which debuted on Jordan Spieth at this year's Masters Golf Tournament that delivered in just 6 months and is now on preorder for athletes at a $45 price point. The StealthForm Uncrushable is also a good metaphor for who we expect to be in our industry: innovative, premium, stylish, and nothing else like it in the market, a product that truly helps you perform better with its comfortable fit, technical material cooling and stretch that feels like a secure hug for your head and deliver to the market with speed. And finally, building out a direct-to-consumer line of exclusive products for our own stores and eCommerce. Wholesale is about 60% of our business and will be hypercritical for our success and how we will achieve the elevated position and vision of the UA brand I'm describing. Yet it has been far too long since we've shown retailers our vision. So using our own physical and digital stores as a proving ground, we will demonstrate what excellence can look like for the Under Armour brand, whether that is through a more premium price point or meaningfully amplified storytelling to drive success. We want our partners to call us because they're inspired by the innovation they see us building and not just what they sold from us before. While delivering better products and segmentation is central to our ability to drive greater future demand, our products must be married with authentic inspirational storytelling and technical education about how Under Armour makes athletes better. Our DNA, reason to buy and storytelling must permeate all consumer touch points. With some of the highest performing material sciences in our industry, including temperature management, moisture wicking, sustainable fabrics, cushioning, compression-based support, to be candid, we've done a poor job consistently communicating our product advantages to athletes. This must be fixed as it's hard to sell something that is a best-kept secret. In this respect, we are working to dramatically overhaul our product descriptions and hang tags and how our DTC and wholesale sales forces are equipped to tout our product attributes. When athletes research Under Armour online or choose our products in a store, it should be clear to them by answering 3 simple questions, what it is, what it does and how it will make them better. Going forward, a simplistic 3-point description of every UA product will be found consistently on our hang tags, point of purchase and website and conveyed by our associates on the floor. Brands are built with consistency. So make no mistake, we'll be strengthening our brand in this chapter. That's not to say we haven't succeeded in marrying these efforts well in our recent path. When our product and marketing engines are aligned, showcasing product innovations with relevant storytelling, we've seen success in driving positive demand. A recent example can be seen at this year's Boston Marathon, where UA athlete, Sharon Lokedi took her third podium wearing our $250 Velociti Elite 2 running shoe, a trend we think will continue. In preparation for the race, we immersed media and influencers in run experience and flooded our social media channels. Of course, there are other examples where we've been running this consistent play and have shown up proudly like our SlipSpeed launch and ongoing business there, our Unstoppable pants and the surrounding collections that make Unstoppable a force for UA and our women's Meridian products where we are building trust with her. We are at our best when we're on offense. We must harness and homogenize this approach more effectively across all consumer connections. Strong product team also requires strategic and operational collaboration with marketing to bring it all together. As mentioned on our last call, we've consolidated our global and North American marketing teams to bring a cleaner, more creative, integrated approach for faster decision-making and improved oversight into our spending and the returns we get for our investments there. Concerning our search for a new Chief Marketing Officer, I pressed pause while assuming the CEO role. And we'll be reengaging that search immediately as we have a strong candidate pool and expect to have this chair filled soon. Over the past 4-plus years, the company has become overly siloed and bureaucratic with competing internal agendas. We now have just one agenda as I'm describing it to you today. And communicating that to internal and external stakeholders is my immediate priority to build complete alignment. Given these changes in iterative evolutions, we are working quickly to disband these silos and drive a more productive, collaborative culture. And this brings us to the second priority within our refined Protect This House strategy, running smarter plays, where we will simplify our operating model, modernize our supply chain and planning process and optimize our cost base to drive greater efficiencies. To begin with, on a broad basis, we are simply doing too much stuff. There are too many products, too many initiatives, too much of too much. To reconstitute this brand, we must be highly focused and prioritize what needs to get done so that our teams know exactly what to do with a clear definition of success for them. As such, we are going to streamline across the organization. We will reduce the number of agencies, consultants and outside experts across the brand, which has reached unacceptable levels, especially in functions like marketing. We are building the talent, and they will now be empowered to run with their expertise and ability to drive our vision. We are also working to reduce the number of reports generated, unnecessary meetings and even the number of fabrics for our designers to choose from. In the overall bureaucracy that occurs when the business scales for being small to midsize to large, in short, we will be much more intentional everywhere. This includes activities that may have had a reason to exist at one time or another but no longer serve the brand. We're now prioritizing to ensure that anything we do or have our teams doing are only the activities that directly contribute in one way or another to our simplest of job descriptions, selling more shirts and shoes. We've talked about being consumer focused for years but never entirely organized our business as such. To enable consistency, we're employing a category portfolio structure designed to unlock the team's full potential, particularly how the work aligns with our talent, speed of delivery and the execution required to put us on a growth path. Under this structure, our product, marketing and sales organizations will work as a collective to develop singular go-to-market strategies that allow each category to obsess the needs of our athletes throughout their journey under the broader UA innovation brand umbrella. We'll be driven by technology and design, enabling us to lead our categories with clear intent and a sharper point of view. This structure will also provide greater visibility in the category and product performance, which is critical to developing greater agility and adaptation.On the product side, there was a critical piece of the puzzle that had been missing to power up this strategy. So a few weeks back, we announced that Yuron White, a 25-year sports industry veteran, had joined UA as our Senior Vice President of Sportswear, Running, Basketball, Curry and Collaborations. Complementing our legacy world-class experts already here, Yuron brings decades of game-changing product strategies, operational excellence and talent development, so we're excited to have him joining Yassine's team to lead those critical categories for the brand. As an important companion to our changes in product and marketing, we'll also improve our supply chain, end-to-end planning capabilities, both of which offer significant opportunity to drive operating efficiencies within our cost of goods sold line. These initiatives, along with proactive moves to reduce discounting and promotions and a reduction in SKUs gives us great confidence in our ability to improve ASPs and gross margin in the years ahead. Being a better, more responsive organization is a big part of our strategy. The natural question is, can we improve our cost structure while continuing to make the investments necessary to reconstitute our brand? Last year, we told you that we expected SG&A to be flat to up slightly. And with today's print, we came in better, even though our revenue was lower than our original expectation. To get there, we pushed hard on headcount and marketing, reduced travel and meeting costs and tightened our overall SG&A. This prudence will certainly continue as we move forward. In fiscal '25, we will optimize our SG&A cost base to ensure efficient and effective spending that supports the long-term health of the Under Armour brand. Of course, it's more than just cost cutting. This year, we will be even more intentional, identifying ways to streamline and realign the entire organization globally to set us up for an even more productive P&L once revenue inflects more positively. Now we move to our third priority, elevating consumer experiences, which is critical to becoming more premium in building better connections with athletes. In this case, we must drive excellence in our retail, eCommerce and wholesale businesses, aligning with our Protect This House strategy. We must ensure that our efforts to deliver better products and storytelling, enabled by a simplified operating model, will manifest through deliberate merchandising strategies and thoughtful distribution choices, particularly here in North America. And this brings me to probably our most important question to answer. So what is happening in North America? The anticipated North America decline in fiscal '25 is driven by 3 factors. The first is sector-specific. We're expecting lower wholesale revenue due to retailer cautiousness amid softer consumer demand in an intensely competitive environment. The second is specific to Under Armour as our softened brand and inconsistent execution were worsened by the impacts of the challenging retail environment over the past few years. The third is our proactive action to reset our business in our largest market by significantly reducing the discounting occurring with the brand, starting with our own DTC business.This reset begins through new leadership here in the Americas. Kara Trent, who is just a couple of months into the role, is a 9-year Under Armour veteran, who most recently led our EMEA region, where she built an accretive brand and business strength over the last few years. She's a leader with a point of view and knows what winning looks like. To arrest the slide in North America, Kara is bringing a strategy to simplify the business by focusing on 3 key areas: digital, team sports and our premium wholesale partners. Our eCommerce business has been overly dependent on promotions and is yet to be a flagship representation of a premium athletic brand. That said, our fiscal '25 outlook contemplates, among other actions, more than 50% fewer site-wide promotional days than last year and a reduction in the depth of discounts on the days that we do choose to promote. As consumers adjust to our new value proposition, these actions will weigh on our top line.The digital goal is to transform our eCommerce business into a significantly more premium platform over the next 18 months. This includes improving our online merchandising, creating a more engaging brand-building environment that encourages our consumers through compelling products with a clear story of why it will make them better. This means more DTC exclusive products and utilizing our new 6- or 12-month speed-to-market process to deliver limited volume products that drive brand heat and help create more brand demand moments. Further, we intend to reduce the number of made-for-outlet products on our website to drive a more premium assortment as well overall. So these actions will benefit us in creating a more elevated product offering and shopping experience for athletes over the long term. It also means harnessing the growing power of our U.S. loyalty program, UA Rewards, where we continue to see strong enrollment trends. With nearly 4 million members, we've engaged members with exclusive programs like a trip to the NBA All-Star game, an exclusive members-only product, including collabs with Logic and Justin Jefferson, which sold out in just hours. Our members also continue to show a higher premium purchase frequency and revenue per member, so we're encouraged about what this can mean over time. As a companion piece of this, as we improve our operating model and supply chain, we'll increase the awareness and velocity when we release new products, ensuring that newness is consistently associated with the brand, underscoring this concept of becoming a brand of launches, products that you never expected but could only be built by UA, telling a better story with fewer, more impactful products. Shifting to our own doors. Though a very small portion of North America's revenue today, our brand houses must become a premium showcase for the Under Armour brand. There is a significant opportunity to improve these stores, and we're working to create a more homogenous look and feel, curated with less product and more storytelling. We're piloting a new store concept now that we expect to test and learn from throughout fiscal '25. Our Factory House business must elevate the consumer experience by reducing unnecessary complexity. For example, in our 183 outlet doors in North America, we're over sorted across categories and have too many different floor sets. This compromises the clarity of experience for consumers when they walk through the door. And from an operational efficiency perspective, it's unacceptable, and we're correcting it with the right leadership now in place. We'll also enact greater discipline and balance between our promotional activities and inventory management needs in our outlet stores. Discounting can drive revenue in the short term, but it's not good for gross margin, balancing market price algorithms and clearly can negatively impact brand perception. In tandem with optimizing our operations and logistics, we believe these actions should lead to higher store profitability, which will have a meaningful impact on our nearly $1 billion Factory House business. Turning to North American wholesale. In my first month on the job, while I still have a few to meet with, I've had top-to-tops with several of our largest U.S. accounts, including DICK'S Sporting Goods, Academy, Shields and more. And as a note, I'll be meeting with key franchise retail and manufacturing partners when I travel to Europe and China before month's end. These interactions with our U.S. partners have been productive as to where we've been and where we are and encouraging as to where we expect to be once our product and marketing engines are reoptimized and firing on all cylinders. Given product lead times, the critical mass of this renewed product vision will not be coming until fall/winter '25 with a build into subsequent seasons from there.So it will take some time for our North American wholesale business to inflect positively. We will be making meaningful progress until then. In the meantime, we're focusing on rebuilding high-quality relationships with our key retail partners. We are confident we'll represent Under Armour in a brand-right manner, especially in sporting goods and mall accounts. But this will only occur for us as long as we stay committed to being authentic in the team sports arena, which is critical for our success. And so we'll continue this focus through team outfitting on the field, court and pitch. This is our differentiator and reason for having a relationship with our targeted 16- to 24-year-old varsity athlete.Elevating our product offering from mostly good and distorting toward better and best level products are also critical enablers combined with inspirational storytelling and more joint marketing with our wholesale partners. We have opportunity to do much more with key accounts. But to do so, we need to drive our aligned product and marketing engines to differentiate our business and convince athletes and our customers to covet Under Armour. Simply put, we haven't been as consistent in giving athletes or retail customers a reason to buy our brand as robustly as possible. As we execute our Protect This House strategy over the next 18 months, I'm confident this will set us on a path towards returning to growth in our critical North American market. We have the right formula for success and are driving forward with clarity and continuity of purpose. With our priority of reconstituting the brand in North America, it's important to explain the role that the international business plays in our go-forward strategy. The attention we are placing on the U.S. business is underscored by our 28 years of learning and understanding of brand management, that in order to be strong abroad, we must be our strongest at home.EMEA and APAC remain vital markets for Under Armour. And our brand is better positioned in these regions than in the U.S. today due to a history of channel discipline across our DTC and wholesale businesses. With consistently optimized brand activations, our expectation for a low single-digit revenue decline in our international business is partly due to more conservative consumer trends and ensuring that we don't erode brand equity by chasing lower-quality revenue.In EMEA, there were signs of retail caution, particularly in the U.K., which is our largest market there, including softer wholesale outlooks and increasingly cautious consumer sentiment and macroeconomic uncertainty. Sensing that trend and maintaining discipline, we expect to grow faster in our DTC channels in the region. And we'll invest in eCommerce processes and systems to support this growth. In wholesale, we'll continue to focus our business on the right partners, working to manage the environment appropriately. There's even more significant long-term growth potential in APAC. Still in the near term, the environment remains materially promotional in China, Southeast Asia and Japan. So our focus is to grow carefully and productively while investing in key markets, balancing short-term performance with long-term brand affinity. So we're not taking our eye off the ball in our international markets. We will focus on maintaining high-quality sales across all channels and protecting our premium brand positioning. Significantly, once we start to see a positive inflection in our largest and most profitable region of North America, more resources will be available to invest outside our home market to drive sustainable growth and profitability over the long term. And with that, I'll hand it over to Dave to review our fourth quarter and fiscal '24 results, provide more color on our fiscal '25 outlook, and then I'm going to come back to close out our prepared remarks. Dave?"", 'David E. Bergman', ""Thanks, Kevin. Starting with our fourth quarter fiscal '24 results, which were in line with our outlook, revenue was down 5% to $1.3 billion with a 10% decline in North America due to softer wholesale demand and lower sales to the off-price channel. Our DTC business was also down during the quarter with positive store growth, offset by softness in our eCommerce business. EMEA revenue was up 10% or 7% on a currency-neutral basis driven by strength in our wholesale and DTC businesses. APAC revenue was up 1% in the quarter or 5% on a currency-neutral basis driven by positive DTC sales, while wholesale results remained flat. And in Latin America, revenue was up 20% or 12% on a currency-neutral basis.From a channel perspective, fourth quarter wholesale revenue was down 7% driven by softer demand in our full price and distributor businesses and lower sales to the off-price channel. Our direct-to-consumer business was flat with 7% growth in our stores, offset by a 7% decline in our eCommerce business. And licensing was up 11%, led by positive results in our North American business. By product type, apparel revenue was down 1%, driven primarily by softness in our team sports, run and outdoor businesses, offset by strength in train and golf. Footwear was down 11% due to a tough comparison and softer demand, primarily in North America. As a reminder, we had robust growth during the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 as a significant volume of footwear products that were previously delayed due to COVID-related factory constraints meaningfully hit the market. And our accessories business was down 7%. Next is gross margin, which was up 170 basis points to 45% and aligned with our outlook. This increase was driven by 260 basis points of supply chain benefits, including lower product and freight costs and 100 basis points of favorable channel mix primarily related to lower sales to the off-price channel. These benefits were partially offset by 90 basis points of unfavorable pricing related to our proactive inventory management actions, including promotional activities in our DTC business and actions to reduce inventory through our Factory Houses. We also realized about 90 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Moving down the P&L. Our SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter were up 5%. Excluding a $58 million litigation reserve expense, adjusted SG&A expenses were down 5% due to ongoing cost management actions, including reduced salary and nonsalary compensation, and driving efficiencies and discretionary spending across our marketing and consulting budgets.Bringing this together, we had an operating loss of $4 million or excluding the litigation reserve expense, adjusted operating income of $54 million. Taking this to the bottom line, we realized a diluted earnings per share of $0.02 or adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.11. From a balance sheet perspective, inventory was down 19% to $958 million, approaching our pre-pandemic levels. And we closed the year with a strong cash position of $859 million and no borrowings under our $1.1 billion revolving credit facility. For the full year, fiscal '24 revenue declined 3% to $5.7 billion primarily due to challenges in our North American business, partially offset by international growth. Despite the revenue contraction, our full year gross margin increased 130 basis points to 46.1% driven primarily by supply chain benefits related to lower freight and product costs. This was partially offset by proactive inventory management actions, including increased promotional activities in our direct-to-consumer business. Full year SG&A expenses were up 1% to $2.4 billion. Excluding an $80 million litigation reserve expense, adjusted SG&A expenses were down 2% to $2.3 billion. Operating income was $230 million or $310 million on an adjusted basis if you exclude our litigation reserve. This aligns with the outlook we provided 1 year ago. Full year diluted earnings per share was $0.52, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.54, a beat versus our previous outlook of $0.50 to $0.52 mainly due to a better-than-anticipated tax rate and lower net interest expense. Shifting next to our fiscal '25 outlook. Given the magnitude of a low double-digit revenue decline, including a large step back in our wholesale volume and proactive actions we are taking to reset our North American eCommerce business, we are encouraged by our expectation for gross margin improvement and what that will mean as we retune the base over the next 18 months. Additionally, we will continue to prioritize investments and manage costs aggressively. As part of this effort, our fiscal '25 restructuring plan amplifies our focus on driving higher returns to deliver more consistent, long-term shareholder value. Within this plan, we expect to incur total estimated pretax restructuring and other related transformational charges of approximately $70 million to $90 million, including up to $50 million in cash-related charges, consisting of approximately $15 million in employee severance and benefit costs and $35 million related to various transformational initiatives and up to $40 million in noncash charges comprised of approximately $7 million in employee severance and benefit costs and $33 million in facility, software and other asset-related charges and impairments. That said, we continue to dig in and may uncover additional opportunities. Concerning anticipated savings and what that means for run rates moving forward, because we've only recently begun the work executing against this plan, it is too early to share those expectations. We anticipate providing additional details on our Q1 call in August. Next, I'd like to provide some color on the first quarter of fiscal '25. From a revenue perspective, we expect our first quarter to be down at a low teen rate, marking the most pronounced decline of the year due to continued wholesale softness and DTC contraction with growth in our retail stores more than offset by a decline in our eCommerce business reflecting our actions to reduce promotions. Next, we expect our first quarter gross margin to be down about 20 to 30 basis points due to a tough comp related to the timing of prior year supply chain benefits and negative foreign currency impacts. These challenges more than offset the benefits we expect to see with less discounting in our DTC business. After that, we expect our gross margin will expand for the rest of fiscal '25 as our product costing initiatives and material reductions to our promotional activities should drive more meaningful improvement as we progress through the year. From an SG&A perspective, we expect to realize close to half of our restructuring charges during the first quarter of fiscal '25. Bringing this to the bottom line, we expect a first quarter operating loss of approximately $75 million to $80 million. Excluding planned restructuring and other related impacts, we expect an adjusted operating loss of $35 million to $40 million, translating to an adjusted diluted loss per share of $0.08 to $0.10.Given our expected revenue decline, inventory management is top of mind. And having planned for this impact, our initial expectation is that inventory will be down at a high single-digit rate in the first quarter followed by slight declines after that and then bringing fiscal '25 to a close at essentially the same level as fiscal '24. And relative to CapEx, we anticipate spending approximately $200 million to $220 million. Finally, our Board of Directors approved a new 3-year, $500 million share buyback program. With confidence in our ability to generate cash, we believe this program provides an excellent opportunity to enhance shareholder value without compromising the financial flexibility necessary to reconstitute our brand as we target a return to top line growth. With that, I'll turn it back to Kevin for closing remarks before we open it up for questions."", 'Kevin A. Plank', ""Yes. Thank you, Dave. As we wrap up today's prepared remarks, and thank you for your patience in allowing us a chance to lay out our strategy and the actions we're already taking at UA, I'll touch on one final question. So what's different this time? And what are reasons to believe in Under Armour? From my vantage point, we've got a lot going for us as an authentic on-field performance brand with more than $5 billion in revenue. Millions of athletes worldwide believe Under Armour products make them better. To be sure, there is much more work to be done. And while there may be 50 things to fix at Under Armour, there are also 500 things that are working really well. We are a sports house, centered on athletic performance and a heritage authenticated in competition.Our refined Protect This House strategy is engineered to cut through the noise and complexity we've allowed to dilute the clear mission that once gave us our core focus and energy. As such, we are urgently working to regain our front foot, put wins on the board that can continue to build over time and optimize our business across the dimensions that matter.I cannot guarantee perfection as we undertake this journey, but I promise 100% team commitment to get Under Armour on a winning front foot. Leading from the top, along with our energized executive team, we will bring a clear unified vision, empowering the organization by providing stability and alignment to drive consistent execution with a clear articulation for all stakeholders of what success looks like. I'll say to investors today that when you buy Under Armour, you're buying a brand, a brand with a formidable heritage that is not easily replicated and one that is more valuable than even the company is at this point. Our job, my job is to close that gap with a strong balance sheet, global presence and awareness, ample resources and a talented team to take the necessary actions to evolve our company. I'll lead from the front foot knowing the name on the front of our UA jersey matters more than the name on the back. And as a team, we'll take care of the Under Armour brand. We are fully committed to shifting our trajectory. And for that to happen, we must change rhetoric into results. And with that, we'll open it up for questions. Operator?"", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from Simeon Siegel from BMO Capital Corp.', 'Simeon Avram Siegel', ""Kevin, so recognizing the tone shift, it makes me think of the last time you successfully focused, I think your words had been building a healthier rather than a [lateral] company or something to the effect. So how do you think about this go around of the brand elevation versus revenue contraction versus the last time you successfully elevated the brand and the gross margins? Maybe can you speak to how you'd expect the timeline of the path improvement to look? Obviously, the focus on brand health feels like the right move. But understandably, it's not an overnight fix. So would love to hear how you think that timeline and any goal posts or hurdles we should be watching for. And I guess, is your expectation in North America would return to growth in '26 or later? And then just if I can, Dave, can you just remind us what percentage of the OpEx are fixed versus variable costs? The gross margin gains are going to be powerful, and they feel key. But just also trying to think through what the right longer-term OpEx should be on the lower revenues."", 'Kevin A. Plank', ""Yes. Thank you, Simeon. And I think that really gets to the heart. I'm not sure if there's a, as I said, a repeat that's available to us, but there's certainly a lot of lessons of what brand building looks like. This is going to be a little different, so we're approaching that way and frankly, just using all the reasoning and thoughtfulness that -- and experience and hopefully some wisdom that we've gained over the years and being able to apply that to this chapter is what's most important. Let me just start because I think this really just nails into what's happening in North America. Not winning here, it hits me and our incredible team. It hits at our core. We are truly an authentically American brand. That is something we know how to do, and it's something that we can fix. I think it's not going to happen overnight, and that's why we continue to use this 18-month sort of outlook that we've been providing. And frankly, we've seen this in the face of the same cautionary consumer sentiment that you guys are hearing out in the market right now as well. The shifting consumer destocking cycle among retailers, bloated industry inventories, so they've been pretty conservative. And we're reacting and we're dealing with that. But as it relates to UA specifically, it's time for us to firm our brand up. And we want to make sure that we're transparent with this messaging as well, is that what we're seeing with the call down, about 2/3 of it is happening to us here in North America and about 1/3 of it is proactive, where we actually were making sure that we cut anything out and we give ourselves room to really start building the base of the brand. Now if there's any positive to be taken from sort of where we are right now beyond the macro environment softness, the majority of our difficulties, as I think I laid out pretty well in the script, have been, for lack of a better phrase, pretty much self-inflicted. And the good news is that we can control that. More importantly, we can address and we can fix that. At the simplest level, we find ourselves, for the most part, when we show up at retail, we're trading on price with more than should be good level product. That's just not who we are representative of the opportunity that this brand has. And we're not falling on a sword saying we just have to be premium. Our eyes are wide open. That consumer is there for us. They're not mad at us. When we do it right, and we get the product and the brand and the story right, and we've seen it with SlipSpeed, Unstoppable, this -- I'm really excited about it, it's a brilliant definition of what our team does. And when our team gets together, that is our team that built that, brought that together and so many other products in the pipeline that we have like that. But contextualizing them and getting them to market, commercialize them, that's where we can be just much better in telling their stories. In the script, I consistently referred to this idea of reconstituting the brand. And that run across product, supply chain, distribution, segmentation. So we must be better, of course, across the board, but it's probably best articulated at the simplest level in our lack of consistent story with our great product. So I'm taking a brand lens to this approach in where I can be the most helpful. And that's really attacking from the product and story and making sure that those 2 functions are truly married. Now of course, there's an entire organization that supports beneath that, but that's where I think we've been most inconsistent and where we can just get better really quickly. We need to ensure that only the amazing products that we make are the ones that make it to market, which is why just taking that 25% off the top, it's just forcing the teams to say, let's make a harder, better decision and make sure that we really, really love it, that we're excited about it and that we can articulate a story about it. So as I said, story is essential to what we're doing, retail, in-store, online, especially with better and best. And so we're going to focus and drive there. But I do want to emphasize, I spoke about the opening we have in the CMO function, but building out marketing with just, frankly, we're so proud I think of the engine that's built on the product side. When you look at from -- John Varvatos joining close to a year ago and Yassine now on board to lead the CPO effort and the ability to attract talent like Yuron White, giving a voice to that team is my highest priority. And it's going to take some time for us to see the goods that are coming from John and Yassine and Yuron and again, complemented with the incredible experts that we already still have here at UA. There's like a worldwide team that isn't -- they're not disappointed by this leadership coming in. They're really inspired by it because they see that this is about a bigger team winning. And everyone, I think, is really excited about our opportunity to do that. I think as you talk about the marketing side, but none of this happens because the 3 heads that we really need, it's product, story and it's the regional expertise. I mentioned Kara on the call, and she's just been a terrific leader who dove right in, in helping us reestablish the relationships with our critical wholesale partners as well as taking a real firm hand on what we're doing with our own DTC. But we're putting the pieces in place for this to happen. I don't have a crystal ball beyond -- as we're talking through fiscal '25 right now. But we do know that this brand deserves to establish our go-forward voice. I think we have a really clear point of view of how to do that and what success looks like. Now it's up to execution. And if we're looking for some kind of a bellwether to measure our success, I think gross margin is going to be a great indicator for us throughout fiscal '25."", 'David E. Bergman', ""And Simeon, this is Dave. Relative to variable and fixed, I think if you kind of remove the compensation cost, which isn't necessarily fixed and just get back to what's kind of locked in, that isn't going to change with revenue. That's probably a little bit less than 1/3 of our SG&A base, something that we've been working on over the years."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Jay Sole from UBS.', 'Jay Daniel Sole', ""Great. Kevin, I'm really interested in something you said at the top of the prepared remarks. You mentioned you have a renewed view on leadership. Can you just kind of take a step back and think about all of UA? Tell us what's renewed. Tell us how you think about leadership today maybe versus how you thought about it before and how it is going to help drive Under Armour forward? I mean it's clear that you have a clear vision about what needs to be done and where Under Armour needs to go. Connect for us how the leadership is going to play into that."", 'Kevin A. Plank', ""Yes. Well, thanks, Jay. I think from the top of the script to the end of my prepared remarks, number one, I love the [80] hockey reference, which is about the name of the jersey on the front versus the name on the back. It's building a team. And we've done a really good job, I think, of understanding what that means to set a vision and power that team and let them run. And we've got capability. And being in sort of the roles that I've been around the company, I've always had the ability, I think, to plug in different areas, but really been able to focus, I think, on building a team. Probably the thing I'm most proud of in the last 10 months is, as I described about our product team with the ability to attract John Varvatos, to get John here, to be able to attract Yassine here, the ability to get Yuron here as well. And most importantly, it was the ability to complement and keep those existing team members, our 15-year innovation head, our 21-year design head now gets to work with John. You're watching our team in sports and working with Yuron and his experience. So that meld of old and new is something that we're just going to utilize agility that we're going to play the best hand that we have. I think at the SCP and above level, we brought in 9 executives in the last 8 or 10 months. And I've been directly involved in recruiting virtually 8 of the 9. So touching this team, it really feels like it's ours. But I think not having to press too much and hopefully that an energy of finding that wisdom where you can tip your glasses to the end of your nose and sort of answer or say much more just through the way that you respond and the energy that you have. And so I'm really looking forward to that and looking forward to watching this leadership team really explode with the likes of Yassine, the what we've done with supply chain and Shawn Curran coming here from 30-year experience at Gap. And now it's a matter of just combining them together and melding that. So it's going to be a little -- as we're pulling everybody together, this team likes each other, and it's just a matter of us running."", 'Jay Daniel Sole', 'Got it. And maybe, Kevin, if I could follow up on that in the spirit of leadership. Are there other potential changes in the management team in the future? And how will you work to retain this fairly new team?', 'Kevin A. Plank', ""Well, I think we're all incentivized by seeing where we are right now is that we believe that we've got a brand that is not trading at the value that it is. And so everyone is incredibly inspired by that. No, I think most importantly, I'm looking for the additions that we are in the market, and we're looking for a CMO. And we'll have that position posted and leaving it open for the best candidates that come. But I tell you, our phone has been ringing. There's this buzz. I keep describing that product organization that we built. And you walk into that product, you can just feel something. And so I feel that obligation to make sure that we get a team to complement and round them out. And I know that we've got the regional leaders between Jason in APAC and Kevin Ross, another former UA veteran in EMEA and Kara Trent here. So we're pretty much stabilized, but there'll always be some limited amount of movement there. But the next one we're looking for is the addition of our new CMO."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim Securities.', 'Robert Scott Drbul', ""I have a couple, if that's okay. The first one is on the international outlook. How much of the macro is driving the low single-digit percent decline in international? Or is there something -- is there a weakness that you're seeing specific to Under Armour? And do you feel like you're being conservative in that international outlook? And I have a second one."", 'Kevin A. Plank', ""Yes. Thanks, Bob. I think that we're cautiously approaching this. Now we've got the benefit of 20 years having done and driven the UA brand and frankly, the lessons in the last 5 or 6 years here in North America. So we're incredibly bullish on the opportunity that we have, especially mid and long term. I think we're being cautious in the short term because we don't want to get caught up in a situation where we feel like we're trying to flood big logo hoodies. Like we've run that play. We've seen how that works. So I think we're bringing a bit of cautiousness and frankly, a bit of experience or wisdom to the way that we're approaching that. But in EMEA specifically is that it's definitely -- it's soft. There is the same sort of inventory issue that we're seeing with some of our wholesalers here. And so we're just -- we're representing a bit of caution there and also that we don't need to push the sales, meaning that we don't need to do anything other than what is in the absolute best interest of making sure that the 16- to 24-year-old just loves and covets the Under Armour brand. And what we've done in Europe, too, it's probably its own little sound bite. We brought Kara here from Europe from the success that she had from going back to 2019, a $600 million-ish brand that ended in 2000 -- or this past year, crossing over $1 billion. And the one thing that's really compelling is that we actually grew contribution margin from 8% to 16%, so doubling that contribution. So we've really been leveraging that hard. So we want to make sure that we can invest there as well. And as I said, I think we have the right leader to take us to the next level there. But what we're seeing are the signs of success. Our largest market there is the U.K. We're the #1 training brand, for instance, with JD Sports. We're within an arm's length that -- at SDI, if we're not #1, depending on the week. So we've got a great base to build from. And I think it's us just making sure that we do this smartly, and we build this as a brand together."", 'Robert Scott Drbul', ""Great. And just if I can ask a second question. Can you talk about the progress -- your view on the progress that you've made in eCommerce and the eCommerce channel? And how long will it take you to get your website to where you want it to be?"", 'Kevin A. Plank', ""Yes. I think that's a work in process that we'll never be done with that, but it's something that -- we've got a tremendous team. And so Jim coming on board has brought a lot of expertise that really parallels into our loyalty program as well that we have in a place that's been really good and really positive for us. So I think we've made great progress when it comes to what we can do in the web. But frankly, I don't think that's probably the best place where I think our product and our story are just not lining up well enough. I mentioned just finding some of the simplistic things to apply brand management, like identifying what are the 3 aspects that make this product desirable for the consumer. So I don't feel like we've played our best game online yet, and that's why we're focused by beginning with eliminating the -- or significantly reducing the amount of promotion so we can have a much cleaner story that comes through on the website."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer.', 'Brian William Nagel', ""A couple of questions. A couple of questions, Kevin, and I'll merge them together to make it simple. But I mean, first off, with regard to -- you talked about this in your script, but the product innovation, the new products coming. I guess just to make sure I want to understand the timing of that, when we should start to see these products. And then with that, the team you've assembled, the team -- a senior leadership before you, there was already product innovation. There's already been discussion about product innovation. Are you picking up on that? Or is there really more of a revamping overall with the product innovation in Under Armour?"", 'Kevin A. Plank', ""Let's be clear. We haven't been standing still. Thanks, Brian, for that question. But no, I mean, we've been moving forward the whole time. So it's not like we're waiting for fall '25. We're still going to move $5 billion plus of product this year. So there are athletes out there that have us. And I think the base that we have from team sports across the board is something we're really excited about. And we have -- I think it's just more of a focus. This goes back to the trimming the number of SKUs that we have and being really clear with our outlook there. But Unstoppable for us is working in an incredible way and something which is our -- basically our jogger pants line that we have in 5 or 6 different expressions. We've really made a commitment to driving and really getting back to the fundamentals of what makes UA, UA. Our base layer compression, as we call it here, heat gear and cold gear. We've tested that, for instance, in DSGs, Houses of Sport, and it's something that's done really well for us, and that's an area that we'll continue to expand. But it's really just reanchoring and resetting ourselves. We talked about how that men's apparel is going to be a priority for us. Just because it's the lowest hanging fruit where we can win the easiest for us, it doesn't mean we're going to neglect what we're doing on the women's front, the opportunity we have there. It doesn't mean we're going to neglect footwear, and that's why we're bringing these footwear experts across the industry. And I think that's what's so exciting. We, first and foremost, need to make sure that we're authenticating ourselves. And that's why I talked about the front porch of team sports. Revenue-wise, that aligns up through the 5 key categories that I mentioned in the script. But we know where we need to be better. And this isn't like we're just going to go turn on the faucet, and all of a sudden, sportswear is going to be the answer, it's that we have to drive and grind this thing the right way with making sure that every product that we put to the consumer is something that has them say, wow. It's making sure that we're approaching all these things, as I say, is that any product that we build, number one, there's 3 functions that I've asked for our product teams to do. Number one is edit and innovate, and that speaks to the 25% decline. It means being faster with the way that we are looking at product. Number two is ensuring that every product that we build begins with the athlete story of the problem that it's solving for. I just don't think we've done a good enough job there. But we've got places that are winning right now, our Vantage collection, our Meridian collection. On the footwear side, Curry is something that still, we think, has a massive upside and opportunity for us. And then we'll keep driving innovation with exploration like we did in accessories with the new StealthForm Uncrushable hat.And so as we start to replicate that and become more famous for less things, I'd like to say, companies are built because they made one product famous. Brands are built because they do it over and over again. So we need to focus on doing that through our product engine and making sure that that's not going to happen unless we have an amazing story to be told. And getting those 2 things up to speed, I think, almost go hand in hand."", 'Brian William Nagel', ""That's very helpful. I appreciate that. And then as a follow-up, and I guess bigger picture as well. You're talking about and others have talked about the more promotional environment within the space broadly. So I guess the question I have there, I mean, one, do you view that as more shorter term in nature? And then secondly, this is the bigger picture part. I mean for those of us who have followed Under Armour for a while, we remember very clearly when the brand was very successful. As you look at the competitive landscape now, you're putting aside some of these promotions. Do you still see that clear lane for the Under Armour brand when Under Armour's performing well? Or has competition changed that lane?"", 'Kevin A. Plank', ""Yes. Thank you. I can't speak to the -- I'm not a prognosticator on what the market has in front of us or what happens on a broad basis. But we know that we're -- I think we're just playing the hand that's right in front of us today. We're giving information, which is why we've really just -- when I say it's almost like running the company by constraints. It's like let's just take -- let's take a smaller bite. We've got 100 miles in front of us. We're going to work the 3 feet that's right in front of us right now. And I think this is what it's telling us, so that's what we're going to respond to. What I want to say about UA, it's interesting because I think about this deeply. Our authentification of being in team sports as I described it in the remarks as a podium brand, it's such a unique position. And you look at anyone else that's out there, I think where Under Armour stands alone is that there's big companies, you can call them old money, there's the cool kids. They're sort of the Sunday leisure league crowd, but there's no one that stands up for the little guy, for the athlete that was not picked first, for the long shot, the underdog.I think that representation for UA, it probably has a story that speaks to virtually everyone on the planet. And it's a position I feel that we own completely uniquely. I don't approach this as saying that's something that's god-given for us for the rest of time. So we better act on it soon. And that's -- we're playing that humble and hungry mentality that Under Armour long shot overcoming. And it's probably a really good metaphor for where we are right now. So I'm excited about what the future holds for us. I'm excited about this unique position that we hold in the marketplace. Now we just need to make sure that we deliver the product and the story together at once as the way it relates and goes and shows up at retail."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Sam Poser from Williams Trading.', 'Samuel Marc Poser', ""Kevin, I just -- a couple of things. You talked about Europe as it relates to the United States. And I'm wondering in the U.S. trying to elevate the brand, does this mean that you're going to cut off some of the more moderate distribution in order to elevate it to get away from -- over time to get to elevate the brand and make -- sort of force better and best to have more prevalence? And I have a follow-up."", 'Kevin A. Plank', ""Yes. I don't think that we -- we like our distribution today. I don't -- that will be part of the exercise as it always is, is constantly culling our retail partners. But it's also -- it's walking into some partners. And some of this, Sam, it's been as much on us of we do walk into one of our premium or close to premium sporting goods stores even here in the States. And the only thing that's leading or explaining what the product is, is the price that's in the upper left-hand corner. And it's hard to explain the difference between a $20 graphic T-shirt and a $45 Vantage T-shirt that has RUSH technology, and it's just not clearly articulated. So I think we're probably in a pretty good space. We may contract some of the doors and make sure that we're only coming through -- and some of those retailers. It's on the table always for us as well. But that's something 6 weeks in the job, we'll continue to evaluate. But for the most part, I just want to -- my main priority is focusing on the product that goes to anyone and ensuring that, that product and story show up hand in hand."", 'Samuel Marc Poser', ""And then what made you -- I mean this is a combined question. You said -- I want to know what led the decision for you to step back into this role. And to follow up on Jay's question, over the last few years, what have you learned? And how are you going to approach it to -- what have you learned over the last few years to -- that made you step back in and believe that it was time? And then secondly, you said earlier that everybody should be focusing on selling shirts and shoes. But I get -- I've had the issue with brand first, product first. And I'm wondering, is it sell shirts and shoes to the right people at the right time at the right price versus just selling shirts and shoes?"", 'Kevin A. Plank', ""Yes. Well, first of all, I think the ability to step away, it allowed me to get a lot of reflection of, number one, taking a breath after 24 years of running hard with the company since beginning in '96 or 25 years doing that. I got to watch my kid -- my son and my daughter play high school sports. I got to watch graduations. And I got to take a bit of a beat. That's not to say that I haven't been close or near the business at the same time. I've been watching the business, just from a different chair. And there's a very different outlook that you can have as coming from being the Chairman to being the active CEO and being able to actually affect day-to-day decisions. So I view this, honestly, Sam, I've been pinching myself for the last 6 weeks. I've done different things, but I realized that what I do love doing is selling shirts and shoes. And in doing that, let me just be really clear, this isn't just selling any shirts and shoes. It's selling the best shirts and shoes. In the product spectrum of good, better, best, I think Under Armour makes a lot of good, some better and nowhere near enough best. We're going to focus on that. And again, this isn't just with an eye on we should do it because we see ourselves as a premium brand. It's because I do believe that Under Armour has that upside, and we're also going to make sure that we pay the rent. And so we'd like to secure and solidify this good level of business, and we want to emphasize and focus on our better and best level business. And I can tell you confidently that we have the product engine and team now in place, both legacy as well as the new additions that have come on to lead this with Yassine at the top of that engine. I owe them and I owe this organization, this organization owes itself a great storytelling function. And we have some great people on our marketing teams, but we need to put all those pieces together and get product and story to be one functioning engine for us to sell only and mostly focusing on more, better and best as we look to grow from where we are today."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu from BNP Paribas.', 'Laurent Andre Vasilescu', ""I wanted to ask about the guide for international being down low single digits. Is that on a reported basis or a constant currency basis? And then, Kevin, I think you mentioned that the environment in China is very promotional. Can you provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing in that marketplace overall and how you're thinking about that business, that geography for fiscal year '25?"", 'David E. Bergman', ""Laurent, this is Dave. I'll jump in on this one. I don't want Kevin to lose his voice. So I think that -- a couple of different things. When we think about the high-level lead-in, I think Kevin gave a lot of color around that relative to how we're kind of smartly approaching our international and our growth and being prudent about that. I think within APAC, and this is actually consistent with EMEA as well, the DTC growth, we do see it being offset by some of the wholesale and distributor slowdown and caution that we see. So where we can directly control and drive the brand within DTC, we see that growing well. But it is some challenges in the markets with the wholesale and distributors. Within APAC more specifically, I would say that it's a little bit around the retail and eComm traffic, but we're driving against that very well. We've also got a little bit of pressure with a partner in South Korea that we're working through. There are some financial pressures there. But we are planning to increase our APAC store fleet by more than 80 doors this year, and that's more back half weighted. And we're excited about the upcoming Curry tour in Asia as well, which is really going to help from a brand voice and energy perspective. Within EMEA, Kevin alluded to this, but we have seen some higher inventory levels within some of our retail partners as we finished out fiscal '24. And that does impact the fiscal '25 orders a little bit. And so we planned for that appropriately. We do believe that, that's more of a temporary situation. And as those inventory levels clean up, you would expect better order flow coming through because the brand is very strong in EMEA. And we have great relationships with our partners there. So a little bit of caution maybe, a little bit of prudence, making sure that we're fueling the brand, making sure we're not chasing any revenue that's not the most premium revenue that we want to get after and just playing a smart game going forward."", 'Laurent Andre Vasilescu', ""That's very helpful."", 'Kevin A.

Maybe for the audience, can you just parse out where did marketing go for -- as a percentage of sales for 4Q? And as we think about the SG&A guide for the year of down 2% to 4% to your point, Kevin, you mentioned how you were able to manage that for fiscal year '24. Where does marketing as a percentage of sales go for fiscal year '25?"", 'David E. Bergman', ""Yes. So when we think about marketing throughout all of fiscal '24, we ran pretty close to kind of the 10% of revenue mark. So little fluctuations up and down. I think Q4 is probably high 9%, really close to 10%, finishing out the year at about 10%. And that play for fiscal '25 isn't significantly different. We've rebalanced some of that and really making sure that we're prioritizing the marketing investments. And Jim has done an excellent job working with the teams on that.

Still, adjusted earnings per share of 11 cents came in better than the 7 cents analysts were projecting, according to Yahoo Finance.', 'Revenues for the three months ended March 31 slipped 4.7 percent to $1.33 billion from $1.4 billion. Apparel sales dipped 1 percent to $877 million, footwear sales dropped 11 percent to $338 million, and accessories were down 7 percent to $89 million.', 'In the year, revenue was down 3 percent to $5.7 billion, and net income was $232 million, down from $374 million the prior year.', 'For fiscal 2025, overall sales are expected to be down in the low double digits, and adjusted earnings per share are expected to tally 18 cents to 21 cents, well below the 59 cents analysts forecast on average.\xa0The stock closed down 1.3 percent to $6.71 on Thursday.', '“Due to a confluence of factors, including lower wholesale channel demand and inconsistent execution across our business, we are seizing this critical moment to make proactive decisions to build a premium positioning for our brand, which will pressure our top and bottom line in the near term,” Plank said. “Over the next 18 months, there is a significant opportunity to reconstitute Under Armour’s brand strength through achieving more by doing less and focusing on our core fundamentals: driving demand through better products and storytelling, running smarter plays like simplifying our operating model, and elevating our consumer experience. In parallel, we’re focused on cost management and implementing the strategies necessary to grow our brand and improve shareholder value as we move forward.”', 'The restructuring is going to be felt in every part of the company. North America, Under Armour’s largest market, is expected to have a sales decline of between 15 percent and 17 percent in fiscal 2025 as the company repositions itself at a more-elevated level and reins in promotions, he said. International sales are expected to be down in the low-single digits, wholesale sales are similarly seen dropping in the low-single digits, and direct-to-consumer sales are expected to be down about 10 percent as Under Armour reduces markdowns within its own e-commerce channel.', 'Apparel and footwear sales are expected to be down in the low double-digit range, he said, with accessories remaining flat year-over-year. But the company is projecting a gross margin improvement of 75 to 100 basis points due to the planned reduction in discounting and better product offerings.', 'In his first remarks since returning to the top post of the company he founded in his grandmother’s basement in 1995, Plank said his top priority is to bring “clarity and stability” to the business that he characterized as one of just three or four global brands that have the credibility of being recognized worldwide as an authentic on-field, court and pitch athletic performance brand.', 'But Plank doesn’t expect to run the same plays as he did when starting the company because the climate today is much different.', 'In his prepared remarks, Plank said innovation will remain at the core of the business. He pointed to the six new footwear drops the company released in February as an example, including Infinite Pro, Infinite Elite and SlipSpeed Mega. “The larger problem is that you probably never heard about any or most of them,” he said. “We’ll make sure that if a product is important enough for us to make and release, it’s also important enough to celebrate with storytelling or we just won’t make it.”', 'He said in North America, Under Armour has become a brand that “competes primarily on price versus our core competency, which is performance and technical innovation, an aspect of UA that has frankly gone untold for too long.”', 'But that storytelling will take place on a lot less product. He pointed to the company’s newly named chief product officer Yassine Saidi as the person who will serve as the gatekeeper. The style count will be reduced by 25 percent over the next 18 months, Plank said, with a focus on eliminating discount product and expanding the more-elevated merchandise.', '“Too many areas of our product strategy have been designated as priorities,” Plank said. “This has caused operational inefficiency and a strain on resources, which has diluted our ability to have a consumer-centric point of view, consistent storytelling and an effective go-to-market process. Over the past few years, it’s also evident that we took our eyes off our core men’s apparel business, which, particularly in North America, has permitted this business to become more promotional and commoditized. That has significantly impacted our brand’s perception. We will rectify this. This focus does not mean that we are de-prioritizing our footwear or women’s business per se, but from a sequencing perspective, men’s apparel will be our highest priority.”', 'The company will also concentrate its efforts on its core sports of football, soccer, baseball, softball, volleyball and lacrosse.', 'He complimented Under Armour’s chief design officer, John Varvatos, whose first product for the company will begin hitting the market shortly, as well as Yuron White, a 25-year sports industry veteran, who recently joined Under Armour as senior vice president of sportswear, running, basketball/Curry and collaborations, as key to the future.', '“I think we have a really clear point of view of…what success looks like. Now it’s up to execution.”', 'Plank will work to quicken Under Armour’s speed-to-market. He said right now, it takes 18 months for a product to move from an idea to the selling floor, which he said is “just plain uncompetitive in a 2024 landscape.” Instead, the company will pursue a six- to 12-month turnaround.', 'Under Armour expects to enhance the messaging in its own channels as a way to show its wholesale partners — wholesale accounts for 60 percent of sales — “what excellence can look like for the Under Armour brand.” Toward this end, the company will “dramatically overhaul our product descriptions and hang tags,” he said, “to tout our product attributes” and answer these questions: “what it is, what it does and how it will make them better.”', 'But creating innovative products can fall short without a strategic marketing plan to tout their attributes and Under Armour is currently searching for a chief marketing officer to lead that charge.', 'Plank said that over the past four years when he served as executive chairman and not CEO, “the company has become overly siloed and bureaucratic with competing internal agendas. We now have just one agenda…and my immediate priority…is to disband these siloes and drive a more-productive collaborative culture.”', 'This will result in a streamlining of the organization with a focus on the simplest of missions: “selling more shirts and shoes.” Plank did not say how many layoffs are planned or in what areas and a spokesperson said the company was not providing specifics beyond Plank’s remarks.', 'Turning to North America, Plank said the anticipated decline in sales in fiscal 2025 is due partially to “retailer cautiousness and softer consumer demand in an intensely competitive environment,” as well as to the company’s own “inconsistent execution,” exacerbated by discounting in its own DTC channels. He said there will be 50 percent fewer site-wide promotional days in fiscal ’25 along with a reduction in the size of the discounts as the company transitions into a “significantly more premium platform over the next 18 months.”', 'The amount of merchandise in its 183 outlet stores, which account for nearly $1 billion in sales, will be reduced as well and its full-price Brand House doors will “become a premium showcase for the Under Armour brand.”', 'Outside the U.S., Plank cited a softer wholesale outlook in the U.K., its largest market in Europe, but “significant long-term growth potential” in Asia.', 'Despite Plank’s long and detailed explanation of his turnaround strategy, the reaction on Wall Street was mixed with most analysts saying they believe the company is moving in the right direction, but citing that it will undoubtedly take some time before the effects are realized. The stock closed down 1.3 percent to $6.71 on Thursday.', 'Simeon Siegel of BMO Capital Markets rated the stock as outperform, noting that there will undoubtedly be initial share pressure, “but this may signify a material step in the right direction.”', 'Citing\xa0 a fiscal 2025 outlook well below Wall Street expectations, Sharon Zackfia of William Blair downgraded the company from outperform to market perform, saying: \xa0“While the goal of resetting the brand to a more premium positioning while narrowing the focus to core fundamentals could very well prove to be a meaningful catalyst over the longer term, the reality is that this will take time to unfold.”', 'Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said Under Armour can only blame its poor performance on itself since other sports brands such as On Running and Lululemon have been doing well.', 'Plank took over as CEO on April 1, succeeding Stephanie Linnartz, the former president of Marriott International who had been named president and CEO just over a year earlier. Linnartz remained with the company as an adviser through April 30 and received a severance package of $2.6 million in cash, eqaul to two times her base salary, as well as a performance bonus, vesting of stock worth $7.3 million as of their grant date, payment of her health benefits for 24 months and payment of the lease of her Baltimore apartment through the middle of this year.', 'Best of WWD', 'Harvey Nichols Sees Sales Dip, Losses Widen in Year Marred by Closures', 'Nike Logs $1.3 Billion Profit, But Supply Chain Issues Persist', 'Zegna Shares Start Trading on New York Stock Exchange']"

The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable.', 'The ratings reflect Agrinational’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as strong, as well as its adequate operating performance, limited business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management. The company also receives rating enhancement provided by its ultimate parent, Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) [NYSE: ADM].', 'Agrinational’s strong balance sheet strength is supported by its risk-adjusted capitalization at the strongest level, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR), conservative investment strategy, and appropriate reinsurance structure in place with highly rated reinsurers. In addition, the company is afforded financial flexibility and support from ADM. Agrinational’s adequate operating performance reflects the positive trend in its improved combined and operating ratios resulting from the benefits of the company’s strategy in focusing on its core business while exiting from restrictive and non-core exposures. While the company produced net loss results in 2023 due to large claims, management expects operating performance to return to its positive trend in the near term. Agrinational has a low cost-expense structure and a keen underwriting focus with an emphasis on risk management controls, which are well-integrated with those of its parent. Agrinational provides a variety of coverages with a focus on commercial property and marine coverages, workers’ compensation, general liability and a medical expense cost containment program for ADM.', 'The ratings also reflect rating enhancement provided to Agrinational by ADM, one of the world’s largest agricultural processors and food ingredient providers. Agrinational holds a strategic position within ADM, serving a critical role in meeting certain global insurance requirements and providing risk management services to ADM and its subsidiaries. ADM in turn provides implicit and explicit support to Agrinational.', ""This press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best’s website.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates."", 'The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 23. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.', ""While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise."", 'Zacks Consensus Estimate', 'This maker of TurboTax, QuickBooks and other accounting software is expected to post quarterly earnings of $9.34 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.7%.', 'Revenues are expected to be $6.63 billion, up 10.3% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Estimate Revisions Trend', 'The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.2% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Intuit?', ""For Intuit, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.41%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.', 'So, this combination indicates that Intuit will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Intuit would post earnings of $2.29 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.63, delivering a surprise of +14.85%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", 'Intuit appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.', ""An Industry Player's Expected Results"", 'Synopsys (SNPS), another stock in the Zacks Computer - Software industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $3.01 for the quarter ended April 2024. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +18.5%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.51 billion, up 8.4% from the year-ago quarter.', 'Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Synopsys has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -1.55%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.', 'When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Synopsys will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

That income, reinvested over time, silently creates small fortunes.', 'Investing in tobacco stocks will not result in the creation of an overnight fortune. Instead, time is necessary. Yet, sensible investors know that it takes time to build wealth and tobacco stocks are a great source of the dividends with which to do so.', 'The other benefit of investing in tobacco stocks is that they are currently underappreciated.

However, add in its dividend yielding almost 9% and those returns rise near 12%. Given that the S&P 500 rises roughly 10% annually, there’s a strong case for investing in Altria once its dividend is considered.', 'Furthermore, the company continues to handle the pivot away from cigarette smoking well. Altria’s most recent earnings topped estimates allowing the company to reaffirm guidance for the year.', 'Altria also enacted an accelerated share repurchase program a month and a half ago.

It serves as a strong counterpoint to those fears. Shares currently trade for less than $30 but are expected to rise close to $40. Each share also includes $2.97 of dividends annually. All told, the base case suggests that investing in British American Tobacco shares will result in a return exceeding 42%.', 'British American Tobacco is moving through the same pivot that is affecting all cigarette manufacturers. It seems to be handling the shift well, finding new growth in the process. British American tobacco’s ‘new categories’ became profitable in 2023, 2 years ahead of schedule.

It offers a lot of the same as Altria and British American Tobacco overall. However, it does have a slightly lower yielding dividend, at 5.3%.', 'How one views those lower yields is a matter of opinion. to some, they represent a relative benefit in that they don’t require as much from earnings.

Notably, Nexstar delivered record sales for the first quarter at $1.28 billion which increased 2% year over year and was roughly on par with estimates.', 'Soaring EPS Estimates: Indicative of now being a good time to buy Nexstar’s stock is that EPS estimates for fiscal 2024 have spiked 4% in the last week from projections of $26.73 a share to $27.82 per share.', 'This would be an 188% increase from EPS of $9.64 in 2023 and while FY25 earnings are expected to dip to $19.64 per share estimates have climbed 8% from projections of $18.19 a share seven days ago.', 'Dividend: Magnifying Nexstar’s immense profitability and separating its stock from other companies that primarily focus on growth and don’t offer or have a significant payout to shareholders is that NXST has a 3.76% annual dividend yield.', 'Better still, Nexstar has increased its payout in each of the last five years for an annualized dividend growth rate of 31.49% during this period. Nexstar’s 57% payout ratio also suggests there may be room for more dividend hikes in the future.', 'Return on Equity: Further illustrating Nexstar’s value to shareholders is a 17% trailing twelve-month ROE which has impressively topped its industry’s 0.33% and is closer to the S&P 500’s 25% average.', 'P/E Valuation: With rising EPS estimates offering further support, it’s also noteworthy that NXST trades at just 6.7X forward earnings which is a significant discount to the industry average of 26.8X and Fox at 10.1X.', 'Proving to be a viable investment, Nexstar’s total return (including dividends) over the last five years is +83% which has largely outperformed the Zacks Broadcasting-Radio and TV Market’s +13% and is near the S&P 500’s +103%.', 'After exceeding lofty earnings expectations for the first quarter, Nexstar’s stock looks very promising in terms of growth and offers sound value to investors at its current levels.', 'The increased need for online marketing and sales following the pandemic led to higher demand for IT services but the frenzy is beginning to slow and it may be time to sell ASGN’s stock.', 'As an integrated critical IT solutions provider that offers professional staffing, ASGN’s stock lands a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and the Bear of the Day.', 'Making it more apparent to sell is that ASGN’s stock has soared +60% over the last year and now may be a good time to take profits as earnings estimate revisions have continued to decline.', 'Notably, fiscal 2024 earnings estimates are now down -9% in the last 60 days while FY25 EPS estimates have dropped -10%.', 'Trading at $102, ASGN’s stock still trades at a reasonable 18.9X forward earnings multiple but when considering the company’s long-term growth rate there are some concerns.

In the 1970s, the spike in oil prices propelled inflation to a double-digit rise, while GDP growth was relatively flat, leading to stagflation in the economy.', 'However, to compare the 1970s with the present economic situation must be an over-the-top expectation. But a small bout of stagflation is likely since an increase in prices of indispensable commodities and services came in hotter than expected. At the same time, the economy expanded at the slowest pace in the first quarter of the two years.', 'Wholesale prices scaled upward in April, a tell-tale sign that it might take time for inflationary pressure to ebb. The producer price index (PPI) increased 0.5% last month, higher than analysts’ expectations of an increase of 0.3%, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Core PPI, which excludes the volatile energy and food costs, also rose 0.5% compared with an estimated gain of 0.2%.', 'The Federal Reserve’s favored inflation gauge has already shown that it’s an uphill task to tame stubborn price growth. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 2.7% in March from a year ago and came in slightly higher than anticipated. The core PCE price index increased 2.8% from a year ago and was also above our estimates.', ""It's worth pointing out that the GDP report of the first quarter mentioned that price pressures have been heating up for most of the year, thanks to an uptick in the cost of services, including insurance and transportation. On the other hand, the GDP for the first three months of the year increased at an annualized rate of 1.6%, much less than the 3.4% jump in the final three months of last year, and fell short of Wall Street expectations."", 'Amid such a gloomy economic setup, where it’s becoming difficult to downplay the idea of stagflation, astute investors should place their bets on ultra-safe stocks. After all, stagflation time and again has led to a double-digit plunge in stocks. Hence, the preferred choices are The Western Union Company, Frontline plc and Organon & Co.', 'This is because these stocks have a low beta (ranges from 0 to 1), making them immune to market vagaries.

But the context matters. If the stock has increased sharply because the business is performing exceptionally well, it could still be a bargain."", 'I have a few examples of stocks like this in my own portfolio. All three of these are up by 100% or more in just a few years but still look like attractive investment opportunities today.', 'Dream Finders Homes (NYSE: DFH) went public in 2021, and I started buying shares soon after. But I aggressively added to my position when the real estate market slowed to a crawl in late 2022 and the stock plunged. Today, my overall Dream Finders investment is up by 110% from what I paid.', ""What's the main reason for the stellar performance? While home sales slowed down, the market clearly favored new homes versus existing ones. Not only did homebuilders have the ability to produce more inventory at a time when existing home inventory was at a generational low, but they could offer incentives (especially when it came to financing) that existing home sellers can't, such as mortgage buydowns."", 'Dream Finders shattered its already ambitious home-closing expectations in 2023, with 7,314 closed home sales (the initial expectation was 6,000), and average sale prices rising by 7%.

I ended up roughly tripling my position near the lows, buying about two-thirds of my shares for about $14.50. From that point, Ryman has increased by 633%. However, considering my overall cost basis, I'm up about 125% on my Ryman investment, not including the dividends I've received along the way."", 'In short, Ryman specializes in group-focused hotels and events.

Plus, Ryman's entertainment business is expanding rapidly. It just opened its flagship Ole Red location on the Las Vegas Strip and has a massive Nashville entertainment complex under development in partnership with country star Luke Combs."", 'Ryman trades for less than 15 times its expected 2024 funds from operations (FFO), despite the impressive performance and long-tailed growth potential.', ""I added Simon Property Group (NYSE: SPG) to my portfolio in mid-2020 as an opportunistic play during the pandemic lockdowns. At the time, nobody knew when (or if) it would be safe to go to the mall again, and the stock's price reflected that uncertainty. About four years later, the stock is up by 127%, but I still think it's cheap."", ""In the most recent quarter, even with widespread fears of a slowdown in consumer spending, Simon's net operating income grew by about 4% year over year, and the occupancy in its malls grew by 110 basis points to 95.5%. The company gave shareholders a dividend increase for the second consecutive quarter, and it now yields about 5.4%. With shares trading for 11.7 times management's full-year FFO guidance, Simon looks like a tremendous value at the current price."", 'These three stocks can be (and have been) rather volatile over the short term.

Penney have two very different real estate strategies,Retail Dive,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ee368f11-0634-3770-867d-4f687fc69696/macy%E2%80%99s-and-j.c.-penney-have.html,1715850000,STORY,"['M', 'SPG', 'BAM']","['In an era when the department store model is under siege, two major examples of it in the U.S. — Macy’s and J.C. Penney — are pursuing very different brick-and-mortar strategies.', 'They do have much in common, with plans to improve stores and streamline their supply chains, indicating an abiding faith in the department store as a still-relevant retail destination. J.C. Penney last year announced a $1 billion investment\xa0in store refreshes and tech upgrades; this year, the company said it would revamp 200 stores by the end of the year and touted improvements in the speed and cost efficiency of its supply chain. And at Macy’s, newly arrived CEO Tony Spring said he would use lessons from his time leading the company’s Bloomingdale’s banner to inform the flagship chain’s transformation.', 'Their differences are real, however, particularly when it comes to plans for the size, number and location of their stores. Analysts peg the reasons for those differences on their current — and potential — ownership.', 'These two retailers have long anchored shopping centers, a setup from the mid-20th century meant to drive consumer traffic to the mall. Today, Macy’s has increasingly broken this mold, while J.C. Penney remains firmly ensconced in it.', 'For both its Bloomingdale’s and Macy’s banners, Macy’s Inc. has been experimenting with stores about one-fifth the size of its sprawling downtown and mall-anchor locations, placed at strip centers. Last year, Macy’s announced it would accelerate this small-format strategy by opening as many as 30 smaller stores through the fall of 2025, which would triple their number and sometimes also entail shuttering a full-line store in a given market.', 'Speaking at the Shoptalk conference in March, Spring said that Macy’s runs “too many locations that were built for a different era” and that it has “no choice” but to close stores if it is to prosper.', 'By contrast, J.C. Penney, which nearly four years ago was acquired out of bankruptcy by shopping center REITs Simon Property Group and Brookfield Properties, is maintaining its relationship to the mall. Its turnaround plan makes no mention of experimenting with small formats or entering strip malls as Macy’s has done.', '“I think their plans make a lot of sense. They’ve got a great leadership team that’s leading them into the next generation of what a department store should be,” Kevin McCrain, CEO of Brookfield Properties U.S., told Retail Dive\xa0about J.C. Penney. “They are very focused and know exactly who their consumer is, and they’re looking to cater to that consumer, which is exactly what every department store should be doing.”', 'Another stark difference between Macy’s and J.C. Penney’s real estate strategies lies in how each contemplates adjustments to the sizes of their fleets. As of its most recent quarter, the Macy’s banner runs 481 full-line stores, 12 small-format stores and nine Backstage off-price stores. According to a financial report released last week, J.C. Penney runs 663 stores.', 'A little over a year ago, Macy’s previous CEO, Jeff Gennette, said that the closure of four full-line stores meant that the retailer was largely finished with its plan to shutter about 125 underperforming stores, part of a turnaround announced in 2020. But this year, Spring said the company would shutter another 150 stores over the next three years. Stores won’t be spared just because they turn a profit, he also said, a hard line that analysts say may be necessary in the long run.', 'Normally, profitability is the main driver of whether or not to run a store, unless a different location might generate even more sales or consolidation might drive efficiencies, according to GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders. But neither Macy’s nor Penney are in normal situations, he said by email.', '“It is no secret that Macy’s has been in decline for a very long time, and it is probably the case that some locations are seeing an ongoing deterioration in sales, so in five or 10 years they may not be profitable,” Saunders said. “If Macy’s acts now it can get in front of the problem and focus its efforts on investing in the stores it thinks can carry the business forward. In some ways this is like amputating gangrenous parts of the business: it’s not very pleasant and it has arisen because of a lack of care in the past, but it is necessary for survival.”', 'This approach balances profitability, capital cost, operating costs and potential real estate value, making it “the right thing to do,” according to Nick Egelanian, president of retail development firm SiteWorks.', '“Macy’s needs to exit stores with no future, to focus its limited\xa0resources on its most promising future investments,” he said.', 'The state of affairs at J.C. Penney couldn’t be more different. As part of its bankruptcy in 2020, J.C. Penney slated 144 stores for closure, but that may be the extent of its downsizing. Last week, Simon Property Group CEO David Simon told analysts that he doesn’t “anticipate much portfolio real estate activity” at J.C. Penney, citing the chain’s profitability and importance to the communities where it operates.', ""“I don't necessarily believe in ‘shrink to grow,’” he also said. “It's very hard to achieve.”"", 'If anything, the retailer could benefit from expanding because even many of their low-volume stores turn a profit, at least as measured by EBITDA, he said.', ""“Penney is able to produce positive EBITDA even if there's not high sales,” he said.\xa0“In fact, I think Penney almost can be a beneficiary of opening new stores as opposed to closing stores.”"", 'Both McCrain and David Simon have said that saving local jobs factored into their companies’ interest in acquiring J.C. Penney. But Egelanian is skeptical, and says that Penney should probably also put more focus on its best performers.', '“What matters is shareholder value, and what determines that is a combination of profits and the hope for or path to future profits,” he said.\xa0“So JCP must focus on promising investments and exit dead-end businesses.”', 'The contrasting real estate plays at Macy’s and J.C. Penney have everything to do with their ownership, and, in Macy’s case, potential ownership, analysts say.', 'Macy’s is a publicly traded company, beholden to stakeholders including investors, employees and customers; J.C. Penney has been private since being purchased out of bankruptcy four years ago by Simon Property Group and Brookfield Asset Management; since then, brand management firm Authentic Brands Group has acquired 16.7%.', ""“Macy's is in the retail business,” Erik Gordon, professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business, said by email. “Simon and Brookfield are in the mall business.”"", 'However, Macy’s could soon also be a private company if one of its investors — namely real estate-minded investment firm Arkhouse Management — gets its way. Arkhouse and its financial partners have bid $6.6 billion to take over the retailer (which includes Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury). Since Arkhouse’s overture, Macy’s has been more preoccupied with its properties, beefing up its board’s real estate expertise and announcing that property value will be a factor as it contemplates which stores to close in the next three years.', '“As Macy’s owns a lot of its shops, in some cases it might make more sense to monetize them and take the proceeds to invest in the business,” Saunders said. “In the case of the activist investors, that money would be used to generate a return rather than invest — but the same principle applies.”', 'J.C. Penney, meanwhile, is owned by two of its landlords. Both Brookfield and Simon have invested in other retailers besides J.C. Penney, and analysts have long speculated that was at least in part to prevent vacancies at their malls. Penney’s position as an anchor is especially valuable because an empty anchor often trips clauses in other tenants’ leases that reopen rent negotiations or allow those retailers to leave.', ""“Macy's doesn't own malls,” Gordon said. “It just does retail, so it closes marginal stores. Simon owns malls, so marginal Penney's stores can be valuable enough to the mall business to keep open.”"", 'Saunders agrees that “the viability of the malls in which J.C. Penney operates” depends on keeping stores running, that the success or failure of Penney stores would influence the malls’ footfall, sales and property value, and that a closure could upset other tenants.', '“That would be very undesirable, so the priority is to keep the stores operating for the greater good of the business,” he said. “That said, I think Simon has a genuine desire to make J.C. Penney work better and to keep it profitable.”', 'This story was originally published on Retail Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Retail Dive newsletter.']"

This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.', ""The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system."", 'Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.', 'Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Aptiv basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.', 'Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices', ""The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock."", ""For Aptiv, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher."", 'Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions', 'Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.', ""The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions for Aptiv', 'For the fiscal year ending December 2024, this company is expected to earn $6.01 per share, which is a change of 23.7% from the year-ago reported number.', 'Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Aptiv. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 5.3%.', 'Bottom Line', ""Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term."", 'You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>', 'The upgrade of Aptiv to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future.', 'Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected.

Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.', ""Over the past month, shares of this world's largest biotech drugmaker have returned +20.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, which Amgen falls in, has gained 6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Amgen is expected to post earnings of $4.87 per share, indicating a change of -2.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.4% over the last 30 days.', 'The consensus earnings estimate of $19.46 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +4.3%.

Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.1%.', ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Amgen."", ""The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:"", '12 Month EPS', 'Projected Revenue Growth', ""Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial."", 'For Amgen, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $8.26 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +18.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $33 billion and $34.01 billion estimates indicate +17.1% and +3.1% changes, respectively.', 'Last Reported Results and Surprise History', 'Amgen reported revenues of $7.45 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22%.

The EPS surprise was +5.32%.', 'The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.', 'Valuation', ""Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects."", ""While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price."", 'The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.', 'Amgen is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers.

As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's look into Wynn Resorts Ltd's dividend performance and assess its sustainability."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with WYNN.', ""High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' Portfolio"", 'This Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 Years', 'How to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?', ""Wynn Resorts operates luxury casinos and resorts. The company was founded in 2002 by Steve Wynn, the former CEO. The company operates four megaresorts: Wynn Macau and Encore in Macao and Wynn Las Vegas and Encore in Las Vegas. Cotai Palace opened in August 2016 in Macao, and Encore Boston Harbor in Massachusetts opened June 2019. We expect the company to continue to build nongaming attractions in Macao over the next few years. We model Wynn's managed integrated resort in the United Arab Emirates to open in 2027. The company also operates Wynn Interactive, a digital sports betting and iGaming platform. The company received 76% and 24% of its 2019 prepandemic EBITDA from Macao and the US, respectively."", 'Wynn Resorts Ltd has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 2023. Dividends are currently distributed on a quarterly basis. Below is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share for tracking historical trends.', ""As of today, Wynn Resorts Ltd currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.02% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 1.02%. This suggests an expectation of same dividend payments over the next 12 months. Over the past three years, Wynn Resorts Ltd's annual dividend growth rate was -9.10%. Based on Wynn Resorts Ltd's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost of Wynn Resorts Ltd stock as of today is approximately 1.02%."", ""To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2024-03-31, Wynn Resorts Ltd's dividend payout ratio is 0.22. Wynn Resorts Ltd's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks Wynn Resorts Ltd's profitability 7 out of 10 as of 2024-03-31, suggesting good profitability prospects. The company has reported net profit in 7 years out of past 10 years."", ""To ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. Wynn Resorts Ltd's growth rank of 7 out of 10 suggests that the company's growth trajectory is good relative to its competitors. Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and Wynn Resorts Ltd's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. Wynn Resorts Ltd's revenue has increased by approximately 43.40% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 83.14% of global competitors."", ""With a stable dividend history and a promising outlook in growth and profitability, Wynn Resorts Ltd appears well-positioned to maintain its dividend payments. The company's strategic operations and expansions into new markets such as the UAE could further bolster its financial stability and attractiveness to investors. As we continue to monitor Wynn Resorts Ltd's performance, investors might consider whether this stock could serve as a sustainable income source in their portfolios.

So it’s not surprising that the Federal Reserve notes that aggregated consumer credit card balances finished 2023 at a record high level of $1.13 trillion, up $50 billion in Q4 alone. This is a double-edged sword, as the current high interest rate regime makes this credit more expensive – but the increase in credit card usage also suggests that consumer spending remains strong.', 'And that strength may soon get a boost. Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA), the world’s two largest credit card issuing and processing companies, have recently settled a class action lawsuit that could provide consumers with an incentive to swipe their cards more often. The suit was an antitrust action against allegedly excessive card swipe fees, and the settlement may run to the tens of billions of dollars. As part of the settlement, both companies have agreed to limit the card swipe fees charged to merchants – a savings that could be passed on to customers.', 'For the card companies, the settlement promises to end the litigation without hitting revenues too hard – they make most of their money from the interest charged to card users. This opens up a potential boon for Visa and Mastercard, who may see costs go down while profits go up, and Piper Sandler analyst Arvind Ramnani is pounding the table for both big names, recommending that investors buy in now.', 'According to the TipRanks database, Visa and Mastercard shares also get Strong Buy ratings from the rest of the Street. Let’s take a closer look.', 'Visa', 'First up is Visa, the largest company among the world’s credit card issuers. A few ‘vital stats’ will show the magnitude of Visa’s market position. The company has more than 4.3 billion branded cards in circulation globally, across some 200 countries. The cards are issued by more than 14,500 financial institutions and are accepted at more than 130 million merchant locations. Visa processes approximately $15 trillion in annual transaction volume. All of this provides a solid foundation for the stock, and Visa has a market cap valuation of $563 billion.', 'In business since 1958, Visa has been a leader in the credit card segment since the industry’s beginning. The company has expanded to become one of the stock market’s blue-chip stalwarts. The company generated almost $30 billion in revenue in 2022, and more than $32.6 billion in 2023. It’s one of the market’s most durable companies, and shares in V have shown a steady long-term gain.', 'The company’s revenues and earnings both show a modest upward trend over the past several years. In the last financial release, covering fiscal 2Q24, Visa’s top line of $8.8 billion was up 10% year-over-year and cleared expectations by $180 million. The bottom line figure was $2.51 per share by non-GAAP measures, based on a non-GAAP net income of $5.1 billion. This EPS was 8 cents per share better than had been anticipated. Visa finished the fiscal quarter, on March 31 of this year, with deep pockets, reporting $20.8 billion in cash and liquid assets on hand – after returning $3.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividend payments and stock buybacks.', 'For analyst Arvind Ramnani, setting out the Piper Sandler take on Visa, the key points boil down to that steady long-term growth and the company’s sheer scale.', '“We believe that Visa should be able to grow revenues by 10.7%, driven by multiple growth drivers, including 10.4% growth in Data Processing, 9.5% in Services, and 10.7% International. This is supported by its foundational offering in 1) Annual aggregate transaction volume of ~$15T, with a vast growing TAM of over $250 trillion; 2) New Flows which captures new sources of money movement for consumers, businesses and governments – an in our view will be an important vector for growth; 3) Value Added Services, which serve as an important lever to deepen its client relationships by offering innovative solutions. Further, we believe that Visa can sustain operating margin expansion (modeling +140 bps in FY25) through its scale, continued execution, and efficiencies/margin uplift from new/emerging tech,” Ramnani opined.', 'Summing up his stance on V, Ramnani gives Visa stock an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating with a $322 price target that suggests a ~15% share appreciation for the next 12 months. (To watch Ramnani’s track record, click here)', 'Overall, the Strong Buy analyst consensus rating on Visa shares is based on 24 recent analyst reviews, with a 20 to 4 breakdown favoring Buys over Holds. The stock is selling for $280.21 and its average target price of $315.15 implies a one-year upside potential of ~12%. (See Visa stock forecast)', 'Mastercard', 'Now we’ll turn to Mastercard, the industry’s other giant company. Mastercard boasts a market cap of $425 billion, and there are approximately 3 billion Mastercard-issued cards in circulation worldwide. The company’s annual revenue came to $18.88 billion in 2021, rose to $22.24 billion in 2022, and hit $25.09 billion last year.', 'Mastercard lends its branding to cards issued by a wide range of financial institutions, and then acts as the payment processor for its branded cards. The company processed $9 trillion in gross dollar volume last year, and has already seen $2.3 trillion in gross dollar volume during the first quarter of this year. This represents a 10% increase from the prior-year period. The company’s cross-border volume, a measure of international transactions, was up 18% y/y in 1Q24.', 'Looking at the headline results from Q1, Mastercard saw quarterly revenue of $6.3 billion, up 10% year-over-year. The top line just skated over the forecast, beating it by $10 million. The company realized a net income of $3.1 billion in the quarter, or $3.31 per share, by non-GAAP reckoning. This compared favorably to the $2.80 EPS from 1Q23, and beat the forecast by 7 cents per share. Mastercard had nearly $7.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents available at the end of the quarter, and paid out $2.616 million to shareholders during Q1, through both repurchases and dividends.', 'Turning again to Ramnani’s view, we find the Piper Sandler analyst predicting continued growth for Mastercard, as the company grows into a large addressable market.', '“In our view, Mastercard should be able to deliver revenue growth of 11.0% this year and 12.7% in FY25, driven by 9.5%/13.5% Payment Network revenue growth (~62% of revenues), and Value-added Services and Solutions growth of 13.7%/11.5% (~38% of revenues) in FY24/ FY25. Underlying growth drivers include a massive untapped opportunity for consumer payments; Mastercard’s aggregate transaction volume of $9T in annual volume, with a vast TAM of over $250 trillion across domestic, cross-border, transaction processing, and value added services revenue channels,” Ramnani wrote.', '“Further,” Ramnani adds, “we expect Mastercard can sustain margin expansion (currently modeling +20bps in FY24 and +80bps in FY25) as the company continues to expand, disrupting cash as a preferred method of transacting, and as it grows into new service and tech offerings.”', 'Quantifying these comments, the Ramnani puts an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on MA shares, along with a $531 price target that points toward a gain of nearly 15% on the one-year horizon.', 'All in all, the consensus view from the Street on Mastercard is a Strong Buy, based on 23 recent analyst reviews that feature a lopsided split of 22 Buys to 1 Hold. The shares have a current trading price of $463.05 and an average target price of $525.25, together suggesting a ~13% potential upside by this time next year.

The company's focus, however, has always been on fast and power-efficient server chips, so while it can use the Arm IP to add some of these features to its chips, it's not necessarily a core competency. That's why Ampere decided to work with Qualcomm (and SuperMicro to integrate the two solutions), Arm CTO Jeff Wittich tells me."", '""The idea here is that while I\'ll show you some great performance for Ampere CPUs running AI inferencing on just the CPUs, if you want to scale out to even bigger models -- multi-100 billion parameter models, for instance -- just like all the other workloads, AI isn\'t one size fits all,"" Wittich told TechCrunch. ""We\'ve been working with Qualcomm on this solution, combining our super efficient Ampere CPUs to do a lot of the general purpose tasks that you\'re running in conjunction with inferencing, and then using their really efficient cards, we\'ve got a server-level solution.""', 'As for partnering with Qualcomm, Wittich said that Ampere wanted to put together best-of-breed solutions.', '""[R]eally good collaboration that we\'ve had with Qualcomm here,"" he said. ""This is one of the things that we\'ve been working on, I think we share a lot of really similar interests, which is why I think that this is really compelling. They\'re building really, really efficient solutions and a lot of different parts of the market. We\'re building really, really efficient solutions on the server CPU side.""', ""The Qualcomm partnership is part of Ampere's annual roadmap update. Part of that roadmap is the new 256-core AmpereOne chip, built using a modern 3nm process. Those new chips are not quite generally available yet, but Wittich says they are ready at the fab and should roll out later this year."", 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYrT2ohcykk', ""On top of the additional cores, the defining feature of this new generation of AmpereOne chips is the 12-channel DDR5 RAM, which allows Ampere's data center customers to better tune their users' memory access according to their needs."", ""The sales pitch here isn't just performance, though, but the power consumption and cost to run these chips in the data center. That's especially true when it comes to AI inferencing, where Ampere likes to compare its performance against Nvidia's A10 GPUs."", ""It's worth noting that Ampere is not sunsetting any of its existing chips in favor of these new ones. Wittich stressed that even these older chips still have plenty of use cases."", ""Ampere also announced another partnership today. The company is working with NETINT to build a joint solution that pairs Ampere's CPUs with NETINT's video processing chips. This new server will be able to transcode 360 live video channels in parallel, all while also using OpenAI's Whisper speech-to-text model to subtitle 40 streams."", '""We started down this path six years ago because it is clear it is the right path,"" Ampere CEO Renee James said in today\'s announcement. ""Low power used to be synonymous with low performance. Ampere has proven that isn’t true. We have pioneered the efficiency frontier of computing and delivered performance beyond legacy CPUs in an efficient computing envelope.""', 'This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/16/ampere-teams-up-with-qualcomm-to-launch-an-arm-based-ai-server/']"

Shares have added about 5.5% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.', ""Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Johnson & Johnson due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts."", 'J&J’s first-quarter 2024 earnings came in at $2.71 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.64. Earnings rose 12.4% from the year-ago period.Adjusted earnings exclude intangible amortization and some other special items. Including these items, J&J reported first-quarter earnings of $2.20 per share against a loss of 19 cents in the year-ago quarter.Sales came in at $21.38 billion, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.40 billion by a slight margin. Sales rose 2.3% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting an operational increase of 3.9% and a negative currency impact of 1.6%. Organically, excluding the impact of acquisitions/divestitures and currency, sales rose 4% on an operational basis. Excluding sales of COVID-19 vaccine, organic sales rose 7.7%.First-quarter sales in the domestic market rose 7.8% to $11.62 billion. Excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures on an adjusted operational basis, domestic sales rose 7.9% in the quarter.International sales declined 3.4% on a reported basis to $9.76 billion, reflecting an operational decrease of 0.3% and a negative currency impact of 3.1%. Excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures on an adjusted operational basis, international sales declined 0.3% in the quarter.', 'Sales in J&J’s Innovative Medicines segment (previously the Pharmaceutical segment) rose 1.1% year over year to $13.56 billion, reflecting a 2.5% operational increase and a 1.4% negative currency impact. Innovative Medicines sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.46 billion as well as our model estimate of $13.24 billion. Excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures and currency on an adjusted operational basis, worldwide sales rose 2.5%. Excluding sales from J&J’s COVID-19 vaccine, operational sales grew 8.3%.Higher sales of key products such as Darzalex, Stelara, Tremfya, Uptravi and Erleada drove the segment’s growth. New drugs like Carvykti, Tecvayli and Spravato also contributed to growth. The sales growth was partially dampened by lower sales of Imbruvica, COVID-19 vaccine and generic/biosimilar competition to drugs like Zytiga and Remicade.In the Innovative Medicines segment, sales in the United States rose 8.4%, while outside U.S. sales declined 4% on an operational basis.Darzalex sales rose 18.9% year over year to $2.69 billion in the quarter, driven by continued share gains across all lines of therapy, particularly the front-line setting. Sales slightly beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.66 billion and our model estimate of $2.63 billion.Stelara sales grew 0.3% to $2.45 billion in the quarter, driven by market growth and share gains for the IBD indications. However, unfavorable patient mix in the United States and share loss for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis indications hurt the drug’s sales. Stelara sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.59 billion and our model estimate of $2.49 billion. With expected biosimilar entry in 2025, continued volume growth is expected to be largely offset by price declines.Imbruvica sales declined 5.2% to $784.0 million due to rising competitive pressure in the United States due to new oral competition. Imbruvica sales were, however, better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $712.0 million and our estimate of $699.8 million.Erleada generated sales of $689 million in the quarter, up 27% year over year, driven by share gains. Erleada sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $662 million as well as our model estimate of $661.5 million.Tremfya recorded sales of $808 million in the quarter, up 26.3% year over year, driven by strong market growth and share gains. Tremfya sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $795.0 million as well as our model estimate of $761.6 million.New drug Carvykti, a BCMA CAR-T therapy approved in 2022 for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (R/R MM), recorded sales of $157 million compared with $159 million in the previous quarter. Another new drug, Tecvayli, also approved in 2022 for R/R MM, recorded sales of $133 million in the quarter.Spravato recorded sales of $225.0 million, up 72.2% year over year, driven by share gains and additional market launches.PAH drug Uptravi recorded sales of $468.0 million, up 29.2% year over year, driven by favorable patient mix, share gains and market growth. Xarelto sales declined 10.4% in the quarter to $518 million due to an unfavorable patient mix.Invega Sustenna/Xeplion/Invega Trinza/Trevicta sales rose 1.2% to $1.06 billion in the quarter. Simponi/Simponi Aria sales rose 3% to $554.0 million, while Prezista sales declined 12.3% to $418.0 million. \xa0Zytiga sales declined 25.9% to $181.0 million in the quarter due to generic competition. Sales of Remicade were down 10.9% in the quarter to $434 million.J&J’s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine generated sales of $25 million in the quarter, down 96.6% year over year. International sales accounted for all COVID-19 vaccine sales.In 2024, J&J expects to record above-market growth in the Innovative Medicine unit, for the 13th consecutive quarter. The growth is expected to be driven by market share gains for key products like Darzalex, Tremfya and Erleada and rapid adoption of new products such as Carvykti, Tecvayli, Talvey and Spravato. Innovative Medicine sales growth is expected to be slightly stronger in the first half of the year compared to the second half due to the potential entry of Stelara biosimilars in Europe in mid-2024.MedTech segment sales came in at $7.82 billion, up 4.5% from the year-ago period, as an operational increase of 6.3% was offset by a negative currency movement of 1.8%. MedTech segment sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as our model estimate of $7.93 billion.Excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures and currency, on an adjusted operational basis, worldwide sales rose 6.5%.In the MedTech segment, sales rose 6.6% in the United States and 6.1% outside of the United States on an operational basis.Sales in the MedTech business were hurt by fewer selling days, disproportionately impacting orthopedics, in the first quarter. Strong global procedure growth, new product uptake and commercial execution continued to benefit the business unit.Cardiovascular (previously Interventional Solutions) sales grew 20.2%, driven by growth of electrophysiology products in all regions and higher sales of Abiomed. Worldwide Surgery declined 0.7% as competitive pressure and VBP issues in China partially offset procedure recovery and strength of biosurgery and wound closure portfolios. Worldwide orthopedics rose 4.3%, benefiting from a one-time revenue recognition timing change, which partially offset the impact of reduced selling days in the quarter. Strong performance in hips and knees was driven by strong procedure recovery and growth in new products. Trauma and spine were negatively impacted by competitive pressures. Worldwide Vision declined 3.3% due to lower sales of contact lenses, China VBP issues and the Blink divestiture.In 2024, in the MedTech segment, J&J expects operational sales growth to be relatively consistent throughout the year. Procedure volumes are expected to be above pre-COVID levels with a modest impact from Russia sanctions in the first half and China VBP pricing impact in some categories.', 'J&J tightened its total revenue expectations from a range of $87.8 billion-$88.6 billion to $88.0 billion-$88.4 billion. The new sales range indicates growth in the range of 4.7%-5.2% compared with 4.5%- 5.5% expected previously.Operational sales growth is expected in the range of 5.5, compared with 5 expected previously.Adjusted operational sales (excluding currency impact, acquisitions/divestitures) growth is also expected to be in the range of 5.5 compared with 5 expected previously.The revenue figures exclude revenues from COVID-19 vaccine sales.Foreign exchange is expected to hurt 2024 sales growth by approximately 0.8% versus the prior expectation of 0.5%.Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the range of $10.57-$10.72 compared with $10.55-$10.75 expected previously. The earnings range implies growth in the range of 6.6%-8.1% (6.4%-8.4% expected previously).On an operational, constant-currency basis, adjusted earnings per share are expected to increase in the range of 6.9%-8.4% (previously 6.4%-8.4%).Adjusted pretax operating margin is expected to improve approximately 50 basis points from 2023.Other income is expected to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. Net interest income is expected in the range of $550 million to $650 million compared with $450 million to $550 million expected previously.The adjusted tax rate is expected in the range of 16.0% to 17.5%.The 2024 financial guidance excludes any impact from the pending acquisition of Shockwave. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2024. J&J is likely to update its guidance to reflect the expected dilution to adjusted earnings per share in 2024 of approximately 10 cents per share due to financing costs.', 'How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?', 'It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month.', 'VGM Scores', 'At this time, Johnson & Johnson has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a D.

Transcontinental Gas Pipeline Company LLC (Transco), a subsidiary of Williams, had proposed the construction of a system of 26 and 42inch diameter natural gas pipeline stretching from Pennsylvania through New Jersey to a transfer point about three miles offshore from the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens, New York. The project was aimed to serve a gas utility, National Grid.', 'Per Williams’ claims, construction of the new pipeline was necessary to meet projected peak demands. The project received approval from Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). However, the project faced several setbacks including severe backlash from environmentalists.', 'Notably, New York State Public Service Commission asked National Grid to conduct an analysis and assess the long-term energy needs and potential alternatives to the NESE pipeline. An IEEFA report published in April 2020, marked a sizeable gap between National Grid’s peak demand projection and actual record highs of peak demand, questioning the need for the new infrastructure. The report also highlighted that ratepayers in several areas would have had to pay almost $193 million annually for 15 years.', 'IEEFA proposed cheap, non-pipeline alternatives and argued that the reasonable response to peak demand would be strategic planning not capital construction. The construction of an unnecessary pipeline would only benefit the pipeline developer and the utility company while ratepayers would need to pay inflated gas rates.', 'National Grid issued a new analysis in May 2020, citing an alternative that did not require construction of a new pipeline.

Gaston Electric Generating plant (Gaston) marking the largest such pilot in the world. The technology was developed by Storworks. The 10-MW-hour-electric (MWhe) energy storage solution (Figure 1) is charged using heat from supercritical steam generated by Gaston’s Unit 5. As designed, high-pressure steam from the power plant flows through tubes, heating the concrete, which stores the thermal energy until it is returned to the power plant by converting feedwater into steam to generate electricity in response to grid demand. The project received funding from the U.S. Department of Energy under award DE-FE0031761. [caption id=""attachment_219279"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""740""]', '1. A 10-MWhe first-of-its-kind concrete energy storage demonstration was constructed and successfully tested at Southern Company’s Gaston coal-fired generating plant. Courtesy: Storworks[/caption] The technology can be applied to existing or new thermal power plants, including coal, natural gas, nuclear, or concentrating solar power. The core technology can go beyond electric power to applications including decarbonizing industrial heat. “Advancements in long-duration energy storage are key to unlocking the full potential of variable renewable energy resources on the path to net-zero,” said Neva Espinoza, EPRI vice president of Energy Supply and Low-Carbon Resources. “As the power sector navigates a highly complex transition, CTES could play an important role in efficiently delivering the reliable and affordable electricity society depends on.” The CTES pilot system, temporarily integrated into the unit at Gaston, proved the technology’s potential to store thermal energy for conversion to electricity when combined with thermal power plants. The original goals of the project were exceeded, as steam production at several pressure levels was demonstrated. More than 80 energy charge and discharge cycles were also successfully performed over 700 hours of total operation. ""Southern Company is deeply committed to advancing the transition to a net-zero future, while ensuring the delivery of clean, safe, reliable, and affordable energy,” said Dr. Mark S. Berry, Southern Company senior vice president of Research, Environment, and Sustainability. “As a leader in research and development, Southern Company is exploring the potential of CTES technology to help decarbonize electricity production. We are excited to be pioneering this groundbreaking research demonstration in collaboration with EPRI, Storworks, and our subsidiary, Alabama Power.” “We appreciate the vision and support from our partners that made this pilot demonstration possible,” said Scott Frazer, co-founder of Storworks. “Low-cost long-duration energy storage is increasingly critical in the shift to low-cost intermittent renewable energy, and the Gaston project represents an important milestone in advancing the commercialization of our technology. With industry-leading low cost, Storworks’ modular system can be tailored to a range of applications for both power plants and industrial decarbonization solutions.” CTES can give grid operators greater flexibility by allowing them to store energy when it is not needed and then provide it when it is most valuable. EPRI will continue to evaluate the feasibility of CTES and other long-duration energy storage options as part of the clean energy transition. —POWER\xa0edited this content, which was contributed by\xa0EPRI’s\xa0Communications department.']"

The Supreme brand will further accelerate VF’s hyper-digital business model transformation and will be a meaningful driver of VF’s commitment to top-quartile total shareholder return and long-term value creation.”', 'But now in 2024, things appear to have taken a different turn.', 'Alice Price, apparel analyst at GlobalData, told Just Style that while it was once a frontrunner in the streetwear scene, Supreme reported a 6.8% decline in revenue for the year ending March 2023.', '“The streetwear player has lost its cult status in recent years, with its drops becoming predictable in style and design, no longer generating the same buzz and anticipation they once did. The player has also suffered from the rise of newer, more exciting streetwear brands such as Fear of God, Represent, and Denim Tears. For instance, brands such as Fear of God and Represent have been quick to align with consumers’ shift to a more minimalist aesthetic.”', 'Neil Saunders, analyst at GlobalData, agreed, adding the brand simply “isn’t exciting anymore”.', '“The brand has lost some of its lustre and it has had issues under VFC ownership. There is also the question of whether Supreme, which is still run by its founder, fits into VFC’s rather corporate structure.”', 'After announcing a 16% decline in total revenues and swinging to loss in Q3, VF Corp announced it was embarking on a strategic review of its portfolio of brands. At the time, Price warned things had gone from ” bad to worse” at VF Corp, adding that the heart of the problem is the “waning appeal of its core brands.”', '“VF Corp’s troubles predominantly lie with the waning appeal of its core brands, especially Vans, as discerning consumers choose to invest in more desirable products that are reflective of the latest fashion trends.”', 'Price added a brand cull would enable VF Corp to focus its attention on core brands and help steer them back to relevance.', 'Saunders said of course if VF can get a good price for Supreme, it’s a great move.“It is no secret that VF Corp is reviewing its brand portfolio with a view to slimming down and selling off some parts of the business. It sees this as a way of generating returns and as a mechanism to help it focus more what it sees as the growth opportunities in its portfolio. There is a sense that VFC is a bit overgrown and needs to be pruned.', '“With regard to Supreme specifically, there is a question mark hanging over how much Supreme is worth. VFC has already written down some of the goodwill for the brand and I doubt it will want to sell it if it means incurring further losses and write downs. Given Supreme is supposed to be growing again, VFC will need to explain to investors what other levers it is going to pull to drive growth from its remaining brands if it disposes of Supreme.”', 'While Price said divesting the brand could help VF Corp “focus its attention on its brands and help steer them back to relevance,” as it remains on “precarious financial footing”.', 'The big question is which companies are after a streetwear brand to add to their portfolio. Where would a brand like Supreme thrive? And how much is it worth?Saunders reckons likely candidates could be portfolio companies like Authentic Brands which is on an aggressive acquisition spree.', 'Earlier this year Authentic Brands acquired the intellectual property of US footwear company, Wolverine Worldwide’s brand, Sperry and signed a licensing agreement with retailer Aldo Group to serve as a North American operating partner.', 'But a private equity firm could also be on the lookout for a brand such as Supreme, Saunders said.', '“However, both groups would need to be convinced that they could grow the business and extract more value from it, which might be hard to accomplish in the current market. Some luxury groups may take a look if they want to add streetwear into their portfolios, but I don’t think many are in a position to make purchases at the moment.”', 'Any buyer eyeing Supreme will need to ensure it has put in place the strategic partnerships in order to grow the brand.', 'At the end of last year, brand management company Iconix International, announced the acquisition of a majority stake in the popular British streetwear brand, Hoodrich to accelerate its global growth. The strategic move was in collaboration with Hoodrich founder Jay Williams, who will retain an ownership interest in the brand.', 'The partnership between Iconix and Jay Williams is grounded in a shared vision for the brand’s accelerated global growth. Both entities are keen to propel the brand to new heights. As part of this acquisition, Iconix is set to collaborate closely with Batra Group, which will oversee business operations, and JD Sports, a key global retail partner.', 'Iconix’s expertise in category extension and global expansion, coupled with decades of experience in international brand management, positions the company as an ideal partner for Hoodrich’s next phase of growth.', '""Explainer: End of the road for Supreme under VF Corp?"" was originally created and published by Just Style, a GlobalData owned brand.', '', '\xa0', 'The information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

And that was certainly the case here.”', 'VF’s decision to jettison the jeans business was part of a company effort to focus on “retail-minded” and “activity-based lifestyle brands” like Vans and The North Face.', 'But the subtext was clear. While the powerhouse VF pushed on to new heights, the wholesale-heavy Lee and Wranger were being left behind. (Or at least VF shareholders, who received shares of Kontoor, had the option to leave them behind).', 'But, despite all of its advantages, VF stumbled hard with Vans, failed to keep up with consumers, loaded up on debt to buy Supreme and saw its market capitalization fall from more than $30 billion to $5 billion at the close on Wednesday.', 'Kontoor, meanwhile, has shown steady growth, with its market cap growing from about $2 billion to $3.8 billion over the past five years.', 'It was Baxter’s job to navigate Lee and Wrangler out into the public market and take the helm — and it wasn’t an easy assignment. But looking back, the CEO said the trials of the spin-off also helped solidify the Kontoor team and set the business up for success, even as it launched into the jaws of the pandemic.', '“Our parent company wanted to get us out of there as fast as possible,” Baxter said. “We did it in 10 months, which is too fast. You have to make too many concessions. To hit the goal, to go ahead and spin, you had to just continually move the ball forward. It didn’t give you enough time for true analyzation in planning.', '“That’s the key to a really successful spin-off from the very beginning — really analyze the business, really analyze the spin, and then really establish the processes that are going to go forward,” he said.', 'To move fast, Kontoor basically cloned VF, adopting the larger company’s structure and approach, from supply chain to hiring practices, Baxter said, giving the company an infrastructure designed for a business four times the size.', '“You end up with maybe people in the wrong places, people with the wrong titles, people working on the wrong projects,” Baxter said.', 'Kontoor also spun out without the right IT system and relied on access to VF’s system while it installed its own enterprise resource planning system, which controls everything from the supply chain to how vendors get paid.', '“Ours, it was stable, it was just old,” Baxter said. “We needed the new ERP system. So we did two things that are the hardest things to do in business: spin off and then put it in the ERP system.”', 'Meanwhile, Baxter was trying to create a new corporate culture and identity for the company.', '“Most of your employees came from the old culture,” he said. “They were long tenured employees used to doing things a certain way. So you’ve got to start retraining and you’ve got to start reprogramming and rethinking about how you want your culture to look.”', 'That reset was important as the mission had changed and the jeans businesses no longer had to send the cash they generated to the larger company.', '“We were a cash cow and we referred to that often as a cash cow for the rest of the company,” Baxter said. “Now we were finally able to use our own money for ourselves. The brands hadn’t been invested in really, we hadn’t been building new product, designing new product or going after other channels.', '“We started investing behind the brands and to, I guess, the surprise of a lot of people, the brands started responding really well, and the consumer started responding really well, and we started hiring some good people and all of a sudden a little bit of success and a little bit more success. And here we are today doing fairly well.”', 'In a tough time for budget consumers wracked by inflation, Kontoor saw revenues dip 1 percent to $2.6 billion — slightly above the $2.5 billion in revenues seen in 2019. Net income last year totaled $231 million. And the journey continues with “Project Jeanius,” the company’s new effort to simplify and transform its processes further, creating $50 million and $100 million in gross profit improvement and cost savings.', 'Kontoor has gone beyond establishing itself and is reshaping for the future. Baxter said there’s no playbook on how to spin off a business — “you learn along the way” — but having done it once, he now sees more opportunities to set brands free from their portfolios.', '“When I look at a big business, when I look at a house of brands, I sit and I think about, ‘Wow, that doesn’t fit. That might perform better if it was spun off or if it was somewhere else.’”', 'Once is enough for Baxter, but he did have a few tips for anyone looking to bring a brand out on its own.', '“Establish a really good process, have open communication, and don’t allow the parent company to win every single battle,” he said. “We got hit pretty hard.”', 'The Bottom Line is a business analysis column written by Evan Clark, deputy managing editor, who has covered the fashion industry since 2000.

Even the smooth gray concrete curbs looked suspiciously fresh.', '“After the curbs were perfectly poured, we had a gentleman with a jackhammer come in here and chip away at them,” said Gary Ehrlich, president of studio operations. “It was slightly heartbreaking to see.”', 'Today, the curbs are suitably beaten up, with dings and black smears as if tires had been rubbing against them for decades. Fire escapes look corroded and other metal fixtures such as banisters have been coated to look old or rusty, while walls appear water-stained. A patina of age has settled over this faux city.', 'The painstaking besmirchment of New York Street was one more twist in the long saga of one of filmdom’s most famous outdoor sets. Looming near the front gate like an adult-sized playhouse, an earlier version of the set and now the new one have long served notice to visitors that they have arrived at a movie studio that is itself a leading character in Hollywood lore.', 'Its lineage is suitably rich in Hollywood flavor: In 1967 Fox was preparing to shoot the film version of ""Hello, Dolly!,"" a Tony-award winning musical set in 1890s New York City that ran for years on Broadway. The script included a spectacular outdoor parade with thousands of extras, and studio executives determined that it would be impossible to shoot on location in New York because the city had changed too much.', 'Fox production designer John DeCuir, who had already won Academy Awards for his design of “The King and I” and “Cleopatra,” came up with a streetscape that required more than 500 workers to labor for four months to build. The $2.25-million price tag made it the most costly movie set built to date, the UPI news service reported at the time.', 'Read more: Fox oral history: Inside the legendary studio at the end of its run', 'It required more than 300,000 feet of board lumber and 22 miles of telephone wire strung between poles, the way it was in old New York. A painted 11-story office building façade obscured the view of the Century Plaza Hotel looming next to the lot, according to Barbra Archives, which chronicles the career of ""Hello, Dolly!"" star Barbra Streisand.', 'Dominating the street was a replica of an elevated train station and a steam locomotive acquired from a sugar plantation in Hawaii, where it had been used to transport workers.', 'On July 16, 1968, the Valley Times reported, ""The parade stretching one-fifth of a mile and comprised of 675 persons in 16 units passed through a crowd of 3,108 film extras"" in period costumes. Among the performers were the UCLA marching band and the Budweiser Clydesdales. The director was actor-dancer Gene Kelly.', 'As impressive as the set was, it was intended to be temporary, said Michael Whetstone, a production designer who worked on building the new version of New York Street.', '""It was supposed to be torn down but wasn\'t because it was too expensive"" to remove, he said. At the time the studio was reeling from financial setbacks including a $30-million loss on ""Hello, Dolly!,"" according to the New York Times.', 'The set enjoyed a second, money-making act in the years that followed as Fox rented it out for use on pictures that included Warner Bros.\' comedy ""Up the Sandbox,"" starring Streisand, and MGM\'s musical ""New York, New York,"" starring Liza Minnelli and Robert De Niro. Among the television shows that used it were ""Charlie\'s Angels"" and ""Moonlighting,"" while Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga and other musicians used it for music videos.', 'But a few years ago, with the set showing its age, the studio started considering its replacement, Ehrlich said. ""It had been exposed to the elements for five decades and was past its useful life.""', 'Fox tapped Culver City architect Nathan Moore of House & Robertson Architects to design something sturdier.', 'Construction required 49 tons of rebar and more than 1,000 cubic feet of concrete. The set is held up by 260 tons of structural steel and backed inside with 4,400 square feet of catwalks. Lighting and other electrical functions are supported with 21,000 square feet of conduit and wire, allowing productions to hook up to house power instead of rolling in generators. The set also had to comply with building codes and be tracked by city building inspectors.', 'The new New York Street was made to look like the city in the mid 20th century, a decision that required detailed craftsmanship such as window heads and sills that would have been carved out of wood in years past but were instead fabricated out of plastic foam and finished with plaster. Windows were installed to be easily replaced so productions can break them when scenes call for it.', 'Whetstone oversaw the project and, as part of his research, made several trips to New York, spending long hours on foot trying to get a sense of how light plays on buildings at night.', '""I was literally walking Lower Manhattan from 10 p.m. to 4 in the morning taking pictures,"" he said.', ""Read more: Almost everyone in Hollywood wants to get back to work. What's taking so long?"", 'Where the original ""Hello, Dolly!"" set was based on a commercial section of 1890s New York suitable for a parade, Fox elected to make the new set feel like a neighborhood from a later era.', '""It\'s more Lower Manhattan, more Bowery,"" Whetstone said. ""Definitely the Lower East Side.""', 'While the set is ""a default vision of New York City,"" said Whetstone, it also is intended to stand in for any major city. Through the years, Fox\'s New York Street has subbed for Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Pasadena.', 'Even though improving camera technology through the years has made it easier to shoot on location, there are reasons filmmakers keep shooting on studio lots, said Jason E. Squire, entertainment podcaster and professor emeritus at USC School of Cinematic Arts.', 'As filming equipment and cameras got lighter and more portable, the more free-flowing New Wave cinema that emerged in the late 1950s and ’60s employed provocative camerawork.', '""This liberation led to people shooting off the studio lot,"" Squire said. ""Filmmakers wanted to get away from the studio.""', 'But it has remained expensive to shoot a large-scale production in the real world with all the vehicles, equipment and personnel required to be transported and managed on-site.', '""One of the key decisions early in any production is whether to build sets on a lot or shoot in a real location,"" Squire said.\xa0""That depends on how intricate the sequences are going to be, how intimate.\xa0 It\'s a judgment call and a money call, and the money usually wins.""', 'Shooting behind studio gates also prevents uncomfortable collisions between fantasy and reality.', '""On the lot you don’t have interference from civilians,"" Squire said. ""You can control traffic, you can control lighting. All of the equipment is at your beck and call.""', 'Whetstone recalled having to flee location shooting in downtown L.A.’s Arts District when working on Season 1 of ""New Girl,"" a Fox television comedy starring Zooey Deschanel that premiered in 2011.', '""We started out shooting in downtown Los Angeles, and by the end of our fifth night shoot we had angered so many of the neighbors around in the community that we ended up building downtown L.A. on the Fox lot,"" Whetstone said.', 'The makeover of New York Street is in addition to a planned $1.5-billion upgrade of the Fox Studio Lot announced last year by Fox Corp. that is to include more soundstages and offices. Fox Corp. retained ownership of the lot when Walt Disney Co. bought most of 21st Century Fox’s entertainment assets in 2019.', 'The upgrades come as the real New York mounts an aggressive effort to lure TV and movie producers from L.A. by building new studios and soundstages.', 'On New York Street in Los Angeles, Fox also was able to transform the set behind the façades, adding 4,000 square feet of interior space that makes it easier to meld outdoor and indoor action. The studio declined to reveal exactly how much the new multimillion-dollar set cost, but Fox wants it to stand for another half-century at least.', '""This project was approached not just as temp architecture but as something more permanent,"" Whetstone said. ""We want this to last a long time.""', 'This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.']"

This adjustment takes the expected growth down to 1.1 million bpd.', ""The IEA's latest “Oil Market Report” attributes the downward revision to several key factors. Firstly, weak industrial activity in developed countries has led to a reduction in gasoil (a by-product of petroleum used as fuel) consumption. Additionally, a mild winter in Europe further dampened demand. The decline has been compounded by Europe's transition away from diesel vehicles."", 'Weak diesel deliveries in the United States also contributed to the overall reduction in OECD oil demand in the first quarter. The IEA noted that while demand in developed nations suffered, resilient consumption in non-OECD countries, particularly China, provided some offset.', ""The IEA's cautious outlook stands in stark contrast to the more optimistic projections from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).

OPEC's growth forecast of 1.85 million bpd for 2025 remains equally optimistic compared to the IEA's more conservative estimate of 1.2 million bpd."", 'The IEA also revised its oil supply growth estimates for 2024, reducing it from 770,000 bpd to 580,000 bpd due to significant outages in Brazil and logistical challenges in the U.S. Despite these adjustments, global supply is expected to reach a record high of 102.7 million bpd. This supply-demand balance will be crucial for OPEC+ as it decides on extending voluntary output cuts in its upcoming June meeting.', ""The divergence between the IEA and OPEC projections sends mixed signals about the future of the oil market.

Conversely, OPEC's optimistic outlook hinges on economic growth and favorable monetary policies."", 'The IEA expects oil demand to peak by 2030, aligning with global efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources.

Power noted fading EV interest from American consumers.', 'For the first time since J.D. Power began its Electric Vehicle Consideration Study in 2021, EV buying sentiment has dropped.', 'The latest edition of the study revealed that 24% of respondents say they are “very likely” to consider purchasing an EV, down from 26% a year ago.', 'In addition, the percentage of shoppers who say they are “overall likely” to consider purchasing an EV decreased to 58% from 61% last year.', 'According to the survey, the decline in enthusiasm for EVs can be traced to charging. Or a lack thereof.', 'Among shoppers who say they are “somewhat unlikely” or “very unlikely” to consider an EV, J.D. Power said 52% cited a “lack of charging station availability” as a reason for rejection — the highest proportion in the study. And these concerns about charging availability have risen, up 3% from a year ago.', 'Chief among those concerns is likely what’s happening with Tesla’s Supercharger network, the country’s largest.', 'Earlier this month Tesla CEO Elon Musk laid off nearly the entire Supercharger organization, which was responsible for the build-out of its best-in-class charging network.', 'Musk then backtracked on his initial stance and is promising to invest in growing the network, but the optics of the move certainly won’t help charging availability concerns. The company has since begun hiring some of the employees back.', 'Automakers like GM, Ford, Kia, Polestar, Stellantis, Honda, and others had signed up to access the Supercharger network and incorporate Tesla’s NACS plug inlet in their future vehicles, under the promise that the Supercharger network would continue to grow at a steady pace.', 'But the changing EV sentiment is more than just grappling with public charging infrastructure. The J.D. Power survey found that overall higher prices for EVs, limited driving distance (range anxiety), long charging times, and inability to charge at both home or work were also main concerns.', 'J.D. Power says more education about incentives like tax credits will help boost sales, but much work still needs to be done on the part of automakers, and perhaps the federal government, which has bet heavily on EV adoption in the country.', '“As understanding of EV incentives rises, so does the likelihood of consideration. However, approximately 40% of shoppers say they do not have a solid understanding of such incentives,” said Stewart Stropp, J.D. Power’s executive director of EV intelligence. “Prioritizing initiatives and efforts to educate consumers about the EV proposition — including available incentives and how they work — is vital to accelerating market growth.”', 'State and federal tax credits are certainly helping to make EVs more affordabile, but at the moment only 15 full EVs qualify for full or partial federal tax credits. Many Americans are likely unaware that any EV sold in America, regardless of country of production or battery sourcing requirements, can get the full federal tax credit of $7,500 if purchased through lease.', 'Nevertheless, cost considerations led to automakers adding incentives and cutting prices of to boost EV sales. Even Tesla earlier this month started offering 0.99% financing for new Model Y purchases for a limited time.', 'Perhaps suprisingly, even younger generations of buyers, who typically are in favor of new technology and greener transportation options, also expressed diminishing EV enthusiasm in the J.D. Power survey.', '“The lack of affordable EV models is affecting the two youngest buyer cohorts, Gen Z and Gen Y, with ‘very likely’ consideration down 2 and 5 percentage points year over year, respectively,” J.D. Power said.', 'Still, those cohorts do offer the most optimism for EV consideration, with 24% of Gen Z and 32% of Gen Y (Millennial) shoppers claiming they are “very likely” to consider an EV, more than the other generational cohorts J.D. Power surveyed.', 'J.D. Power’s data comes via responses from 8,179 consumers and was conducted from January through April 2024.', 'Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

There are a number of investment styles to suit the predilection of hundreds of investors looking for the best value stocks.', 'Among them, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is an easy-to-use tool for identifying low-priced stocks with high growth prospects.', ""The P/B ratio is used to calculate how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of book value of a stock. It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter's book value per share."", 'P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equity.', 'The P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks with high growth prospects. General Motors Company GM, Qifu Technology QFIN, The ODP Corporation ODP, Tri Pointe Homes TPH and Gray Television GTN are some such stocks.', 'Now, let us understand the concept of book value.', 'There are several ways by which book value can be defined.\xa0Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.', 'It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.', 'By comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.', 'A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value or the stock is undervalued and, therefore, a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.', 'For example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.', 'But there is a warning. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.', 'Moreover, the P/B ratio is not without limitations. It is useful for businesses like finance, investments, insurance and banking or manufacturing companies with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.', 'In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.', 'Price to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.', 'Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.', 'Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.', 'PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.', 'Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.', 'Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.', 'Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.', 'Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.', 'Here are five of the eight stocks that qualified the screening:', 'Headquartered in Detroit,\xa0General Motors is one of the world’s largest automakers.

From the cute home decor to the delicious snacks, there are many delightful items you'll find on the shelves at Target."", ""Target used to be a store I'd visit somewhat often. But these days, it's rare that I walk into Target. Here's why I've stopped shopping there -- at least in person."", ""The experience of shopping at Target can vary substantially from one location to the next. In recent years, my local Target has gone from being a well-stocked store to one with shelves that are half-bare much of the time. Not only that, but the store is often a mess. So all told, it's just not a pleasant experience."", ""If your local Target store has fallen victim to a similar fate, you may have more luck shopping on Target.com. While I've stopped going to Target in person, I do sometimes capitalize on the online deals. And generally speaking, the website's inventory tends to be more extensive."", ""Also, give other stores in your area a chance if Target hasn't been meeting your expectations."", ""Walmart sometimes gets a bad rap for mediocre quality, but I've recently gotten some pretty decent buys there. And you might save money on some of the items you're looking for by purchasing them at a warehouse club store like Costco or Sam's Club."", ""I happen to live in a bit of a Target dead zone in that there's not a store super close by. Since the closest Target to my home serves a number of towns in my area, the store tends to be pretty crowded. And as someone who doesn't enjoy navigating crowds, that makes for a bad experience."", ""In fact, I strategically try to do my in-person shopping at times when the stores I frequent tend to have fewer people. When I shop at Costco, I tend to get there right as the store is opening, which often does the trick. And I tend to shop for groceries at 9:30 a.m. after dropping my kids off at school, or I'll shop at 9 p.m. because I find the store isn't as busy at those times as it is in the afternoon or early evening."", ""If you're someone who doesn't enjoy crowds, then it's important to visit stores strategically like I do, whether it's at Target or someplace else. If you're frazzled due to crowded aisles and long checkout lines, you may not be in a position to think through your purchases carefully. That could result in wasted money or forgetting items on your shopping list."", ""Even though the quality of my local Target has declined recently, it's still Target, which means there's still ample opportunity to go off-list and make extra purchases that aren't good for my budget. Also, when I take my kids to Target to buy clothing, which is one of my biggest reasons for shopping there, they pretty much always want to check out other aisles that lead to me purchasing accessories, toys, or other items that weren't planned."", 'So now, I basically avoid Target to avoid overspending. I buy my food mostly at a local supermarket and Costco, and when my kids need clothing, I take them to a store that only sells clothing. If I need Target-specific brands (which is rarely the case), I order them online and stay out of the store.', ""You may love shopping at Target. But if your experience has shifted, you may want to take your business elsewhere.

The Arkansas-based retailer long known as a discount store has not only retained its budget-hunting customer, but it’s now also going after the wealthier crowd of competitors Target and Amazon.', 'The company reported 6% revenue growth to $161.5 billion and a comparable sales growth of 3.8% in its first quarter Thursday, which it said was driven by upper-income shoppers. Walmart was so optimistic it raised its outlook for growth to 4% from 3% for the year and expects adjusted earnings to be $2.37 per share, up from $2.23.', '“We are seeing customers trade into Walmart,” Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey told Bloomberg on Thursday. “We’ve historically been thought of for value, but now it’s value, quality and convenience.”', 'Walmart attributed its growth to its 21% surge in e-commerce revenue, led by curbside pick-up and delivery orders—a service typically favored by wealthier consumers looking for convenience. It also gained market share in groceries as consumers continue to stray from discretionary purchases in favor of just buying the essentials.', 'Customers making over $100,000 have contributed the most to Walmart’s market share takeover, according to analyst Neil Saunders of GlobalData, and the retailer’s strategies of late reflect its desire to keep that the case. In April, Walmart announced the release of the premium own-brand food line bettergoods, with a focus on bright packaging and plant-based items to appeal to Gen Z and bougie shoppers. Earlier this year the retailer remodeled and revamped 800 locations, stocking wider shelves with $50 silk sleep masks and $230 duck breast. The company plans to remodel 900 stores in 2024, CEO Doug McMillon said in the company’s earnings presentation.', 'These tactics are on top of its consistent discount efforts, which McMillon said have been key to Walmart continuing to resonate with its consumer base—particularly as consumer sentiment reaches a six-month low despite cooling inflation—and have kept analysts upbeat on the company.', '“Despite a volatile consumer spending backdrop, increased concerns on the health of the low-end consumer, and the relative resiliency of shares of [Walmart], we approach its [first quarter] print with optimism,” Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai wrote.', 'While Walmart has moved to appeal to higher-income consumers, historically higher-income-focused Target has gone in the opposite direction as the company lags in sales. Regarded for its cheap-chic, Tar-jay reputation, the Minnesota retailer has pivoted to lower-income customers, launching in February its “dealworthy” budget brands with most items under $10. It’s not an all-in endeavor for Target: The company also launched its own paid membership, Target Circle 360, mirroring Amazon Prime and Walmart+ efforts to tap into well-to-do customers looking for convenience.', 'Amazon has made similar moves to compete with Walmart’s e-commerce rally, introducing last month an unlimited grocery delivery service under $10 for Amazon Prime members, with the same service available for EBT cardholders without Prime for $4.99. Last July, Walmart rolled out Walmart+ Assist and cut the price of its paid membership in half for those receiving government assistance. Walmart’s grocery delivery services eclipsed Amazon’s since 2019, with Insider Intelligence predicting recently that Walmart orders will make up 26.9% of online grocery sales by the end of 2024, with Amazon making up 18.5%. While the big-box retailer has expanded to 4.4 billion units delivered in the past 12 months, Amazon Prime reported last month it delivered 4 billion items for same or next-day delivery in the U.S. in 2023.', 'Other factors are keeping Walmart on top: The company grew its advertising business 24%, a venture with higher margins than retail. It laid off hundreds of its corporate staff earlier this week, relocating many remote employees to its Arkansas headquarters, a decision that came on the heels of its move to shutter all 51 of its health care clinics. Walmart decreased U.S. inventory 4.2% as an additional cost-cutting measure.\xa0 But Oliver Chen, an analyst at TD Cowen, told Bloomberg in March that Walmart’s real advantage lies in its potential to tap into customers across tax brackets.', '“This is about modernizing the brand and making it seem chic and cool,” Chen said. “Walmart is good at basics and wants to be known for more than that — and sell more than that.”', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher.

Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.', 'In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements."", 'Is RCL Worth Investing In?', 'In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Royal Caribbean, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 10% over the past month to $10.96.', ""Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Royal Caribbean.

During this period, the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry, which Royal Caribbean falls in, has gained 4.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'Royal Caribbean is expected to post earnings of $2.69 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +47.8%.

This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction)."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss.

So it’s not surprising that the Federal Reserve notes that aggregated consumer credit card balances finished 2023 at a record high level of $1.13 trillion, up $50 billion in Q4 alone. This is a double-edged sword, as the current high interest rate regime makes this credit more expensive – but the increase in credit card usage also suggests that consumer spending remains strong.', 'And that strength may soon get a boost. Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA), the world’s two largest credit card issuing and processing companies, have recently settled a class action lawsuit that could provide consumers with an incentive to swipe their cards more often. The suit was an antitrust action against allegedly excessive card swipe fees, and the settlement may run to the tens of billions of dollars. As part of the settlement, both companies have agreed to limit the card swipe fees charged to merchants – a savings that could be passed on to customers.', 'For the card companies, the settlement promises to end the litigation without hitting revenues too hard – they make most of their money from the interest charged to card users. This opens up a potential boon for Visa and Mastercard, who may see costs go down while profits go up, and Piper Sandler analyst Arvind Ramnani is pounding the table for both big names, recommending that investors buy in now.', 'According to the TipRanks database, Visa and Mastercard shares also get Strong Buy ratings from the rest of the Street. Let’s take a closer look.', 'Visa', 'First up is Visa, the largest company among the world’s credit card issuers. A few ‘vital stats’ will show the magnitude of Visa’s market position. The company has more than 4.3 billion branded cards in circulation globally, across some 200 countries. The cards are issued by more than 14,500 financial institutions and are accepted at more than 130 million merchant locations. Visa processes approximately $15 trillion in annual transaction volume. All of this provides a solid foundation for the stock, and Visa has a market cap valuation of $563 billion.', 'In business since 1958, Visa has been a leader in the credit card segment since the industry’s beginning. The company has expanded to become one of the stock market’s blue-chip stalwarts. The company generated almost $30 billion in revenue in 2022, and more than $32.6 billion in 2023. It’s one of the market’s most durable companies, and shares in V have shown a steady long-term gain.', 'The company’s revenues and earnings both show a modest upward trend over the past several years. In the last financial release, covering fiscal 2Q24, Visa’s top line of $8.8 billion was up 10% year-over-year and cleared expectations by $180 million. The bottom line figure was $2.51 per share by non-GAAP measures, based on a non-GAAP net income of $5.1 billion. This EPS was 8 cents per share better than had been anticipated. Visa finished the fiscal quarter, on March 31 of this year, with deep pockets, reporting $20.8 billion in cash and liquid assets on hand – after returning $3.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividend payments and stock buybacks.', 'For analyst Arvind Ramnani, setting out the Piper Sandler take on Visa, the key points boil down to that steady long-term growth and the company’s sheer scale.', '“We believe that Visa should be able to grow revenues by 10.7%, driven by multiple growth drivers, including 10.4% growth in Data Processing, 9.5% in Services, and 10.7% International. This is supported by its foundational offering in 1) Annual aggregate transaction volume of ~$15T, with a vast growing TAM of over $250 trillion; 2) New Flows which captures new sources of money movement for consumers, businesses and governments – an in our view will be an important vector for growth; 3) Value Added Services, which serve as an important lever to deepen its client relationships by offering innovative solutions. Further, we believe that Visa can sustain operating margin expansion (modeling +140 bps in FY25) through its scale, continued execution, and efficiencies/margin uplift from new/emerging tech,” Ramnani opined.', 'Summing up his stance on V, Ramnani gives Visa stock an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating with a $322 price target that suggests a ~15% share appreciation for the next 12 months. (To watch Ramnani’s track record, click here)', 'Overall, the Strong Buy analyst consensus rating on Visa shares is based on 24 recent analyst reviews, with a 20 to 4 breakdown favoring Buys over Holds. The stock is selling for $280.21 and its average target price of $315.15 implies a one-year upside potential of ~12%. (See Visa stock forecast)', 'Mastercard', 'Now we’ll turn to Mastercard, the industry’s other giant company. Mastercard boasts a market cap of $425 billion, and there are approximately 3 billion Mastercard-issued cards in circulation worldwide. The company’s annual revenue came to $18.88 billion in 2021, rose to $22.24 billion in 2022, and hit $25.09 billion last year.', 'Mastercard lends its branding to cards issued by a wide range of financial institutions, and then acts as the payment processor for its branded cards. The company processed $9 trillion in gross dollar volume last year, and has already seen $2.3 trillion in gross dollar volume during the first quarter of this year. This represents a 10% increase from the prior-year period. The company’s cross-border volume, a measure of international transactions, was up 18% y/y in 1Q24.', 'Looking at the headline results from Q1, Mastercard saw quarterly revenue of $6.3 billion, up 10% year-over-year. The top line just skated over the forecast, beating it by $10 million. The company realized a net income of $3.1 billion in the quarter, or $3.31 per share, by non-GAAP reckoning. This compared favorably to the $2.80 EPS from 1Q23, and beat the forecast by 7 cents per share. Mastercard had nearly $7.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents available at the end of the quarter, and paid out $2.616 million to shareholders during Q1, through both repurchases and dividends.', 'Turning again to Ramnani’s view, we find the Piper Sandler analyst predicting continued growth for Mastercard, as the company grows into a large addressable market.', '“In our view, Mastercard should be able to deliver revenue growth of 11.0% this year and 12.7% in FY25, driven by 9.5%/13.5% Payment Network revenue growth (~62% of revenues), and Value-added Services and Solutions growth of 13.7%/11.5% (~38% of revenues) in FY24/ FY25. Underlying growth drivers include a massive untapped opportunity for consumer payments; Mastercard’s aggregate transaction volume of $9T in annual volume, with a vast TAM of over $250 trillion across domestic, cross-border, transaction processing, and value added services revenue channels,” Ramnani wrote.', '“Further,” Ramnani adds, “we expect Mastercard can sustain margin expansion (currently modeling +20bps in FY24 and +80bps in FY25) as the company continues to expand, disrupting cash as a preferred method of transacting, and as it grows into new service and tech offerings.”', 'Quantifying these comments, the Ramnani puts an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on MA shares, along with a $531 price target that points toward a gain of nearly 15% on the one-year horizon.', 'All in all, the consensus view from the Street on Mastercard is a Strong Buy, based on 23 recent analyst reviews that feature a lopsided split of 22 Buys to 1 Hold. The shares have a current trading price of $463.05 and an average target price of $525.25, together suggesting a ~13% potential upside by this time next year.

During this period, the Zacks Hotels and Motels industry, which Marriott falls in, has lost 1.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Marriott is expected to post earnings of $2.51 per share, indicating a change of +11.1% from the year-ago quarter.

Hand tools are sold through a franchisee-operated mobile van network that serve auto technicians who purchase tools at their own expense. A unique element of its business model is that franchisees bear significant risk, as they must invest in the mobile van, inventory, and software. At the same time, franchisees extend personal credit directly to technicians on an individual tool basis. Snap-on currently operates three segments: repair systems and information, commercial and industrial, and tools. Its finance arm provides financing to franchisees to run their operations, which includes offering loans and leases for mobile vans.', 'Snap-on Inc has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 1986. Dividends are currently distributed on a quarterly basis. Snap-on Inc has increased its dividend each year since 1995.

Below is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share for tracking historical trends.', ""As of today, Snap-on Inc currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.51% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 2.67%. This suggests an expectation of increased dividend payments over the next 12 months. Over the past three years, Snap-on Inc's annual dividend growth rate was 14.60%. Extended to a five-year horizon, this rate decreased to 14.50% per year.

The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2024-03-31, Snap-on Inc's dividend payout ratio is 0.36."", ""Snap-on Inc's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers.

The company has reported positive net income for each of year over the past decade, further solidifying its high profitability."", ""To ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. Snap-on Inc's growth rank of 10 out of 10 suggests that the company's growth trajectory is good relative to its competitors. Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and Snap-on Inc's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. Snap-on Inc's revenue has increased by approximately 9.60% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 54.82% of global competitors. The company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, Snap-on Inc's earnings increased by approximately 18.10% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 58.37% of global competitors.

It started with our desire to push harder into women’s empowerment. We started doing our first women’s cooperative in Rwanda, with the idea of bringing empowerment to women in rural communities.”', 'Fraser said Kate Spade put a lot of work into women’s physical health, literacy and nutrition and what they discovered — partially because Rwanda has a history of genocide — was there were a lot of mental health issues. “When we added women’s mental health resources into the work, their empowerment scores skyrocketed. We discovered you can not be an empowered woman without addressing mental health,” Fraser said.', 'Further, she explained that the brand is multidimensional. “It’s not just about happiness.

It’s a very caring community.” One of the things that came out of Kate Spade’s death, is an inside grassroots effort called Mind Body Soul where they do yoga, meditation and offer all kinds of events to help people.

Then these models go on to do their job of completing complex tasks. Nvidia holds 80% of the AI chip market because its GPUs are the fastest around, and that's translated into explosive earnings performance."", ""The company's quarterly earnings have surpassed analysts' estimates in at least the past four quarters. And revenue and net income have climbed in the triple and even quadruple digits in recent quarters -- well into the billions of dollars. So it's no surprise the stock has soared more than 200% over the past year."", 'Considering all of this, should you rush out to buy Nvidia stock before its May 22 earnings report?', ""First, here's a look at Nvidia's earnings path so far. A few years back, the company generated most of its revenue from the video game industry, with the GPU bringing games to life on the screen. But the GPU's ability to process multiple tasks at a time made it clear that this chip could score a big win in other industries, too. Nvidia created CUDA, a parallel computing platform that brings the GPU to general computing -- and that opened the door to AI."", ""Since then, Nvidia has progressively grown revenue from its data center business -- which includes its AI offerings -- and this now represents the company's biggest source of growth and revenue. In the most recent quarter, data center revenue soared more than 400% year over year to a record $18.4 billion. That's on total revenue of about $22 billion (also a record) and significantly more than gaming revenue of $2.9 billion."", ""In addition to GPUs, Nvidia offers a wide range of products and services, including a growing cloud software platform that streamlines the development of a company's AI applications. Potential customers can gain access to all of this through the world's major cloud providers -- so it's easy for a business to learn about what Nvidia has to offer and get started."", ""It's true that Nvidia faces increasing competition from rivals, such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, which both have announced new high-performing chips in recent times.

For example, Amazon's Amazon Web Services (AWS), sells Nvidia products and its own in-house developed training and inference chips."", ""These players probably will gain some market share, but Nvidia still has what it takes to dominate the market and keep those looking for a premium chip coming back. This is due to the company's first-to-market advantage, along with its reputation for top performance and ongoing innovation."", ""Later this year, the company plans to release its Blackwell architecture, including six new technologies -- and this includes the most powerful chip yet.

The GAAP gross margin forecast of 76.3% also shows a great leap from the prior period, when GAAP gross margin was 64.6%."", ""One factor that may represent a headwind is the U.S. government's restriction on sales of AI chips to China.

Even the smooth gray concrete curbs looked suspiciously fresh.', '“After the curbs were perfectly poured, we had a gentleman with a jackhammer come in here and chip away at them,” said Gary Ehrlich, president of studio operations. “It was slightly heartbreaking to see.”', 'Today, the curbs are suitably beaten up, with dings and black smears as if tires had been rubbing against them for decades. Fire escapes look corroded and other metal fixtures such as banisters have been coated to look old or rusty, while walls appear water-stained. A patina of age has settled over this faux city.', 'The painstaking besmirchment of New York Street was one more twist in the long saga of one of filmdom’s most famous outdoor sets. Looming near the front gate like an adult-sized playhouse, an earlier version of the set and now the new one have long served notice to visitors that they have arrived at a movie studio that is itself a leading character in Hollywood lore.', 'Its lineage is suitably rich in Hollywood flavor: In 1967 Fox was preparing to shoot the film version of ""Hello, Dolly!,"" a Tony-award winning musical set in 1890s New York City that ran for years on Broadway. The script included a spectacular outdoor parade with thousands of extras, and studio executives determined that it would be impossible to shoot on location in New York because the city had changed too much.', 'Fox production designer John DeCuir, who had already won Academy Awards for his design of “The King and I” and “Cleopatra,” came up with a streetscape that required more than 500 workers to labor for four months to build.

Among the performers were the UCLA marching band and the Budweiser Clydesdales. The director was actor-dancer Gene Kelly.', 'As impressive as the set was, it was intended to be temporary, said Michael Whetstone, a production designer who worked on building the new version of New York Street.', '""It was supposed to be torn down but wasn\'t because it was too expensive"" to remove, he said. At the time the studio was reeling from financial setbacks including a $30-million loss on ""Hello, Dolly!,"" according to the New York Times.', 'The set enjoyed a second, money-making act in the years that followed as Fox rented it out for use on pictures that included Warner Bros.\' comedy ""Up the Sandbox,"" starring Streisand, and MGM\'s musical ""New York, New York,"" starring Liza Minnelli and Robert De Niro. Among the television shows that used it were ""Charlie\'s Angels"" and ""Moonlighting,"" while Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga and other musicians used it for music videos.', 'But a few years ago, with the set showing its age, the studio started considering its replacement, Ehrlich said. ""It had been exposed to the elements for five decades and was past its useful life.""', 'Fox tapped Culver City architect Nathan Moore of House & Robertson Architects to design something sturdier.', 'Construction required 49 tons of rebar and more than 1,000 cubic feet of concrete. The set is held up by 260 tons of structural steel and backed inside with 4,400 square feet of catwalks. Lighting and other electrical functions are supported with 21,000 square feet of conduit and wire, allowing productions to hook up to house power instead of rolling in generators. The set also had to comply with building codes and be tracked by city building inspectors.', 'The new New York Street was made to look like the city in the mid 20th century, a decision that required detailed craftsmanship such as window heads and sills that would have been carved out of wood in years past but were instead fabricated out of plastic foam and finished with plaster. Windows were installed to be easily replaced so productions can break them when scenes call for it.', 'Whetstone oversaw the project and, as part of his research, made several trips to New York, spending long hours on foot trying to get a sense of how light plays on buildings at night.', '""I was literally walking Lower Manhattan from 10 p.m. to 4 in the morning taking pictures,"" he said.', ""Read more: Almost everyone in Hollywood wants to get back to work. What's taking so long?"", 'Where the original ""Hello, Dolly!"" set was based on a commercial section of 1890s New York suitable for a parade, Fox elected to make the new set feel like a neighborhood from a later era.', '""It\'s more Lower Manhattan, more Bowery,"" Whetstone said.

Fox Corp. retained ownership of the lot when Walt Disney Co. bought most of 21st Century Fox’s entertainment assets in 2019.', 'The upgrades come as the real New York mounts an aggressive effort to lure TV and movie producers from L.A. by building new studios and soundstages.', 'On New York Street in Los Angeles, Fox also was able to transform the set behind the façades, adding 4,000 square feet of interior space that makes it easier to meld outdoor and indoor action. The studio declined to reveal exactly how much the new multimillion-dollar set cost, but Fox wants it to stand for another half-century at least.', '""This project was approached not just as temp architecture but as something more permanent,"" Whetstone said.

Plank', ""Thank you, Lance, and to everyone joining us this morning. We've got a lot to get through on today's call, including some extended prepared remarks, so let's dive right in. Four-plus years removed from the President and CEO role at Under Armour, I am bringing a clear sense of purpose and 100% commitment with 0 distractions from making UA excellent. I've gained a unique perspective from the Executive Chair Board seat. And while I've maintained a presence in the business throughout, that role was very different from the responsibility and opportunity I now have as CEO to affect the day-to-day decisions of this brand. I look forward to applying these lessons with renewed approach to leadership. During this time, our industry has undergone significant changes, including a global pandemic that tested the resilience of the consumer value chain and increased competition with many new capable entrants that have altered shopping behavior and preferences. However, our aspiration to build the world's best athletic performance brand has not changed. Our goal has always been to be a premium brand of choice driven by industry-leading athletic performance products, inspirational storytelling and elevated consumer experiences. Yet, we have not consistently nor holistically delivered on this ambition. A lack of continuity, increased complexity have challenged our execution with several CEOs and heads of product marketing in North America over the past half decade. Ongoing turnover of critical leadership has been central to our inability to stay agile and decisive. From uneven execution across product and marketing to suboptimal segmentation, wholesale relationships and DTC performance, there remains a significant opportunity to activate more effectively across the dimensions that matter to drive improved brand affinity and therefore, demand. With several of our executive team being new to their roles, my top priority is to bring clarity and stability to our business. Said better, we must make the complex simple and the simple compelling. To address this, we will reconstitute Under Armour's brand strength over the next 18 months by focusing on brand-building fundamentals like making great products, telling the best story about those products and servicing every aspect of delivering our business while building the best team. As a podium brand, meaning 1 of just 3 or 4 global brands that have the credibility of being recognized worldwide as an authentic on-field, court and pitch athletic performance brand, we have an incredible foundation from which to reconstitute a winning culture. And while I have no delusions that this is to be a repeat of how this brand was built the first time, there are certainly parts that will rhyme. And I plan to use every tool of resource or experience available to me and UA to make us successful. That said, I do not arrive at the next part of the call easily, but it is where we are today. We had a confluence of factors, including lower wholesale orders, proactive decisions to restore brand health to our eCommerce and lead times to bring new products to market. We are at crossroads of defensive necessity and offensive opportunity. Therefore, before driving forward, we'll be taking a larger step back in fiscal '25 with an expectation that our revenue will be down at a low double-digit rate. This includes an approximate 15% to 17% decline in North America driven by 3 factors that I will go into later in the call as we work to meaningfully reset this business while navigating an environment made more challenging by our execution in the past. In our international regions, we expect revenue to be down at a low single-digit rate due to some conservative macro consumer trends we see as well as applying lessons learned here in North America to ensure that we protect the brand strength that we've built in EMEA, APAC and Latin America. From a channel perspective, we see our wholesale business to be down at a low double-digit rate and direct-to-consumer to be down approximately 10% due to proactive actions to significantly reduce the discounting level within our own eCommerce business. This reflects some of the foundational steps in our ambition to create a more premium stance for our brand. By product, we expect apparel and footwear sales to be down at a low double-digit rate and our accessories business to remain essentially flat year-over-year. Even with this revenue contraction, we expect a gross margin improvement of 75 to 100 basis points due to the material reduction in promotional and discounting activities through our DTC business and proactive product and costing initiatives. Turning to SG&A. As we work to streamline our business further, we anticipate our expenses to be down 2% to 4% in fiscal '25. This includes a Board-approved restructuring plan to help strengthen and support additional financial and operational efficiencies. While Dave will provide more detail, we expect to incur total estimated pretax restructuring and related charges of approximately $70 million to $90 million. Excluding the midpoint of this restructuring range, we expect $130 million to $150 million in adjusted operating income, representing $0.18 to $0.21 of adjusted diluted earnings per share. This is not where I envisioned Under Armour playing at this point in our journey. That said, we'll use this turbulence to reconstitute our brand and business, giving athletes, retail customers and shareholders bigger and better reasons to care about and believe in Under Armour's potential, a potential backed by nearly 1,900 retail stores and a worldwide presence in almost 100 countries, respected by athletes as a podium brand with a distinctive positioning of innovation and performance that is truly unique. From a product perspective, we're not just chasing the low-hanging fruit of sportswear. We're reinvigorating our culture of blowing athletes' minds with a consistent drumbeat of innovation. We must become a brand of launches, creating products that solve athlete problems while communicating the story of how and why our products deliver. The good news is that we're already doing this. For example, we delivered 6 new footwear drops in February alone: Infinite Pro and Infinite Elite, SlipSpeed Mega, Curry color drops at the NBA All-Star game, the Apparition from UA sportswear and the Drive Pro in golf. The larger problem is that you've probably never heard about any or most of them. We'll make sure that if a product is important enough for us to make and release, it's also important enough to celebrate with storytelling or plainly, we just won't make it. So giving stakeholders reasons to believe begs the question, how do we plan to strengthen the Under Armour brand? It starts by reminding everyone, ourselves included, why we're here. Under Armour is a sports house. This is our reason for being. It's our DNA and identity. Under Armour is about athletes and innovation, leading with team sports. We equip those athletes to push the boundaries of what is possible by inspiring them with performance solutions they never knew they needed and once they've tried them, cannot imagine living without. At the backbone of all this is an authentic passion with an identity of grit. Under Armour was not born on that podium, but of an underdog spirit, the long shot, the athlete without all the gifts who some way, somehow finds a way to persevere. That underdog grit is our differentiator, and we will embrace this mentality in this chapter as a brand.With this brand positioning recentered and solidified, we're narrowing and simplifying our Protect This House strategy to rebuild our core through 3 main priorities: first is delivering better products and storytelling, to amplify demand and loyalty; second is running smarter plays by simplifying, modernizing and optimizing our systems, structure and processes so we harness efficiency for effectiveness; and third, is elevating consumer experiences, mandating excellence where, when and how athletes choose to engage with our brand and transact. So starting with delivering better products and storytelling. This is about the constant and a [movement] with troika, of athlete, product and story, particularly in our North American business. This balance of this triad has been underserved for quite some time.In our largest market, we have become a brand that, well, competes primarily on price versus our core competency, which is performance and technical innovation, an aspect of UA that has frankly gone untold for too long. To correct this, we must reprioritize our innovation agenda by reminding athletes that our products perform like no other in the industry, a flawless balance of science, function and style made to empower them to be the best at whatever they do from Monday to Sunday. We are eliminating products that do not meet our standard to sell much more of much fewer products accomplished by editing more intentionally. Led by our Chief Product Officer, Yassine Saidi, we are committed to this vision, but it requires having one point of view with considerably improved design language, a reduced but more intentional fabric library that includes a clear good, better, best segmentation for distribution, trend-right colorways and standardized fits across all the athletes we serve. Dissecting our execution further, too many areas of our product strategy have been designated as priorities. This has caused operational inefficiency and a strain on resources, which has diluted our ability to have a consumer-centric point of view, consistent storytelling and an effective go-to-market process. Over the past few years, it's also evident that we've taken our eyes off of our core men's apparel business, which, particularly in North America, has permitted this business to become more promotional and commoditized. That has significantly impacted our brand's perception. We will rectify this. This focus does not mean that we are deprioritizing our footwear or women's business per se, but from a sequencing perspective, men's apparel will be our highest priority. We're also reorganizing our product and marketing teams around our largest revenue sports categories of training, running, sportswear, golf and basketball while ensuring that the authenticator of team sports is still our front porch in every region where we compete. Here in North America, the United States, that means our presence in American football, soccer, baseball, softball, volleyball, lacrosse as the core sports we'll speak to and solve problems for with our amazing performance innovation. The specific core sport authenticators will, of course, vary by region. So given the newness of our leadership and product lead times, the critical mass of elevated offerings won't fully come to market until our fall/winter '25 collection, which is the second half of our fiscal '26. However, as we work through this in-between period, I challenge the team to adjust our operating and go-to-market models in 3 actionable ways. First, refine our product assortment and reduce our SKU or style count by roughly 25% over the next 18 months, intentionally decreasing our good discounted level mix while scaling our better and best offerings to drive balance into our segmentation. This will significantly reduce workloads for our teams and allow them to focus and prioritize on making any product that comes from our engine excellent with a product and story that we will be proud of. Secondly, our current go-to-market has only one gear with an 18-month process to get a product from an idea to the selling floor. This is just plain uncompetitive in the 2024 landscape. That said, we'll be pursuing a faster 6- and 12-month go-to-market capability, which was recently demonstrated with the release of the world's first true performance headwear that immediately sold out, the StealthForm Uncrushable hat, which debuted on Jordan Spieth at this year's Masters Golf Tournament that delivered in just 6 months and is now on preorder for athletes at a $45 price point. The StealthForm Uncrushable is also a good metaphor for who we expect to be in our industry: innovative, premium, stylish, and nothing else like it in the market, a product that truly helps you perform better with its comfortable fit, technical material cooling and stretch that feels like a secure hug for your head and deliver to the market with speed. And finally, building out a direct-to-consumer line of exclusive products for our own stores and eCommerce. Wholesale is about 60% of our business and will be hypercritical for our success and how we will achieve the elevated position and vision of the UA brand I'm describing. Yet it has been far too long since we've shown retailers our vision. So using our own physical and digital stores as a proving ground, we will demonstrate what excellence can look like for the Under Armour brand, whether that is through a more premium price point or meaningfully amplified storytelling to drive success. We want our partners to call us because they're inspired by the innovation they see us building and not just what they sold from us before. While delivering better products and segmentation is central to our ability to drive greater future demand, our products must be married with authentic inspirational storytelling and technical education about how Under Armour makes athletes better. Our DNA, reason to buy and storytelling must permeate all consumer touch points. With some of the highest performing material sciences in our industry, including temperature management, moisture wicking, sustainable fabrics, cushioning, compression-based support, to be candid, we've done a poor job consistently communicating our product advantages to athletes. This must be fixed as it's hard to sell something that is a best-kept secret. In this respect, we are working to dramatically overhaul our product descriptions and hang tags and how our DTC and wholesale sales forces are equipped to tout our product attributes. When athletes research Under Armour online or choose our products in a store, it should be clear to them by answering 3 simple questions, what it is, what it does and how it will make them better. Going forward, a simplistic 3-point description of every UA product will be found consistently on our hang tags, point of purchase and website and conveyed by our associates on the floor. Brands are built with consistency. So make no mistake, we'll be strengthening our brand in this chapter. That's not to say we haven't succeeded in marrying these efforts well in our recent path. When our product and marketing engines are aligned, showcasing product innovations with relevant storytelling, we've seen success in driving positive demand. A recent example can be seen at this year's Boston Marathon, where UA athlete, Sharon Lokedi took her third podium wearing our $250 Velociti Elite 2 running shoe, a trend we think will continue. In preparation for the race, we immersed media and influencers in run experience and flooded our social media channels. Of course, there are other examples where we've been running this consistent play and have shown up proudly like our SlipSpeed launch and ongoing business there, our Unstoppable pants and the surrounding collections that make Unstoppable a force for UA and our women's Meridian products where we are building trust with her. We are at our best when we're on offense. We must harness and homogenize this approach more effectively across all consumer connections. Strong product team also requires strategic and operational collaboration with marketing to bring it all together. As mentioned on our last call, we've consolidated our global and North American marketing teams to bring a cleaner, more creative, integrated approach for faster decision-making and improved oversight into our spending and the returns we get for our investments there. Concerning our search for a new Chief Marketing Officer, I pressed pause while assuming the CEO role. And we'll be reengaging that search immediately as we have a strong candidate pool and expect to have this chair filled soon. Over the past 4-plus years, the company has become overly siloed and bureaucratic with competing internal agendas. We now have just one agenda as I'm describing it to you today. And communicating that to internal and external stakeholders is my immediate priority to build complete alignment. Given these changes in iterative evolutions, we are working quickly to disband these silos and drive a more productive, collaborative culture. And this brings us to the second priority within our refined Protect This House strategy, running smarter plays, where we will simplify our operating model, modernize our supply chain and planning process and optimize our cost base to drive greater efficiencies. To begin with, on a broad basis, we are simply doing too much stuff. There are too many products, too many initiatives, too much of too much. To reconstitute this brand, we must be highly focused and prioritize what needs to get done so that our teams know exactly what to do with a clear definition of success for them. As such, we are going to streamline across the organization. We will reduce the number of agencies, consultants and outside experts across the brand, which has reached unacceptable levels, especially in functions like marketing. We are building the talent, and they will now be empowered to run with their expertise and ability to drive our vision. We are also working to reduce the number of reports generated, unnecessary meetings and even the number of fabrics for our designers to choose from. In the overall bureaucracy that occurs when the business scales for being small to midsize to large, in short, we will be much more intentional everywhere. This includes activities that may have had a reason to exist at one time or another but no longer serve the brand. We're now prioritizing to ensure that anything we do or have our teams doing are only the activities that directly contribute in one way or another to our simplest of job descriptions, selling more shirts and shoes. We've talked about being consumer focused for years but never entirely organized our business as such. To enable consistency, we're employing a category portfolio structure designed to unlock the team's full potential, particularly how the work aligns with our talent, speed of delivery and the execution required to put us on a growth path. Under this structure, our product, marketing and sales organizations will work as a collective to develop singular go-to-market strategies that allow each category to obsess the needs of our athletes throughout their journey under the broader UA innovation brand umbrella. We'll be driven by technology and design, enabling us to lead our categories with clear intent and a sharper point of view. This structure will also provide greater visibility in the category and product performance, which is critical to developing greater agility and adaptation.On the product side, there was a critical piece of the puzzle that had been missing to power up this strategy. So a few weeks back, we announced that Yuron White, a 25-year sports industry veteran, had joined UA as our Senior Vice President of Sportswear, Running, Basketball, Curry and Collaborations. Complementing our legacy world-class experts already here, Yuron brings decades of game-changing product strategies, operational excellence and talent development, so we're excited to have him joining Yassine's team to lead those critical categories for the brand. As an important companion to our changes in product and marketing, we'll also improve our supply chain, end-to-end planning capabilities, both of which offer significant opportunity to drive operating efficiencies within our cost of goods sold line. These initiatives, along with proactive moves to reduce discounting and promotions and a reduction in SKUs gives us great confidence in our ability to improve ASPs and gross margin in the years ahead. Being a better, more responsive organization is a big part of our strategy. The natural question is, can we improve our cost structure while continuing to make the investments necessary to reconstitute our brand? Last year, we told you that we expected SG&A to be flat to up slightly. And with today's print, we came in better, even though our revenue was lower than our original expectation. To get there, we pushed hard on headcount and marketing, reduced travel and meeting costs and tightened our overall SG&A. This prudence will certainly continue as we move forward. In fiscal '25, we will optimize our SG&A cost base to ensure efficient and effective spending that supports the long-term health of the Under Armour brand. Of course, it's more than just cost cutting. This year, we will be even more intentional, identifying ways to streamline and realign the entire organization globally to set us up for an even more productive P&L once revenue inflects more positively. Now we move to our third priority, elevating consumer experiences, which is critical to becoming more premium in building better connections with athletes. In this case, we must drive excellence in our retail, eCommerce and wholesale businesses, aligning with our Protect This House strategy. We must ensure that our efforts to deliver better products and storytelling, enabled by a simplified operating model, will manifest through deliberate merchandising strategies and thoughtful distribution choices, particularly here in North America. And this brings me to probably our most important question to answer. So what is happening in North America? The anticipated North America decline in fiscal '25 is driven by 3 factors. The first is sector-specific. We're expecting lower wholesale revenue due to retailer cautiousness amid softer consumer demand in an intensely competitive environment. The second is specific to Under Armour as our softened brand and inconsistent execution were worsened by the impacts of the challenging retail environment over the past few years. The third is our proactive action to reset our business in our largest market by significantly reducing the discounting occurring with the brand, starting with our own DTC business.This reset begins through new leadership here in the Americas. Kara Trent, who is just a couple of months into the role, is a 9-year Under Armour veteran, who most recently led our EMEA region, where she built an accretive brand and business strength over the last few years. She's a leader with a point of view and knows what winning looks like. To arrest the slide in North America, Kara is bringing a strategy to simplify the business by focusing on 3 key areas: digital, team sports and our premium wholesale partners. Our eCommerce business has been overly dependent on promotions and is yet to be a flagship representation of a premium athletic brand. That said, our fiscal '25 outlook contemplates, among other actions, more than 50% fewer site-wide promotional days than last year and a reduction in the depth of discounts on the days that we do choose to promote. As consumers adjust to our new value proposition, these actions will weigh on our top line.The digital goal is to transform our eCommerce business into a significantly more premium platform over the next 18 months. This includes improving our online merchandising, creating a more engaging brand-building environment that encourages our consumers through compelling products with a clear story of why it will make them better. This means more DTC exclusive products and utilizing our new 6- or 12-month speed-to-market process to deliver limited volume products that drive brand heat and help create more brand demand moments. Further, we intend to reduce the number of made-for-outlet products on our website to drive a more premium assortment as well overall. So these actions will benefit us in creating a more elevated product offering and shopping experience for athletes over the long term. It also means harnessing the growing power of our U.S. loyalty program, UA Rewards, where we continue to see strong enrollment trends. With nearly 4 million members, we've engaged members with exclusive programs like a trip to the NBA All-Star game, an exclusive members-only product, including collabs with Logic and Justin Jefferson, which sold out in just hours. Our members also continue to show a higher premium purchase frequency and revenue per member, so we're encouraged about what this can mean over time. As a companion piece of this, as we improve our operating model and supply chain, we'll increase the awareness and velocity when we release new products, ensuring that newness is consistently associated with the brand, underscoring this concept of becoming a brand of launches, products that you never expected but could only be built by UA, telling a better story with fewer, more impactful products. Shifting to our own doors. Though a very small portion of North America's revenue today, our brand houses must become a premium showcase for the Under Armour brand. There is a significant opportunity to improve these stores, and we're working to create a more homogenous look and feel, curated with less product and more storytelling. We're piloting a new store concept now that we expect to test and learn from throughout fiscal '25. Our Factory House business must elevate the consumer experience by reducing unnecessary complexity. For example, in our 183 outlet doors in North America, we're over sorted across categories and have too many different floor sets. This compromises the clarity of experience for consumers when they walk through the door. And from an operational efficiency perspective, it's unacceptable, and we're correcting it with the right leadership now in place. We'll also enact greater discipline and balance between our promotional activities and inventory management needs in our outlet stores. Discounting can drive revenue in the short term, but it's not good for gross margin, balancing market price algorithms and clearly can negatively impact brand perception. In tandem with optimizing our operations and logistics, we believe these actions should lead to higher store profitability, which will have a meaningful impact on our nearly $1 billion Factory House business. Turning to North American wholesale. In my first month on the job, while I still have a few to meet with, I've had top-to-tops with several of our largest U.S. accounts, including DICK'S Sporting Goods, Academy, Shields and more. And as a note, I'll be meeting with key franchise retail and manufacturing partners when I travel to Europe and China before month's end. These interactions with our U.S. partners have been productive as to where we've been and where we are and encouraging as to where we expect to be once our product and marketing engines are reoptimized and firing on all cylinders. Given product lead times, the critical mass of this renewed product vision will not be coming until fall/winter '25 with a build into subsequent seasons from there.So it will take some time for our North American wholesale business to inflect positively. We will be making meaningful progress until then. In the meantime, we're focusing on rebuilding high-quality relationships with our key retail partners. We are confident we'll represent Under Armour in a brand-right manner, especially in sporting goods and mall accounts. But this will only occur for us as long as we stay committed to being authentic in the team sports arena, which is critical for our success. And so we'll continue this focus through team outfitting on the field, court and pitch. This is our differentiator and reason for having a relationship with our targeted 16- to 24-year-old varsity athlete.Elevating our product offering from mostly good and distorting toward better and best level products are also critical enablers combined with inspirational storytelling and more joint marketing with our wholesale partners. We have opportunity to do much more with key accounts. But to do so, we need to drive our aligned product and marketing engines to differentiate our business and convince athletes and our customers to covet Under Armour. Simply put, we haven't been as consistent in giving athletes or retail customers a reason to buy our brand as robustly as possible. As we execute our Protect This House strategy over the next 18 months, I'm confident this will set us on a path towards returning to growth in our critical North American market. We have the right formula for success and are driving forward with clarity and continuity of purpose. With our priority of reconstituting the brand in North America, it's important to explain the role that the international business plays in our go-forward strategy. The attention we are placing on the U.S. business is underscored by our 28 years of learning and understanding of brand management, that in order to be strong abroad, we must be our strongest at home.EMEA and APAC remain vital markets for Under Armour. And our brand is better positioned in these regions than in the U.S. today due to a history of channel discipline across our DTC and wholesale businesses. With consistently optimized brand activations, our expectation for a low single-digit revenue decline in our international business is partly due to more conservative consumer trends and ensuring that we don't erode brand equity by chasing lower-quality revenue.In EMEA, there were signs of retail caution, particularly in the U.K., which is our largest market there, including softer wholesale outlooks and increasingly cautious consumer sentiment and macroeconomic uncertainty. Sensing that trend and maintaining discipline, we expect to grow faster in our DTC channels in the region. And we'll invest in eCommerce processes and systems to support this growth. In wholesale, we'll continue to focus our business on the right partners, working to manage the environment appropriately. There's even more significant long-term growth potential in APAC. Still in the near term, the environment remains materially promotional in China, Southeast Asia and Japan. So our focus is to grow carefully and productively while investing in key markets, balancing short-term performance with long-term brand affinity. So we're not taking our eye off the ball in our international markets. We will focus on maintaining high-quality sales across all channels and protecting our premium brand positioning. Significantly, once we start to see a positive inflection in our largest and most profitable region of North America, more resources will be available to invest outside our home market to drive sustainable growth and profitability over the long term. And with that, I'll hand it over to Dave to review our fourth quarter and fiscal '24 results, provide more color on our fiscal '25 outlook, and then I'm going to come back to close out our prepared remarks. Dave?"", 'David E. Bergman', ""Thanks, Kevin. Starting with our fourth quarter fiscal '24 results, which were in line with our outlook, revenue was down 5% to $1.3 billion with a 10% decline in North America due to softer wholesale demand and lower sales to the off-price channel. Our DTC business was also down during the quarter with positive store growth, offset by softness in our eCommerce business. EMEA revenue was up 10% or 7% on a currency-neutral basis driven by strength in our wholesale and DTC businesses. APAC revenue was up 1% in the quarter or 5% on a currency-neutral basis driven by positive DTC sales, while wholesale results remained flat. And in Latin America, revenue was up 20% or 12% on a currency-neutral basis.From a channel perspective, fourth quarter wholesale revenue was down 7% driven by softer demand in our full price and distributor businesses and lower sales to the off-price channel. Our direct-to-consumer business was flat with 7% growth in our stores, offset by a 7% decline in our eCommerce business. And licensing was up 11%, led by positive results in our North American business. By product type, apparel revenue was down 1%, driven primarily by softness in our team sports, run and outdoor businesses, offset by strength in train and golf. Footwear was down 11% due to a tough comparison and softer demand, primarily in North America. As a reminder, we had robust growth during the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 as a significant volume of footwear products that were previously delayed due to COVID-related factory constraints meaningfully hit the market. And our accessories business was down 7%. Next is gross margin, which was up 170 basis points to 45% and aligned with our outlook. This increase was driven by 260 basis points of supply chain benefits, including lower product and freight costs and 100 basis points of favorable channel mix primarily related to lower sales to the off-price channel. These benefits were partially offset by 90 basis points of unfavorable pricing related to our proactive inventory management actions, including promotional activities in our DTC business and actions to reduce inventory through our Factory Houses. We also realized about 90 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Moving down the P&L. Our SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter were up 5%. Excluding a $58 million litigation reserve expense, adjusted SG&A expenses were down 5% due to ongoing cost management actions, including reduced salary and nonsalary compensation, and driving efficiencies and discretionary spending across our marketing and consulting budgets.Bringing this together, we had an operating loss of $4 million or excluding the litigation reserve expense, adjusted operating income of $54 million. Taking this to the bottom line, we realized a diluted earnings per share of $0.02 or adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.11. From a balance sheet perspective, inventory was down 19% to $958 million, approaching our pre-pandemic levels. And we closed the year with a strong cash position of $859 million and no borrowings under our $1.1 billion revolving credit facility. For the full year, fiscal '24 revenue declined 3% to $5.7 billion primarily due to challenges in our North American business, partially offset by international growth. Despite the revenue contraction, our full year gross margin increased 130 basis points to 46.1% driven primarily by supply chain benefits related to lower freight and product costs. This was partially offset by proactive inventory management actions, including increased promotional activities in our direct-to-consumer business. Full year SG&A expenses were up 1% to $2.4 billion. Excluding an $80 million litigation reserve expense, adjusted SG&A expenses were down 2% to $2.3 billion. Operating income was $230 million or $310 million on an adjusted basis if you exclude our litigation reserve. This aligns with the outlook we provided 1 year ago. Full year diluted earnings per share was $0.52, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.54, a beat versus our previous outlook of $0.50 to $0.52 mainly due to a better-than-anticipated tax rate and lower net interest expense. Shifting next to our fiscal '25 outlook. Given the magnitude of a low double-digit revenue decline, including a large step back in our wholesale volume and proactive actions we are taking to reset our North American eCommerce business, we are encouraged by our expectation for gross margin improvement and what that will mean as we retune the base over the next 18 months. Additionally, we will continue to prioritize investments and manage costs aggressively. As part of this effort, our fiscal '25 restructuring plan amplifies our focus on driving higher returns to deliver more consistent, long-term shareholder value. Within this plan, we expect to incur total estimated pretax restructuring and other related transformational charges of approximately $70 million to $90 million, including up to $50 million in cash-related charges, consisting of approximately $15 million in employee severance and benefit costs and $35 million related to various transformational initiatives and up to $40 million in noncash charges comprised of approximately $7 million in employee severance and benefit costs and $33 million in facility, software and other asset-related charges and impairments. That said, we continue to dig in and may uncover additional opportunities. Concerning anticipated savings and what that means for run rates moving forward, because we've only recently begun the work executing against this plan, it is too early to share those expectations. We anticipate providing additional details on our Q1 call in August. Next, I'd like to provide some color on the first quarter of fiscal '25. From a revenue perspective, we expect our first quarter to be down at a low teen rate, marking the most pronounced decline of the year due to continued wholesale softness and DTC contraction with growth in our retail stores more than offset by a decline in our eCommerce business reflecting our actions to reduce promotions. Next, we expect our first quarter gross margin to be down about 20 to 30 basis points due to a tough comp related to the timing of prior year supply chain benefits and negative foreign currency impacts. These challenges more than offset the benefits we expect to see with less discounting in our DTC business. After that, we expect our gross margin will expand for the rest of fiscal '25 as our product costing initiatives and material reductions to our promotional activities should drive more meaningful improvement as we progress through the year. From an SG&A perspective, we expect to realize close to half of our restructuring charges during the first quarter of fiscal '25. Bringing this to the bottom line, we expect a first quarter operating loss of approximately $75 million to $80 million. Excluding planned restructuring and other related impacts, we expect an adjusted operating loss of $35 million to $40 million, translating to an adjusted diluted loss per share of $0.08 to $0.10.Given our expected revenue decline, inventory management is top of mind. And having planned for this impact, our initial expectation is that inventory will be down at a high single-digit rate in the first quarter followed by slight declines after that and then bringing fiscal '25 to a close at essentially the same level as fiscal '24. And relative to CapEx, we anticipate spending approximately $200 million to $220 million. Finally, our Board of Directors approved a new 3-year, $500 million share buyback program. With confidence in our ability to generate cash, we believe this program provides an excellent opportunity to enhance shareholder value without compromising the financial flexibility necessary to reconstitute our brand as we target a return to top line growth. With that, I'll turn it back to Kevin for closing remarks before we open it up for questions."", 'Kevin A. Plank', ""Yes. Thank you, Dave. As we wrap up today's prepared remarks, and thank you for your patience in allowing us a chance to lay out our strategy and the actions we're already taking at UA, I'll touch on one final question. So what's different this time? And what are reasons to believe in Under Armour? From my vantage point, we've got a lot going for us as an authentic on-field performance brand with more than $5 billion in revenue. Millions of athletes worldwide believe Under Armour products make them better. To be sure, there is much more work to be done. And while there may be 50 things to fix at Under Armour, there are also 500 things that are working really well. We are a sports house, centered on athletic performance and a heritage authenticated in competition.Our refined Protect This House strategy is engineered to cut through the noise and complexity we've allowed to dilute the clear mission that once gave us our core focus and energy. As such, we are urgently working to regain our front foot, put wins on the board that can continue to build over time and optimize our business across the dimensions that matter.I cannot guarantee perfection as we undertake this journey, but I promise 100% team commitment to get Under Armour on a winning front foot. Leading from the top, along with our energized executive team, we will bring a clear unified vision, empowering the organization by providing stability and alignment to drive consistent execution with a clear articulation for all stakeholders of what success looks like. I'll say to investors today that when you buy Under Armour, you're buying a brand, a brand with a formidable heritage that is not easily replicated and one that is more valuable than even the company is at this point. Our job, my job is to close that gap with a strong balance sheet, global presence and awareness, ample resources and a talented team to take the necessary actions to evolve our company. I'll lead from the front foot knowing the name on the front of our UA jersey matters more than the name on the back. And as a team, we'll take care of the Under Armour brand. We are fully committed to shifting our trajectory. And for that to happen, we must change rhetoric into results. And with that, we'll open it up for questions. Operator?"", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from Simeon Siegel from BMO Capital Corp.', 'Simeon Avram Siegel', ""Kevin, so recognizing the tone shift, it makes me think of the last time you successfully focused, I think your words had been building a healthier rather than a [lateral] company or something to the effect. So how do you think about this go around of the brand elevation versus revenue contraction versus the last time you successfully elevated the brand and the gross margins? Maybe can you speak to how you'd expect the timeline of the path improvement to look? Obviously, the focus on brand health feels like the right move. But understandably, it's not an overnight fix. So would love to hear how you think that timeline and any goal posts or hurdles we should be watching for. And I guess, is your expectation in North America would return to growth in '26 or later? And then just if I can, Dave, can you just remind us what percentage of the OpEx are fixed versus variable costs? The gross margin gains are going to be powerful, and they feel key. But just also trying to think through what the right longer-term OpEx should be on the lower revenues."", 'Kevin A. Plank', ""Yes. Thank you, Simeon. And I think that really gets to the heart. I'm not sure if there's a, as I said, a repeat that's available to us, but there's certainly a lot of lessons of what brand building looks like. This is going to be a little different, so we're approaching that way and frankly, just using all the reasoning and thoughtfulness that -- and experience and hopefully some wisdom that we've gained over the years and being able to apply that to this chapter is what's most important. Let me just start because I think this really just nails into what's happening in North America. Not winning here, it hits me and our incredible team. It hits at our core. We are truly an authentically American brand. That is something we know how to do, and it's something that we can fix. I think it's not going to happen overnight, and that's why we continue to use this 18-month sort of outlook that we've been providing. And frankly, we've seen this in the face of the same cautionary consumer sentiment that you guys are hearing out in the market right now as well. The shifting consumer destocking cycle among retailers, bloated industry inventories, so they've been pretty conservative. And we're reacting and we're dealing with that. But as it relates to UA specifically, it's time for us to firm our brand up. And we want to make sure that we're transparent with this messaging as well, is that what we're seeing with the call down, about 2/3 of it is happening to us here in North America and about 1/3 of it is proactive, where we actually were making sure that we cut anything out and we give ourselves room to really start building the base of the brand. Now if there's any positive to be taken from sort of where we are right now beyond the macro environment softness, the majority of our difficulties, as I think I laid out pretty well in the script, have been, for lack of a better phrase, pretty much self-inflicted. And the good news is that we can control that. More importantly, we can address and we can fix that. At the simplest level, we find ourselves, for the most part, when we show up at retail, we're trading on price with more than should be good level product. That's just not who we are representative of the opportunity that this brand has. And we're not falling on a sword saying we just have to be premium. Our eyes are wide open. That consumer is there for us. They're not mad at us. When we do it right, and we get the product and the brand and the story right, and we've seen it with SlipSpeed, Unstoppable, this -- I'm really excited about it, it's a brilliant definition of what our team does. And when our team gets together, that is our team that built that, brought that together and so many other products in the pipeline that we have like that. But contextualizing them and getting them to market, commercialize them, that's where we can be just much better in telling their stories. In the script, I consistently referred to this idea of reconstituting the brand. And that run across product, supply chain, distribution, segmentation. So we must be better, of course, across the board, but it's probably best articulated at the simplest level in our lack of consistent story with our great product. So I'm taking a brand lens to this approach in where I can be the most helpful. And that's really attacking from the product and story and making sure that those 2 functions are truly married. Now of course, there's an entire organization that supports beneath that, but that's where I think we've been most inconsistent and where we can just get better really quickly. We need to ensure that only the amazing products that we make are the ones that make it to market, which is why just taking that 25% off the top, it's just forcing the teams to say, let's make a harder, better decision and make sure that we really, really love it, that we're excited about it and that we can articulate a story about it. So as I said, story is essential to what we're doing, retail, in-store, online, especially with better and best. And so we're going to focus and drive there. But I do want to emphasize, I spoke about the opening we have in the CMO function, but building out marketing with just, frankly, we're so proud I think of the engine that's built on the product side. When you look at from -- John Varvatos joining close to a year ago and Yassine now on board to lead the CPO effort and the ability to attract talent like Yuron White, giving a voice to that team is my highest priority. And it's going to take some time for us to see the goods that are coming from John and Yassine and Yuron and again, complemented with the incredible experts that we already still have here at UA. There's like a worldwide team that isn't -- they're not disappointed by this leadership coming in. They're really inspired by it because they see that this is about a bigger team winning. And everyone, I think, is really excited about our opportunity to do that. I think as you talk about the marketing side, but none of this happens because the 3 heads that we really need, it's product, story and it's the regional expertise. I mentioned Kara on the call, and she's just been a terrific leader who dove right in, in helping us reestablish the relationships with our critical wholesale partners as well as taking a real firm hand on what we're doing with our own DTC. But we're putting the pieces in place for this to happen. I don't have a crystal ball beyond -- as we're talking through fiscal '25 right now. But we do know that this brand deserves to establish our go-forward voice. I think we have a really clear point of view of how to do that and what success looks like. Now it's up to execution. And if we're looking for some kind of a bellwether to measure our success, I think gross margin is going to be a great indicator for us throughout fiscal '25."", 'David E. Bergman', ""And Simeon, this is Dave. Relative to variable and fixed, I think if you kind of remove the compensation cost, which isn't necessarily fixed and just get back to what's kind of locked in, that isn't going to change with revenue. That's probably a little bit less than 1/3 of our SG&A base, something that we've been working on over the years."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Jay Sole from UBS.', 'Jay Daniel Sole', ""Great. Kevin, I'm really interested in something you said at the top of the prepared remarks. You mentioned you have a renewed view on leadership. Can you just kind of take a step back and think about all of UA? Tell us what's renewed. Tell us how you think about leadership today maybe versus how you thought about it before and how it is going to help drive Under Armour forward? I mean it's clear that you have a clear vision about what needs to be done and where Under Armour needs to go. Connect for us how the leadership is going to play into that."", 'Kevin A. Plank', ""Yes. Well, thanks, Jay. I think from the top of the script to the end of my prepared remarks, number one, I love the [80] hockey reference, which is about the name of the jersey on the front versus the name on the back. It's building a team. And we've done a really good job, I think, of understanding what that means to set a vision and power that team and let them run. And we've got capability. And being in sort of the roles that I've been around the company, I've always had the ability, I think, to plug in different areas, but really been able to focus, I think, on building a team. Probably the thing I'm most proud of in the last 10 months is, as I described about our product team with the ability to attract John Varvatos, to get John here, to be able to attract Yassine here, the ability to get Yuron here as well. And most importantly, it was the ability to complement and keep those existing team members, our 15-year innovation head, our 21-year design head now gets to work with John. You're watching our team in sports and working with Yuron and his experience. So that meld of old and new is something that we're just going to utilize agility that we're going to play the best hand that we have. I think at the SCP and above level, we brought in 9 executives in the last 8 or 10 months. And I've been directly involved in recruiting virtually 8 of the 9. So touching this team, it really feels like it's ours. But I think not having to press too much and hopefully that an energy of finding that wisdom where you can tip your glasses to the end of your nose and sort of answer or say much more just through the way that you respond and the energy that you have. And so I'm really looking forward to that and looking forward to watching this leadership team really explode with the likes of Yassine, the what we've done with supply chain and Shawn Curran coming here from 30-year experience at Gap. And now it's a matter of just combining them together and melding that. So it's going to be a little -- as we're pulling everybody together, this team likes each other, and it's just a matter of us running."", 'Jay Daniel Sole', 'Got it. And maybe, Kevin, if I could follow up on that in the spirit of leadership. Are there other potential changes in the management team in the future? And how will you work to retain this fairly new team?', 'Kevin A. Plank', ""Well, I think we're all incentivized by seeing where we are right now is that we believe that we've got a brand that is not trading at the value that it is. And so everyone is incredibly inspired by that. No, I think most importantly, I'm looking for the additions that we are in the market, and we're looking for a CMO. And we'll have that position posted and leaving it open for the best candidates that come. But I tell you, our phone has been ringing. There's this buzz. I keep describing that product organization that we built. And you walk into that product, you can just feel something. And so I feel that obligation to make sure that we get a team to complement and round them out. And I know that we've got the regional leaders between Jason in APAC and Kevin Ross, another former UA veteran in EMEA and Kara Trent here. So we're pretty much stabilized, but there'll always be some limited amount of movement there. But the next one we're looking for is the addition of our new CMO."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim Securities.', 'Robert Scott Drbul', ""I have a couple, if that's okay. The first one is on the international outlook. How much of the macro is driving the low single-digit percent decline in international? Or is there something -- is there a weakness that you're seeing specific to Under Armour? And do you feel like you're being conservative in that international outlook? And I have a second one."", 'Kevin A. Plank', ""Yes. Thanks, Bob. I think that we're cautiously approaching this. Now we've got the benefit of 20 years having done and driven the UA brand and frankly, the lessons in the last 5 or 6 years here in North America. So we're incredibly bullish on the opportunity that we have, especially mid and long term. I think we're being cautious in the short term because we don't want to get caught up in a situation where we feel like we're trying to flood big logo hoodies. Like we've run that play. We've seen how that works. So I think we're bringing a bit of cautiousness and frankly, a bit of experience or wisdom to the way that we're approaching that. But in EMEA specifically is that it's definitely -- it's soft. There is the same sort of inventory issue that we're seeing with some of our wholesalers here. And so we're just -- we're representing a bit of caution there and also that we don't need to push the sales, meaning that we don't need to do anything other than what is in the absolute best interest of making sure that the 16- to 24-year-old just loves and covets the Under Armour brand. And what we've done in Europe, too, it's probably its own little sound bite. We brought Kara here from Europe from the success that she had from going back to 2019, a $600 million-ish brand that ended in 2000 -- or this past year, crossing over $1 billion. And the one thing that's really compelling is that we actually grew contribution margin from 8% to 16%, so doubling that contribution. So we've really been leveraging that hard. So we want to make sure that we can invest there as well. And as I said, I think we have the right leader to take us to the next level there. But what we're seeing are the signs of success. Our largest market there is the U.K. We're the #1 training brand, for instance, with JD Sports. We're within an arm's length that -- at SDI, if we're not #1, depending on the week. So we've got a great base to build from. And I think it's us just making sure that we do this smartly, and we build this as a brand together."", 'Robert Scott Drbul', ""Great. And just if I can ask a second question. Can you talk about the progress -- your view on the progress that you've made in eCommerce and the eCommerce channel? And how long will it take you to get your website to where you want it to be?"", 'Kevin A. Plank', ""Yes. I think that's a work in process that we'll never be done with that, but it's something that -- we've got a tremendous team. And so Jim coming on board has brought a lot of expertise that really parallels into our loyalty program as well that we have in a place that's been really good and really positive for us. So I think we've made great progress when it comes to what we can do in the web. But frankly, I don't think that's probably the best place where I think our product and our story are just not lining up well enough. I mentioned just finding some of the simplistic things to apply brand management, like identifying what are the 3 aspects that make this product desirable for the consumer. So I don't feel like we've played our best game online yet, and that's why we're focused by beginning with eliminating the -- or significantly reducing the amount of promotion so we can have a much cleaner story that comes through on the website."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer.', 'Brian William Nagel', ""A couple of questions. A couple of questions, Kevin, and I'll merge them together to make it simple. But I mean, first off, with regard to -- you talked about this in your script, but the product innovation, the new products coming. I guess just to make sure I want to understand the timing of that, when we should start to see these products. And then with that, the team you've assembled, the team -- a senior leadership before you, there was already product innovation. There's already been discussion about product innovation. Are you picking up on that? Or is there really more of a revamping overall with the product innovation in Under Armour?"", 'Kevin A. Plank', ""Let's be clear. We haven't been standing still. Thanks, Brian, for that question. But no, I mean, we've been moving forward the whole time. So it's not like we're waiting for fall '25. We're still going to move $5 billion plus of product this year. So there are athletes out there that have us. And I think the base that we have from team sports across the board is something we're really excited about. And we have -- I think it's just more of a focus. This goes back to the trimming the number of SKUs that we have and being really clear with our outlook there. But Unstoppable for us is working in an incredible way and something which is our -- basically our jogger pants line that we have in 5 or 6 different expressions. We've really made a commitment to driving and really getting back to the fundamentals of what makes UA, UA. Our base layer compression, as we call it here, heat gear and cold gear. We've tested that, for instance, in DSGs, Houses of Sport, and it's something that's done really well for us, and that's an area that we'll continue to expand. But it's really just reanchoring and resetting ourselves. We talked about how that men's apparel is going to be a priority for us. Just because it's the lowest hanging fruit where we can win the easiest for us, it doesn't mean we're going to neglect what we're doing on the women's front, the opportunity we have there. It doesn't mean we're going to neglect footwear, and that's why we're bringing these footwear experts across the industry. And I think that's what's so exciting. We, first and foremost, need to make sure that we're authenticating ourselves. And that's why I talked about the front porch of team sports. Revenue-wise, that aligns up through the 5 key categories that I mentioned in the script. But we know where we need to be better. And this isn't like we're just going to go turn on the faucet, and all of a sudden, sportswear is going to be the answer, it's that we have to drive and grind this thing the right way with making sure that every product that we put to the consumer is something that has them say, wow. It's making sure that we're approaching all these things, as I say, is that any product that we build, number one, there's 3 functions that I've asked for our product teams to do. Number one is edit and innovate, and that speaks to the 25% decline. It means being faster with the way that we are looking at product. Number two is ensuring that every product that we build begins with the athlete story of the problem that it's solving for. I just don't think we've done a good enough job there. But we've got places that are winning right now, our Vantage collection, our Meridian collection. On the footwear side, Curry is something that still, we think, has a massive upside and opportunity for us. And then we'll keep driving innovation with exploration like we did in accessories with the new StealthForm Uncrushable hat.And so as we start to replicate that and become more famous for less things, I'd like to say, companies are built because they made one product famous. Brands are built because they do it over and over again. So we need to focus on doing that through our product engine and making sure that that's not going to happen unless we have an amazing story to be told. And getting those 2 things up to speed, I think, almost go hand in hand."", 'Brian William Nagel', ""That's very helpful. I appreciate that. And then as a follow-up, and I guess bigger picture as well. You're talking about and others have talked about the more promotional environment within the space broadly. So I guess the question I have there, I mean, one, do you view that as more shorter term in nature? And then secondly, this is the bigger picture part. I mean for those of us who have followed Under Armour for a while, we remember very clearly when the brand was very successful. As you look at the competitive landscape now, you're putting aside some of these promotions. Do you still see that clear lane for the Under Armour brand when Under Armour's performing well? Or has competition changed that lane?"", 'Kevin A. Plank', ""Yes. Thank you. I can't speak to the -- I'm not a prognosticator on what the market has in front of us or what happens on a broad basis. But we know that we're -- I think we're just playing the hand that's right in front of us today. We're giving information, which is why we've really just -- when I say it's almost like running the company by constraints. It's like let's just take -- let's take a smaller bite. We've got 100 miles in front of us. We're going to work the 3 feet that's right in front of us right now. And I think this is what it's telling us, so that's what we're going to respond to. What I want to say about UA, it's interesting because I think about this deeply. Our authentification of being in team sports as I described it in the remarks as a podium brand, it's such a unique position. And you look at anyone else that's out there, I think where Under Armour stands alone is that there's big companies, you can call them old money, there's the cool kids. They're sort of the Sunday leisure league crowd, but there's no one that stands up for the little guy, for the athlete that was not picked first, for the long shot, the underdog.I think that representation for UA, it probably has a story that speaks to virtually everyone on the planet. And it's a position I feel that we own completely uniquely. I don't approach this as saying that's something that's god-given for us for the rest of time. So we better act on it soon. And that's -- we're playing that humble and hungry mentality that Under Armour long shot overcoming. And it's probably a really good metaphor for where we are right now. So I'm excited about what the future holds for us. I'm excited about this unique position that we hold in the marketplace. Now we just need to make sure that we deliver the product and the story together at once as the way it relates and goes and shows up at retail."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Sam Poser from Williams Trading.', 'Samuel Marc Poser', ""Kevin, I just -- a couple of things. You talked about Europe as it relates to the United States. And I'm wondering in the U.S. trying to elevate the brand, does this mean that you're going to cut off some of the more moderate distribution in order to elevate it to get away from -- over time to get to elevate the brand and make -- sort of force better and best to have more prevalence? And I have a follow-up."", 'Kevin A. Plank', ""Yes. I don't think that we -- we like our distribution today. I don't -- that will be part of the exercise as it always is, is constantly culling our retail partners. But it's also -- it's walking into some partners. And some of this, Sam, it's been as much on us of we do walk into one of our premium or close to premium sporting goods stores even here in the States. And the only thing that's leading or explaining what the product is, is the price that's in the upper left-hand corner. And it's hard to explain the difference between a $20 graphic T-shirt and a $45 Vantage T-shirt that has RUSH technology, and it's just not clearly articulated. So I think we're probably in a pretty good space. We may contract some of the doors and make sure that we're only coming through -- and some of those retailers. It's on the table always for us as well. But that's something 6 weeks in the job, we'll continue to evaluate. But for the most part, I just want to -- my main priority is focusing on the product that goes to anyone and ensuring that, that product and story show up hand in hand."", 'Samuel Marc Poser', ""And then what made you -- I mean this is a combined question. You said -- I want to know what led the decision for you to step back into this role. And to follow up on Jay's question, over the last few years, what have you learned? And how are you going to approach it to -- what have you learned over the last few years to -- that made you step back in and believe that it was time? And then secondly, you said earlier that everybody should be focusing on selling shirts and shoes. But I get -- I've had the issue with brand first, product first. And I'm wondering, is it sell shirts and shoes to the right people at the right time at the right price versus just selling shirts and shoes?"", 'Kevin A. Plank', ""Yes. Well, first of all, I think the ability to step away, it allowed me to get a lot of reflection of, number one, taking a breath after 24 years of running hard with the company since beginning in '96 or 25 years doing that. I got to watch my kid -- my son and my daughter play high school sports. I got to watch graduations. And I got to take a bit of a beat. That's not to say that I haven't been close or near the business at the same time. I've been watching the business, just from a different chair. And there's a very different outlook that you can have as coming from being the Chairman to being the active CEO and being able to actually affect day-to-day decisions. So I view this, honestly, Sam, I've been pinching myself for the last 6 weeks. I've done different things, but I realized that what I do love doing is selling shirts and shoes. And in doing that, let me just be really clear, this isn't just selling any shirts and shoes. It's selling the best shirts and shoes. In the product spectrum of good, better, best, I think Under Armour makes a lot of good, some better and nowhere near enough best. We're going to focus on that. And again, this isn't just with an eye on we should do it because we see ourselves as a premium brand. It's because I do believe that Under Armour has that upside, and we're also going to make sure that we pay the rent. And so we'd like to secure and solidify this good level of business, and we want to emphasize and focus on our better and best level business. And I can tell you confidently that we have the product engine and team now in place, both legacy as well as the new additions that have come on to lead this with Yassine at the top of that engine. I owe them and I owe this organization, this organization owes itself a great storytelling function. And we have some great people on our marketing teams, but we need to put all those pieces together and get product and story to be one functioning engine for us to sell only and mostly focusing on more, better and best as we look to grow from where we are today."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu from BNP Paribas.', 'Laurent Andre Vasilescu', ""I wanted to ask about the guide for international being down low single digits. Is that on a reported basis or a constant currency basis? And then, Kevin, I think you mentioned that the environment in China is very promotional. Can you provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing in that marketplace overall and how you're thinking about that business, that geography for fiscal year '25?"", 'David E. Bergman', ""Laurent, this is Dave. I'll jump in on this one. I don't want Kevin to lose his voice. So I think that -- a couple of different things. When we think about the high-level lead-in, I think Kevin gave a lot of color around that relative to how we're kind of smartly approaching our international and our growth and being prudent about that. I think within APAC, and this is actually consistent with EMEA as well, the DTC growth, we do see it being offset by some of the wholesale and distributor slowdown and caution that we see. So where we can directly control and drive the brand within DTC, we see that growing well. But it is some challenges in the markets with the wholesale and distributors. Within APAC more specifically, I would say that it's a little bit around the retail and eComm traffic, but we're driving against that very well. We've also got a little bit of pressure with a partner in South Korea that we're working through. There are some financial pressures there. But we are planning to increase our APAC store fleet by more than 80 doors this year, and that's more back half weighted. And we're excited about the upcoming Curry tour in Asia as well, which is really going to help from a brand voice and energy perspective. Within EMEA, Kevin alluded to this, but we have seen some higher inventory levels within some of our retail partners as we finished out fiscal '24. And that does impact the fiscal '25 orders a little bit. And so we planned for that appropriately. We do believe that, that's more of a temporary situation. And as those inventory levels clean up, you would expect better order flow coming through because the brand is very strong in EMEA. And we have great relationships with our partners there. So a little bit of caution maybe, a little bit of prudence, making sure that we're fueling the brand, making sure we're not chasing any revenue that's not the most premium revenue that we want to get after and just playing a smart game going forward."", 'Laurent Andre Vasilescu', ""That's very helpful."", 'Kevin A. Plank', 'In the spirit of supporting the team, Dave did a great job on that answer. I have nothing to add.', 'Laurent Andre Vasilescu', ""Okay. And then, Dave, maybe in order to spare Kevin's voice, you mentioned the adjusted SG&A was down 5% in 4Q. Maybe for the audience, can you just parse out where did marketing go for -- as a percentage of sales for 4Q? And as we think about the SG&A guide for the year of down 2% to 4% to your point, Kevin, you mentioned how you were able to manage that for fiscal year '24. Where does marketing as a percentage of sales go for fiscal year '25?"", 'David E. Bergman', ""Yes. So when we think about marketing throughout all of fiscal '24, we ran pretty close to kind of the 10% of revenue mark. So little fluctuations up and down. I think Q4 is probably high 9%, really close to 10%, finishing out the year at about 10%. And that play for fiscal '25 isn't significantly different. We've rebalanced some of that and really making sure that we're prioritizing the marketing investments. And Jim has done an excellent job working with the teams on that. But you're not going to see a noticeable difference in that percentage of revenue as we go through fiscal '25."", 'Operator', ""And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll be concluding today's question-and-answer session as well as today's conference call and presentation. We thank everyone for joining this morning. You may have -- you may disconnect. Have a great day.""]"

International sales are expected to be down in the low-single digits, wholesale sales are similarly seen dropping in the low-single digits, and direct-to-consumer sales are expected to be down about 10 percent as Under Armour reduces markdowns within its own e-commerce channel.', 'Apparel and footwear sales are expected to be down in the low double-digit range, he said, with accessories remaining flat year-over-year. But the company is projecting a gross margin improvement of 75 to 100 basis points due to the planned reduction in discounting and better product offerings.', 'In his first remarks since returning to the top post of the company he founded in his grandmother’s basement in 1995, Plank said his top priority is to bring “clarity and stability” to the business that he characterized as one of just three or four global brands that have the credibility of being recognized worldwide as an authentic on-field, court and pitch athletic performance brand.', 'But Plank doesn’t expect to run the same plays as he did when starting the company because the climate today is much different.', 'In his prepared remarks, Plank said innovation will remain at the core of the business. He pointed to the six new footwear drops the company released in February as an example, including Infinite Pro, Infinite Elite and SlipSpeed Mega. “The larger problem is that you probably never heard about any or most of them,” he said. “We’ll make sure that if a product is important enough for us to make and release, it’s also important enough to celebrate with storytelling or we just won’t make it.”', 'He said in North America, Under Armour has become a brand that “competes primarily on price versus our core competency, which is performance and technical innovation, an aspect of UA that has frankly gone untold for too long.”', 'But that storytelling will take place on a lot less product. He pointed to the company’s newly named chief product officer Yassine Saidi as the person who will serve as the gatekeeper. The style count will be reduced by 25 percent over the next 18 months, Plank said, with a focus on eliminating discount product and expanding the more-elevated merchandise.', '“Too many areas of our product strategy have been designated as priorities,” Plank said. “This has caused operational inefficiency and a strain on resources, which has diluted our ability to have a consumer-centric point of view, consistent storytelling and an effective go-to-market process. Over the past few years, it’s also evident that we took our eyes off our core men’s apparel business, which, particularly in North America, has permitted this business to become more promotional and commoditized. That has significantly impacted our brand’s perception. We will rectify this. This focus does not mean that we are de-prioritizing our footwear or women’s business per se, but from a sequencing perspective, men’s apparel will be our highest priority.”', 'The company will also concentrate its efforts on its core sports of football, soccer, baseball, softball, volleyball and lacrosse.', 'He complimented Under Armour’s chief design officer, John Varvatos, whose first product for the company will begin hitting the market shortly, as well as Yuron White, a 25-year sports industry veteran, who recently joined Under Armour as senior vice president of sportswear, running, basketball/Curry and collaborations, as key to the future.', '“I think we have a really clear point of view of…what success looks like. Now it’s up to execution.”', 'Plank will work to quicken Under Armour’s speed-to-market. He said right now, it takes 18 months for a product to move from an idea to the selling floor, which he said is “just plain uncompetitive in a 2024 landscape.” Instead, the company will pursue a six- to 12-month turnaround.', 'Under Armour expects to enhance the messaging in its own channels as a way to show its wholesale partners — wholesale accounts for 60 percent of sales — “what excellence can look like for the Under Armour brand.” Toward this end, the company will “dramatically overhaul our product descriptions and hang tags,” he said, “to tout our product attributes” and answer these questions: “what it is, what it does and how it will make them better.”', 'But creating innovative products can fall short without a strategic marketing plan to tout their attributes and Under Armour is currently searching for a chief marketing officer to lead that charge.', 'Plank said that over the past four years when he served as executive chairman and not CEO, “the company has become overly siloed and bureaucratic with competing internal agendas. We now have just one agenda…and my immediate priority…is to disband these siloes and drive a more-productive collaborative culture.”', 'This will result in a streamlining of the organization with a focus on the simplest of missions: “selling more shirts and shoes.” Plank did not say how many layoffs are planned or in what areas and a spokesperson said the company was not providing specifics beyond Plank’s remarks.', 'Turning to North America, Plank said the anticipated decline in sales in fiscal 2025 is due partially to “retailer cautiousness and softer consumer demand in an intensely competitive environment,” as well as to the company’s own “inconsistent execution,” exacerbated by discounting in its own DTC channels. He said there will be 50 percent fewer site-wide promotional days in fiscal ’25 along with a reduction in the size of the discounts as the company transitions into a “significantly more premium platform over the next 18 months.”', 'The amount of merchandise in its 183 outlet stores, which account for nearly $1 billion in sales, will be reduced as well and its full-price Brand House doors will “become a premium showcase for the Under Armour brand.”', 'Outside the U.S., Plank cited a softer wholesale outlook in the U.K., its largest market in Europe, but “significant long-term growth potential” in Asia.', 'Despite Plank’s long and detailed explanation of his turnaround strategy, the reaction on Wall Street was mixed with most analysts saying they believe the company is moving in the right direction, but citing that it will undoubtedly take some time before the effects are realized. The stock closed down 1.3 percent to $6.71 on Thursday.', 'Simeon Siegel of BMO Capital Markets rated the stock as outperform, noting that there will undoubtedly be initial share pressure, “but this may signify a material step in the right direction.”', 'Citing\xa0 a fiscal 2025 outlook well below Wall Street expectations, Sharon Zackfia of William Blair downgraded the company from outperform to market perform, saying: \xa0“While the goal of resetting the brand to a more premium positioning while narrowing the focus to core fundamentals could very well prove to be a meaningful catalyst over the longer term, the reality is that this will take time to unfold.”', 'Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said Under Armour can only blame its poor performance on itself since other sports brands such as On Running and Lululemon have been doing well.', 'Plank took over as CEO on April 1, succeeding Stephanie Linnartz, the former president of Marriott International who had been named president and CEO just over a year earlier. Linnartz remained with the company as an adviser through April 30 and received a severance package of $2.6 million in cash, eqaul to two times her base salary, as well as a performance bonus, vesting of stock worth $7.3 million as of their grant date, payment of her health benefits for 24 months and payment of the lease of her Baltimore apartment through the middle of this year.', 'Best of WWD', 'Harvey Nichols Sees Sales Dip, Losses Widen in Year Marred by Closures', 'Nike Logs $1.3 Billion Profit, But Supply Chain Issues Persist', 'Zegna Shares Start Trading on New York Stock Exchange']"

It aims to pay 10% of its operating cash flow through a fixed dividend plus a variable dividend of up to 50% of its excess free cash flow. As a result, you can rake in the cash when oil prices rise. But it also leaves you vulnerable to dividend cuts, which is exactly what happened in 2023.', ""Oil prices have stabilized, with WTI Light Crude Oil trading around $70 to $80 per barrel for much of the past year. As a result, Devon's earnings have fallen alongside its dividend. Last year, its earnings fell by 38% to $3.7 billion, while free cash flow came in at around $2.7 billion. As a result, its dividend was cut multiple times, and the dividend payout fell to $2.87 per share."", ""If you're bullish on oil prices long term, owning Devon stock could be an excellent way to express your investment thesis."", 'Oil prices could remain elevated because of tight supply and ongoing geopolitical tensions. OPEC+ has made a series of cuts since 2022 to support markets, and members, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, are committed to further reducing oil production and inventory levels.', 'In addition, the U.S. economy has remained resilient, and energy demand remains robust. Many U.S. producers are cautious about ramping up production because they fear overproducing after so many suffered huge losses in the 2010s from debt-fueled overexpansion. On top of that, long-term underinvestment could be another tailwind for elevated prices.', 'According to a report by Morgan Stanley, capital spent on oil exploration is half of what it was in 2014, while demand has increased by 5% over the same time.

Somewhere in the ballpark of $16 billion and $13 billion have, respectively, been put to work in shares of Chevron and Occidental -- and this doesn't count the $8.5 billion in Occidental Petroleum preferred stock that Berkshire also owns."", ""Spending an aggregate of $29 billion on energy stocks is a pretty clear indication that Berkshire's smartest investment minds expect the spot price of crude oil to remain elevated. Following years of capital underinvestment during the pandemic by energy majors (including Chevron and Occidental), the global supply of crude oil is constrained. With no easy fix in sight, higher spot prices should be beneficial to the high-margin drilling segments of both companies."", ""Warren Buffett put quite a bit of his company's capital to work when beverage company Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and credit-services provider American Express (NYSE: AXP) were added to Berkshire's portfolio in 1988 and 1991, respectively. Based on a previous annual letter to shareholders, Buffett points out that his company's cost basis on Coca-Cola and AmEx is roughly $1.3 billion for each company."", 'In his latest annual letter to shareholders, Buffett referred to Coca-Cola and American Express as ""indefinite"" holdings. They\'re companies with especially strong branding and marketing that benefit from long-winded periods of economic growth.', ""Collectively, Warren Buffett has put around $63 billion to work in these five core holdings. While that might sound like a lot of money, it's actually dwarfed by the amount of cash he's spent buying shares of his favorite stock over the last six years."", ""What makes this purchasing activity somewhat of a mystery is that it doesn't show up in Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly 13Fs. In order to track the buying activity in Buffett's favorite stock, you'll need to dig into the company's quarterly operating results."", ""Toward the end of each quarterly report, just prior to the executive certifications, you'll find the complete details on share repurchases undertaken during the previous three months. That's right... the company Warren Buffett has spent more money buying shares of than Apple, Chevron, Coca-Cola, American Express, and Occidental, combined, is Berkshire Hathaway!"", ""Before the midpoint of July 2018, Warren Buffett and the late, great Charlie Munger had their hands tied when it came to share buybacks. Repurchases were only allowed if Berkshire's stock fell to or below 120% of book value (i.e., no more than 20% above stated book value in the latest quarter). At no point did Berkshire's stock hit this threshold during the 2010s."", ""On July 17, 2018, Berkshire Hathaway's board adopted new measures that allowed Buffett and Munger to get off the proverbial bench and work their magic. Berkshire's board green-lit share buybacks with no ceiling or end date as long as:"", 'Berkshire Hathaway has at least $30 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries on its balance sheet; and', 'Warren Buffett believes shares are intrinsically cheap.', ""Since this change was made in July 2018, Warren Buffett has bought back shares of his own company's stock for 23 consecutive quarters. Including the $2.6 billion that was spent on buybacks in the first quarter, the Oracle of Omaha has repurchased over $77 billion of Berkshire's stock in under six years -- $14 billion more than was collectively spent on Apple, Chevron, Coca-Cola, AmEx, and Occidental Petroleum."", ""Because Buffett's company doesn't pay a dividend, a steady share repurchase program is an easy way for the Oracle of Omaha to reward his long-term shareholders. Consistently buying back stock and reducing the number of shares outstanding is incrementally increasing the ownership stakes of long-term investors."", ""Furthermore, companies with steady or growing net income usually see their earnings per share (EPS) rise as their outstanding share count declines.

The company is gaining from the ongoing momentum across its cloud business, driven by the strong uptake of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Autonomous Database offerings. The solid adoption of cloud-based applications, comprising NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Fusion ERP bodes well.Oracle’s Gen 2 Cloud is delivering better performance at a lower cost due to high bandwidth and low-latency RDMA networks. ORCL’s continued investment in cloud infrastructure positions it well for sustained growth in the dynamic software industry. The company’s partnership with Microsoft and Nvidia is noteworthy. We expect fiscal 2024 net sales to grow 6.3% from 2023.However, higher spending on product enhancements, especially toward the cloud platform amid increasing competition in the cloud domain, is likely to limit margin expansion.(You can read the full research report on Oracle here >>>)Shares of Bank of America have gained +16.3% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry’s gain of +17.8%. The company’s first-quarter 2024 results were aided by strength in the investment banking (IB) business. While higher funding costs are a concern, the company’s net interest income (NII) will likely be positively impacted in the current high-rate environment.The opening of financial centers and improved digital capabilities will support the top line. While the capital markets activity improved of late, the challenging macroeconomic environment might once again weigh on the IB business.

Also, its focus on Accelerating the Arches strategy is encouraging.(You can read the full research report on McDonald’s here >>>)Shares of Miller Industries have outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Original Equipment industry over the past year (+76.7% vs. -10.4%). The company showcases strong growth, with Q1 2024 revenues hitting $349.9 million, up 24% year over year, driven by increased demand and chassis shipments. Gross profit rose 45.5% to $44.2 million, with margins expanding to 12.6% due to enhanced manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies.The firm boosts shareholder value with a 5.6% dividend increase and a $25 million share repurchase plan, reflecting confidence in its financial stability and long-term strategy. Positioned as a leader in the growing global towing equipment market, Miller benefits from its broad product range and strong brand while continuing to innovate, like their patented LCG design in car carriers.However, challenges include intense competition, volatile raw material costs, regulatory uncertainties, and reliance on specific market sectors, posing risks to profitability.(You can read the full research report on Miller Industries here >>>)Via Renewables’ shares have gained +24.8% over the past six months against the Zacks Alternative Energy - Other industry’s gain of +36.3%.

VIA boosted its net cash from operations in the first quarter, signaling improved efficiency and capital management.However, challenges persist with a decrease in adjusted EBITDA and retail gross margins, primarily in the electricity and natural gas segments.

And that’s where technology solution companies, like Oracle, have come in — providing not only explanations but the tools to overcome those barriers.', 'To dig deeper into the leading challenges facing brands today and explore how one brand used Oracle’s technology to achieve decreased infrastructure costs and smoother integrations to loyalty and promotions programs, Megan Douglas, chief digital and information officer at Maurices, Nick Reinbold, senior vice president of Logic, and Rose Spicer, head of global retail marketing at Oracle, sat down with WWD’s executive editor of strategic content development, Arthur Zaczkiewicz, in a live webinar hosted by WWD.', 'More from WWD', 'CNN Champions for Change 2024: 4Kinship Indigenous Fashion Brand Founder Amy Denet Deal', 'Small Business Owners Poised to Impact Upcoming Elections, New Survey Finds', 'As ICFF Kicks Off, a New Little Italy Emerges', 'Spicer said that in Oracle’s research conducted while building its solutions, the company found five key trends that identify what is plaguing the industry: changing consumer expectations, economic uncertainty, supply chain disruption, executing sustainability goals and finding talent.', 'In the fashion industry, in particular, brands and retailers have heavily discussed generative AI’s use in areas like marketing and customer engagement, while deciphering potential ROI. “It’s figuring out how to bring the right talent in and how to get them spending time on the most strategic things possible with the opportunity to automate but also to enable and empower associates to deliver a better experience for them,” Spicer said.', 'In her role, Spicer said she has seen retailers be innovative across channels, especially when faced with supply chain disruptions and rethinking stores to fulfill demand in different ways. And the pandemic forced much of this innovation as retailers figured out how to serve their customers.', '“The customer experience is critical. Seventy-five percent of American shoppers say that the customer experience is a deciding factor when choosing between competing brands,” Spicer said. “Making sure that you have empowered associates, that you have the right products in store, that you deliver a positive experience, that you have a beautiful, merchandised store so people can find the sizes and styles that they’re looking for [is important].”', 'Also worth noting, she said, is that “Amazon has changed the way we all think about shopping. We expect [our orders] in the next couple of days. My mom is almost 80 and she expects to get anything she orders in a day.” Moreover, Spicer said it pays for customers to feel loved and appreciated, with store associates playing a major role. Around 80 percent of customers are even willing to share personal data in exchange for better customer experiences and 41 percent of companies who say they are “customer-obsessed” report a 10 percent greater revenue growth over the previous fiscal year.', 'An example of how Oracle’s technology solutions have worked to combat these common challenges facing brands today can be seen in its partnership with Maurices and Logic. The female specialty retailer currently has just under 900 locations across the U.S. and Canada with headquarters in Duluth, Minn., and a design studio in Brooklyn. The brand offers inclusive sizing from size zero to 24 and is primarily based in small and mid-markets.', 'What makes Maurices stand out from other brands, said Douglas is the brand’s style, community and service. “About half of our stores are in communities with 50,000 people or less and [we] really home in on our hometown mentality.” Prompting the company’s need for change when the brand partnered with Logic and Oracle was a separation from Maurices’ parent company.', '“We’re a retailer so everything we do is under a lens of profitability and revenue and how is this going to affect the bottom line,” Douglas said. “Becoming a stand-alone, private entity, we were looking at what we needed to invest in and what we could do to set ourselves up as our own company for the first time. It was an opportunity to remove technical debt, streamline a lot of our technical operations but then also kind of leapfrog to a modern platform. In addition to that, anything we do we want to have the customer at the center of it and so what can we do about loyalty and omni channel so really be bringing our digital customer into the store.”', 'To do this, Maurices began to rebuild retail operations from scratch. The company implemented Oracle Retail Xstore, Sales Audit, Campaign Management and Customer Engagement combined with a full hardware refresh in 28 months. The project touches its nearly 900 stores and 10,000 store associates, which underwent training and change management. Hardware in stores was also replaced with new POS registers and new pin pads, new scanners, among other technology.', 'Answering why the company moved its POS to the cloud, Douglas said Maurices experienced some quick wins in addition to ongoing successes. “So there were some immediate and obvious improvements in just moving to the latest and greatest technology, such as email receipts are faster, it’s much easier to suspend and resume transactions, and an overall faster checkout process that has promotions integrated and automatically applied for the customer.”', 'Moreover, Douglas said, that investing in POS is an expensive endeavor. “Anytime you’re going to tackle a complex project like this, where you’re touching so many users and locations, it’s a tough decision. And really for us, I think a key point in moving to a cloud-based POS is that it really helps a retailer like us having someone as a partner manage the infrastructure and integration and it’s built into that platform. That’s one less complexity on my team side that we’re having to manage and really enables future flexibility in third-party integrations.”', 'When launching Maurices’ new system, Reinbold said, Maurices and Logic prioritized what to get done in the initial release, strategizing what to launch with monthly releases. Reinbold pointed to several lessons learned during the pandemic with the industry now permanently shifted and an understanding that there is a need to support agility and flexibility through rapid deployments of functionality several times a year.', '“We’re steering around the holidays and making sure that we’re not disturbing the holiday freeze,” Reinbold said. “So, I think that the first thing is you need to be able to update your system regularly. And stakeholder buy-in is key — everyone needs to work as a single unit.”', 'During the rollout, Reinbold said there were some initial speedbumps, including the need for modifications on organization operations to work within the cloud and embrace leading practices. He called out Oracle’s support and Logic rolled out its project with Maurices, noting the company’s expertise in working with nuances and challenges of migrating mass amounts of data. It’s a collaborative process, one that has built a system specifically for Maurices needs.', '“Getting creative across all of the different touchpoints is what ultimately contributed to the value that we got out of it and then ultimately the support that we got from the executive team and private equity owners who were making a really large investment in making sure Maurices was stood up for success,” Douglas said.', 'Today, the company is in a run-state mode, where every two months new updates and releases are added to make sure that the stores stay on pace with the customer and business initiatives that allow for flexibility. Beyond quick wins of seeing smoother operations in store with immediate support of store associates, Maurices has seen a speed to market with infrastructure to help scale, improved omnichannel customer experience and smooth integrations with loyalty, promotions and credit cards.', 'Best of WWD', 'Retailers Leverage First Insight for ESG Alignment', ""What Steph Curry's Sneaker NFTs Can Teach Fashion"", 'Year in Review: Brands, Retailers Go Hyper-digital in a Challenging Landscape']"

The company is gaining from the ongoing momentum across its cloud business, driven by the strong uptake of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Autonomous Database offerings. The solid adoption of cloud-based applications, comprising NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Fusion ERP bodes well.Oracle’s Gen 2 Cloud is delivering better performance at a lower cost due to high bandwidth and low-latency RDMA networks. ORCL’s continued investment in cloud infrastructure positions it well for sustained growth in the dynamic software industry. The company’s partnership with Microsoft and Nvidia is noteworthy. We expect fiscal 2024 net sales to grow 6.3% from 2023.However, higher spending on product enhancements, especially toward the cloud platform amid increasing competition in the cloud domain, is likely to limit margin expansion.(You can read the full research report on Oracle here >>>)Shares of Bank of America have gained +16.3% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry’s gain of +17.8%. The company’s first-quarter 2024 results were aided by strength in the investment banking (IB) business. While higher funding costs are a concern, the company’s net interest income (NII) will likely be positively impacted in the current high-rate environment.The opening of financial centers and improved digital capabilities will support the top line. While the capital markets activity improved of late, the challenging macroeconomic environment might once again weigh on the IB business.

Gross profit rose 45.5% to $44.2 million, with margins expanding to 12.6% due to enhanced manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies.The firm boosts shareholder value with a 5.6% dividend increase and a $25 million share repurchase plan, reflecting confidence in its financial stability and long-term strategy. Positioned as a leader in the growing global towing equipment market, Miller benefits from its broad product range and strong brand while continuing to innovate, like their patented LCG design in car carriers.However, challenges include intense competition, volatile raw material costs, regulatory uncertainties, and reliance on specific market sectors, posing risks to profitability.(You can read the full research report on Miller Industries here >>>)Via Renewables’ shares have gained +24.8% over the past six months against the Zacks Alternative Energy - Other industry’s gain of +36.3%. The company demonstrates robust customer growth, adding 41,000 RCEs in first-quarter 2024, reaching 338,000. This, coupled with a recent acquisition of 12,500 RCEs, indicates effective growth strategies.Financially, VIA rebounded with a first-quarter net income of $19.1 million, reversing a previous loss in the prior-year quarter on favorable hedge gains. VIA boosted its net cash from operations in the first quarter, signaling improved efficiency and capital management.However, challenges persist with a decrease in adjusted EBITDA and retail gross margins, primarily in the electricity and natural gas segments.

In the \'long\' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock\'s price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.', 'While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.', 'Below, we take a look at Seagate (STX), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.', ""It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance.

On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 5.91% and 30.04%, respectively.', ""Investors should also pay attention to STX's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. STX is currently averaging 2,677,136 shares for the last 20 days."", 'Earnings Outlook', 'The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well.

After experiencing a surge in demand due to the pandemic, which was subsequently followed by a sharp downturn caused by prolonged COVID lockdowns in China, a war in Eastern Europe, and broader macroeconomic slowdowns that dampened cloud computing demand, collectively, the HDD and SSD sectors are now poised for a cyclical recovery.', 'That is the conclusion reached by Citigroup’s Asiya Merchant, who has been assessing the digital storage sector’s prospects. “Following several quarters of storage digestion, capex cuts and workforce reductions, we expect the storage media industry dynamics to improve from here with the return of pent-up storage demand led by hyperscalers,” the 5-star analyst said. “Total revenues for the storage media industry are poised to grow by ~25% CAGR over the next 3 years, largely driven by total PB growth of ~30% CAGR. Enterprise data is expected to continue to grow at 40%+ CAGR as AI becomes an incremental driver for data creation, storage, and data management.”', 'Against this backdrop, let’s follow Merchant’s argument in detail and examine two storage stocks in particular that she’s recommending to play this shift in demand. A look at the Street’s broader perspective on them, through the TipRanks platform, will also provide us with additional color. Here are the details.', 'Western Digital (WDC)', 'The first company we’ll look at here is Western Digital. The San Jose, California-based firm boasts a market cap of nearly $25 billion, and specializes in memory storage. Its product lines include PC hard drives, SSDs, memory cards, USB flash drives, and data center memory systems. In addition, the company owns the popular SanDisk brand, which is well known for its portable memory products.', 'Western Digital’s products are found in a wide range of applications, including SSD hard drive replacements, embedded flash memory, high-capacity HDDs and platforms for data centers, storage for smart video surveillance systems, and memory for high-end gaming upgrades. The company offers memory solutions for every need, from small thumb drives to multi-terabyte backup memories and storage.', 'Of particular interest to today’s investor, Western Digital’s memory products have found application in cloud computing and AI systems. These technologies lean heavily on high-speed computing – but also on increasingly large storage capacity.', 'On the business side, Western Digital recently reported its financial results from the fiscal third quarter of 2024. The company brought in a total of $3.46 billion at the top line, a figure that was up more than 23% year-over-year and beat the forecast by $110 million. The company realized a bottom line of 63 cents per share by non-GAAP measures, an impressive 48 cents per share better than had been anticipated. The company’s results were driven by a 45% year-over-year increase in the Cloud Revenue segment. We can note here that WDC stock has gained 44.5% year-to-date, outstripping the NASDAQ’s 13% returns by a substantial margin.', 'In another recent announcement that investors should watch closely, Western Digital in March gave an update on its plans to split into two independent public companies. The split will form a separation between the HDD and Flash businesses and is on track to take place during the second half of 2024. Management expects that the split will put each segment in a better position to focus on its own attributes and assets – and to thereby unlock advantages for investors.', 'For Citigroup’s Merchant, who is ranked among the Street’s top 5% of analysts by TipRanks, the return of growth in the storage market is reason for optimism here: “We initiate Western Digital shares with a Buy rating given our view of a cyclical recovery in the storage market which coupled with our view of AI driven storage demand growth and rational capacity additions should enable the company to sustain higher revenue and earnings growth ahead.”', 'The analyst goes on to look at the synergies of the upcoming split, saying, “We believe the business remains extremely attractive given the potential to spinoff the company and unlock value. At current prices and assuming the HDD business trades at a 15% discount to Seagate’s HDD business to reflect higher debt levels and no dividend, implies the flash business trades at a significant (~75%) discount to their peer group. We believe the spin-off should create substantial value for investors.”', 'In addition to starting out her coverage with a Buy, the top-ranked analyst also sets a $90 price target to point toward a one-year upside potential of 19%. (To watch Merchant’s track record, click here)', 'Western Digital has picked up 17 recent analyst reviews, including 13 Buys and 4 Holds, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are selling for $75.69, and the average price target, at $88.81, implies a potential gain of 17% for the coming year. (See WDC stock forecast)', 'Seagate Technology (STX)', 'The second Citi pick is Seagate Technology, another storage company with a focus on hard disk drives. Seagate got its start in the 1980s when it developed the 5.25-inch HDD – back when hard disks were truly disks. Today, Seagate is known for lines of external and internal hard drives and solid-state disks (SSDs), along with data storage systems for professional and personal use, network storage, and solutions for cloud, edge, and data center storage. Seagate’s products are found in a wide range of applications, from backup and recovery to telecom and video analytics.', 'Seagate today can boast of a $20.7 billion market cap and expertise in developing hardware that supports secure and scalable cloud computing systems and data backup infrastructure. The company offers its customers the promise of storing greater memory and more data for less cost.', 'Return-minded investors will find Seagate’s dividend payment of interest. The company in April declared a payment of 70 cents per common share, for a July 5 payment date. The annualized payment of $2.80 gives a forward yield of 2.8%, high enough to take a bite of the current rate of inflation.', 'When we look at the financial results, we find that Seagate’s fiscal 3Q24 (March quarter) featured a top line of $1.66 billion and a bottom line of 33 cents per adj. share. The revenue was down more than 10% year-over-year, although it met expectations. The non-GAAP EPS was 7 cents better than the forecast – and was a sharp turnaround from the company’s 28-cent EPS loss in the prior-year period. In the quarter, Seagate generated cash from operations of $188 million and returned $147 million worth of capital to investors.', 'Looking ahead, Seagate guided toward fiscal Q4 revenue in the range between $1.7 billion and $2 billion – compared to a consensus estimate of $1.82 billion.', 'Checking in again with Citigroup’s Merchant, we find her upbeat, particularly citing cyclical factors and demand growth as well as Seagate’s potential for returns, saying of the stock, “Our Buy rating is underpinned by our view of a cyclical recovery in the HDD market from enterprise/hyperscalers which coupled with our view of AI driven storage demand growth, rational capacity additions and HAMR led cost improvements should enable Seagate to sustain higher revenue and earnings growth ahead and resume a higher pace of shareholder returns.”', 'Merchant outlines a sound path forward the stock, that could prove attractive to investors: “Looking ahead, we are modeling for revenue growth improvement in line with overall industry growth rate forecast of ~25% y/y CAGR (FY24-FY27E) on continued demand improvement driven primarily by cloud, while gross margins are also expected to continue to expand toward 33%, with potential for upside as HAMR contribution increases. Given Seagate’s opex discipline we model EPS of $6.10 in FY25E and $8.19 in FY26E.”', 'Following her Buy rating, Merchant sets a price target of $110, suggesting that the stock will appreciate by 11.5% this year.', 'Turning now to the rest of the Street, where based on an additional 9 Buys and 7 Holds, the stock claims a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The shares have an average price target of $99.69, indicating the stock will stay rangebound for the time being.

That\'s because the ""Oracle of Omaha,"" as he\'s come to be known, has handily outpaced the benchmark S&P 500 in the return column over nearly six decades.', ""Whereas the S&P 500 has produced an impressive total return, including dividends, of around 34,200% since the mid-1960s, Buffett has overseen an aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) that's approaching 5,000,000%! With an outperformance this great, it's no wonder tens of thousands of investors flock to Omaha, Neb., each year to hear Buffett speak about stocks and the U.S. economy."", ""It also explains why investors wait on pins and needles for Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly Form 13F filing. A 13F provides a snapshot of what Wall Street's brightest and most-successful money managers bought and sold in the most recent quarter."", ""Though Berkshire's 13Fs have historically been a gold mine for investors, they don't tell the full story about Warren Buffett's favorite stock to buy."", ""With the preface that I'm writing this up before Berkshire Hathaway files its 13F on Wednesday, May 15, the combination of Berkshire's previous operating reports, 13Fs, and annual letters to shareholders show that Warren Buffett and his investment team have spent a small fortune building up many of their core positions."", ""Based on admissions by Buffett during his company's latest annual shareholder meeting, he and his top investment aides (Todd Combs and Ted Weschler) sold about 13% of their company's leading position in tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) for tax purposes in the March-ended quarter. This reduced the market value of Berkshire's stake in Apple to an estimated $144.5 billion, as of the closing bell on May 10."", 'However, Buffett and his team are sitting on a massive unrealized gain. According to 13F aggregation website WhaleWisdom.com, Berkshire Hathaway is estimated to have a cost basis of less than $40 in Apple. This suggests Buffett & Co. spent around $31.3 billion to purchase the shares of Apple they currently own.', ""The Oracle of Omaha and his crew have also spent big bucks building up Berkshire's holdings in two integrated energy companies, Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). Somewhere in the ballpark of $16 billion and $13 billion have, respectively, been put to work in shares of Chevron and Occidental -- and this doesn't count the $8.5 billion in Occidental Petroleum preferred stock that Berkshire also owns."", ""Spending an aggregate of $29 billion on energy stocks is a pretty clear indication that Berkshire's smartest investment minds expect the spot price of crude oil to remain elevated. Following years of capital underinvestment during the pandemic by energy majors (including Chevron and Occidental), the global supply of crude oil is constrained. With no easy fix in sight, higher spot prices should be beneficial to the high-margin drilling segments of both companies."", ""Warren Buffett put quite a bit of his company's capital to work when beverage company Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and credit-services provider American Express (NYSE: AXP) were added to Berkshire's portfolio in 1988 and 1991, respectively. Based on a previous annual letter to shareholders, Buffett points out that his company's cost basis on Coca-Cola and AmEx is roughly $1.3 billion for each company."", 'In his latest annual letter to shareholders, Buffett referred to Coca-Cola and American Express as ""indefinite"" holdings. They\'re companies with especially strong branding and marketing that benefit from long-winded periods of economic growth.', ""Collectively, Warren Buffett has put around $63 billion to work in these five core holdings. While that might sound like a lot of money, it's actually dwarfed by the amount of cash he's spent buying shares of his favorite stock over the last six years."", ""What makes this purchasing activity somewhat of a mystery is that it doesn't show up in Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly 13Fs. In order to track the buying activity in Buffett's favorite stock, you'll need to dig into the company's quarterly operating results."", ""Toward the end of each quarterly report, just prior to the executive certifications, you'll find the complete details on share repurchases undertaken during the previous three months. That's right... the company Warren Buffett has spent more money buying shares of than Apple, Chevron, Coca-Cola, American Express, and Occidental, combined, is Berkshire Hathaway!"", ""Before the midpoint of July 2018, Warren Buffett and the late, great Charlie Munger had their hands tied when it came to share buybacks. Repurchases were only allowed if Berkshire's stock fell to or below 120% of book value (i.e., no more than 20% above stated book value in the latest quarter). At no point did Berkshire's stock hit this threshold during the 2010s."", ""On July 17, 2018, Berkshire Hathaway's board adopted new measures that allowed Buffett and Munger to get off the proverbial bench and work their magic. Berkshire's board green-lit share buybacks with no ceiling or end date as long as:"", 'Berkshire Hathaway has at least $30 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries on its balance sheet; and', 'Warren Buffett believes shares are intrinsically cheap.', ""Since this change was made in July 2018, Warren Buffett has bought back shares of his own company's stock for 23 consecutive quarters. Including the $2.6 billion that was spent on buybacks in the first quarter, the Oracle of Omaha has repurchased over $77 billion of Berkshire's stock in under six years -- $14 billion more than was collectively spent on Apple, Chevron, Coca-Cola, AmEx, and Occidental Petroleum."", ""Because Buffett's company doesn't pay a dividend, a steady share repurchase program is an easy way for the Oracle of Omaha to reward his long-term shareholders. Consistently buying back stock and reducing the number of shares outstanding is incrementally increasing the ownership stakes of long-term investors."", ""Furthermore, companies with steady or growing net income usually see their earnings per share (EPS) rise as their outstanding share count declines.

In the \'long\' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock\'s price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.', 'Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.', 'Below, we take a look at NetApp (NTAP), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.', ""It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. NetApp currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period."", 'You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>', 'Set to Beat the Market?', ""Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for NTAP that show why this data storage company shows promise as a solid momentum pick."", ""Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area."", ""For NTAP, shares are up 3.69% over the past week while the Zacks Computer- Storage Devices industry is up 1.69% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 9.62% compares favorably with the industry's 3.4% performance as well."", 'Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of NetApp have increased 30.76% over the past quarter, and have gained 69.12% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 5.91% and 30.04%, respectively.', ""Investors should also pay attention to NTAP's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. NTAP is currently averaging 1,806,103 shares for the last 20 days."", 'Earnings Outlook', 'The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with NTAP.', ""Over the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost NTAP's consensus estimate, increasing from $6.43 to $6.47 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period."", 'Bottom Line', ""Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that NTAP is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep NetApp on your short list."", 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate."", 'The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.', 'Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for ResMed basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.', 'Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices', ""The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it.

Many stocks simply look either fully valued or overvalued. But a close look reveals that there are still some stocks worth buying -- even after their recent run-up."", ""One stock that still looks attractive despite already rising 15% this year is Tractor Supply (NASDAQ: TSCO). Sure, the dividend-paying stock may not provide investors with eye-popping returns from here. But the returns the rural lifestyle retailer's stock could potentially deliver going forward will likely be good relative to the underlying risk taken to achieve them. In other words, Tractor Supply's overall risk-to-reward profile continues to look very attractive."", 'Here are three reasons investors might want to consider adding Tractor Supply to their portfolios.', 'One of the top things to love about Tractor Supply stock is the resilient nature of its underlying business.', '""Tractor Supply has a proven business model that has been resilient over many business cycles,"" explained Tractor Supply CEO Hal Lawton in the company\'s first-quarter earnings release. This is largely due to its business\'s heavy reliance on what it calls its CUE (consumable, usable, and edible) products. This needs-based merchandise includes items like livestock feed and bedding, weed control, and fertilizer -- products consumers have to restock regularly.', ""With well over half of its sales coming from C.U.E. categories, Tractor Supply's business is likely to be more resilient than many other retailers during a recession."", ""Unsurprisingly, Tractor Supply's resilient business model has enabled it to consistently pay dividends to investors for years. Indeed, the company initiated a quarterly dividend back in 2010, and it's been paying one ever since. Further, management has raised this dividend every year for 14 consecutive years."", ""Also worth noting is how strong the company's dividend growth has been. Tractor Supply's quarterly dividend today of $1.10 is more than double what it was paying shareholders just three years ago."", 'Looking ahead, strong dividend growth should persist. This should be supported by both further growth in the business and a low payout ratio. Today, Tractor Supply pays out only about 41% of its earnings in dividends, leaving plenty of room for continued increases in the years ahead.', ""Fortunately for investors, Tractor Supply's store footprint has a lot of runway for growth. Today, the company has 2,233 stores in 49 states. But management recently said it believes there's an opportunity for around 3,000 stores domestically. This would represent a footprint growth of about 34%."", ""And the retailer isn't sitting on its laurels. It plans to open 80 new stores in 2024 and then 90 new stores in 2025. At this rate, Tractor Supply could hit its target of 3,000 stores as early as 2032."", 'With shares trading at just 27 times trailing-12-month earnings, investors can buy into this resilient growth story at a reasonable price. Investors will even get access to a growing dividend, which is currently yielding 1.6%.', 'Before you buy stock in Tractor Supply, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Tractor Supply wasn’t one of them.

That\'s because the ""Oracle of Omaha,"" as he\'s come to be known, has handily outpaced the benchmark S&P 500 in the return column over nearly six decades.', ""Whereas the S&P 500 has produced an impressive total return, including dividends, of around 34,200% since the mid-1960s, Buffett has overseen an aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) that's approaching 5,000,000%! With an outperformance this great, it's no wonder tens of thousands of investors flock to Omaha, Neb., each year to hear Buffett speak about stocks and the U.S. economy."", ""It also explains why investors wait on pins and needles for Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly Form 13F filing. A 13F provides a snapshot of what Wall Street's brightest and most-successful money managers bought and sold in the most recent quarter."", ""Though Berkshire's 13Fs have historically been a gold mine for investors, they don't tell the full story about Warren Buffett's favorite stock to buy."", ""With the preface that I'm writing this up before Berkshire Hathaway files its 13F on Wednesday, May 15, the combination of Berkshire's previous operating reports, 13Fs, and annual letters to shareholders show that Warren Buffett and his investment team have spent a small fortune building up many of their core positions."", ""Based on admissions by Buffett during his company's latest annual shareholder meeting, he and his top investment aides (Todd Combs and Ted Weschler) sold about 13% of their company's leading position in tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) for tax purposes in the March-ended quarter. This reduced the market value of Berkshire's stake in Apple to an estimated $144.5 billion, as of the closing bell on May 10."", 'However, Buffett and his team are sitting on a massive unrealized gain. According to 13F aggregation website WhaleWisdom.com, Berkshire Hathaway is estimated to have a cost basis of less than $40 in Apple. This suggests Buffett & Co. spent around $31.3 billion to purchase the shares of Apple they currently own.', ""The Oracle of Omaha and his crew have also spent big bucks building up Berkshire's holdings in two integrated energy companies, Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). Somewhere in the ballpark of $16 billion and $13 billion have, respectively, been put to work in shares of Chevron and Occidental -- and this doesn't count the $8.5 billion in Occidental Petroleum preferred stock that Berkshire also owns."", ""Spending an aggregate of $29 billion on energy stocks is a pretty clear indication that Berkshire's smartest investment minds expect the spot price of crude oil to remain elevated. Following years of capital underinvestment during the pandemic by energy majors (including Chevron and Occidental), the global supply of crude oil is constrained. With no easy fix in sight, higher spot prices should be beneficial to the high-margin drilling segments of both companies."", ""Warren Buffett put quite a bit of his company's capital to work when beverage company Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and credit-services provider American Express (NYSE: AXP) were added to Berkshire's portfolio in 1988 and 1991, respectively. Based on a previous annual letter to shareholders, Buffett points out that his company's cost basis on Coca-Cola and AmEx is roughly $1.3 billion for each company."", 'In his latest annual letter to shareholders, Buffett referred to Coca-Cola and American Express as ""indefinite"" holdings.

Berkshire owns 248 million shares of OXY, indicating a 28% stake in the company, which is quite sizeable. I believe this Warren Buffett stock is a good buy in May 2024. I am bullish on OXY stock due to its acquisition of CrownRock, expanding chemicals business, and massive potential for low-carbon products.', 'Berkshire has increased its stake in Occidental Petroleum since 2020, and it is now worth roughly $16 billion. The company accounts for 4.4% of Berkshire’s equity portfolio and is one of its largest portfolio companies in 2024.', 'Warren Buffett is arguably the greatest stock market investor the world has ever seen. Also called the Oracle of Omaha, Buffett has a proven history of identifying quality undervalued stocks, allowing him to comfortably beat the broader markets over time. Due to his excellent track record, Wall Street closely follows Buffett’s investments.', 'Occidental Petroleum is engaged in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. It has three primary business segments that include the following:', 'Oil and Gas: It explores, develops, and produces oil and condensate, natural gas liquids, and natural gas.', 'Chemical: The segment manufactures and markets basic chemicals and vinyls.', 'Midstream and Marketing: It gathers, processes, transports, and stores oil, condensate, natural gas liquids, natural gas, and power.', 'In Q1, Occidental Petroleum generated adjusted earnings of $0.63 per share, higher than estimates of $0.58 per share. It reported revenue of $6.2 billion, a decline of 12.7% year-over-year. Occidental Petroleum ended Q1 with $1.3 billion of unrestricted cash and delivered a free cash flow of $700 million.', 'It expects total production to increase between 1.23 million to 1.27 million BoE (barrels of oil equivalent) per day in Q2, above the 1.17 million BoE per day in the March quarter. The midpoint of its production guidance for Q2 will be its highest quarterly production since 2021.', 'Investors should note that oil and gas stocks are cyclical, and their earnings are tied to energy prices, which can be very volatile. It suggests that earnings for energy stocks will move significantly higher when oil prices are elevated. Several energy companies, including Occidental Petroleum, reported record earnings in 2022 due to higher prices.', 'Alternatively, Occidental Petroleum (and its peers) should be positioned to generate enough cash flow to sustain its operations, reinvest in capital projects, and maintain its dividend yield, even when commodity prices move lower.', 'While Occidental Petroleum saw an erosion in its bottom line, it surpassed earnings estimates in Q1 and reported positive free cash flow amid an uncertain macro environment.', 'In December 2023, Occidental Petroleum disclosed plans to acquire CrownRock for $12 billion via a combination of cash and stock. This purchase should further bolster Occidental’s presence in the Permian Basin.', 'Occidental Petroleum expects the acquisition to add $1 billion to its free cash flow, assuming oil prices average $70 per barrel. Today, crude oil prices are hovering around $80, indicating that free cash flow should be over $1.1 billion, significantly moving the needle for Occidental Petroleum.', 'The expansion in free cash flow would help OXY repay its debt and enhance shareholder returns in 2024 and beyond. Investors should note that Occidental Petroleum is issuing over $9 billion in debt to fund the acquisition while taking over CrownRock’s existing debt of $1.2 billion.', 'As noted above, Occidental Petroleum has a chemical business, which allows it to offset a portion of earnings volatility associated with daily swings in oil prices. The OxyChem business has started to generate stable cash flows for the company, as Occidental Petroleum continues to expand the capacity for this segment.', 'In its investor presentation, Occidental Petroleum stated that it is modernizing and expanding its facility in Texas and allocated capital to enhance multiple plants on the Gulf Coast. These enhancements should be completed in the next 24 months and should increase earnings between $300 million and $400 million each year.', 'Additionally, Occidental Petroleum is building a low-carbon energy solutions platform. It has allocated $600 million in 2024 to build a direct air capture (DAC) plant in Texas, which is on track to begin operations in mid-2025. The DAC plant will capture 500,000 tons of carbon emissions each year, which can be commercialized.', 'Occidental Petroleum plowed in more than $1 billion to acquire Carbon Engineering in 2023, the company behind the DAC technology. The carbon capture business may help bring in significant revenue and earnings in the coming decades. In fact, Occidental expects earnings from the carbon capture business to be similar to its oil and gas business over time.', 'Occidental Petroleum ended Q1 with long-term debt of $19 billion. This number might rise to $29 billion once the CrownRock acquisition is closed. However, the company announced a divesture program, aiming to sell assets worth between $4.5 billion and $6 billion. The proceeds of the divesture will be used to deleverage its balance sheet, as Occidental Petroleum aims to maintain principal debt levels of $15 billion.', 'In Q1 of 2024, Occidental Petroleum’s interest expense totaled $284 million, which suggests its debt is easily serviceable given the company’s free cash flow of $700 million. Moreover, OXY’s long-term debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 1.4x, which is not too high.', 'Out of the 18 analyst ratings given to OXY stock, two are Buys, 12 are Holds, and none are Sells, indicating a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average OXY stock price target is $71.69, indicating upside potential of 14.1% from current levels.', 'Occidental Petroleum’s earnings and cash flow took a hit in Q1 due to lower oil and gas prices. Alternatively, there are multiple catalysts for Occidental Petroleum that should help it deliver outsized gains to shareholders. I believe the potential upside from non-oil businesses makes OXY stock a top investment choice for those looking to gain exposure to the energy sector.', 'Disclosure']"

(NYSE:DHI), America’s Builder, today announced the sudden passing of Donald R. Horton, the Company’s Founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors (""the Board""). David V. Auld, the Company’s Executive Vice Chairman, has been appointed by the Board to serve as Executive Chairman, effective immediately.', '""It is with great sadness that I announce the passing of my friend and our Company’s iconic founder and Chairman, Don (""DR"") Horton. Throughout the Company’s 46-year existence, he worked tirelessly to build a national homebuilding operation with a strong company culture, and the impact of his personal involvement with our team of operators across the United States has contributed immeasurable value to our company and people,"" Auld said.', 'Auld continued, ""I am deeply grateful to DR for his friendship, leadership and commitment to making D.R. Horton the leading homebuilder in America. DR was truly a pioneer in the homebuilding industry. From the first house he built in 1978 in Fort Worth, Texas as a local homebuilder, he led the business to unprecedented growth regionally and then nationally. Under DR’s leadership, we have had the privilege of helping more than one million American individuals and families achieve homeownership. We are all indebted to DR for his vision, tenacity and never-ending drive to continue to grow and improve our Company. While he is impossible to replace, we will strive to carry on his legacy of enabling the dream of homeownership for individuals and families across the United States in every stage of their lives. Our sincere condolences and prayers go out to DR’s wife, Marty; his sons, Ryan and Reagan; daughters-in law, Stacy and Michelle; their four grandchildren; and the rest of DR’s family.""', 'Throughout the Company’s history, Don steadfastly maintained a strategy of decentralized operational decision making, which was considered unorthodox by many industry observers. The company’s local leadership teams have been and continue to be empowered to make local business decisions, such as product offerings, price points and home features. Today, we consider this important company tenet a critical ingredient to our past and future success.', 'Over the years, Don traveled extensively visiting the Company’s field operations. During these visits, he made it a point to meet everyone in the sales offices, job sites and division offices, and he continually emphasized that the people in our operational teams are the key to our business success. Don was approachable and relatable to everyone he met and maintained an unassuming personal lifestyle, as he never forgot his humble beginnings and the hard work it took to succeed.', 'Don always referred to the Company, including our employees, homebuyers, vendors and subcontractors, as the D.R. Horton family. While the Company has grown significantly, the sentiment remains true, and Don championed several initiatives for the benefit of D.R. Horton employees and their families. He founded a Horton summer camp for employees’ children to enjoy activities in the great outdoors and truly enjoyed leading and actively participating in the summer camp for many years. The D.R. Horton, Inc. Foundation was created to provide financial and other assistance to employees and their families who are victims of natural disasters, helping take care of housing, meals and other personal needs following a disaster. Also, numerous Company employees have experienced individual acts of caring and kindness from Don over the years without him seeking any attention or credit. This culture of family and care for each other will be a longstanding legacy of Don’s commitment to the Company and its employees.', 'Don, age 74, has served as Chairman of D.R. Horton, Inc. since it was formed in July 1991, and held the roles of President and CEO from July 1991 until November 1998. He was involved in the real estate and homebuilding industries since 1972, and was the founder, sole or principal stockholder, director and president of each of D.R. Horton’s predecessor companies, which date from 1978 to 1990.', 'Don is survived by his wife Marty and their children Ryan (Stacy) and Reagan (Michelle) and four grandchildren: Douglas, Madeline, Derek and Shelby. Details on a public memorial event to honor Don’s longstanding legacy will be made available at a later date.', 'About D.R. Horton, Inc.', 'D.R. Horton, Inc., America’s Builder, has been the largest homebuilder by volume in the United States since 2002 and has closed more than 1,000,000 homes in its over 45-year history. D.R. Horton has operations in 119 markets in 33 states across the United States and is engaged in the construction and sale of high-quality homes through its diverse product portfolio with sales prices generally ranging from $200,000 to over $1,000,000. The Company also constructs and sells both single-family and multi-family rental properties. During the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2024, D.R.

388,ea9ec2d4-c29b-3da1-92a3-34a9ca36ecfa,AAL,2024-05-17,DAL vs. AAL: Which Airline Stock Can Fly Higher?,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dal-vs-aal-airline-stock-023620778.html,1715913380,STORY,"['DAL', 'AAL']","['In this piece, I evaluated two airline stocks, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), using TipRanks’ Comparison Tool below to see which is better. A closer look suggests a bullish view for Delta and a bearish view for American Airlines.', 'Both companies are major U.S. airlines, although American also provides freight and mail services in addition to passenger air travel, while Delta operates through its Airline and Refinery segments.', 'Shares of Delta Air Lines have climbed 33% year-to-date and are up 59% over the last 12 months, while American Airlines stock is up 9% year-to-date and 5% over the last 12 months.', 'With such a dramatic difference in the airlines’ share-price performances, a closer look is needed to determine whether there may still be upside left in Delta’s shares — and if AAL is now undervalued after Delta’s recent run. We’ll compare their price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios to gauge their valuations against each other and that of their industry.', 'Notably, the airline industry is trading at a trailing P/E of 13.2x. Over the last three years, the airline industry has been averaging negative earnings, although it continues to trade close to its three-year average price-to-sales ratio of 0.86x.', 'Despite its year-to-date rally, Delta Air Lines is trading at a steep discount to its industry. Delta’s P/E of 6.8x, its outstanding earnings results, and strong momentum suggest this stock is too cheap to ignore, calling for a bullish view.', 'Delta’s valuation has been marching steadily downward since January 2023, when it was trading at a P/E of around 19x. While the stock was richly valued then, the airline has made progress on several fronts, and much of this progress doesn’t appear to be priced in yet despite the year-to-date rally.', 'Delta posted blow-out results for the first quarter, smashing estimates with adjusted earnings of 45 cents per share on $13.75 billion in revenue versus the consensus numbers of 37 cents per share on $12.51 billion in revenue. Unadjusted net profits came in at six cents per share or $37 million, a vast improvement from losses of 57 cents per share or $363 million a year ago.', 'Several analysts boosted their price targets for the airline following this earnings report. Delta continues to benefit from renewed commercial air travel and the higher margins in its thriving Premium Services business. The airline is also starting to work off some of the debt it accumulated during the pandemic, and it continues to benefit from its loyalty program.', 'Looking forward, Delta expects travel demand to remain robust during the current quarter, driving a 5% to 7% year-over-year increase in revenue. For the current quarter, the airline expects earnings of $2.20 to $2.50 per share versus expectations of $2.23 per share. Delta also expects full-year earnings of $6 to $7 a share, also higher than what analysts had been expecting.', 'Additionally, Delta enjoys some benefits that other airlines don’t have. Delta was one of a very small number of airlines to post a profitable first quarter. Additionally, it’s the only airline with non-unionized labor, according to HSBC (NYSE:HSBC), which may be giving it a leg up in the area of expenses as the travel industry continues to recover from the pandemic.', 'Delta Air Lines has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 17 Buys, zero Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $59.74, the average Delta Air Lines stock price target implies upside potential of 13.8%.', 'At a P/E of around 24.2x, American Airlines is trading at a steep premium to its industry. However, its first-quarter earnings release was disastrous, albeit pretty typical of the airline industry currently. In fact, the airline revised its guidance to the lower end of its previously provided range before the first-quarter release. High debt levels complete a bearish view for the airline.', 'Unlike Delta, American Airlines posted a loss for the first quarter, as did most other airlines. Adjusted losses came in at 34 cents per share on $12.57 billion in revenue, worse than the consensus expectations of 27 cents per share in losses on $12.6 billion in revenue. Also, unadjusted net losses amounted to 48 cents a share or $312 million.', 'For the current quarter, American Airlines expects adjusted earnings of $1.15 to $1.45 per share for the second quarter and adjusted earnings of $2.25 to $3.25 per share for the full year.', 'Although AAL has been making progress on its debt, trimming about $950 million of it during the first quarter, it still has much further to go than Delta. At the end of 2023, American Airlines had over $32 billion in net debt, an amount that’s been somewhat stable over the last several years. The question now is whether it has turned a corner because its net debt fell under $31 billion after the latest quarter. It hasn’t been that low since 2019.', 'Unfortunately, though, American Airlines began facing another round of strikes in early May as flight attendants pushed for higher wages. The federal government has not yet given permission for that strike, which is required for airline workers, although the airline’s talks with the union are said to be progressing.', 'Importantly, AAL is already facing wage pressure from the recent deal to give its pilots higher pay, which could mean increased fares and fees for travelers as the airline struggles to turn a profit.', 'American Airlines has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 10 Buys, zero Holds, and two Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $18.70, the average American Airlines stock price target implies upside potential of 26.4%.', 'While the travel industry as a whole took a major hit during the pandemic-era lockdowns, it appears as if Delta Air Lines is significantly further ahead in its recovery than American Airlines, making Delta the clear winner of this pairing.', 'Zooming out to their long-term share price performances reveals that Delta wins there, too. Ironically, Delta stock is up by roughly the same percentage as American Airlines has fallen over the last 10 years (+56% for DAL, -58% for AAL).', 'Disclosure']"

The drivers’ cars have a QR code on the back windows and a message asking consumers if they want a better burger. ', 'Those who scan the code will be entered to redeem a coupon for a free Cheeseburger Melt and a Pepsi drink as part of the PepsiCo marketer’s long-running “Better with Pepsi” promotional platform. The campaign demonstrates how QSRs are returning to past tactics of geoconquesting and competitive sparring.', 'Pizza Hut is launching a cross-category offering by taking aim at burger chains with the help of QR code-enabled delivery drivers. The bold effort looks to conquest competitors’ drive-thrus —\xa0in their headquarters’ hometowns, no less — in a return to the kind of competitive campaigning the QSR category was known for before the pandemic.', '“We thought we\'d kick off our burger journey with something bold,” said Lindsay Morgan, chief marketing officer at Pizza Hut, in a release. “That\'s why we\'re making waves in burger chain drive-thrus.""', 'The effort is also savvy. By asking consumers to use QR codes to access the promo, the company can also gain access to valuable consumer data. A recent campaign from Coca-Cola’s Innocent Drinks captured more than 25,000 consumer profiles from a digital out-of-home campaign that leveraged the scannable codes. That campaign leveraged a platform from Digiphy to assist in the collection of first-party consumer data including name, email, address and birthdate.', 'Pizza Hut is no stranger to outre marketing. For Valentine’s Day, the chain gave consumers in select markets the opportunity to send a free “Goodbye Pie”\xa0to a future ex while drafting breakup texts for consumers in other markets. During last year’s busy holiday delivery season, the company distributed welcome mats with a QR code that offered delivery drivers a chance to get a free pizza after dropping off packages. As part of a tie-in with last year’s “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” movie, the company tested its ability to deliver pizzas in underground subway stations.', 'Pizza Hut’s partnership with PepsiCo and its “Better with Pepsi” promotional platform is also fitting for its challenge to the established burger chains. Though the “Better with Pepsi” positioning has softened in recent years, it was originally launched in 2021 as a challenge to the top three national burger chains, pointing out that none of them had soda contracts with PepsiCo\xa0despite company research indicating consumers preferred its product over rival Coca-Cola.']"

This approach sharpens the investment edge and highlights opportunities that might otherwise be overlooked in the current volatility. Positive endorsements by brokers are regarded as powerful catalysts for stock prices, often leading to increased investor buying interest. Understanding the fundamental rationale behind these bullish outlooks can help make better-informed investment decisions.', 'In this article, we take a closer look at three significant analyst upgrades that have captured the attention of Wall Street. They highlight analysts’ confidence in these companies’ growth prospects and their potential to outperform in the rest of 2024. However, investors should always consider how these analyst upgrades align with their overall investment strategy and risk tolerance. With that information, let’s delve into the specifics of these analyst upgrades and discover why these broker bets are garnering attention in May.', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'First on our list of analyst upgrades is the cloud networking solutions provider Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET). It provides switches and routing systems for data centers and hyperscalers that connect servers to the cloud.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'On May 7, Arista reported solid first quarter fiscal 2024 results, buoyed by increased AI spending. Revenue surged 16% year-over-year (YOY) to $1.57 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.99, representing a 44% increase YOY.', 'Analysts are increasingly bullish about Arista’s potential to capitalize on surging cloud computing and AI infrastructure spending, highlighting strong growth in data center buildouts. In addition, the company has a favorable positioning within the back-end networking space. We should note that the overall data center capital expenditure is expected to surpass $1 trillion by 2027. Booming investments in AI infrastructure will drive this growth.', 'Arista’s primary competitive advantage lies in its technological know-how to develop faster and more reliable data flows that consume less energy. Its innovative software stack enhances Arista’s reliability in developing large AI clusters. Hence, its network solutions command robust margins that generate significant free cash flow.', 'Year-to-date (YTD), ANET stock is up 17%.\xa0Given its robust growth narrative, shares are priced at a premium valuation of 40.7 times forward earnings and 14.7 times trailing sales. Meanwhile, analysts’ 12-month price target for ANET stock suggests an upside potential of 11% from current levels.', 'Source: Joe Hendrickson / Shutterstock.com', 'Next up on our list of analyst upgrades is off-price retail giant TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX). The company operates in apparel and home fashion with key brands like TJ Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods.', 'The retailer is expected to announce the first quarter fiscal 2024 results on May 15. Before that, the fourth quarter fiscal 2023 results showed a 13% YOY increase in revenue to $16.4 billion. EPS surged 37% YOY to $1.22, driven by a 5% increase in comparable store sales and rising gross margin.', 'At present, the retail landscape is difficult for companies to navigate, partly due to the given uncertainty over interest rates. Yet, TJX’s ability to attract deal-conscious shoppers across different income levels and its flexible business model gives the company a competitive edge. As consumers seek value amid sticky inflation, the retailer could continue gaining market share from department stores and full-price retailers.', 'Strong consumer spending and an improving macro outlook suggest a positive overview for the financial year 2025. Analysts expect TJX to beat its financial year 2025 guidance on comparable store sales growth and EPS fronts.', 'So far, in 2024, TJX stock is up just 1%. Meanwhile, shares are trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.6x and a trailing price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 2.1x.

The company enjoys a duopoly with BNSF Railway over the U.S. West Coast ports, moving freight across 23 states and gateway cities in Canada and Mexico.', 'The railroad operator reported first quarter fiscal 2024 results in late April. Operating revenues remained flat at $6.03 billion due to economic headwinds, while EPS increased 1% YOY to $2.69, beating Wall Street’s expectations. In addition, free cashflow more than doubled to $525 million, driven by pricing gains that helped to compensate for lower volume and declining fuel surcharge revenue.', 'Union Pacific’s ability to maintain stable revenue and improve efficiency amid economic headwinds in part shows its effective cost management strategies. Despite the flat revenue growth, the group lowered operating expenses in an inflationary environment.', 'Management’s optimistic outlook is based on expectations of stable domestic grain demand and growth potential in other segments. As a result, Union Pacific upgraded its profitability outlook.', 'Yet, so far in 2024, UNP stock is down 1%. Shares are trading at a forward P/E ratio of 21.2x and a trailing P/S ratio of 6.1x.
