Developed for political violence underwriters, exposure analysts, modellers, and specialty reinsurers as part of the Lloyd’s Lab accelerator programme, Verisk Maplecroft’s new SRCC Predictive Model offers insurers an entirely new approach to how they assess and price these risks and is unlike anything currently available to the market.“Insured losses linked to major bouts of unrest have reached new highs in recent years, while our data tells us that in the last 12 months, SRCC risks have risen in over 50% of countries,” says Verisk Maplecroft’s Head of Risk Analytics, Sam Haynes. “As these risks expand, so too does the need for granular, forward-looking data that provides valuable insight into exposures.”Building on Verisk Maplecroft’s extensive experience in quantifying political violence, the model provides 12-month forecasts for 50,000 counties and districts globally on the risk of severe protests occurring that could result in insured losses. The machine learning model validates its predictions against actual insured losses and draws on geospatial data covering the size of recent protests, concentrations of economic value, demographics, and a range of political risk, climate, and socio-economic indicators.  As part of Verisk’s growing suite of sustainability and resilience exposure analytics, which includes extreme event models and global geospatial datasets covering the full spectrum of ESG and political risks, the SRCC Predictive Model will help political violence insurers:Improve visibility on the frequency, location, and size of SRCC eventsMake better, more informed decisions to price policiesQuickly identify portfolio exposure to unfolding SRCC eventsAnticipate potential future SRCC related lossesStory continuesUnforeseen losses, alongside ongoing global political and economic uncertainty highlights the insurance industry need for enhanced solutions to help it anticipate where large-scale, damaging events may take place. Historical findings from the model shows that SRCC risks have generally worsened in all regions over the past two years except in the Middle East and North Africa. However, it is the forward-looking capabilities that should matter most to insurers. The SRCC Predictive Model’s data suggests that the trend for costly, major civil unrest events across the world will likely continue, with political violence insurers potentially facing greater exposures.Access to the SRCC Predictive Model and its underlying data is available via Verisk platforms and through API.Learn more about the SRCC Predictive Model.  About Verisk Maplecroft  As organisations strive to understand and adapt to a fast-moving world, Verisk Maplecroft empowers them to put the environment, human rights, and political risk at the heart of their decision-making.

(NYSE:PVH) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for PVH What's The Estimated Valuation?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$720.0mUS$704.8mUS$762.7mUS$749.5mUS$809.5mUS$837.3mUS$862.8mUS$886.8mUS$909.7mUS$932.1mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x2Analyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 3.43%Est @ 3.05%Est @ 2.78%Est @ 2.59%Est @ 2.46% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.7% US$657US$586US$578US$518US$510US$481US$452US$424US$396US$370(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$5.0bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 9.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$932m× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (9.7%– 2.2%) = US$13bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$13b÷ ( 1 + 9.7%)10= US$5.0bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$10b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$83.5, the company appears quite undervalued at a 48% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at PVH as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.504. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for PVHStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Luxury market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

It is calculated based on historical trading multiples, the GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at.CF Industries Holdings (NYSE:CF) stock is estimated to be fairly valued based on the GuruFocus Value calculation. If the price of a stock is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor.

The company has also outperformed its industry’s gain of 7% over the same time frame. Moreover, it has topped the S&amp;P 500’s 5.3% rise over the same period.Let’s take a look at the factors behind this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock’s price appreciation.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Working in CF’s Favor?While CF Industries is facing headwinds from lower nitrogen prices, it is gaining from healthy nitrogen fertilizer demand in major markets and lower natural gas costs. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on rising nitrogen fertilizer demand in major markets. Higher crop commodity prices are contributing to healthy demand globally.Demand for nitrogen in North America is expected to be driven by high levels of corn planted acres in the United States and favorable farm economics. Moreover, increased planted corn acres, higher crop prices and healthy farm economics are likely to support urea demand in Brazil. CF also expects demand in India to be driven by the government’s plans to maintain high urea volumes in stock.Lower natural gas prices will also act in the company’s favor. CF Industries saw a significant decline in natural gas costs in the second quarter of 2023. Average cost of natural gas fell to $2.75 per MMBtu in the second quarter of 2023 from $7.05 per MMBtu in the year-ago quarter. Lower natural gas costs led to a decline in the company's cost of sales. The benefits of reduced gas costs are expected to continue in the third quarter.CF Industries also remains committed to boosting shareholders’ value by leveraging strong cash flows. Net cash provided by operating activities was $712 million in the second quarter. During the first half of 2023, the company repurchased 3.1 million shares for $205 million, which included the purchase of 2 million shares for $130 million in the second quarter.CF Industries Holdings, Inc.

Wellington Management portfolio manager Ann Gallo mentioned utilization as a big trend, benefiting healthcare facilities and medical device manufacturers. Other non-pharma themes included digital healthcare, managed care, and medical services. The four panelists brought together by Barron’s listed some of their favorite healthcare picks. But we are going to delve into three alternative healthcare investments unrelated to the pharmaceutical industry. Each name will have share prices up in 2023 and rated Overweight or better by the analysts covering each stock. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBecton Dickenson (BDX)Source: ShutterstockBecton Dickenson (NYSE:BDX) is up nearly 9.9% year to date. Of the 19 analysts covering its stock, 14 rate it Overweight or Buy, with a target price of $302. When Barron’s piece was written a year ago, the medical supplies and life sciences tools and technology company traded for 14x earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). It now trades at 18x.   The Q3 2023 results show revenue increase by 6.3%, excluding currency, to $4.88 billion, with adjusted earnings per share increasing 15% to $2.96 a share. Revenues were up in the U.S. (57% of sales) and internationally (43%). For all of 2023, it expects $19.3 billion in revenue, with adjusted EPS of $12.21 at the midpoint of its guidance.Boston Scientific (BSX)a zoom-in on the Boston Scientific logo (BSX) on a web pageSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comBoston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) is up nearly 19% year to date (YTD). Of the 32 analysts covering its stock, 28 rate it Overweight or Buy, with a target price of $60.50. In Barron’s roundtable, Gallo pointed to the company’s “above-market growth in all its key divisions. It is positioned to grow broadly for some years into the future”.Story continuesThe medical device company’s shares rallied on Aug. 28 after it reported positive results from its clinical trial for its atrial fibrillation device.  “The Farapulse Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA) uses electric fields to remove heart tissue causing irregular heartbeats, rather than the more traditional thermal method,” Investopedia reported. “The study involved 607 patients with paroxysmal AF who had previously been unsuccessfully treated with at least one anti-arrhythmic drug.”  In Q2 2023, the company’s revenues rose 12.0% year over year (YOY) on an operational basis to $3.60 billion. The company’s guidance had called for 8% growth at its midpoint. Its adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.53, four cents higher than its guidance.  For the year, it expects sales growth of 10.5% to 11.5%, with adjusted EPS between $1.96 and $2.00.Edwards Lifesciences (EW)An image of a tablet with 'therapeutics' on the screen, a stethoscope and face mask around itSource: ra2 studio/ShutterstockEdwards Lifesciences (NYSE:EW) reported its Q2 2023 results at the end of July. While they were better than expected, its shares fell on near-term growth concerns.“It is exiting the pandemic with its leading TAVR (transaortic valve replacement) franchise well positioned for continued growth after the recent lull,” Barron’s reported on Gallo’s comments last September. “Over the next decade, two newer and currently smaller markets, mitral and bicuspid valve repair, will join TAVR as important growth engines.”Despite the decline at the end of July, EW stock remains in positive territory YTD, up nearly 5%. Over the past five years, it’s up 62%, higher than the S&amp;P 500. Of the 30 analysts covering its stock, 16 rate it Overweight or Buy, with a target price of $99, considerably higher than currently trading.In 2023, Edward Lifesciences expects revenue of $6.0 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, up from its previous estimate of $5.8 billion. It expects to earn $2.55 a share this year, up a penny from its previous guidance. Also, it is hopeful that TAVR will generate $3.93 billion in 2023, accounting for more than 65% of its total revenue. This would deliver growth of 11.5% YOY, excluding currency.   As recently as December 2021, it traded near $130. It’s got the growth to get back there in 2024.  On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(Photo: Gatik)Breakfast sausage, hot dogs and frozen chicken breasts from Tyson Foods are beginning to move autonomously on Gatik AI trucks in Northwest Arkansas. The three-year contract could expand nationwide.Gatik has covered a 7.1-mile route from a small warehouse to a Walmart retail store in Bentonville, Arkansas. It will serve Walmart neighbor Tyson as a third-party carrier using four Gatik trucks equipped with autonomous capability.Gatik’s four-year project with Walmart — using driverless trucks since 2021 — ended with the closing of the warehouse where it was picking up loads. The startup expects to expand autonomous operations with Walmart but declined to provide details of what that will look like.Much attention in autonomous trucking goes to Class 8 autonomous developers. Two of those — Aurora Innovation and TuSimple — forecast driver-out commercial routes by the end of 2024.With less fanfare and no meaningful competition, Gatik has operated short-haul repeatable routes for up to 18 hours a day for Walmart and the Loblaws supermarket chain in Canada. In March, it added grocery giant Kroger as a customer for autonomous deliveries in Dallas.Gatik counts thousands of accident-free driverless trips and more than 500,000 deliveries with and without safety monitors. Robot drivers are exempt from hours-of-service regulations limiting humans to 11 hours of driving in a 24-hour period.“We’re really building on a lot of the operational learnings that we’ve gained over the past few years in northwest Arkansas,” said Richard Steiner, Gatik vice president of government relations and public affairs.Reconfiguring supply chain transportation for TysonIn adding lane density, Gatik is using Class 7 box trucks, weaning shippers from using Class 8 day cab semi-trailers on shorter runs.“We’re able to offer a much more responsive and flexible solution with a slightly smaller truck but still deliver a substantial load very frequently for the customer,” Steiner said. “This is the first time that anyone, to the best of our knowledge, has done that in the autonomous trucking space.”Story continuesA typical Tyson truckload consists of 30 pallets. But it’s not always easy to fill a 53-foot refrigerated trailer for a short haul, Patrick Simmons, Tyson’s vice president of transportation, told FreightWaves.“Almost 47% of our total miles are what we refer to as shuttle runs,” Simmons said. “That’s taking loads from a production facility out to one of our distribution facilities or a finishing plant where [chicken] can get breaded and those types of things.”Using a smaller truck to haul 10 pallets for 10 miles makes sense. High-frequency autonomous runs use less fuel and create fewer emissions, he said.“We figure that just one Gatik truck equates to about 700 truckloads a year, and that gives us a lot more efficiency, better turns on our trailers and helps us reduce our carbon footprint,” Simmons said.4 autonomous trucks for Tyson for startersTyson operates the nation’s eighth-largest private fleet, with 1,300 trucks and 4,500 mostly refrigerated trailers. It is helping Gatik purchase four Class 7 Isuzu FVR cabovers upfit for autonomy.“There are multiple facilities in Northwest Arkansas where we’re starting so we can monitor it,” Simmons said. “Across the country, we’ve identified 40 locations where we could do similar operations.”But first things first. Autonomous trucks assigned to Tyson will start with safety drivers as the pilots with Walmart and Loblaws did. Steiner would not share the timeline for when driver-out operations to Tyson storage facilities in the Rogers and Springdale, Arkansas, areas would begin.“There is an exponential decrease in the time frame from safety driver to driver out as we expand our operations,” he said.Autonomous trucking involves much more than the truck. The warehouse needs to be prepared. Bills of lading will change, as will communication between the carrier and the plant. A driverless truck passing through a guard shack is another challenge.Repurposing Tyson driver jobs  Tyson has hired 250 private fleet drivers so far this year and expects that number to grow. Adding autonomous trucking could change some driving jobs but won’t eliminate any, Simmons said.“We’re going to repurpose what they do,” he said. “I have worked with drivers for over 20 years and one of the biggest complaints I hear is ‘I have to drive 400-plus miles a day to make any money.’”Tyson wants its private fleet to carry 50% of its total freight compared to 40% presently. As autonomous trucks take on the short-haul trips, human drivers will get more long-haul runs.“This will allow us to take that same driver and make them more of a regional driver, that 400- to 500-mile average distance,” Simmons said.Tyson has no immediate plans for converting to long-haul autonomous trucks. Its proteins are the refrigerated freight on a hub-to-hub autonomous pilot with carrier C.R. England and autonomous trucking developer Kodiak Robotics.“There’s not enough drivers for us to do all that we want to accomplish,” Simmons said. “That’s why we want to learn where [autonomy] makes sense. Can we use technology today to help us be more flexible, responsive and nimble across the country?”Related articles:Running on Ice: KITT joins the cold chain2022 Shipper of Choice Profile: Tyson FoodsGatik will autonomously deliver groceries for Kroger in DallasClick for more FreightWaves articles by Alan Adler.The post Gatik robot trucks will haul Tyson chicken, sausage and hot dogs appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

(The Nike brand has the top spot.)According to Drbul, the hype is still there: In the company's fiscal fourth quarter earnings, the Jordan brand brought in $6.59 billion in revenue — 12.9% of Nike's total fiscal year 2023 sales.And the brand has plenty of momentum heading into the holidays, especially around the re-release of a sneaker that first debuted in 1996.""The sneaker industry is anticipating a Holiday launch of the Air Jordan 11, at $230, which is considered by many as one of the greatest Jordan sneakers ever,"" Drbul wrote, adding that Nike plans to include new colorways and editions in the release, such as the ""Gratitude,"" ""Defining Moments Pack,"" and ""Concord"" colorways.""We expect these sneakers to create a lot of brand Heat and keep Brand Jordan relevant for Sneaker Heads,"" the analyst added.Jordan an 'attractive growth vehicle' amid some concerns for NikeAfter nearly 30 years, the Jordan brand ""remains extremely relevant"" and ""an attractive growth vehicle"" for Nike, even as the footwear space experiences some weakness, Drbul said.Total searches for Jordan brand keywords are up on most major retailers' websites, per Guggenheim and SimilarWeb data, which also included searches on Google, Bing, and the private browser DuckDuckGo in the results.Searches for the brand are up 38.7% year over year on JDSports.com, 67.0% on Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), 139.4% on Foot Locker (FL), 3.3% on the sneaker site goat.com, 492.1% on eBay (EBAY), and up 455.5% on Amazon's website (AMZN).On fightclub.com, however, searches are down 52.4% from a year ago.Story continuesNike Air Jordan shoes at a store in Krakow, Poland on July 5, 2023. (Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)There's another perk for investors: Nike is a brand that is engaging Gen Z by gaining social media hype with innovation and new products, Barclays consumer discretionary analyst Adrienne Yih told Yahoo Finance. The brand also benefits from secular lifestyle trends like health and wellness.Yet despite the Jordan interest, Nike stock is down nearly 14% year to date.Shares hit a rough patch over the last month, dropping over 7% after Foot Locker posted disappointing results and cut its full-year outlook. Historically, Nike accounts for more than half of Foot Locker's total sales, Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reported.One concern for Nike is the drop in monthly downloads and usage of SNKRS, an app created by the athletic apparel giant. However, Drbul argued there have also been signs of weakness within mobile and web traffic for sneaker resellers, which led the team to believe it is ""not a Brand Jordan problem.""As signs of stress begin to show at some large retailers and ""given macro uncertainties and a slowdown in discretionary spending"" so far this year, Drbul added the firm believes ""the weakness in the secondary sneaker market is logical.""Another challenge in recent years has been Nike's efforts to redo its distribution network, Oppenheimer senior analyst Brian Nagel told Yahoo Finance. ""One of the challenges for Nike over the last few or several years now has been that they've had to ... dismantle or ... reconfigure their wholesale distribution network because they had to think about where their partnerships and wholesale [are].""Nike is expected to post its first quarter fiscal 2024 financial results on Thursday, Sept. 28, after the market close.—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

""We think 2024 is going to be a little weaker, but we're still expecting about 3% real disposable household income growth. If that's right, or even if that's anywhere close to right, then it's very difficult to see declines in real consumer spending.""Shoppers load a TV into their SUV at Best Buy during Black Friday sales in Chicago on Nov. 25, 2022.

The consumer's reaction to the return of student loan repayments this fall is also a wildcard.""We do think [student loan repayments are] going to be a modest drag on growth in the fourth quarter or maybe in the first quarter [of 2024],"" Hatzius said.

The company is benefiting from a growing wireless subscriber base as witnessed in the second quarter of 2023. The technology will help it in expanding much faster and at a lower cost compared to competitors.Recovery in the park and movie business bodes well for Comcast's profitability. Its streaming service Peacock is a key catalyst in driving broadband sales. Strong free cash flow generation ability is noteworthy.However, Comcast persistently suffers from video-subscriber attrition due to cord cutting. Moreover, broadband prospects are suffering from increased competition from fixed wireless as well as fiber. Additionally, a leveraged balance sheet is a major concern.(You can read the full research report on Comcast here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Linde have outperformed the Zacks Chemical - Specialty industry over the year-to-date (+19.5% vs. +11.3%). With a wide range of applications for its industrial gases, Linde is making the world more productive by the day. The company's primary products in industrial gases include oxygen, which is used as life support in hospitals.Linde has long-term contracts with on-site customers backed by minimum purchase requirements, thereby securing stable cashflows. In the profitable industrial gas market, the merger of Praxair and Linde has created an efficient player with considerable size advantages.

A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that estimates the current intrinsic value of a stock. It is based on historical trading multiples, an adjustment factor from GuruFocus based on the company's past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line on our summary page provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should be traded.Based on this method, Xylem (NYSE:XYL) appears to be modestly undervalued. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued, predicting poor future returns. Conversely, if the stock price is significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued, suggesting high future returns. Given Xylem's current price and market cap, the stock appears to be modestly undervalued, implying that the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Story continuesUnveiling Xylem's True Worth: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with low financial strength could result in permanent capital loss. A company's financial strength can be initially assessed by looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage. Xylem has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.27, which ranks worse than 79.83% of 2791 companies in the Industrial Products industry. Based on this, GuruFocus ranks Xylem's financial strength as 7 out of 10, suggesting a fair balance sheet.Unveiling Xylem's True Worth: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies carries less risk, especially if the companies have demonstrated consistent profitability over the long term. Xylem has been profitable 10 years over the past 10 years. During the past 12 months, the company had revenues of $6.10 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $1.88. Its operating margin of 11.11% is better than 71.51% of 2801 companies in the Industrial Products industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks Xylem's profitability as fair.Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. A faster-growing company creates more value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of Xylem is 1.7%, which ranks worse than 67.34% of 2670 companies in the Industrial Products industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is -0.6%, which ranks worse than 69.22% of 2362 companies in the Industrial Products industry.ROIC vs WACCOne can also evaluate a company's profitability by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the return on invested capital exceeds the weighted average cost of capital, the company is likely creating value for its shareholders. During the past 12 months, Xylem's ROIC is 7.14 while its WACC came in at 9.66.Unveiling Xylem's True Worth: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of Xylem (NYSE:XYL) appears to be modestly undervalued. The company's financial condition is fair and its profitability is fair.

Jarrett/ShutterstockSaudi Arabia and Russia said they will extend oil supply cuts of 1.3 million barrels a day through December 2023.The Tuesday announcements sent prices of benchmark oil futures shooting to their 10-month highs.Analysts think inflation could stay at higher levels for longer due to the higher oil prices.Analysts think inflation could stay at higher levels for longer, after a decision by Saudi Arabia and Russia to extend oil production cuts until the end of this year sent prices soaring.The two energy giants' plan to cut a collective 1.3 million barrels of oil per day sent Brent crude oil futures — the international benchmark — to hit their 10-month high above $90 a barrel. US West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude oil futures also hit a 10-month high.Saudi Arabia and Russia said the supply cuts are aimed at maintaining stability and balance in the oil markets.These unilateral supply cuts from both countries are outside the production policy of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, or OPEC+.OPEC+ had last cut production in April for ""the stability of the oil market.""""These bullish moves significantly tighten the global oil market and can only result in one thing: higher oil prices worldwide,"" Jorge Leon, a senior vice president at research firm Rystad Energy, wrote in a Tuesday note seen by Insider.Leon said it is hard to predict the impact of these cuts on inflation and economic policy in the West, but said, ""higher oil prices will only increase the likelihood of more fiscal tightening, especially in the US, to curtail inflation.""Higher oil prices are bad news for the world's central banks, which have been trying to tame high inflation since last year. Energy is a key input for economic activities, so higher oil prices generally lead to inflation.But Saudi Arabia and Russia's keeping their oil supply cuts for longer means ""they have no interest in what central banks are worried about,"" Naeem Aslam, the chief investment officer of Zaye Capital Markets, wrote in a Tuesday note seen by Insider.Story continuesSaudi Arabia also has its own reasons to want to keep oil prices higher because it needs to pump in massive investment into the Kingdom's economic transformation project that is aimed at steering its reliance away from oil, Aslam added in his note.As it is, world oil demand is ""scaling record highs"" due to strong summer air travel and power generation, according to the International Energy Agency in its August report. While the IEA expects global oil demand to hit 102.2 million barrels a day this year, supply has already fallen to 100.9 million barrels a day in July — indicating a shortfall.Even so, oil price gains have so far remained muted this year due to concerns about major importer China's economic gloom. Brent futures are up about 5% this year while US WTI futures are up about 8% so far.Brent futures were flat at $90.04 a barrel at 12.16 a.m. ET on Wednesday after surging over 1.4% on Tuesday.

In that same time, the Finance sector lost 0.81%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 1.02%.Investors will be hoping for strength from Morgan Stanley as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be October 18, 2023. On that day, Morgan Stanley is projected to report earnings of $1.42 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 7.19%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $13.41 billion, up 3.24% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $5.83 per share and revenue of $54.78 billion. These totals would mark changes of -8.33% and +2.08%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Morgan Stanley should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank.

Morgan Stanley is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Story continuesLooking at its valuation, Morgan Stanley is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 14.7.

44,1c322526-25b2-3808-bd02-47c2e9dba9d4,MS,2023-09-06,The $100trn battle for the world’s wealthiest people,The Economist,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/100trn-battle-world-wealthiest-people-200308471.html,1693944188,STORY,['MS'],"[The uber-rich hire all kinds of people to make their lives easier. Landscapers maintain gardens, housekeepers tidy homes, nannies raise children. Yet perhaps no role is as important as that of the wealth manager, who is hired to protect capital.These advisers are scattered across the globe in cities such as Geneva and New York, and are employed as fiduciaries, meaning they are required to act in the interest of their clients. As such, they become privy to the intimate lives of the rich and famous, who must expose their secrets so that advice may be offered on, say, the inheritance of a child born of an extramarital affair.Advisers also help families allocate investments, stash cash in boltholes, minimise tax bills, plan for retirement, arrange to pass down their vast wealth and follow unusual wishes. A Singapore-based manager recalls being told to invest a “double-digit” percentage of a family’s wealth in “bloodstock horses”—steeds bred especially for racing—a term he hurriedly looked up after the meeting.For decades, wealth management was a niche service, looked down upon by the rest of finance. Now it is the most attractive business in the industry.Capital and liquidity requirements set after the global financial crisis of 2007-09 have made running balance-sheet-heavy businesses, such as lending or trading, difficult and expensive. By comparison, doling out wealth advice requires almost no capital. Margins for firms that achieve scale are typically around 25%. Clients stick around, meaning that revenues are predictable.Competition has crushed profits in other formerly lucrative asset-management businesses, such as mutual funds. And whereas the pools of assets managed by BlackRock (BLK) and Vanguard, the index- and exchange-traded-fund giants, are huge, they collect a fraction of a penny on every dollar invested. A standard fee for a wealth manager is 1% of a client’s assets, annually.Wealth management is all the more appealing because of how quickly it is expanding. Global economic growth has been decent enough over the past two decades, at more than 3% a year. Yet it has been left in the dust by growth in wealth. Between 2000 and 2020 it rose from $160 trillion, or four times global output, to $510 trillion, or six times output.Story continuesAlthough much of this is tied up in property and other assets, the pool of liquid assets is still vast, making up a quarter of the total. Bain, a consultancy, estimates that it will almost double, from just over $130 trillion to almost $230 trillion by 2030—meaning that a $100 trillion prize is up for grabs. They anticipate the boom will help lift global wealth-management revenues from $255 billion to $510 billion.It will be fuelled by geography, demography and technology. The biggest managers are attempting to cover ever more of the globe as dynastic wealth is created in Asian and Latin American markets. Baby-boomers are the last generation that can rely on defined-benefit pensions for their retirement; more people will have to take decisions about how their own wealth will support them. Meanwhile, software is streamlining the bureaucracy that once waylaid wealth managers, allowing them to serve more clients at lower cost, and helping firms automate the acquisition of new ones.These gains will allow big banks to serve the merely rich as well as the uber-wealthy. Firms are already climbing down the rungs of the wealth ladder, from ultra-high-net-worth and high-net-worth, who have millions of dollars to invest, into the lives of those with just $100,000 or so.Markus Habbel of Bain sees a comparison to the booming luxury-goods industry. Handbags were once prized for their exclusivity as much as their beauty, but have become ubiquitous on social media, with influencers touting Bottega Veneta pouches and Hermès bags. “Think about Louis Vuitton or Gucci. They have basically the same clients as [wealth managers] target and they increased from 40 million [customers] 40 years ago to 400 million now,” he notes. Upper-crust buyers have not been put off.Which firms will grab the $100 trillion prize? For the moment, wealth management is fragmented. Local banks, such as BTG in Brazil, have large shares of domestic markets. Regional champions dominate in hubs, including Bank of Singapore and DBS in Asia. In America, the masses are served by specialist firms such as Edward Jones, a retail-wealth-mananagement outfit in which advisers are paid based on commissions for selling funds.UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti speaks on the first results of the Swiss giant banking since its Credit Suisse merger. (Photo by FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP via Getty Images) (FABRICE COFFRINI via Getty Images)Only a handful of institutions compete on a truly global scale. These include Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM). But the two biggest are Morgan Stanley (MS) and a new-look UBS (UBS) (UBSG.SW), which has just absorbed Credit Suisse, its old domestic rival. After acquiring a handful of smaller wealth-management firms over the past decade, Morgan Stanley now oversees around $6 trillion in wealth assets. After its merger, UBS now oversees $5.5 trillion.To the victor This patchwork is unlikely to last. “The industry is heading in a winner-takes-all direction,” predicts Mr Habbel, as it becomes “very much about scale, about technology and about global reach”.Jennifer Piepszak, an executive at JPMorgan, has reported that her firm’s takeover of First Republic, a bank for the well-heeled that failed in May, represents a “meaningful acceleration” of its wealth-management ambitions. Citigroup (C) has poached Andy Sieg, head of wealth management at Bank of America (BAC), in an effort to revamp its offering. In 2021, Vanguard purchased “Just Invest”, a wealth-technology company.UBS and Morgan Stanley have grander ambitions. The firms’ strategies reflect their contrasting backgrounds and may, ultimately, end up in a clash.Morgan Stanley competes around the world but is dominant in America, and is focusing on wealth services for the masses, as shown by its purchase of E*trade, a brokerage platform, in 2020. James Gorman, the bank’s boss, has said that if the firm keeps growing new assets by around 5% a year, its current growth rate, it would oversee $20 trillion in a decade or so.This would be built on Morgan Stanley’s existing scale. In 2009, the bank agreed to acquire Smith Barney, Citi’s wealth-management arm, for $13.5 billion, which helped boost margins to the low teens from 2% or so in the years before the financial crisis. Today they are around 27%, reflecting the use of tech to move into advising the merely rich.Andy Saperstein, head of the wealth-management division, points to the acquisition of Solium, a small stock-plan-administration firm, which Morgan Stanley purchased for just $900 million in 2019, as crucial for building a strong client-referral machine.“No one was looking at the stock-plan-administration companies because they didn’t make any money,” he says. But these firms “had access to a huge customer base and [clients] were constantly checking to see when the equity was going to vest, what it was worth and when they would have access to it.”UBS is employing a more old-school approach, albeit with a global twist. Having taken over its domestic rival, the Swiss bank has a once-in-a-generation chance to cement a lead in places where Credit Suisse flourished, such as Brazil and South-East Asia. Deft execution of the merger would make the firm a front-runner in almost every corner of the globe. Thus, for now at least, the new-look UBS will focus more on geographic breadth than the merely rich.In differing ways, both Morgan Stanley and UBS are seeking even greater scale. When clients hire a wealth manager, they tend to want one of two things. Sometimes it is help with a decision “when the cost of making a bad choice is high”, says Mr Saperstein, such as working out how to save for retirement or a child’s education. Other times it is something exclusively available, such as access to investments unobtainable through a regular brokerage account.Being able to offer clients access to private funds or assets will probably become increasingly important for wealth managers. Greater scale means greater bargaining power when negotiating with private-markets firms to secure exclusive deals, such as private funds for customers or lower fees. Younger generations, which will soon be inheriting wealth, are expected to demand more environmentally and socially conscious options, including those that do not just screen out oil companies, but focus on investing in, say, clean energy. A decade ago a client would tend to follow their wealth adviser if he or she moved to a new firm. Exclusive funds make such a switch more difficult.The winner-takes-all trend may be accelerated by artificial intelligence (AI), on which bigger firms with bigger technology budgets already have a head start. There are three kinds of tools that AI could be used to create. The first take a firm’s proprietary information, such as asset-allocation recommendations or research reports, and spit out information that advisers can use to help their clients. Attempts to build such “enterprise” tools are common, since they are the easiest to produce and pose few regulatory difficulties.Wealthbots The second type of tool would be trained on client information rather than companies’ proprietary data, perhaps even listening in on conversations between advisers and clients. Such a tool could then summarise information and create automatic actions for advisers, reminding them to send details to clients or follow up about certain issues. The third kind of tool is the most aspirational. It is an execution tool, which would allow advisers to speak aloud requests, such as purchasing units in a fund or carrying out a foreign-exchange transaction, and have a firm’s systems automatically execute that transaction on their behalf, saving time.It will take money to make money, then. The biggest wealth managers already have more substantial margins, access to products their clients want and a head start on the technology that might put them even further ahead. “We are a growth company now,” claims Mr Saperstein of Morgan Stanley, a sentence that has been rarely uttered about a bank in the past 15 years. “We are just getting started.”Yet the two giants atop the industry are both going through periods of transition. UBS has barely begun the open-heart surgery that is required when merging two large banks. Meanwhile, Mr Gorman, architect of Morgan Stanley’s wealth strategy, will retire some time in the next nine months. The succession race between Mr Saperstein, Ted Pick and Dan Simkowitz, two other executives, is already under way.Either firm could falter. Although the two are chasing different strategies, it is surely only a matter of time before they clash. UBS is on an American hiring spree; Morgan Stanley is eyeing expansion in some global markets, including Japan.A sign for Morgan Stanley's offices in Tokyo at the Yebisu Garden Place. (Photo by James Leynse/Corbis via Getty Images) (James Leynse via Getty Images)And despite the advantages offered by scale, smaller wealth-management firms will be difficult to dislodge entirely. Lots of different outfits have a foothold in the industry, from customer-directed brokerage platforms like Charles Schwab (SCHW), which also offer their richest customers independent advice from a fiduciary, to asset-management firms, such as Fidelity and Vanguard, which have millions of customers invested in their funds, who might seek out wealth-management advice.When Willie Sutton — a dapper thief also known as ""Slick Willie"" who died in 1980 — was asked why he decided to rob banks, he replied that it was simply “because that is where the money is”. This is also a useful aphorism to explain strategy on Wall Street, as firms race to take advantage of the $100 trillion opportunity in wealth management. Once the business was a sleepy, unsophisticated corner of finance. Now it is the industry’s future.© 2023 The Economist Newspaper Limited.

In the Diagnostics segment, revenues declined 11.5% year over year in the first half of 2023 due to lower COVID-related respiratory testing volumes. In the Biotechnology segment, revenues fell 16.4% year over year.Due to lower demand for COVID-19 testing, vaccines and therapeutics, Danaher expects total core revenues to decline in the low to mid-teens percentage range for the third quarter.

The upside can be linked to strength across the Aerospace segment (which accounts for the bulk of the company’s top line), recovery in GE Vernova’s (the combined operations of GE Power and Renewable) operations and shareholder-friendly policies.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCommercial aerospace strength is driving growth of the Aerospace segment. Significant growth in LEAP engine deliveries is driving commercial engines revenues. Growth in the commercial services business and a significant increase in defense engine orders also bode well for the segment’s growth. The segment’s revenues and orders jumped 27% and 25% in the first six months of 2023, respectively.After months of softness, a rebound in demand at the Power segment augurs well for General Electric. Strength in GE Gas Power’s heavy-duty gas turbine transactional services and GE gas turbine business is aiding the Power segment. The company expects low-single-digit revenue growth for the Power segment in 2023 driven by Gas Power services. The acquisition of Nexus Controls (April 2023), which allows the creation of a single, full-service controls business line for further development of GE’s proprietary Mark Vle controls systems platform, should bolster the segment’s growth.With higher equipment demand at Grid and Onshore Wind in North America, signs of progress in the Renewables segment are encouraging. For 2023, the company expects GE Renewable Energy revenues to increase in the high-single digits.Given continued strength in GE Aerospace and improvement in GE Vernova, General Electric has raised its full-year guidance. The company now expects revenues to increase in low double digits compared with the high-single-digit growth anticipated earlier. It expects adjusted earnings of $2.10-$2.30 per share compared with $1.70-$2.00 estimated earlier. GE expects an operating profit of $4.7-$5.1 billion for 2023. It expects free cash flow of $4.1-$4.6 billion for 2023 compared with $3.6-$4.2 billion estimated earlier.General Electric’s commitment to reward its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks is encouraging. In the first six months of 2023, the company paid dividends of $350 million, up 19% year over year. In the same period, GE repurchased 6.2 million shares for $0.6 million under the above authorization.Story continuesWill the Uptrend in Shares Continue?General Electric is expected to continue to thrive on the back of momentum across its Aerospace segment as demand for jet engine spare parts and services increases with the boom in air travel demand. GE expects Aerospace revenues to increase in the high teens to 20% in 2023.In March, General Electric provided a bullish long-term view for the Aerospace segment. For 2025, the company expects the segment’s revenues to increase in the low double digits to mid-teens. For the long term, GE predicts mid-single to high-single-digit revenue growth for the Aerospace segment. It expects continued margin expansion for the unit over the long term.Continued recovery in GE Vernova’s operations is expected to foster GE’s growth. The recent acquisition of data integration platform company, Greenbird Integration Technology AS, bolsters GE Vernova’s growth. The buyout facilitates GridOS, the first software portfolio designed for grid orchestration, by adding new capabilities for connecting systems and integrating data across the grid smoothly.Zacks Rank &amp; Other Stocks to ConsiderGeneral Electric sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Below we discuss some top-ranked industrial companies:Flowserve Corporation FLS presently sports a Zacks Rank #1.

Too many bushes in close proximity allow fire to spread from bush to bush and increase fire intensity,"" Hawks says.Story continuesThin bushes out or remove some altogether.Space bushes twice the height of a bush, so a three-foot bush should be six feet away from nearby bushes.Avoid ladder fuels, which allows fire to move from ground to bush to trees to the crownsHow to create 100 feet of defensible spaceSmall trees should be limbed up at least six feet from the groundLarger trees with vegetation below should be limbed up three times the height of the vegetation, so if you have a two-foot-tall bush under tree, you should remove limbs up to six feetGive full-grown trees space.

The company is benefiting from a growing wireless subscriber base as witnessed in the second quarter of 2023. The technology will help it in expanding much faster and at a lower cost compared to competitors.Recovery in the park and movie business bodes well for Comcast's profitability. Its streaming service Peacock is a key catalyst in driving broadband sales. Strong free cash flow generation ability is noteworthy.However, Comcast persistently suffers from video-subscriber attrition due to cord cutting. Moreover, broadband prospects are suffering from increased competition from fixed wireless as well as fiber. Additionally, a leveraged balance sheet is a major concern.(You can read the full research report on Comcast here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Linde have outperformed the Zacks Chemical - Specialty industry over the year-to-date (+19.5% vs. +11.3%).

The company's primary products in industrial gases include oxygen, which is used as life support in hospitals.Linde has long-term contracts with on-site customers backed by minimum purchase requirements, thereby securing stable cashflows. In the profitable industrial gas market, the merger of Praxair and Linde has created an efficient player with considerable size advantages. Linde reported strong second quarter earnings aided by higher pricing from its Americas segment.However, increasing competition for new projects and developments in emerging markets is concerning.

The company is well-poised to grow on the back of acquisitions made within its operating units, the launch of new products and branching out into new businesses.Revenues have been increasing thanks to a wide geographic presence and strong client retention. The Risk and Insurance Services unit has been contributing to revenue growth for a while. Solid cash flows enable business investments. MMC had around $3.7 billion left under authorization as of Jun 30, 2023.However, escalating operating costs might weigh on the margins. The metric jumped 6.1% y/y in 1H23.

That includes fines or a possible company breakup.Scrutiny is also rising in the US, where regulators are preparing this month to file a new suit against Amazon after a meeting with the company last month failed to solve their differences, according to new reports from Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal.The legal action from the Federal Trade Commission would reportedly target concerns the e-commerce giant is unfairly competing with third-party sellers who use its marketplace.The Department of Justice and a collection of state attorneys general are also suing Google in two consolidated cases launched during President Trump’s administration, alleging the company abuses its market power across search and search advertising to squeeze competition.Those cases go to trial starting Tuesday before the US District Court for the District of Columbia, which has dismissed some of the claims.Revenue risksA Google executive said Wednesday in a blog post that the new rules from the EU will require Google to make changes to the way its products and services work.""For us, for example, that will mean building on the work we have done to provide consumers with information and opportunities to switch platforms or manage their data ... and remind people about their choices,"" Google's legal director Oliver Bethell said.Story continuesThe DMA purports to promote competition by scaling back tech companies’ ability to control gateways through which business users reach their final consumers.Messaging apps like WhatsApp, for example, must interoperate with other messaging services, meaning that messages must be capable of being sent from WhatsApp to another messaging application.Companies subject to the law also can no longer favor their own products or services over the services of competing businesses that use their platforms. Amazon.com, for example, is prohibited from preferencing its brand name products over the products of its third-party sellers.The DMA further prohibits gatekeeper designees from locking users into their own ecosystems. For instance, Google must open its Play Store and Apple must open its App Store to other app stores that want to compete in the market. The mobile device manufacturers are also prohibited from dictating what apps must come on their devices, pre-installed.""They're all going to face risk to their revenue streams for sure if they're on that list,"" Case Western Reserve University Law School professor Anat Alon-Beck told Yahoo Finance.The EU released a new list of tech 'gatekeeper' companies.The DMA is enforceable in the EU starting in March. Its rules carve out special restrictions for dominant technology companies that have a market cap of at least 75 billion euros ($80.5 billion), and earned at least 7.5 billion euros ($8 billion) in revenue in each of the past three years.An exception can be made for companies that have an ""entrenched and durable"" market position.Penalties for violations of the DMA are steep. Gatekeepers that fail to comply with its obligation face fines up to 10% of the company's annual worldwide revenue, and up to 20% for repeat offenses. Other systematic infringements can empower the EC to seek divestment or block future acquisitions.The full list of Big Tech services that the EC says fall under the law’s purview includes Meta's Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp; Apple's iOS and Safari; Alphabet's Android operating system, Google Search, YouTube, and its app store, advertising, and map services; Amazon's marketplace and advertising services; Microsoft's Windows operating system and LinkedIn; plus ByteDance's TikTok.The EC said it separately opened market investigations to assess Microsoft’s claims that its Bing search engine, Edge browser, and Microsoft Advertising arm should be exempt from gatekeeper status. The commission is also investigating Apple's claims that its iMessenger service should be exempt.Alon-Beck with Case Western Reserve said Apple's and Microsoft's objections to gatekeeper status for their respective iMessage and Bing services hold merit.""I kind of agree with Microsoft and Apple, that [regulators] will be harming ... overall competition if they add them, because really, Google doesn't have competition,"" she said.Amazon said in a statement that it is ""committed to delivering services that meet our customers’ requirements within Europe’s evolving regulatory landscape"" and that ""we will continue to work constructively with the European Commission as we finalize our implementation plans.""Click here for the latest technology newsRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Microsoft The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$67.2bUS$80.9bUS$97.9bUS$112.9bUS$130.9bUS$144.1bUS$155.3bUS$164.7bUS$172.7bUS$179.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x23Analyst x19Analyst x9Analyst x4Analyst x3Est @ 10.13%Est @ 7.73%Est @ 6.06%Est @ 4.89%Est @ 4.07% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% US$62.7kUS$70.4kUS$79.5kUS$85.5kUS$92.5kUS$95.1kUS$95.6kUS$94.6kUS$92.5kUS$89.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$858bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$180b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.2%– 2.2%) = US$3.6tPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$3.6t÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$1.8tThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$2.7t. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$334, the company appears about fair value at a 7.6% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Microsoft as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.006. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for MicrosoftStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Software market.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Meta's Facebook, Instagram, Marketplace, and WhatsApp also qualified as gatekeepers.Companies that fail to comply with their obligations can be fined up to 10% of their annual global turnover for DMA violations.Gatekeepers could ask for an interim measure to suspend the application of the rules but they would need to launch a legal case in the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg to do that, a senior Commission official said. ""We haven't seen anything like that so far.""Following the introduction of separate legislation, the Digital Services Act, Zalando took the Commission to court in June.Story continues""It's D-Day for #DMA!,"" EU industry chief Thierry Breton said on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""The most impactful online companies will now have to play by our EU rules.""MIXED REACTIONSA Microsoft spokesperson said it accepts its gatekeeper designation, while Meta, Google and Amazon spokespersons said they were reviewing the designations.Apple and TikTok were less welcoming.TikTok said it ""fundamentally disagreed with this decision"" and was ""disappointed that no market investigation was conducted prior to this decision,"" adding it was considering its next steps.An Apple spokesperson said the company remained ""very concerned about the privacy and data security risks the DMA poses for our users.""The iPhone maker had earlier raised concerns that the DMA would lead to more installing of apps that do not come via Apple's App Store, or ""side-loading"".""The Commission should balance the need to protect user security and privacy with the very real risk that gatekeeper app stores will use security and privacy as excuses to dilute compliance with their DMA obligations,"" said Stavroula Vryna, partner at law firm Clifford Chance.Alphabet's Gmail, Microsoft's Outlook and Samsung's browser were exempted after the companies provided sufficiently justified arguments showing that these services do not qualify as gatekeepers, the Commission said.The Commission has also opened four market investigations to further assess Microsoft's and Apple's submissions that some of their core platforms such as Bing, Edge and Microsoft Advertising, and Apple's iMessage services do not qualify as gateways.""iMessage is designed and marketed for personal consumer communications, and we look forward to explaining to the commission why iMessage is outside the scope of the DMA,"" an Apple spokesperson said.

Cities in Texas are making it illegal to travel their roads for an abortion, the movie version of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour broke AMC's single-day sales record, and Fortune senior writer Maria Aspan dives into the sudden exit of Walgreens's Roz Brewer, the most powerful Black female CEO in the Fortune 500. Have a thoughtful Tuesday!- Abrupt exit. The supposedly sleepy Labor Day weekend began with a bang on Friday morning, when Walgreens abruptly announced that CEO Roz Brewer had stepped down and left its board, effective the day before (Aug 31).The decision was “mutually agreed” upon by Brewer and Walgreens’s board, the company said. Brewer, who had been in the job for less than three years, used the same language in a LinkedIn post and an internal email to Walgreens employees seen by Fortune.“This is perhaps one of the most difficult notes I have ever written over the course of my career,” Brewer wrote in both notes. Spokespeople for her and for Walgreens declined to comment further to Fortune on Friday.Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit Monday, October 10th, 2022 Laguna Niguel, CA Rosalind (Roz) Brewer, Chief Executive Officer and Director, Walgreens Boots Alliance Interviewer: Beth Kowitt, FORTUNEBrewer’s departure means that the most powerful Black woman running a Fortune 500 company—and one of only two Black female CEOs in the Fortune 500 at the start of last week—is out of a job, at least temporarily. (She will advise Walgreens on its search for a permanent CEO, the company said; Walgreens is paying her $9 million in severance, plus $2.25 million in consulting fees for the next six months, according to a securities filing Friday.)Pharma industry veteran and Walgreens independent director Ginger Graham will serve as acting CEO until Walgreens names a permanent replacement.The sudden departure is a stunning move for Brewer, a well-respected retail operator who was previously chief operating officer at Starbucks and CEO of Walmart’s Sam’s Club. She arrived at Walgreens in March 2021, just as the struggling pharmacy chain and its competitors were navigating the messy rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. “I couldn’t think of anything else more important than keeping people healthy. I would not have done this for any other company except for WBA, quite honestly,” Brewer told my former colleague Beth Kowitt in October 2021.Story continuesHer departure also raises questions about Walgreens’s ability to pull off the ambitious pivot towards health care that Brewer had announced six months after becoming Walgreens CEO. Like larger rival CVS, Walgreens under Brewer has been buying up primary-care clinics and trying to turn itself into a full-service health care provider. But a transformation of that magnitude takes time, and it appears to be going more slowly than both Walgreens and its investors would like: In June, the company cut its full-year earnings guidance, while executives acknowledged that they were “disappointed with the pace of our path to profitability” in its health care business.It's also unclear how much support Brewer’s health care strategy had from Walgreens executive chairman (and former CEO and largest shareholder) Stefano Pessina. The Wall Street Journal in January reported that Pessina envisioned a slower expansion into health care, one that was “best achieved through partnerships and minority stakes,"" and that he said that ""buying up companies outside of the core pharmacy industry unnecessarily exposed Walgreens to risk.” Spokespeople for Walgreens and Brewer did not respond to requests for comment over the weekend.As she announced her departure on Friday, Brewer stood by her health care efforts. “Perhaps what I’m most proud of is our work to develop a strategic pivot towards the growth of WBA into health care,” she wrote to employees. “I’m proud of what we have done together. So let me take a moment to say thank you, because your hard work and leadership has been—and will continue to be—critical to the transformation of WBA.”Maria Aspanmaria.aspan@fortune.com@mariaaspanThe Broadsheet is Fortune's newsletter for and about the world's most powerful women.

(Jim Cooke / Los Angeles Times; photos via Getty Images)Sharri Shaw walked out of the CVS on Vermont Avenue in South Los Angeles in 2019 believing she had a prescription for the pain reliever acetaminophen.Instead the bottle held a medicine to treat high blood pressure, a problem she did not have.Shaw began taking the pills, not learning of the mistake until six days later when a CVS employee arrived at her home, according to a lawsuit she filed last year. The employee told her not to take the tablets, the lawsuit said, before leaving the correct prescription at her door. The mistake, she said, left her stunned.Shaw's experience is far from an isolated event. California pharmacies make an estimated 5 million errors every year, according to the state’s Board of Pharmacy.Officials at the regulatory board say they can only estimate the number of errors because pharmacies are not required to report them.Most of the mistakes that California officials have discovered, according to citations issued by the board and reviewed by The Times, occurred at chain pharmacies such as CVS and Walgreens, where a pharmacist may fill hundreds of prescriptions during a shift, while juggling other tasks such as giving vaccinations, calling doctors’ offices to confirm prescriptions and working the drive-through.Christopher Adkins, a pharmacist who worked at CVS, and then at Vons pharmacies until March, said that management policies at the big chains have resulted in understaffed stores and overworked staff.“At this point it’s completely unsafe,” he said.Adkins now works at an independent pharmacy company in Los Angeles. He isn’t the only pharmacist worried that heavy workloads and distractions are leading to errors.In a survey of California licensed pharmacists in 2021, 91% of those working at chain pharmacies said staffing wasn’t high enough to provide patients adequate care.Although the board requires pharmacies to document errors internally, inform patients about mistakes in certain cases and learn how to prevent them from occurring again, only 62% of chain pharmacists said stores were following those rules, according to the survey.Story continuesRead more: Picking up a prescription? 6 tips to avoid dangerous pharmacy errorsMistakes with deadly consequencesMedication errors can harm patients, sometimes seriously.One patient took prednisone, a powerful steroid, for 89 days after a Walgreens pharmacist in Santa Clara confused the drug with Prilosec, the heartburn drug that had actually been prescribed, according to a citation issued in June 2022. Research has shown that prednisone can decrease bone density within weeks of starting the drug, increasing the risk of fractures.In Inglewood, a pregnant patient suffered a fall after she was given two drugs prescribed to another customer by a pharmacist at the CVS on Market Street, according to an August 2021 citation.At a Rite Aid in Bakersfield, a pharmacist typed the wrong instructions on a prescription for anastrozole, a hormonal treatment for breast cancer. The pharmacist told the patient to take half a tablet twice a day rather than twice a week as the doctor had prescribed. The patient took the drug according to the incorrect instructions for several days, according to a January 2023 citation, suffering “adverse effects.”Some patients have continued to take and refill the prescriptions without knowing they received the wrong drug. A pharmacist in Adelanto at the CVS on Palmdale Road gave a patient another customer’s prescription for 50-milligram tablets of Zoloft, the antidepressant, according to a February citation. The person took the wrong drug for at least seven months, refilling the prescription three times.The pharmacy board says it investigates any report of an error that it receives from consumers or others. If the investigation finds that regulations were violated, the board can issue citations and fines and possibly take away the pharmacist's or pharmacy's state license.Read more: 7 key questions about worsening drug shortages, answeredCVS and Walgreens declined to make executives available for interviews but sent statements saying that the errors were rare. Rite Aid did not respond to messages.“Patient safety is our highest priority,” CVS said in its statement. “When we learn of a prescription error, the first priority of our pharmacy teams is caring for the patient, taking steps to correct the error, working with the patient and the prescriber.”CVS said it does not comment on litigation.Walgreens said it has “a multi-step prescription filling process with numerous safety checks to minimize the chance of human error.""“When errors do occur, we also have a robust mandatory reporting system in place that allows us to quickly identify root causes and to implement process improvements to prevent future errors,” Walgreens said.Vons said in a statement that the company makes sure pharmacies are appropriately staffed. ""We also regularly review the workflow in our pharmacies to identify ways to streamline and automate non-patient facing tasks so that our pharmacy teams can dedicate more time to serving our customers,"" the company said.Some errors have been deadly. More than 10% of malpractice claims against pharmacists were for injuries that resulted in death, according to a 2019 report by two insurance providers.The leading cause of death was from overdoses, in which patients were given dosage strengths that were too high or incorrect instructions that multiplied the amount of medicine the patient received.As many as 9,000 Americans die each year from prescription errors, according to one study.Read more: Drug to prevent preterm birth pulled from market, years after it was shown ineffective'Virtual verification'The chain pharmacies told The Times they are using technology to give pharmacists more time to keep patients safe.Walgreens said, for example, it uses “micro-fulfillment,” in which prescriptions are filled by robots at regional centers.One method of automation used by CVS is mentioned in at least seven citations by the pharmacy board since July 2022. The technique, called “virtual verification,” allows a pharmacist to sign off on a prescription without seeing what pills are put in the bottle.Instead a lower-paid technician, hired to help the pharmacist, finds the drug to fill the prescription, counts the pills and then snaps a photo just before putting the tablets in the bottle and stapling the bag shut. The pharmacist approves the prescription based on the photo rather than actually observing the pills.According to a June 2022 citation, one patient received a bottle of Valtrex, which treats viral infections, rather than the prescribed Keflex, which treats bacterial illnesses, from the CVS on Lankershim Boulevard in North Hollywood.“Pharmacist verification based on the photograph … obstructs the pharmacist’s ability to verify the prescription,” the regulators wrote on the citation, which imposed a $5,000 fine.Since those citations were issued for errors, the board agreed to withdraw the part of its findings related to virtual verification at five pharmacies after meeting with CVS executives, according to a letter the board sent to the company. The executives told board officials that they had improved the process, including by making it easier for pharmacists to see the pills in the photographs. The board said it ""remains concerned"" that relying on photos could increase errors, the letter said. CVS told the board it has not seen an increase.Read more: Alzheimer's drug trials target older Californians. Do they understand what they're signing up for?The fight for more accountabilityRarely does the public learn of the mistakes. Not only does the state not require the reporting of errors, but the big pharmacy companies often ask consumers to sign agreements demanding that they take any dispute not to court but to private arbitration panels.Patients typically agree to arbitration when they are asked to click a box to accept the company’s terms and conditions when they pick up a prescription.“You agree that CVS and you each waive the right to trial by a jury,” states the CVS agreement.To begin understanding the frequency of the mistakes, the pharmacy board sponsored a bill that would require pharmacies to report every error — not publicly but to a third party outside the government. The bill would also give the pharmacist responsible for the store the ability to increase staffing if they believe the workload has become too heavy to keep patients safe.The legislation is opposed by the California Community Pharmacy Coalition, a lobbying group representing retail pharmacies, including the big chains. The coalition has told legislators that the pharmacy staffing requirements are too rigid and that it does not want the pharmacy board to have access to the error reports, among other objections with the bill. The coalition did not respond to a request for comment.Language in the bill being debated in Sacramento states that the board would not get access to the reports — and neither would the public. Instead the reports would be kept confidential. The third-party group receiving the error reports would periodically provide information to the pharmacy board, including how many mistakes have been reported.The pharmacy board said it hopes to use the information to learn more about what is causing the errors and what can be done to reduce them. The bill would allow the board to publish de-identified information compiled from the data in the reports.Read more: Science hasn't shown these medications work. They're being sold anywayThe bill, AB 1286, authored by Assemblymember Matt Haney, a San Francisco Democrat, has passed the Assembly and is now before the state Senate.""Shockingly, there's no centralized reporting mechanism for medication errors,"" Haney said in an interview. ""There should be transparency, and the Board of Pharmacy should have the authority to respond to protect patients. That's not happening right now.""Two years ago, the state Legislature passed a bill that banned chain pharmacies from setting quotas for pharmacists on the numbers of prescriptions filled, vaccines given or other activities during a shift. The law’s goal was to make the chain pharmacies safer.In the 2021 survey, taken before that bill passed, 73% of chain pharmacists said their employer monitored the number of prescriptions filled and 62% said the company monitored the average time it took them to fill a prescription.Despite the new law, some chain pharmacies have continued to require pharmacists to meet quotas, according to citations issued by the board. Since January 2022, at least five pharmacies have been cited for asking pharmacists to meet quotas.CVS set quotas and measured pharmacists on the number of vaccinations they gave each week, according to a March citation issued to the company's pharmacy in Ripon, a town in the Central Valley. The citation included a $10,000 fine.CVS declined to answer questions about the citation. It said it did not set quotas for pharmacists or pharmacy technicians.A pharmacy board inspection at a Walgreens in Citrus Heights in August of last year found that the store had set quotas for pharmacists on the number of COVID-19 tests dispensed and vaccinations given.The quota was “expressly encouraged by Walgreens corporate ownership,” the citation said. The pharmacy was fined $50,000, and an additional $5,000 for the inspectors’ finding that a pharmacist had dispensed a prescription of atenolol, a blood pressure medicine, without consulting with the customer about how to safely take it. That consultation is required by state law if the drug hasn’t been given to the patient previously.Walgreens said it disagreed with the citation and was challenging it. “Walgreens does not utilize quotas for pharmacists or pharmacy technicians,” the company said, “and was in compliance with the new law before it went into effect.”In a nationwide move last fall, Walgreens announced that it would no longer evaluate its pharmacy staff on any task-based metrics.Adkins, the former chain pharmacist, said that when he began working at CVS pharmacies in the Bay Area in 2020, he accidentally gave a customer another patient’s prescription.He said he was the only person in the pharmacy at the time.“I was having to go back and forth between the register and filling prescriptions and answering the phones, and one patient came in to pick up a medication, which wasn't ready because I was behind,” Adkins said. “So I had to go get it ready really quickly.”He gave the customer her prescription and realized after she left that he had made a mistake.Adkins said he quickly called the customer, finding she was still in the parking lot. Although the patient ultimately received the correct prescription, he said, she was angry at the dangerous mistake.“It was my fault,” Adkins said. He said he believes it would not have happened if he'd had staff to help him.“The public does not realize what’s going on behind the counter,” he said.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

Finance Chief Gerald Laderman at the TD Cowen Transportation Conference said the first order of business is the expansion of the flight training center in Denver.Southwest said it continues to forecast a ""solid (third-quarter) profit"", but trimmed its expectations for revenue per available seat mile - a proxy for pricing power - to a 5% to 7% fall, compared with a 3% to 7% fall forecast earlier.Alaska Air expects a quarterly adjusted pre-tax margin of 10% to 12%, lower than its prior expectation of 14% to 16%.U.S. airlines do not generally hedge against fuel costs, making them vulnerable to price swings.""The relatively quick up move in fuel has given the industry little time to respond through fares,"" Citi Research analyst Stephen Trent said in a note.

So we're looking at United under pressure here.Allie, this is nothing new when it comes to the airline industry, right? We all remember what happened to Southwest back around the holiday season when they were forced to ground flights. They weren't able to get those flights off of the ground because of some of their own tech issues here. But it speaks to one outdated system that these airlines are working on.But that's also not the only story that's going on with airlines today. We were just talking about the jump that we've seen in crude prices, clearly that is also a headwind, a challenge here for the sector going forward.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah. It feels like airlines can't really catch a break. You also have worker shortages that include the pilot shortage. You mentioned that Southwest meltdown back in December. Clearly that was scarring to a lot of consumers.And it made me think about how when anything goes wrong in an airline, you see it online. You see it on social media. People have their phones out. And it adds to this pessimistic outlook when we think about the future of travel.That being said, consumers are still traveling. It makes me wonder what could happen for the holiday season and whether or not these airlines are able to handle that demand both on the tech side, on the worker side, and then as you were mentioning, with fuel prices as well. So a lot of questions there, but you're seeing the sector down across the board right now.]"

But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.HCA Healthcare (HCA) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this hospital operator a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for HCA is 18.3%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 18342% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 781.9%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Story continuesRight now, HCA has an S/TA ratio of 1.18, which means that the company gets $1.18 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.93, it can be said that the company is more efficient.While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And HCA looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 6.1% this year versus the industry average of 5.9%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for HCA have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.1% over the past month.Bottom LineHCA has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions HCA well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about HCA Healthcare (HCA).HCA currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.40, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 20 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.40 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 20 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 15 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 75% and 10% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for HCABroker Rating Breakdown Chart for HCACheck price target &amp; stock forecast for HCA here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying HCA, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is HCA a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for HCA, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the past month to $18.44.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for HCA. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for HCA may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In its newest edition of The Weight of America's Boards, the firm measured the ""Average Director Weight"" (objective standard for assessing relative board strength) of America's largest publicly traded companies (based on revenue and market cap). Since 2011, the board of PPG (NYSE: PPG) has appeared on the study's top-ten list seven times and has ranked #1 twice, most recently in 2016. JDP LogoThis year, the study carefully evaluated the business acumen of every director serving on more than 600 public boards. A complete ranking of the corporations can be found in the full report:  The Weight of America's Boards (2023)Top-10 Corporations with the Highest Average Director Weight:PPG IndustriesTeradyneInternational PaperWaste ManagementElevance Health (Formerly Anthem)Baker HughesRegions FinancialWalt DisneyUber TechnologiesYum! Brands""The Weight of America's Boards provides a thoughtful benchmark by which the integrity of a board's governance system can be measured,"" said the report's lead author, Jim Drury (CEO of JamesDruryPartners). ""It is an honor to provide the unique insights contained in the study. For more than a decade, boards have used its findings to facilitate boardroom discussion, and we anticipate that the actionable insights in this edition will help them to further strengthen their governance capacity.""Other Key Findings: 47% of the 6,525 board seats analyzed in the report were held by gender and/or ethnically diverse directors. Female directors make up nearly a third of today's public boards, which outpaces their presence in the C-suite by almost 7%. According to the report, 32.7% of board directors are female, compared to a recent McKinsey/LeanIn.org study which indicated 26% of C-level executives to be women. In addition, board seats held by non-white directors were shown to have more than doubled since 2011, the first year The Weight of America's Boards was published.Story continuesCurrent Challenges: Geopolitical and macroeconomic instability, increased regulatory oversight, ESG compliance, rapid technological advancement, cyber risk, and a complex global business environment are among the leading issues corporate boards are facing today. In addition, public skepticism towards corporate boards and unfounded criticism from shareholder activists continues to grow.Concerning Trends: For the first time in the history of the study, Average Director Weight declined among the boards examined. ADW fell 3.5% since the last report was issued, an indicator of decreased business acumen in corporate boardrooms. The number of active CEOs serving on outside boards continued to trend downward, driving this alarming decline. The report also noted that, of the 6,525 board seats analyzed, only 100 seats were filled by outside active CFOs. Together, these trends indicate that some boards are lacking the financial and business leadership expertise needed to deal with the complex, ever-evolving challenges facing boards today. CEO Drury attests, ""We are more convinced than ever that strong governance capacity is the high-octane fuel in a corporation's engine. It is the able leadership of the board Chairperson and committee heads that catalyzes this precious fuel in a manner that fosters governance strength, quality, and effectiveness.""About JamesDruryPartners (www.jdrurypartners.com) – Following an earlier career in management consulting and executive search, Jim Drury founded JamesDruryPartners to advise boards in the selection of new CEOs and board directors. While advising some of the highest profile companies in the U.S., he soon recognized that boards were experiencing a ""brain drain"" as CEOs began to reduce their outside board commitments. The firm expanded its offerings as a result, developing new services focused on maintaining the strength of corporate boards. In addition to director recruitment, the firm launched its most innovative service, BoardSelect®: optimizing the matching process of America's top executives with the boards that could most benefit from their service, while also providing a governance experience most beneficial to the companies they lead.Governance Study CoverCisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-study-on-corporate-governance-americas-largest-public-companies-ranked-by-board-strength--fewer-active-ceos-serving-on-boards-share-of-board-seats-held-by-women-and-minorities-increases-301915365.htmlSOURCE James Drury Partners]"

Who better to ask what will happen to the consumer than Goldman Sachs Chief Economist Jan Hatzius. Jan, thanks for taking some time. Very busy tech conference here. And you are out of the chute with two big notes here today, first, lowering your recession odds to 15% from 20%. Why now with that move?JAN HATZIUS: Basically because of continued improvement in the indicators of rebalancing. So the economy has continued to be pretty resilient. We're growing at 2% plus. We think that's going to be true in 2024 as well. Income growth looks supportive. Job growth is still pretty significant.And at the same time, the labor market has gotten more rebalanced. Job openings have come down. Quits have come down. Wage growth decelerated. You saw that in Friday's numbers in the employment report. And inflation has come down. So I think there's increased evidence that we can see rebalancing of the economy, inflation coming under control. And it's not going to require a recession.Story continuesSo we've progressively reduced our recession probability. We added in the 30%, 35% range around March when you had the financial turbulence and the banking turbulence. Always thought that it was less likely than 50%. But I've gotten incrementally more confident that recession can be avoided.BRIAN SOZZI: Does this quantify as a soft landing for the economy?JAN HATZIUS: Yes. In fact, the note that I published yesterday, I titled it soft landing summer, because the evidence that has accumulated, especially over the last few months, is very much consistent with soft landing.BRIAN SOZZI: A lot of folks that have been reading this note and consuming it on the Yahoo Finance platform seem to be asking this question, what's the impact of the Federal Reserve's rate hikes? Doesn't that hurt growth at some point?JAN HATZIUS: Well, I think it has hurt growth. They've hiked the funds rate by 525 basis points. That did reduce growth in the past year, we think, to the tune of, you know, as much as 1 and 1/2 to 2 percentage points in the second half of last year. But the lags of monetary policy according to our analysis are relatively short. And the biggest impact of these rate increases now is behind us.And we can see that, for example, in our financial conditions index, which actually has been easing on net since the October of last year. That's almost a year of net easing. So if financial conditions are easing, it's sort of hard to say that monetary policy is having a large negative impact on growth right this minute. We think it's diminishing. And we think the impact is going to continue to diminish, assuming that we're now either at the end of the rate hikes or almost at the end of the rate hikes. And we think we're actually at the end of the rate.BRIAN SOZZI: So you-- so you're not in the-- are you in the camp where no more rate hikes at the Fed next Fed meeting, they're done for this cycle?JAN HATZIUS: Next Fed meeting in a couple of weeks, highly unlikely that they hike. I think that's already been pretty clearly signaled. Beyond that, I think it's possible that you get another hike, but it's not our expectation.BRIAN SOZZI: Would a part of that hike be a function of-- we're now seeing oil prices back to $90 a barrel. We're seeing food prices as a result pick back up in many places. How concerned are you about this disinflationary narrative becoming inflationary again next year?JAN HATZIUS: Well, I think headline inflation, of course, depends to a significant degree on what happens to commodity prices. So increases in commodity prices will be visible in terms of headline inflation. The real concern, though, from the Fed's perspective has been core inflation underlying inflation getting entrenched in the economy. And I think there the news flow has been very positive.It's been positive in terms of the core inflation indices. It's been positive in terms of the labor market rebalancing. It's been positive in terms of supply chain disruptions disappearing. So none of that is really being called into question by the commodity price rebound, although, of course, commodity prices matter for headline.BRIAN SOZZI: How tough will it be for the US economy to withstand the restart of student loan payments? And where do you fall in that debate?JAN HATZIUS: We do think that that's going to be, you know, a modest drag on growth in the fourth quarter or maybe in the first quarter. It's going to take tents off of the increase in real consumer spending. We do think that Q3, where we're estimating almost 3% quarter on quarter growth. And other estimates are even higher than that. That's probably going to be sort of a local high.Fourth quarter, we think is going to be lower than that, you know, maybe closer to 1% than to 2%. But I don't think it's going to be a long-lasting or deep slowdown. We think it's going to be, you know, in the end something that keeps us at a trend or slightly below trend pace. But in 2024, we expect a re acceleration to about 2.BRIAN SOZZI: The other note you wrote, you wrote that US consumers will likely outperform in 2024. And I think that might be the contrarian view on the street, depending on who you talk to. Why are you so confident in the consumer here? We have seen a lot of retailers, Macy's, you name it, warn about rising delinquencies, and people not being able to pay their bills.JAN HATZIUS: I mean, at a macro level, if there was only one indicator that I could know regarding the consumer, it would be real disposable household income. And that has been growing at a 4% pace in 2023. We think 2024 is going to be a little weaker. But we're still expecting about 3% real disposable household income growth.If that's right or even if that's anywhere close to right, then it's very difficult to see declines in real consumer spending. And in fact, we're expecting continued moderate growth. Now that's at the most macro level. Of course, you can drill down into the different income groups, the different types of households, the demographics. And I would agree that probably a bit more of that growth is going to be towards the top end of the income distribution.And the bottom end of the income distribution, I would expect to be somewhat softer. And I think that would be consistent also with some of the things that we've seen on delinquencies among lower income consumers. That said, we're still expecting income to grow for lower end consumers. We expect real wages to grow. And we don't think that there will be a large deterioration. But incrementally, it's probably going to be a little bit softer than in the macro or not.BRIAN SOZZI: Within your outlook for next year in terms of monthly job creation, are we still over 100,000 jobs created each month? And where do you see the unemployment rate going?JAN HATZIUS: In the next year, we still think 100,000 or a little bit more than 100,000. There is a deceleration in job growth. Job growth is normalizing from the really outsized rates that we saw coming out of the pandemic. But-- but, yeah, we think it's going to be a gentle decline. Again, this is going to, of course, depend on how the overall economy does, what happens to GDP. If GDP grows 2% or so next year, then I think you can be pretty confident that we'll also continue to create a decent number of jobs 100,000, 125,000, 150,000.And I think there are good reasons, including the income point I just made to expect that that growth is still reasonable. In terms of unemployment rate, we're expecting more of the same, meaning about 3.5%. We're 3.6% for the end of next year. We saw a 0.3 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate in August in Friday's employment report. However, that was entirely driven by an increase in labor supply. So it's not a concern.I normally, if you'd asked me, if you saw a 0.3 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate, I might say it's a little concerning. But if you dig into the details and look at layoffs still very low, but increases in the labor supply, that is something that is I think reassuring. So no real change. We've been in the sub 4% range for unemployment since early 2022. And we still expect to be there next.BRIAN SOZZI: Jan Hatzius, Chief Economist at Goldman Sachs, always great to get some time at this conference and always a pleasure to read your team's research, some of the best in the game.JAN HATZIUS: Thank you so much. Wonderful to be here.]"

Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal, Seana Smith, and Josh Schafer discuss the album, featuring songs from pop stars Dua Lipa, Nicki Minaj, and Charlie XCX, as its popularity has soared on this summer's trend of all things Barbie.Video TranscriptALEXANDRA CANAL: ""Barbie,"" the phenomenon that is ""Barbie,"" not only is the film outperforming, but their album is outperforming as well, debuting at number two on the Billboard 200, multiple singles. And I want to point out, too, that this was a global effort. There are global artists featured on this album. It was released through Warner Music so a holistic approach from Warner Brothers Discovery, which also produced the film.And I think TikTok, YouTube, that's been a big driver for the popularity of some of these songs, especially the newer ones like Dua Lipa's ""Dance the Night."" We also saw the resurgence of some older songs like Matchbox Twenty's ""Push."" And if you saw the movie, that was a scene that stuck with you. And that song was from the late '90s, so that making a resurgence as well. And I know that you did an experiment.JOSH SCHAFER: You guys have been hosting the show for the last hour and a half, I've been listening to the ""Barbie"" album.SEANA SMITH: It must be nice.JOSH SCHAFER: --doing a little market research.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: Didn't love it.SEANA SMITH: Shocker. I was going to say, someone's been questioning ""Barbie"" ever since--JOSH SCHAFER: The same person that hasn't seen the movie, didn't love the album. But the one thing--ALEXANDRA CANAL: [INAUDIBLE].JOSH SCHAFER: Well, I like the Barbie girl song, the Nicki Minaj song. I think that one's good. I've heard that one on TikTok.ALEXANDRA CANAL: That's surprising.[INTERPOSING VOICES]JOSH SCHAFER: But I did you bring a trivia question, too, because I was curious about this. What do you guys think the most downloaded or I guess bought? Because it's going back to before we downloaded albums from a movie is, the most downloaded movie soundtrack, most purchased movie soundtrack. Any ideas?Story continuesALEXANDRA CANAL: I have no idea. I know like ""Armageddon"" makes me think of--SEANA SMITH: ""Armageddon"" is a good one.JOSH SCHAFER: Whitney Houston's ""The Bodyguard."" Because do you know what song was the headline of that?SEANA SMITH: One that got 45 million copies that were sold.JOSH SCHAFER: ""I will Always Love You,"" Whitney Houston sings in that movie. But it did sort of remind me of what I like more about some movie soundtracks, which is when you have a very talented musical person, it makes for a really fun soundtrack, because you get a bunch of originals out of it. Think like ""A Star is Born"" with Lady Gaga. I really like that soundtrack more. That was the thing I didn't love about the ""Barbie"" soundtrack. There's a Ryan Gosling song on there, but it's not that good.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, but--JOSH SCHAFER: Like the actors weren't singers. So it's fun when the actors--SEANA SMITH: Ryan Gosling was a singer when he was younger.JOSH SCHAFER: He's not-- he's not Lady Gaga. He's not Lady Gaga.ALEXANDRA CANAL: No, but he was cute and funny. And that was the whole point of the movie, being cute.JOSH SCHAFER: Well, I haven't seen the movie. So I'm basing it off not seeing the movie.SEANA SMITH: But I think it also just speaks right to the fact that movies here can just play such a massive impact on the music industry in terms of sales, in terms of resurrecting some of those older songs, like you just said with Matchbox Twenty, and really even finding new stars. We've seen that happen time and time again with releases that have happened in the past and what that could mean for artists going forward.I have also not seen the movie yet. But I've heard a lot of these songs. A lot of them I've discovered via TikTok. So here we are in 2023 with the massive success, obviously, of TikTok. So many people finding these trends on that. And I think that also just unlocks future gains here for the music industry and movie tie-ups.JOSH SCHAFER: It gets to the music trend that we've talked about a lot, right, with the fact that you hear it now on TikTok. You and I both haven't even seen the movie, and I knew half the songs because I like, I could see them on TikTok. Right.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Right.

Yahoo Finance Entertainment Reporter Alexandra Canal details the summer box office revenue after the premieres of the Barbie movie and Oppenheimer, while also commenting on Disney's (DIS) push to have streaming customers subscribe to Hulu's live-TV package.Video Transcript- Denzel Washington has made a return to the top spot at the box office this holiday weekend with the third installment of Equalizer, which is expected to wrap up the four day weekend at $42 million. That's according to Comscore. Now Barbie took the second spot with Blue Beetle, Gran Turismo, and Oppenheimer rounding out the top five. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal joins us now with the details. Hey, Allie.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Hi, Rachelle. Yes. A solid Labor Day weekend at the box office, thanks in large part to the Equalizer 3. And Labor Day weekend, it hasn't historically been a holiday that draws people out to the theater. But this year seems to be a noteworthy exception. The film made $34.5 million in its opening weekend. And as you mentioned, is estimated to pull in 42 million over the four-day holiday weekend.And if we compare that to years past, that makes this year the second highest Labor Day weekend ever behind 2021. And remember, in 2021, we saw the debut of Marvel's Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, which pulled in just under $100 million in that opening two years ago. So still a very strong start here, especially considering we don't have a Marvel film to save the box office this time around.And it's interesting to see the different types of movies that are outperforming at the box office this year. Obviously, The Equalizer. Huge star attached to that with Denzel Washington. An action movie. Typically, those are the movies that do well at the theater. However, this year, we're seeing different types of films emerge, like Barbie starring Margot Robbie. That was a huge success this summer. In fact, as the summer comes to a close the box office revenue hit $4 billion for the first time since the pandemic. So that's a huge win moving forward.Story continuesI will say there are certainly risks heading into the back half of this year. For example, Warner Brothers' Dune 2. That was pushed from November of this year to March of next year. And that was one of the most anticipated films of the fall. And the fact that we don't have that much content heading in to the back half of 2023 is concerning, especially amid these ongoing strikes in Hollywood. Dune 2 was pushed because of the strikes, and we could see potentially more reshuffling of the box office calendar as we head into the end of the year.So a lot to keep track of here, and certainly, the strikes are going to continue to have an impact. But so far at the box office, we're still seeing people come out to the theater, which is encouraging.- It's true. And even with a big name. I mean, look at Indiana Jones, that didn't do well. So I mean, it's kind of hit and miss for some of these as well. I also want to shift gears and look at the streaming space. Disney making a move to push users to subscribe to Hulu and its live TV offerings. What can you tell us there? That does seem like a like a reversal of fortunes here.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah. So this follows the dispute that we saw late last week with Charter Communications, which is the parent company of Spectrum and Disney. If you remember last week, we had a lot of angry sports fans who were unable to watch the US Open, unable to watch college football. After Disney and Charter failed to reach an agreement, Disney then pulled all of its owned and operated channels from subscribers of Charter. So you weren't able to watch ABC, ESPN, even the Disney Channel. So that was very disappointing to those users.But now, Disney has an interesting tactic this morning, saying, if you're a subscriber to Charter and you're disappointed with all these blackouts, why don't you go and subscribe to Hulu Plus Live TV? So that's an interesting move to try and pump your own streaming offerings there. But we've heard from a lot of analysts that say Charter might be OK at the end of the day with this if a dispute is not resolved. However, this could have larger implications to the larger media space considering companies like Disney, Warner Brothers, Discovery, Paramount Global, they depend very heavily on the cash flow from linear networks.So if this sets a precedent moving forward, that could be devastating down the line. So this is something we're continuing to track and watch very closely since this feud, it's still ongoing at the moment.- We'll certainly be keeping track of that. It certainly does put front of mind all the streaming services available and just how much we're spending on them and then the streaming live TV options. It's a lot for us to have to deal with at the moment. But I know you'll keep us up to speed on all of it. Thank you so much, our very own Allie Canal.]"

(TSX-V: LBNK) (OTCQX: LBNKF) (“LithiumBank'' or the “Company”) is pleased to announce it has engaged SLB (NYSE: SLB) (formerly Schlumberger Limited) a global technology company, to provide detailed reservoir modelling for an upcoming resource estimation and preliminary economic assessment that the Company anticipates completing at the Park Place lithium brine project in west-central Alberta (Figure 1) (the ""Park Place Project""). The Park Place Project is located approximately 50 kilometres south of the Company’s Boardwalk Project (for which a preliminary economic assessment was recently completed). Results of SLB’s modelling work are expected in 90 days.SLB provides technology solutions along with subsurface engineering services across Alberta and around the globe. Its subsurface engineering interpretation tools and understanding of fluid behaviours, under various circumstances within the reservoir, are expected to help discern optimal operational techniques to maximize production while achieving sustainability benefits through direct lithium extraction (DLE) on the Company’s production chain lifecycle.LithiumBank has engaged SLB to conduct detailed subsurface reservoir modelling of the Leduc and Swan Hills Formations at the Park Place Project. This work will complement the hydrogeological study previously completed by Matrix (News Release Feb. 27, 2023). SLB’s study will involve reservoir characterization, such as facies modelling, porosity and permeability modelling, and interpretation of 57 kilometres of seismic lines that were not included in the earlier study. Detailed reservoir modelling from this study is expected to provide a higher level of confidence in future engineering and production designs as well as support for an upcoming resource estimation that the Company has targeted to complete. The study will target a 3,255 km2 area of interest (“AOI”) (Figure 2), that is considered to be the most favourable AOI in the Park Place Project in terms of formation thickness, porosity, depth to formation, and location and has been prioritized for development. This work is expected to be the foundation of an upcoming resource estimation followed by a preliminary economic assessment expected to be completed by the Company.Story continues“We are very pleased to work with SLB on the Park Place lithium-brine project. SLB will leverage its decades of experience in the region and history of technological innovation to characterize the potential of the project,” commented Rob Shewchuk, CEO and Director of LithiumBank.Park Place Project has reported as the largest lithium-rich brine project, by volume, in North America held by a single operator (News Release Feb. 27, 2023) with 76.3 km3 (76.3 B m3) of lithium-bearing brine, 49.8 km3 within the Leduc Formation and 26.5 km3 within the Swan Hills Formation at a 3% porosity cut-off. Brine samples collected in December 2022 from the Leduc Fm, reported an average of 77.2 mg/L lithium (News Release Jan. 17, 2023). The Leduc Fm measures up to 350 metres in thickness (Figure 2) &amp; Swan Hills Fm up to 250 metres thick. The thicker zones (over 200 metres) in the Leduc Formation are correlated with higher porosity and are in locations that logistically are ideal for potential production hubs.The scientific and technical disclosure in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Mr. Kevin Piepgrass (Chief Operations Officer, LithiumBank Resources Corp.), who is a Member of the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta (APEGA) and the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of the Province of British Columbia (APEGBC) and is a Qualified Person (QP) for the purposes of National Instrument 43-101.

The stock returned 13.2%, which compared favorably with the 3.8% rally of the industry it belongs to and the 5.8% rise of the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 earnings of $4.74 indicates growth of 39% from that reported a year ago. Moreover, earnings are expected to register 28.9% growth in 2024. APTV has a long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 18.2%.Aptiv PLC Price Aptiv PLC price | Aptiv PLC QuoteFactors That Augur WellAptiv is exposed to the lucrative connected cars market. With security becoming a key selling point for connected cars, automakers are increasingly seeking related technologies. This is one of the reasons behind the quick advancement of the driver-assistance system market. Demand for personalization, infotainment connectivity and convenience are increasing rapidly. Added features require more wiring inside vehicles.We believe that with excellent system integration expertise, Aptiv is well-positioned to leverage the growing electrification, connectivity and autonomy trends in the automotive sector.The company’s ""smart architecture"" provides a competitive advantage and should help it continue gaining market share. Decreasing environmental impact and increasing fuel economy are the key industry trends, and OEMs have increased their search for better engine management and lower power consumption. Aptiv intends to take advantage of this trend as its “smart architecture” reduces wiring requirements in cars, helping them become fuel-efficient and add features.The 2022 acquisition of Wind River expanded Aptiv’s position in the automotive software solutions market. Another 2022 acquisition, Intercable Automotive Solutions, strengthened the company’s position as a global leader in vehicle architecture systems. Aptiv intends to continue making investments aimed at organic and inorganic growth. Since it acquires a large number of companies on an ongoing basis, the integration of these companies generates cost synergies, which improve the efficiency of the combined company.Story continuesA RiskAptiv’s current ratio (a measure of liquidity) was at 1.76 at the end of second-quarter 2023, lower than the 2.63 recorded at the end of the prior-year quarter. A decreasing current ratio indicates that the company may have difficulty meeting its short-term obligations.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAptiv currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Here are two better-ranked stocks from the Business Services sector:DocuSign DOCU beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the four trailing quarters and has an earnings surprise of 25.6%.

That’s because once the sector gets going, it’s gargantuan. In fact, jump aboard the right self-driving stock opportunities and you can ride your portfolio to possibly life-changing gains.According to Mordor Intelligence, the autonomous vehicle market size may reach $33.48 billion this year. Even better, experts in the field project that the sector could expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.75% from 2023 to 2028. By the culmination of the forecast period, the future of driving stocks may have a valuation print worth $93.31 billion.And that might be on the conservative side. For example, McKinsey &amp; Company reports that by 2035, autonomous driving may create $300 billion to $400 billion in revenue. By positioning yourself in must-buy self-driving stocks, you may accrue mind-blowing returns.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNaturally, you do want to take precautions as innovative sectors almost always carry high risks. Still, if you’re willing to absorb them, these are the top autonomous vehicle stocks to consider.Autonomous Driving Stock Picks: Aptiv (APTV)An Aptiv (APTV) office building in Poland.Source: shutterstock.comA global technology firm focused on automotive innovation, Aptiv (NYSE:APTV) may not be the most obvious choice for autonomous driving stock picks. However, it fits the bill quite nicely if you’re looking for an up-and-comer with strong upside potential. Established as an independent entity in December 2017, its origins trace back to Delphi Automotive and General Motors (NYSE:GM). So, it’s not a pure startup per say because of the distinct rebranding history.Still, APTV belongs on your radar of less-appreciated but still potent must-buy self-driving stocks. Regarding autonomous mobility, Aptiv creates and refines the underlying software, sensors and computing platforms that fuel this innovation. Even better, the company has partnered with Hyundai Motor Group to bring autonomy to the next level.Story continuesFinancially, Aptiv is a bit of a mixed bag. However, what’s intriguing is its trailing-year operating margin of 9.16%, beating out 75.45% of its peers. Also, analysts dig APTV, pegging it a moderate buy. Further, their price target lands at $130.10, implying over 29% upside potential.Aurora Innovation (AUR)A young woman reads a book while behind the wheel of a self-driving car.Source: ShutterstockFounded in 2017, Aurora Innovation (NASDAQ:AUR) is a compelling idea among autonomous driving stock picks. Encouragingly, Aurora commands an enviable pedigree. Co-founded by Chris Urmson, the tech expert previously led Google’s – under the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) umbrella – self-driving car project, which eventually became Waymo. Since the start of this year, AUR gained an impressive 181%. Still, there could be more gains to be had.Aurora’s main product is Aurora Driver, a self-driving system with a common core of hardware and software designed to adapt to a wide range of vehicle types, per its website. This versatility encompasses anything from a four-door sedan up to a Class 8 semitruck. Notably, the underlying system is durable, working against all kinds of inclement or unusual weather conditions. As well, its compact.Unsurprisingly, investors have targeted AUR as the future of driving stocks. Per Wall Street analysts, Aurora is a consensus moderate buy. Further, the experts’ price target clocks in at $5, implying over 53% upside potential.Aeva Technologies (AEVA)7 Autonomous Vehicle Stocks to Drive You to the FutureSource: ShutterstockFor those wanting to maximize the return potential of their top autonomous vehicle stocks, Aeva Technologies (NYSE:AEVA) belongs on your radar. Also founded in 2017, Aeva came to life thanks to Soroush Salehian and Mina Rezk, former Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) engineers. Primarily, the company specializes in lidar (light detection and ranging) innovation.What distinguishes the tech specialist from other self-driving stock opportunities is its 4D lidar technology, per its website. Management calls its system “4D” because it captures three spatial dimensions – length, width and height – along with a velocity dimension simultaneously. In other words, Aeva’s tech can detect roadway objects’ location and movement, enabling superior (and safer) decision-making.To be fair, AEVA trades at only a few cents above a buck. Also, since the Jan. opener, it lost almost 20% of equity value. Nevertheless, AEVA presents a compelling idea for autonomous driving stocks due to analyst support, which pegs it as a moderate buy. Further, the experts forecast AEVA to hit $2.41, implying 134% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Maybe, maybe not. But it's definitely something that is being discussed at Goldman Sachs' big annual tech conference Communicopia. Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi and Allie Garfinkle are at the conference talking to CEOs and executives who are attending. ""AI is everywhere in this conference,"" Sozzi says, but where there's talk of AI, there will usually be talk of Nvidia (NVDA). Garfinkle explains that it was standing room only at an event featuring a Nvidia vice president. She also says that Microsoft (MSFT) is ""everywhere,"" given that it has a role in everything from cybersecurity to the cloud.Click here for more of Yahoo Finance's coverage from the Goldman Sachs Communacopia tech conference.Video TranscriptBRIAN SOZZI: Yahoo Finance's at the biggest tech and media conference of the year. That is the Goldman Sachs Tech And Media Conference. And here I am with our very own Allie Garfinkle, who's been pounding the pavement all the conference scene and panels.And Allie, there's a lot of takeaways from a conference like this investors need to know about. For me, it is AI, it's going to crush jobs. I don't want to be the bearer of bad news. I get--ALEXANDRA GARFINKLE: So many CEOs here would disagree with you, so many of them.BRIAN SOZZI: I've been talking to a lot of executives. And Zoom CFO talking about how there's new features coming to the Zoom platform on AI. There's AI here. There's AI there. AI is everywhere in this conference. And I have to think that at some point, there is going to be massive job loss. That may not be tomorrow and maybe not the next day, may not even be next year. But if we were having this conversation a decade from today, I would venture to say a lot of this new AI technology is going to mean a couple few or just a few less humans sitting behind a cubicle.ALEXANDRA GARFINKLE: I will say, you know, for me, I am a little bit more optimistic than you are. But Sam Altman himself would actually agree with you. From my end, there is an AI tie-in, but it's actually way more enterprise than that. For me, right now, though Nvidia is the star, Microsoft is the giant.Story continuesNvidia's VP of enterprise computing had a full room. Everybody was there people were standing room only to see a VP of enterprise computing from Nvidia. Have you ever--BRIAN SOZZI: They're stars, no?ALEXANDRA GARFINKLE: They're stars. They're stars now. But the other thing, too, is except for that panel, every single other panel I've been in Microsoft has come up-- cyber security, cloud. It doesn't matter, all forms of computing, Microsoft is there. Microsoft even got a shout out in that Zoom panel, right, considering concerns about antitrust. Microsoft, let's not underestimate them. They really are everywhere.BRIAN SOZZI: They have the relationship with OpenAI. They are--ALEXANDRA GARFINKLE: With Netflix.BRIAN SOZZI: the Netflix.ALEXANDRA GARFINKLE: Netflix relationship, I didn't know that.BRIAN SOZZI: Their business is growing with teams in a significant way. Now you kind of really get sense from being at this conference why Microsoft stock has been an outperformer this year. But also, look at that room. Look at that packed room for Nvidia. And to your point, normally, an EVP of a company, first of all, is not even going to be allowed to show up at a conference. Like, let's just be-- let's just be real.ALEXANDRA GARFINKLE: A packed room, I have never seen it in my entire life, Brian. And I think it really speaks to the depth of excitement about AI and excitement about Nvidia specifically.BRIAN SOZZI: So you don't think AI is going to crush jobs?ALEXANDRA GARFINKLE: I think it will create different jobs. I think it will crush some jobs, and it will create others. It's not like one of these-- sounds like one of these--BRIAN SOZZI: But I'm not bringing you to the dark side.ALEXANDRA GARFINKLE: You're not bringing me to the dark side, no.BRIAN SOZZI: All right. We appreciate that. We appreciate your optimistic self. And that's it from the tech conference. Goldman Sachs Tech and Media Conference, lots of big top takeaways for investors all over the world.]"

Disney pulled its channels from Spectrum amid a carriage dispute between the two companies. Goldman Sachs Managing Director Brett Feldman says there are two reasons why this dispute is happening.First with the decline in cable subscribers is accelerating, falling about 6% to 7% this year. Feldman says that's interesting because, historically, media companies have been able to raise the prices of their channels by about 5% to 6% a year. ""We've hit this tipping point now where the media companies simply can't raise prices fast enough to offset the loss of paid TV subscribers,"" Feldman says, going on to say that it has ""emboldened"" cable companies to start discussing the possibility of a new model.The second thing is that the cable companies have reached the ""point of economic indifference,"" Feldman says. What that means is that given how much cord-cutting is happening, Charter is losing so much profitability in that business and ""basically what they're saying is we almost don't care anymore whether our customers decide to pay for a channel package or not,"" Feldman says, adding that they are primarily making their money by providing internet service.Click here for more of Yahoo Finance's coverage from the Goldman Sachs Communacopia tech conference.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]BRIAN SOZZI: Welcome back to ""Yahoo Finance Live."" We're still live at the Goldman Sachs Tech and Media Conference in San Francisco. And the other undercurrent at this conference is in fact all things happening in media. Lots of focus, of course, on AI. But that undercurrent is media and what might be happening next.And to that end, Brett Feldman is here, Goldman Sachs Managing Director covering telecom, cable, and media. Thanks for having us to your conference, Brett. We appreciate it.BRETT FELDMAN: We're so excited to have you here. This is one of the biggest events we do all year. We're going to have the senior leaders and CEOs from over 200 global TMT companies that really should be a great couple of days.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: No, it's already shaping up to be that way. And a lot of the chatter in the room is the situation between Charter and Disney. And my question to you is, why is this happening right now?BRETT FELDMAN: That's right. So just for your viewers, who I think probably know by this point in time, if you're a Charter customer, so if you have spectrum cable, you can't get any Disney channels right now. They've been removed from the service. And that includes ESPN.So you made a great point. We've been seeing the number of households that pay for cable and satellite TV bundles decline for years. Why are we now just getting to this point where the distributors, the cable companies are really pushing back? There's really two reasons why. The first is we're going to see the total number of households that pay for TV this year decline by about 6% to 7%. About two years ago, that was negative 5%. A couple of years before that, it was a much more moderate number. So this has been an accelerating pace of decline.The reason why 6% to 7% is interesting is that historically, the media companies, companies like Disney, have been able to raise the price of their channels by about 5% to 6% per year. So we've hit this tipping point now where the media companies simply can't raise prices fast enough to offset the loss of paid TV subscribers. I think that has emboldened the cable companies to look at this relationship and say, listen, we can't absorb these historical price increases. We need to talk about a new model. That's one of the things that Charter talked about.Another point Charter made is the point we actually started making about four years ago, which is that they've reached what they call a point of economic indifference. Basically, they're saying we almost don't care anymore, whether our customers decide to pay for a channel package or not, because they've lost so much profitability in that business as a result of cord cutting. They really make all their money now providing internet service.And so I think that you have the cable companies saying, we can't do this anymore. We were able to deal with it for a couple of years when we were losing a small number of customers. But as this snowball continues to roll down the hill, we have to come up with a new model.BRIAN SOZZI: At the end of the day, when this comes to an end, and it inevitably will, who is the biggest loser? And what does it mean to the broader media landscape?BRETT FELDMAN: It's a great question. And actually, we're going to be asking a version of that question to all these CEOs of the big media and cable companies when they're here this week. And really, the question we're going to be trying to get an answer to is, what's a win-win?If the model that we've had before, the relationship between the media companies, between the cable and satellite companies, and the relationship that they ultimately have with their viewers, if that's not working anymore, what is going to work? And are there other things that have to change? Maybe the way they price their streaming services in order to get something that works for everyone involved, including the consumer.BRIAN SOZZI: Do you agree-- I think it was last week, Barry Diller at IAC said the streaming companies, they're not your friends. They're your enemies is the ultimate problem here companies like a Netflix.BRETT FELDMAN: I think Charter has been trying to make that point. Their view is that the media companies have devalued their entertainment by moving on to streaming platforms. And they give examples of it. They say, historically, you've been able to capture some of that value through advertising. You're barely doing any advertising on your streaming platforms. It's a new thing, and you're not doing a lot of it.There's no security. It used to be that if you wanted to watch what was on cable TV, you had to pay for cable TV in your home. I think we all know that password sharing has become a big deal. Netflix has recently started cracking down on that, but not all of the media companies have. And just in general, I think that the distributors, the cable and satellite companies, they look at what they're being asked to pay to make that content available to their customers. And they look at the price that those same media companies are charging to make it available on a direct basis. They say these are not the same prices. There's got to be a way that we come up with a sustainable economic model we can all agree on.BRIAN SOZZI: Is there any appetite to own these media stocks, and what has to happen?BRETT FELDMAN: Well, I think there is, in part, because they've been under so much pressure. A stock that we have talked a lot about is Warner Brothers Discovery, David Zaslav, the CEO of Warner Brothers--BRIAN SOZZI: He will be here.BRETT FELDMAN: --will be here tomorrow. They are able to do something that some of the other media companies cannot, which is that they're still integrating a very large merger. They had acquired the Time Warner assets, the old Time Warner assets out of AT&amp;T about two years ago. And they quickly realized that there was a lot of inefficiency in how that business was run. And so they have an opportunity here to keep taking costs out of the business. And hopefully make the products better at the same time, so that they can generate cash, they can pay down debt, and ultimately do something that should be accretive to their shareholders by positioning the company to be a winner in the streaming wars.But to be fair, it's a highly debated sector, that's a highly debated stock.BRIAN SOZZI: Not lost on me, Brett, is last year, Bob Chapek was here, now former CEO of Disney. Disney CEO Bob Iger is not here. Of course, there's always scheduling conflicts, et cetera, et cetera. But to me, I think it says a lot that Disney is not at this premier conference. And it says a lot about the challenges they're going through. What has to happen to get investor appetite back into a stock that's about 52-week lows, despite the content power that is Disney?BRETT FELDMAN: Well, Disney has been here for a number of years. And so it would have been great if we could have made the scheduling work. But we'll hopefully, we'll have Bob Iger back.There's a few things they have to do. They have to demonstrate that they can continue to be on a path to profitability in streaming. So one of the nice inflections that we've seen since Bob Iger returned is that the losses they've been incurring in their streaming business have begun to compress very significantly. So proving that they can make money and then give some indication as to what those margins can be over time, I think that's really important.I think in their traditional media networks business, which is really revolves around ESPN, they have to show that they can transition ESPN from being a package of cable and satellite TV channels to being something that you can subscribe to on a direct basis, meaning something you could stream. A lot of people may say, well, hold on, can't you get ESPN Plus right now, you get that in your bundle with Disney Plus? It's not the same thing. It's a niche product they haven't put the full suite of sports rights that they have access to into that product.If they can do those two things, they will really be able to demonstrate that they have a strategy and a model for taking what is a very profitable, historically, very profitable media business, and turning it into a profitable streaming media business.BRIAN SOZZI: And Bob made a lot of headlines a couple of months ago, suggesting everything was on the table. What's the end game here for him? Is it a spinoff of ESPN? Is it a sale of those linear TV assets?BRETT FELDMAN: I don't think we know. I thought what was refreshing about those comments-- I think some people heard them as a little bit alarming. But I think that what was refreshing was to hear him acknowledge that everything is on the table.You know, if you go back a few years when cord-cutting wasn't quite as intense as it is right now. In some cases, you would hear media companies talk about this being manageable, taking a very long time, not likely to get any worse. I think investors were always very skeptical of that. To hear a leader in the industry like Bob Iger acknowledge that you have to put everything on the table right now, I think, shows how seriously they're taking this and is a real signal to the Street that they are going to do what they need to do, so that Disney can have another 100 years of success in the market.BRIAN SOZZI: Are investors waiting for that big move to get back into the stock? Do they want to see him pull the trigger on something mind-blowing?BRETT FELDMAN: I don't know if it's one thing. I think you have to look at this and say, as he's returned to the company, he has made the adjustments that are necessary to put the company on the path they need to be on, because what investors really want is they want to see a company that can execute its way to success. And if you're still debating what they're supposed to do, that can be an overhang on the stock. So the main thing is setting a strategy and then setting a strategy that the market thinks will work if you execute it.BRIAN SOZZI: Along the lines of Disney hit a 52-week low, I look at Paramount. You still rate the stock a sell, right? What has to happen to get investors excited about that name?BRETT FELDMAN: You know, Paramount faces a lot of the same issues that Disney faces a lot of the same issues that Warner Brothers Discovery faces. One of the things that they are very committed to is continuing to invest in their streaming platform. So whereas many of the other media companies have already moved past peak investment, meaning that they're getting closer to breaking even not farther away, this year Paramount will probably see their peak losses, meaning they're still leaning into the investment.To their credit, the service has been much more popular with viewers. And I think a lot of people guessed. And they've had some real hits. They've put the NFL on the platform. So I think they feel very good about the subscriber momentum, what they have to be able to demonstrate to investors is that they can not only pivot away from being an investment phase but accelerate towards making money in their streaming business, because they, just like everyone else, are going to see their legacy networks come under increasing pressure.BRIAN SOZZI: Brett Feldman, Goldman Sachs Managing Director covering telecom, cable, and media. Thank you for having us at your conference. This is one of our favorite ones by far.BRETT FELDMAN: Thanks for being here.]"

The company's Earnings Per Share (EPS) stand at 9.39, raising the question: Is Netflix fairly valued? In this article, we will conduct a thorough valuation analysis to answer this question. We invite you to read on for a comprehensive examination of Netflix's intrinsic value.Company OverviewWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with RMD. Click here to check it out. NFLX 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NFLXNetflix's primary business is a streaming video on demand service, now available in almost every country worldwide except China. The firm primarily generates revenue from subscriptions to its eponymous service. Netflix delivers original and third-party digital video content to a variety of digital platforms. As of now, Netflix is the largest SVOD platform in the world with over 220 million subscribers globally.With a current stock price of $452.18 per share and a market cap of $200.40 billion, we compare these figures with the GF Value, an estimation of fair value, to provide a comprehensive exploration of the company's value.Unveiling Netflix's Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page provides an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors:Historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at.GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth.Future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Story continuesAccording to GuruFocus Value calculation, the stock of Netflix is believed to be fairly valued. This implies that the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.Unveiling Netflix's Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with low financial strength could result in permanent capital loss. Hence, it is crucial to review a company's financial strength before deciding to buy shares. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage can give a good initial perspective on the company's financial strength. Netflix has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.51, which ranks worse than 62.81% of 1003 companies in the Media - Diversified industry. Based on this, GuruFocus ranks Netflix's financial strength as 7 out of 10, suggesting a fair balance sheet.Unveiling Netflix's Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies carries less risk, especially in companies that have demonstrated consistent profitability over the long term. Typically, a company with high profit margins offers better performance potential than a company with low profit margins. Netflix has been profitable 10 years over the past 10 years. During the past 12 months, the company had revenues of $32.10 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $9.39.

""I don't get a piece from Netflix on BREAKING BAD to be totally honest and that's insane to me."" #AMPTP pic.twitter.com/iqiz2yVy50— Todd Spence (@Todd_Spence) September 4, 2023The fact that one of the stars of arguably one of the biggest shows on television in the past decade (and certainly one of the buzziest) is not getting paid from its continued streaming raised questions about who, exactly, is benefiting from it financially.Ten years ago, Breaking Bad was the most popular show on Netflix and, while it has fallen out of the Top 10, per the company, it’s still incredibly popular with viewers. Ironically, Netflix can be credited, in part, with boosting the show’s overall popularity by bringing it on its streaming platform while the show was still airing on AMC, its original network.After the drama began airing, the show's popularity on AMC grew over time, the opposite of the falloff in viewers that shows typically experience. The season four finale attracted fewer than 2 million viewers. The series finale, two years later, had 10 million people watching.Story continues(In fairness, AMC would also run marathons of the show, which could have helped boost viewership as well.)While Paul took Netflix to task for the lack of payments, he and his Breaking Bad cast members did reunite recently to urge Hollywood studios to resume negotiations with striking actors. Warner Bros. Discovery, on Monday, adjusted its earnings forecast, saying it assumed the financial impact of the strikes will persist through at least the end of the year.Netflix, meanwhile, will stop streaming Breaking Bad in February 2025.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

UBS also managed to immediately cut the total headcount at the combined banks by 30%, or 35,000 employees. Now that the takeover has been completed, UBS Group emerges as one of the biggest banks in the world with $1.6 trillion in assets and 120,000 employees worldwide.

The company, which runs T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, beat Wall Street forecasts for its Q2 print across the board, and raised its forward guidance.Cash-strapped consumers who are grappling with higher prices continue to spend at TJX Companies’ stores even as they pullback on discretionary purchases at other retail outlets.

""We think 2024 is going to be a little weaker, but we're still expecting about 3% real disposable household income growth. If that's right, or even if that's anywhere close to right, then it's very difficult to see declines in real consumer spending.""Shoppers load a TV into their SUV at Best Buy during Black Friday sales in Chicago on Nov. 25, 2022. (REUTERS/Jim Vondruska) (Jim Vondruska / reuters)Hatzius' latest research sees the consumer outperforming next year amid further healthy gains in incomes.Incomes are expected to receive a ""boost"" from continued increases in monthly job creation and higher yields on interest-bearing assets such as CDs and savings accounts, according to Hatzius.Read more: How to find the best CD rates for September 2023Hatzius believes the unemployment rate will hold steady in 2024 at around 3.5%, and the economy will create 100,000 jobs a month on average.""The evidence that has accumulated, especially over the last few months is very much consistent with a soft [economic] landing,"" Hatzius added.Goldman Sachs has lowered its recession forecast as stronger-than-expected economic data has headlined 2023.The more upbeat read on the consumer arrives as the Fed's interest rate hikes ripple through the economy and begin to stunt spending power and weigh on household finances.Execs at electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY) called out rising credit card delinquencies on its earnings call last week.

The consumer's reaction to the return of student loan repayments this fall is also a wildcard.""We do think [student loan repayments are] going to be a modest drag on growth in the fourth quarter or maybe in the first quarter [of 2024],"" Hatzius said.

""We are hearing more 'normalized promotional levels.' Comparatively, it may not look that bad, even though it still will feel somewhat promotional.""Barbecue grills are offered for sale at a Home Depot store on March 24, 2015 in Chicago, Illinois. (Scott Olson/Getty Images) (Scott Olson via Getty Images)Groceries are driving consumers' purchasing decisions this weekendWhile featured deals vary from appliances to apparel to toys (with Walmart even offering a 10-foot kids' trampoline for a fraction of the cost), customers are looking to keep their purchases simple, starting with groceries at the top of the list.A recent survey of 518 individuals from Numerator found that over two-thirds of respondents (69%) plan to visit a grocery store to purchase items for Labor Day.This comes as the cost of food at home — what consumers see at their local supermarkets such as Kroger (KR), Albertsons (ACI), and others — increased slightly in July after remaining mostly flat in recent months.Story continuesOver a third of respondents plan to go to mass retailers like Walmart and Target too. Target seems to be playing into the grocery demand. At the top of its deal page, it features savings on its private-label ground beef and cans of Pepsi and Coca-Cola, among other barbecue fan favorites.Other consumers may be bulking up ahead of back-to-school at Sam's Club or Costco (COST), though Costco will be closed on the actual holiday. Overall, consumers aren't planning to do much Labor Day shopping online. Only 7% plan to go to online-only stores such as Amazon (AMZN) or eBay (EBAY) to shop this weekend.Feldman also said consumers are known to shop around holiday events like Mother's Day and July Fourth weekend.He even added: ""Halloween is off to a good start."" (Yes, its only the beginning of September, I know.)Consumers face squeeze from gas prices, credit card debtMeanwhile, in the background, the odds are stacked against consumers' wallets.Higher gas prices are ""still a pain point"" for consumers with the national average gas price at $3.81 per gallon as of Friday, AAA Northeast senior manager Robert Sinclair Jr. told Yahoo Finance.""I worry that with inflation cutting into the family budget, particularly for housing and food, that there isn't a lot left over for gasoline for ... non-essential travel,"" Sinclair said. ""Demand so far this year is 0.9% less than a year ago when gasoline was much more expensive. ... That's very, very telling.""In addition to higher prices at the pump, consumers' wallets are pinched by the cost of groceries, higher mortgage rates, higher interest rates, a slowdown in the US job market, the looming return of student loan payments, and a rising rate of credit card delinquencies as Americans struggle to pay off credit card debt.Retailers are feeling the pinch in return. Earlier this month, Kohl's (KSS) CFO Jill Timm said ""payment rates [are] down, losses up"" — a potential red flag that consumers are falling behind.""Credit losses did increase over what was obviously a really low year last year,"" Timm added. ""But as anticipated ... we did take early actions as we did anticipate the macroeconomic environment to worsen and people to have less cash in their bank account.""Investors heard a similar message from Macy's (M).""While we have seen an increase in revenues as interest rates have risen, that has been more than offset by higher bad debt assumptions and write-offs,"" Macy's CFO Adrian Mitchell said on a call with investors. ""These bad debt assumptions and write-offs are the result of rising delinquencies, which leads to higher net credit losses over time and contributes to increased bad debt within the portfolio.""Despite this noise, consumers continue to defy the odds.""The consumer seems to be somewhat resilient,"" Feldman said, especially when it comes to the desire to have the next big thing. ""The consumer is purchasing when they see newness, when they see innovation in the product.""—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

However, it has recently witnessed a decline of 4.14%, juxtaposed with a three-month change of -2.87%. Fresh insights from the GuruFocus Score Rating hint at potential headwinds. Notably, its diminished rankings in financial strength, growth, and valuation suggest that the company might not live up to its historical performance. Join us as we dive deep into these pivotal metrics to unravel the evolving narrative of Wynn Resorts Ltd.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with WYNN. Click here to check it out. WYNN 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of WYNNWynn Resorts Ltd (WYNN): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialDecoding the GF ScoreThe GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.1. Financial strength rank: 3/102. Profitability rank: 6/103. Growth rank: 1/104. GF Value rank: 9/105. Momentum rank: 9/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned Wynn Resorts Ltd the GF Score of 68 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.Understanding Wynn Resorts Ltd's BusinessWynn Resorts operates luxury casinos and resorts. The company was founded in 2002 by Steve Wynn, the former CEO. The company operates four megaresorts: Wynn Macau and Encore in Macau and Wynn Las Vegas and Encore in Las Vegas. Cotai Palace opened in August 2016 in Macau, and Encore Boston Harbor in Massachusetts opened June 2019. We expect the company to begin construction on a new building next to its existing Wynn Palace resort in 2024, which we forecast to open around 2027. The company also operates Wynn Interactive, a digital sports betting and iGaming platform. The company received 76% and 24% of its 2019 prepandemic EBITDA from Macau and Las Vegas, respectively.Story continuesWynn Resorts Ltd (WYNN): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialFinancial Strength BreakdownWynn Resorts Ltd's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. Wynn Resorts Ltd has an interest coverage ratio of 0.48, which positions it worse than 92.07% of 555 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt. It's worth noting that the esteemed investor Benjamin Graham typically favored companies with an interest coverage ratio of at least five.The company's Altman Z-Scoreis just 0.96, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.29 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels. Furthermore, the company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 10.53, which is above Joel Tillinghast's warning level of 4 and is worse than 83.28% of 580 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. Tillinghast said in his book Big Money Think's Small: Biases, Blind Spots, and Smarter Investing that a high debt-to-Ebitda ratio can be a red flag unless tangible assets cover the debt.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where Wynn Resorts Ltd seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. The company's revenue has declined by -18.8 per year over the past three years, which underperforms worse than 78.56% of 765 companies in the Travel &amp; Leisure industry. Stagnating revenues may pose concerns in a fast-evolving market. Lastly, Wynn Resorts Ltd predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.Wynn Resorts Ltd (WYNN): A Deep Dive into Its Performance PotentialConclusionGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GuruFocus Score Rating highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While Wynn Resorts Ltd has a rich history and a strong brand, its current financial health and growth prospects may not be as robust as they once were. As value investors, it's crucial to consider these factors when making investment decisions. Will Wynn Resorts Ltd be able to overcome these challenges and return to its former glory?

PWR stock has gained 49% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Engineering - R and D Services industry’s 27% growth. The company has been gaining from the sustained demand in its end markets and the strength of its core business. The year 2023 exhibits widespread growth opportunities, with continuous growth opportunities for infrastructure solutions.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is also expected to gain from prudent growth strategies and accretive acquisitions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate has witnessed an uptrend over the past 30 days as analysts raised their estimates.

The estimated figure indicates 11.8% year-over-year growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research However, project delays, supply chain risks and lower operating margins across the Electric and Renewable segments are concerns.Let’s Take a Look at the Factors Supporting the GrowthHigh Infrastructural Investment: Quanta is expected to reap the rewards of its involvement in a wide range of technology solutions dedicated to decarbonization efforts. These encompass areas like carbon management mitigation, compliance consulting, and the complete spectrum of infrastructure required to facilitate carbon-free energy solutions. Quanta has been strategically positioned to capitalize on major trends driving the energy transition and fostering technological advancements. Notably, initiatives like the expansion of electric vehicle charging infrastructure and the undergrounding of electrical infrastructure are gaining significant traction, further contributing to the company's growth prospects.Solid Backlog: The company ended the second quarter with a total record backlog of $27.2 billion and a 12-month backlog of $15.64 billion. This compares favorably with the December 2022-end’s 12-month backlog of $13.79 billion and the total backlog of $24.09 billion. The reported metrics were also up from the year-ago respective figures of $11.58 billion and $19.85 billion. This demonstrates the strength of its core operations. This robust performance underscores the company's core operational strength, and Quanta remains optimistic about its future prospects, driven by its healthy backlog levels, which are expected to continue growing.Acquisitions: Quanta considers acquisitions as a pivotal element of its strategy to augment its market presence and expand its order backlog. As of January 2023, Quanta completed the acquisition of three companies. One of these specializes in providing services related to high-voltage transmission lines, overhead and underground distribution, emergency restoration, and industrial and commercial wiring and lighting. This acquisition primarily strengthens Quanta's presence in the Electric Power sector. Another acquired company offers solutions in the field of concrete construction services, bolstering Quanta's capabilities in both the Electric Power and Renewable Energy segments. The third acquisition involves a business focused on procuring components, assembling kits for sale, managing logistics, and installing solar tracking equipment for utility and development clients, primarily enhancing Quanta's operations within the Renewable Energy segment.Story continuesHurdlesLower Margins: Lower equity in earnings from its integral unconsolidated affiliates and lower utilization of Canadian resources have been impacting the Electric segment’s operating margins, which contracted 30 basis points (bps) and 50 bps in the first and second quarters of 2023, respectively.Also, increased costs related to higher levels of resources required to support the expected increase in project activity in the second half of 2023 and into 2024 led to the contraction of the operating margin in Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions unit during the first and second quarters of 2023.

(Photo: Gatik)Breakfast sausage, hot dogs and frozen chicken breasts from Tyson Foods are beginning to move autonomously on Gatik AI trucks in Northwest Arkansas. The three-year contract could expand nationwide.Gatik has covered a 7.1-mile route from a small warehouse to a Walmart retail store in Bentonville, Arkansas. It will serve Walmart neighbor Tyson as a third-party carrier using four Gatik trucks equipped with autonomous capability.Gatik’s four-year project with Walmart — using driverless trucks since 2021 — ended with the closing of the warehouse where it was picking up loads. The startup expects to expand autonomous operations with Walmart but declined to provide details of what that will look like.Much attention in autonomous trucking goes to Class 8 autonomous developers. Two of those — Aurora Innovation and TuSimple — forecast driver-out commercial routes by the end of 2024.With less fanfare and no meaningful competition, Gatik has operated short-haul repeatable routes for up to 18 hours a day for Walmart and the Loblaws supermarket chain in Canada. In March, it added grocery giant Kroger as a customer for autonomous deliveries in Dallas.Gatik counts thousands of accident-free driverless trips and more than 500,000 deliveries with and without safety monitors. Robot drivers are exempt from hours-of-service regulations limiting humans to 11 hours of driving in a 24-hour period.“We’re really building on a lot of the operational learnings that we’ve gained over the past few years in northwest Arkansas,” said Richard Steiner, Gatik vice president of government relations and public affairs.Reconfiguring supply chain transportation for TysonIn adding lane density, Gatik is using Class 7 box trucks, weaning shippers from using Class 8 day cab semi-trailers on shorter runs.“We’re able to offer a much more responsive and flexible solution with a slightly smaller truck but still deliver a substantial load very frequently for the customer,” Steiner said. “This is the first time that anyone, to the best of our knowledge, has done that in the autonomous trucking space.”Story continuesA typical Tyson truckload consists of 30 pallets. But it’s not always easy to fill a 53-foot refrigerated trailer for a short haul, Patrick Simmons, Tyson’s vice president of transportation, told FreightWaves.“Almost 47% of our total miles are what we refer to as shuttle runs,” Simmons said. “That’s taking loads from a production facility out to one of our distribution facilities or a finishing plant where [chicken] can get breaded and those types of things.”Using a smaller truck to haul 10 pallets for 10 miles makes sense. High-frequency autonomous runs use less fuel and create fewer emissions, he said.“We figure that just one Gatik truck equates to about 700 truckloads a year, and that gives us a lot more efficiency, better turns on our trailers and helps us reduce our carbon footprint,” Simmons said.4 autonomous trucks for Tyson for startersTyson operates the nation’s eighth-largest private fleet, with 1,300 trucks and 4,500 mostly refrigerated trailers. It is helping Gatik purchase four Class 7 Isuzu FVR cabovers upfit for autonomy.“There are multiple facilities in Northwest Arkansas where we’re starting so we can monitor it,” Simmons said. “Across the country, we’ve identified 40 locations where we could do similar operations.”But first things first. Autonomous trucks assigned to Tyson will start with safety drivers as the pilots with Walmart and Loblaws did. Steiner would not share the timeline for when driver-out operations to Tyson storage facilities in the Rogers and Springdale, Arkansas, areas would begin.“There is an exponential decrease in the time frame from safety driver to driver out as we expand our operations,” he said.Autonomous trucking involves much more than the truck. The warehouse needs to be prepared. Bills of lading will change, as will communication between the carrier and the plant. A driverless truck passing through a guard shack is another challenge.Repurposing Tyson driver jobs  Tyson has hired 250 private fleet drivers so far this year and expects that number to grow. Adding autonomous trucking could change some driving jobs but won’t eliminate any, Simmons said.“We’re going to repurpose what they do,” he said. “I have worked with drivers for over 20 years and one of the biggest complaints I hear is ‘I have to drive 400-plus miles a day to make any money.’”Tyson wants its private fleet to carry 50% of its total freight compared to 40% presently. As autonomous trucks take on the short-haul trips, human drivers will get more long-haul runs.“This will allow us to take that same driver and make them more of a regional driver, that 400- to 500-mile average distance,” Simmons said.Tyson has no immediate plans for converting to long-haul autonomous trucks. Its proteins are the refrigerated freight on a hub-to-hub autonomous pilot with carrier C.R. England and autonomous trucking developer Kodiak Robotics.“There’s not enough drivers for us to do all that we want to accomplish,” Simmons said. “That’s why we want to learn where [autonomy] makes sense. Can we use technology today to help us be more flexible, responsive and nimble across the country?”Related articles:Running on Ice: KITT joins the cold chain2022 Shipper of Choice Profile: Tyson FoodsGatik will autonomously deliver groceries for Kroger in DallasClick for more FreightWaves articles by Alan Adler.The post Gatik robot trucks will haul Tyson chicken, sausage and hot dogs appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

(NYSE: TSN), one of the world’s largest food companies, and Gatik AI, Inc. (Gatik), the leader in autonomous middle mile logistics, announced a multi-year collaboration to deploy autonomous refrigerated box trucks to bolster Tyson routes in Northwest Arkansas. Operating 18 hours a day, trucks will deliver Tyson®, Jimmy Dean® and BallPark® products, among others, to the company’s distribution and storage facilities in the Rogers and Springdale, Arkansas areas.The deployment will introduce Gatik trucks equipped with commercial-grade autonomous technology to the Tyson supply chain, operating on predetermined short-haul, repeated routes to support fast and efficient product flow from plant to storage facilities. In a nationwide truck driver shortage, these autonomous trucks are an innovative and safe way to add resources that will allow the company to elevate drivers to other transportation positions in the Tyson business, while ensuring continuous supply chain reliability.The collaboration, which begins this week, will include multiple trucks with the potential for future expansion at other Tyson locations. The autonomous trucks are equipped with a 26-foot temperature-controlled box purpose-built to transport refrigerated and frozen goods quickly and safely and multiple sensor modalities that are custom-designed for fail-safe short-haul B2B operations. A safety driver will initially be present in the cab to monitor the autonomous system and take command of operating the truck if required.“At Tyson Foods, we are innovating and using automation throughout our business, including in transportation,” said Patrick Simmons, vice president of transportation for Tyson Foods. “This partnership allows us to strategically place our drivers where they are needed most while still reliably and safely transporting protein from the plant to distribution centers.”Story continues""We’re excited to partner with Tyson Foods to reduce cost and complexity within their regional distribution architecture,” said Gatik CEO and co-founder, Gautam Narang. “This is a significant moment for Gatik as we introduce Class 7 autonomous box trucks into our fleet. Our partnership with Tyson is poised to drive long-term innovation and supply chain resiliency while delivering tangible, near-term value.”The partnership is expected to provide Tyson Foods with increased asset utilization within its short-haul logistics network, assist with inventory objectives, and support a transition to a more responsive, high-frequency approach to goods movement.

Chairman Davies' position also came under investor pressure over his handling of the matter.Davies had already announced his planned retirement, and said in April he would leave the bank as planned by next year, despite facing calls for him to leave sooner.Farage said in a post on social network X that Davies seeing out his term was ""a classic case of the establishment closing ranks"".Haythornthwaite said that he was inheriting a ""very different NatWest"" to his predecessor Davies, who oversaw a return to majority private ownership for the bank after its state rescue in the 2008 global financial crisis.Sky News first reported Haythornthwaite was being lined up for the role, which is subject to regulatory approval.NatWest shares were last down 1%, compared to a 0.2% dip for the FTSE 100 index.CEO HUNTINGOne of Haythornthwaite's first tasks will be to find a permanent successor to Rose, who had led the bank for nearly 4 years prior to her leaving in July after admitting to a ""serious error of judgment"" over discussing Farage's account with a BBC reporter.Story continuesNatWest appointed former commercial banking boss Paul Thwaite as interim CEO for an initial period of 12 months.""First and foremost, NatWest needs to rebuild the trust of customers, investors, and the regulator – as we often find, trust is hard to build and easy to lose,"" said Matt Britzman, equity analyst at investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown.Haythornthwaite chaired payments company Mastercard for 14 years before taking on the same role at British online supermarket Ocado in May 2021.NatWest said in its statement that Haythornthwaite would step down from several roles, including as a director at software company Globant.An Ocado spokesperson said Haythornthwaite would stay on as chair of the company.The AA said in a statement that Haythornthwaite would be stepping down as the company's chairman, adding he would remain as a non-executive director.He also previously worked as chairman at Centrica, Britain's largest energy supplier, and state-owned rail track owner Network Rail, which at the time attracted criticism from the government and unions over claims of excessive pay for top bosses.Haythornthwaite will be paid 775,000 pounds a year, the same as his predecessor Davies, NatWest said in a statement.

But it's hard to know where this company goes from here.SEANA SMITH: It is very hard to know where this company goes from here. When we talked about why they made this move, they did it so they could still stay listed on the New York Stock Exchange. When you take a look at some of the rules, some of the guidelines from the NYSE, you have to have a closing price above $1, so they did this as one of their last ditch efforts here. They're trying to turn around the business.But we know WeWork is not alone when you take into account the pressure that we are seeing in the office space right now. So many companies-- obviously WeWork having an outsized impact because of this, but so many companies are trying to figure out what they're going to do with their office spaces. WeWork dealing with elevated costs, a cash burn, that high turnover rate.People simply are not renewing their memberships here with WeWork, so the company has a very, very, very challenging several months ahead of themselves. They talked about that turnaround strategy that you mentioned, saying that it's critical that they execute on that in order to stay in business. So we'll see what happens here for the future of WeWork.Story continuesLet's also take a look at Mastercard. Now, Mastercard denying reports that it's planning to raise credit card fees on merchants. Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal previously saying last week that the company was going to start charging retailers more starting next month. We're looking at Mastercard closing off just about 1%.Now, we talk about the massive run up in fees and what some of these credit card companies-- Mastercard included-- charge these vendors, charge these third parties in order to use a credit cards. Clearly that fee level has been climbing very, very steadily over the last several years. And it means something to consumers too because, a lot of time, merchants are being forced to pass along some of those higher costs to consumers in the form of how they're pricing their products in order to offset some of the pressure from fees. But Mastercard coming out saying that, at least for right now, they don't have plans to raise their fees.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And that was my question mark. Is it going to happen later and it's just not going to happen now? But as we were [? mentioning, ?] I mean, these fees are so high. Merchants in the US paid an estimated $93 billion in both Mastercard fees along with Visa fees as well. And Visa also said that recent press coverage on the issue was, quote, misleading and that its fees on visa transactions have been flat for the past decade. So good news for merchants and the consumer, as you were mentioning, especially considering this macro environment is so uncertain right now.]"

The statement refers to an Aug. 30 Wall Street Journal report that Visa and Mastercard – which dominate the card processing market with an 80% market share – intend to begin raising fees on merchants in October and April. Several other media outlets also picked up the WSJ story.The news comes amid concerns that America's credit card debt, which recently surpassed $1 trillion, continues to rapidly increase. Merchants can pass some or all of the swipe fees that they are charged on to credit card users.“The reporting relies upon a report produced by an advisory firm advocating for legislation currently under consideration in Congress,” Mastercard said in the statement. “Mastercard is not raising interchange rates in the U.S. this fall and has no plans to do so. Mastercard is not raising network fees in the U.S. required for the processing of Mastercard transactions this fall.”The company said, however, that the authorization optimizer service “is the only Mastercard fee noted in the study cited by the journal” but that it is not related to interchange fees. “This service is designed to reduce the likelihood that subscription and recurring payments will be declined, with any related fees being de minimis in scope,” the company said.A Visa spokesperson said in a statement that its overall interchange fees have remained flat for more than a decade and that over the past few years the company has lowered interchange rates for the vast majority of small businesses and in key segments such as supermarkets and quick service restaurants.The spokesperson referred Kiplinger to a Visa blog to “set the record straight on recent misleading press coverage.” In the blog, the company said that since 2012 it has seen a 180% increase in Visa payment volume.Story continues“Despite strong growth in the use of Visa cards, our overall interchange fees on Visa transactions have been flat for the past decade. Moreover, over the past three years, Visa has introduced programs to lower interchange for the vast majority of small businesses in the United States,” the company said.Last year, for example, Visa lowered interchange 10% for 90% of US businesses to help with their recovery and growth, it said. “Efforts by special interest groups to challenge these facts in the press are simply inaccurate and disappointing,” Visa said.New legislation seeks to increase competitionCiting the WSJ article, two U.S. Senators pushed back last week on the reported fee hikes, urging Visa and Mastercard to withdraw any such plans as they would result in fees ultimately being passed on to consumers in the form of price hikes.“We strongly urge Visa and Mastercard to withdraw their plan to raise credit card fees on small business owners and hard-working American families,” said senators Roger Marshall (R-KA) and Dick Durbin (D-IL) in a statement. “With small businesses and families already dealing with high prices on groceries and gasoline, this hidden credit card fee increase couldn’t come at a worse time.”The senators are the lead sponsors of the recently reintroduced Credit Card Competition Act, a bill that seeks to increase industry competition by requiring major card-issuing banks to offer a choice of at least two networks to process transactions.Mastercard noted in the statement that Congress is considering legislation that could potentially lower costs for merchants. “Yet it fails to mention the negative consequences for consumers – compromised security, a loss of rewards programs and higher prices on goods and services,” the company said.“Whether businesses are considering implementing a specific service or Congress is considering legislation, we believe these activities should only take place based on an accurate understanding of the facts and how our industry works,” Mastercard said.Credit card fees have been a hot topic on the state level as well. New Jersey recently became the latest state to pass a law that limits the amount of card swipe fees that businesses can pass on to customers. Swipe fees can create financial hardships for consumers, said N.J. Assemblyman Sadaf Jaffer in a statement endorsing the new law.According to a Bankrate study, 35% of Americans carry credit card debt from month to month, which can hold people back from achieving their financial goals. One of the first steps you can take to help pay off credit card debt is knowing your credit score and assessing your options.RELATED CONTENTHow to Pay Off Credit Credit Card DebtA Guide to Debt: Good vs Bad and Tips to Better ManageBest Rewards Credit Cards]"

After a purchase, the cardholder’s bank wires money to Visa’s treasury, from which Visa pulls the funds and sends them to the merchant’s bank.This is usually done in fiat currency, but the payments giant has previously allowed companies, mostly crypto-native firms like Crypto.com, to send payments to its treasury via USDC, the dollar-backed stablecoin issued by Circle.Now, Visa, which has a dedicated account with Circle, will begin to send USDC out of its treasury to two large payments firms—Worldpay and Nuvei—which, in turn, can directly facilitate payments for merchants. The companies have decided to send and receive USDC on Solana because of the blockchain’s capacity to process transitions more quickly than on Ethereum’s.“Expanding the pilot exemplifies how pairing USDC with Visa’s innovation opens up the future of payments, commerce, and financial applications,” Jeremy Allaire, Circle’s cofounder and CEO, said in a statement.Despite the promise of stablecoins to speed up bank transfers, the processing time to transfer money into or out of its treasury will remain the same, Cuy Sheffield, Visa’s head of crypto, told Fortune.“In this early stage, we’re really just giving the option to send or receive USDC instead of a bank wire, but we’re not sending money out faster or receiving money in faster necessarily,” he said in an interview. “Over time, I think that there’s potential to start doing that.”The expansion of Visa’s USDC settlement process is yet another new crypto product or pilot to come out of a legacy payments company this year, despite ongoing, expansive regulatory action from the federal government against the crypto industry.In February, the SEC issued a Wells Notice, or a legal document that says the agency intends to sue a company, to Paxos, a stablecoin issuer. PayPal, which had partnered with Paxos to develop its own stablecoin, said it was “pausing” development amid the regulatory scrutiny. However, in August, the publicly traded payments firm indeed launched its stablecoin.Story continuesMastercard also has unveiled a new suite of crypto offerings, most recently it’s so-called Multi Token Network, or MTN. But just months later, Mastercard confirmed it was severing its partnership with Binance on prepaid crypto debit cards, after the SEC sued the world’s largest crypto exchange in June.A spokesperson for Visa also confirmed that the company had stopped issuing Binance cards in Europe as of this summer, and Sheffield, Visa’s crypto head, wouldn’t comment to Fortune on whether the payments firm plans to fully cut off its partnership with Binance.That being said, Visa’s latest pilot suggests that the firm isn’t cutting itself off from crypto, especially stablecoins, anytime soon. “We’ve gotten to the point where there’s a recognition that stablecoins can play a role in payments,” Sheffield told Fortune, “that they can solve real challenges.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian breaks down what this means for Qualcomm, as the company has been seeing smartphone revenue slump.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: US semiconductor giant Qualcomm will supply chips for Mercedes and BMW's infotainment systems, including displays and voice features. Let's get the details with Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian. Hey, Pras.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Hey, Rachelle. Yeah, a nice little coup here for Qualcomm over its rival NVIDIA. As you mentioned, Qualcomm supplied chips for infotainment and self-driving tech for Mercedes and BMW. These chips will appear in new Mercedes E-Class and will also power some of those voice commands you mentioned in new BMWs as well.This as Qualcomm sees revenue for smartphones slump recently, but autos are a bright spot here, with sales climbing 13% last quarter in that sector, while outlook for the smartphone business fell short. CEO Cristiano Amon highlighting the importance of the auto sector, with Qualcomm seeing revenue rise to $4 billion by 2026 and $9 billion by the end of the decade. Rachelle.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, certainly smart making that increased pivot into autos when you see that what we're seeing with phones and PCs slumping. Now, let's also talk about competition, though, in the EV space. There was a notable concept car debut for Mercedes this weekend. What's the deal there?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, so kind of a stunner here at the Munich Auto Show over the weekend. Mercedes debuted their CLA EV here. Sort of the CLA class, normal gas powered cars, they're going to kind of cancel that car, sort of see it off into the sunset. But then they announce this EV that's going to come up based on a concept that will be sort of almost production ready.This new car is quite stunning in its looks. Going to have also around 400 miles of range, if not a bit more than that, so it's sort of taking on Tesla, the Model 3, which is around 320 or so, so Mercedes upping the ante there from a range point of view. But also, as we know, Mercedes knows what they're doing with luxury. A nice wide screen digital display in that cockpit. It's going to look great, I think. So we'll see that probably in the next year or two coming out from Mercedes. Can't come soon enough for the brand, I think.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I love that, and I love the fact that even though, you know, these EVs don't need a grill, this one has one on there because it still makes it feel a bit more special. I cannot wait. I'm sure at some point hopefully you get to try that out for us. Always great to have you on. Our very own Pras Subramanian.]"

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) look very promising so lets take a look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Lockheed Martin is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.23 = US$9.2b ÷ (US$57b - US$18b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).So, Lockheed Martin has an ROCE of 23%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry average of 9.5%. View our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin roceIn the above chart we have measured Lockheed Martin's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From Lockheed Martin's ROCE Trend?Lockheed Martin is displaying some positive trends. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 23%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 26%. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed.The Bottom LineAll in all, it's terrific to see that Lockheed Martin is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. And investors seem to expect more of this going forward, since the stock has rewarded shareholders with a 56% return over the last five years. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.Story continuesLockheed Martin does have some risks though, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Lockheed Martin  that you might be interested in.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

The work related to this deal will be carried out at multiple locations across the United States.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?LMT’s Aegis Combat System is a centralized, automated, command-and-control (C2) and weapon control system designed as a complete system, most suitable for military missions, ranging from detection to kill.

Per a report from the Mordor Intelligence firm, the naval combat system market is likely to witness a CAGR of more than 2.5% during the 2023-2028 period. This should benefit LMT, which designs surface combatant ships for the U.S. Navy and international customers as well as integrated warfare systems like Aegis that serve as a sea and land-based element of the U.S. missile defense system.Considering the aforementioned market’s growth opportunities, Lockheed’s expertise in building naval combat weapons and consistently upgrading them is likely to result in a steady flow of contracts for the company, like the latest one.

PHM is likely to have performed well in the second half of 2023, thanks to improving residential demand and a lack of existing homes for sale. This notable homebuilder is also gaining from land acquisition strategies, margin expansion moves and regular community openings in various locations.PHM has gained 81.5% so far this year compared with the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry’s 47.3% growth, the Zacks Construction sector’s 33.2% rise and the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 18.7% rally. The company regularly raises shareholders’ value via repurchases and dividend distributions, boosting investors’ sentiment.Earnings estimates for 2023 have increased to $11.62 per share from $11.16 in the past 30 days. This reflects 7.6% year-over-year growth on a 1.6% rise in revenues. This can further be substantiated from its VGM Score of B. These positive trends indicate bullish analysts’ sentiments, robust fundamentals and further expectations of outperformance in the near term.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s check out the factors that are pushing this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company despite a lower backlog. The industry is also grappling with a challenging sales environment, higher cancellation rates and significant inflation.Land Acquisition &amp; Development Move: PulteGroup’s land acquisition strategies aim to improve volumes, revenues and profitability on an annual basis. In second-quarter 2023, the company spent $370 million on land acquisition and $523 million on related development. Considering the strong buyer demand and increase in its construction activities, the company expects land acquisition and development investment in 2023 to range within $3.5-$4 billion, up from the previously considered value of $3.3 billion. Of these, it estimates 65% to go toward the development of owned land positions.Apart from this, PulteGroup’s land strategy emphasizes investing in shorter-lived, smaller land assets while expanding the use of land option agreements when possible, thereby mitigating market risk.These initiatives helped PHM post impressive results in second-quarter 2023. Adjusted earnings per share beat the consensus mark by 21.5% and increased by 9.9% year over year.Home sale revenues increased nearly 8% year over year, mainly due to the higher closings and average price of homes closed. Land sale revenues also rose 11.2% from a year ago.Cost Control Measures: To mitigate the accelerated raw material prices, PHM and its peers have undertaken various cost control measures and focused on making the homebuilding platform more efficient, which in turn is resulting in higher operating leverage. Homebuilders have been controlling construction costs by designing homes efficiently and obtaining construction materials and labor at competitive prices. SG&amp;A expenses (as a percentage of home sales revenues) improved by 50 basis points in the second year.Focus on First-Time/Entry-Level Buyers: PulteGroup remains focused on the growing demand for entry-level homes, which aim at lower-priced homes, given affordability concerns prevailing in the U.S. housing market. In second-quarter 2023, it comprised 41% of first-timers, 34% of move-ups and 25% of active adults. The shift from mix to first-time is in line with its strategy of having more than one-third of business in the first-time buyer space. Community Expansion Strategy: Changing demography has lifted demand for new homes in lower-density markets, including small metro areas, rural markets and large metro exurbs, as people seek larger homes to work from home amid the pandemic. The desire for more space and amenities to accommodate working and learning from home should continue to boost the U.S. housing market in the near term.PHM has been expanding its reach in various markets via community openings and recently announced community openings in various locations. On Jun 29, it unveiled the opening of its first communities in Greenville and Columbia, SC.The company expects the community count to grow by 5-10% in the third and fourth quarters.Driving Shareholder Value: PHM has been paying quarterly dividends for nearly four decades. It has consistently focused on sharing its cash flows with shareholders and maintaining a solid financial position. In December 2022, it announced a quarterly dividend hike of 7% to 16 cents per share.In the first half of 2023, PulteGroup declared cash dividends of $71.8 million and repurchased 6.4 million shares under the repurchase authorization for $400 million. On Apr 24, 2023, its board of directors increased the share repurchase authorization by $1 billion. As of Jun 30, 2023, the company had $982.9 million remaining in authorization.Story continuesKey PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the sector are:Boise Cascade Company BCC sports a Zacks Rank #1.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Stocks to Buy with Steady Dividends.Investment trends have evolved significantly over time in response to shifts in the market and the preferences of investors. Nevertheless, dividend stocks have consistently attracted interest in the market due to their capacity to provide a dependable source of income. Nearly 77% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 pay dividends and the policies of individual companies can vary widely, with some paying higher dividends than others.Over the years, the importance of dividends in contributing to overall investment returns has increased significantly. A report from Morgan Stanley suggested that in the coming years, stock market gains may be smaller with higher volatility. As a result, the portion of the market returns coming from dividends might become more important. From 2013 to 2022, dividends made up about 17% of the total returns in the S&amp;P 500 Index. However, if we look at a much longer period starting from the 1930s, dividends contributed to 37% of the returns. It's expected that the next few years will resemble this longer-term trend. This growing recognition of the role dividends play in long-term wealth accumulation has led to increased attention from investors seeking both income and capital appreciation.Since the start of 2023, a group of giant tech companies has made it difficult for other parts of the market to perform better than the S&amp;P 500. While dividend stocks, in general, have not done well compared to the index this year, there have been some positive developments. The ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL), which invests in companies with dividend growth track records over 25 consecutive years, is aiming to recover with its straightforward approach. The fund has gained 4.98% year-to-date, which is considerably lower than the 18.9% return of the S&amp;P 500. However, this performance represents a promising beginning in terms of a potential recovery for the fund.Story continuesThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the most popular stocks among investors that have raised their dividends for decades. These companies are resilient, profitable, generate substantial cash flow, and are typically capable of enduring various economic conditions.Analysts have been paying close attention to dividend stocks this year due to their possible resurgence in the markets. In one of her recent interviews with CNBC, Sandy Pomeroy, a senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman, presented a positive outlook on dividend stocks over the next years. Here are some comments from the analyst:“Dividend stocks are so cheap right now, that maybe you just have a reversal based on the fact that they are as cheap as they have been since the tech boom of the 1990s. When we did that we were three standard deviations cheaper relative to that period, three standard deviations cheaper now. And they went on to have a great decade. They were the outperformers for the next ten years.”In view of these arguments and the analyst’s remarks, we will discuss some of the best dividend stocks to buy with steady dividends.15 Stocks to Buy with Steady DividendsOur Methodology:For this article, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 910 hedge funds as of Q2 2023 and picked dividend stocks with over 10 consecutive years of dividend growth and dividend yields over 2%, as of September 4. After that, we gathered the price forecasts and ratings given to these stocks by Wall Street analysts and other investment firms.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Stocks to Buy with Steady Dividends.Investment trends have evolved significantly over time in response to shifts in the market and the preferences of investors. Nevertheless, dividend stocks have consistently attracted interest in the market due to their capacity to provide a dependable source of income. Nearly 77% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 pay dividends and the policies of individual companies can vary widely, with some paying higher dividends than others.Over the years, the importance of dividends in contributing to overall investment returns has increased significantly. A report from Morgan Stanley suggested that in the coming years, stock market gains may be smaller with higher volatility. As a result, the portion of the market returns coming from dividends might become more important. From 2013 to 2022, dividends made up about 17% of the total returns in the S&amp;P 500 Index. However, if we look at a much longer period starting from the 1930s, dividends contributed to 37% of the returns. It's expected that the next few years will resemble this longer-term trend. This growing recognition of the role dividends play in long-term wealth accumulation has led to increased attention from investors seeking both income and capital appreciation.Since the start of 2023, a group of giant tech companies has made it difficult for other parts of the market to perform better than the S&amp;P 500. While dividend stocks, in general, have not done well compared to the index this year, there have been some positive developments. The ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL), which invests in companies with dividend growth track records over 25 consecutive years, is aiming to recover with its straightforward approach. The fund has gained 4.98% year-to-date, which is considerably lower than the 18.9% return of the S&amp;P 500. However, this performance represents a promising beginning in terms of a potential recovery for the fund.Story continuesThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the most popular stocks among investors that have raised their dividends for decades. These companies are resilient, profitable, generate substantial cash flow, and are typically capable of enduring various economic conditions.Analysts have been paying close attention to dividend stocks this year due to their possible resurgence in the markets. In one of her recent interviews with CNBC, Sandy Pomeroy, a senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman, presented a positive outlook on dividend stocks over the next years. Here are some comments from the analyst:“Dividend stocks are so cheap right now, that maybe you just have a reversal based on the fact that they are as cheap as they have been since the tech boom of the 1990s. When we did that we were three standard deviations cheaper relative to that period, three standard deviations cheaper now. And they went on to have a great decade.

(NYSE: ROK), the world’s largest company dedicated to industrial automation and digital transformation, today announced it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Ontario, Canada-based Clearpath Robotics Inc., a leader in autonomous robotics for industrial applications. Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) are the next frontier in industrial automation and transformation, and this acquisition will supercharge Rockwell’s lead in bringing the Connected Enterprise to life.Transporting parts and materials to assembly lines and between manufacturing cells is one of the industry’s most complex and inefficient tasks, often resulting in production bottlenecks. Autonomous production logistics will transform the workflow throughout a manufacturing plant, enabling substantial reductions in cost and greater operational efficiency. Clearpath’s OTTO Motors Division offers AMRs and fleet management and navigation software, which dramatically increase throughput and reduce costs by ensuring components and subassemblies are in place when needed and by transporting finished goods to a truck or warehouse upon completion.Combined with Rockwell’s strong continuing partnerships in fixed robotic arms, solutions such as Independent Cart Technology, and traditional leadership in programmable logic controllers (PLCs), the addition of OTTO Motors’ AMR capabilities will create a complete portfolio of advanced material handling solutions unmatched in the industry.According to Interact Analysis, the market for AMRs in manufacturing is expected to grow about 30% per year over the next five years, with an estimated market size of $6.2 billion by 2027. This acquisition is expected to contribute a percentage point to Rockwell’s fiscal 2024 revenue growth.Story continues""Rockwell and Clearpath together will simplify the difficult and labor-intensive task of moving materials and product through an orchestrated and safe system to optimize operations throughout the entire manufacturing facility,"" said Blake Moret, Chairman and CEO, Rockwell Automation. ""The combination of autonomous robots and PLC-based line control has long been a dream of plant managers in industries as diverse as automotive and consumer packaged goods. With Clearpath, Rockwell is uniquely positioned to make that dream a reality across virtually all discrete and hybrid verticals, optimizing planning, operations, and the workforce.""Data from Rockwell’s offerings and OTTO Motors’ AMRs will be harnessed in artificial intelligence-powered Software as a Service information management applications, such as those by Rockwell’s Plex and Fiix businesses. With this, Rockwell will deliver a unified solution for manufacturing, enabling autonomous execution and optimization to increase efficiency and allow for traceability and real-time adjustments. The combined technology will also amplify Kalypso’s production logistics consulting practice.""Industrial customers are under ever-increasing pressure to do more with less. Autonomous production logistics is becoming a necessity to meet targets and stay competitive. We are excited to join Rockwell and help expand their leadership position in advanced material handling,"" said Matt Rendall, co-founder and CEO of Clearpath. ""Together, we will create safer and more productive workplaces with autonomous technology.""Founded in 2009, Clearpath got its start offering robotics technology to global research and development markets, and in 2015, launched its OTTO Motors Division.The acquisition will be funded by a portion of the proceeds from the sale of Rockwell’s investment in PTC. It is subject to customary regulatory approval and is expected to close in the first quarter of Rockwell’s fiscal year 2024.

(NASDAQ:ILMN): Illumina was our top detractor in the quarter despite reporting first quarter results that were generally in line with expectations and reaffirming full-year guidance. Uncertainty around activist investor Carl Icahn’s impact on the business, the change of CEO and the possible forced divestiture of liquid biopsy subsidiary Grail (early-stage cancer screening via blood samples) all weighed on Illumina’s stock price.We continue to view the company’s core genomics industry as offering one of the larger total addressable markets that we cover, and ILMN is the clear innovation leader in sequencing and array-based solutions for genetic analysis. With less than 0.02% of humans having been sequenced and 99% of the variants discovered in the genome having not yet been deciphered, Illumina, at less than $5 billion of TTM revenue, is still in its infancy in what is potentially a greater than $50 billion genetics analysis tools market opportunity. We believe Carl Icahn’s involvement is neutral to slightly positive to the extent he can help the company be more disciplined on expenses. We are cautiously optimistic that EU regulators’ push to force Illumina to divest Grail will lead to either or both 1) much higher core earnings or 2) a big valuation for Grail in a sale.

Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Exelixis and Illumina are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #4 (Sell), respectively, right now. This means that EXEL's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.EXEL currently has a forward P/E ratio of 23.10, while ILMN has a forward P/E of 202.05. We also note that EXEL has a PEG ratio of 1.12. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. ILMN currently has a PEG ratio of 9.10.Another notable valuation metric for EXEL is its P/B ratio of 2.86. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ILMN has a P/B of 4.06.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to EXEL's Value grade of B and ILMN's Value grade of D.EXEL sticks out from ILMN in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that EXEL is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Is Illumina (ILMN) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapScrutinizing the RisksHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Piotroski F-score and high Beneish M-score. These indicators suggest that Illumina, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Company OverviewIllumina provides tools and services to analyze genetic material with life science and clinical lab applications. The company generates over 90% of its revenue from sequencing instruments, consumables, and services. Illumina's high-throughput technology enables whole genome sequencing in humans and other large organisms. Its lower throughput tools enable applications that require smaller data outputs, such as viral and cancer tumor screening. Illumina also sells microarrays (less than 10% of sales) that enable lower-cost, focused genetic screening with primarily consumer and agricultural applications.Story continuesDespite the promising fair value of $337.35, Illumina's stock is currently priced at $161.2. This discrepancy, coupled with the company's low Piotroski F-score and high Beneish M-score, warrants a cautious approach.Is Illumina (ILMN) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapConclusionIn conclusion, while Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) appears to be undervalued at first glance, the potential risks associated with the stock suggest that it might be a value trap. The low Piotroski F-score and high Beneish M-score are red flags that investors should not ignore. Therefore, a prudent approach would be to conduct thorough due diligence before making an investment decision.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

PWR stock has gained 49% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Engineering - R and D Services industry’s 27% growth. The company has been gaining from the sustained demand in its end markets and the strength of its core business. The year 2023 exhibits widespread growth opportunities, with continuous growth opportunities for infrastructure solutions.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is also expected to gain from prudent growth strategies and accretive acquisitions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate has witnessed an uptrend over the past 30 days as analysts raised their estimates. Over the said time frame, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $7.09 for 2023 has increased from $7.01. The estimated figure indicates 11.8% year-over-year growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research However, project delays, supply chain risks and lower operating margins across the Electric and Renewable segments are concerns.Let’s Take a Look at the Factors Supporting the GrowthHigh Infrastructural Investment: Quanta is expected to reap the rewards of its involvement in a wide range of technology solutions dedicated to decarbonization efforts. These encompass areas like carbon management mitigation, compliance consulting, and the complete spectrum of infrastructure required to facilitate carbon-free energy solutions. Quanta has been strategically positioned to capitalize on major trends driving the energy transition and fostering technological advancements. Notably, initiatives like the expansion of electric vehicle charging infrastructure and the undergrounding of electrical infrastructure are gaining significant traction, further contributing to the company's growth prospects.Solid Backlog: The company ended the second quarter with a total record backlog of $27.2 billion and a 12-month backlog of $15.64 billion. This compares favorably with the December 2022-end’s 12-month backlog of $13.79 billion and the total backlog of $24.09 billion. The reported metrics were also up from the year-ago respective figures of $11.58 billion and $19.85 billion. This demonstrates the strength of its core operations. This robust performance underscores the company's core operational strength, and Quanta remains optimistic about its future prospects, driven by its healthy backlog levels, which are expected to continue growing.Acquisitions: Quanta considers acquisitions as a pivotal element of its strategy to augment its market presence and expand its order backlog. As of January 2023, Quanta completed the acquisition of three companies. One of these specializes in providing services related to high-voltage transmission lines, overhead and underground distribution, emergency restoration, and industrial and commercial wiring and lighting. This acquisition primarily strengthens Quanta's presence in the Electric Power sector. Another acquired company offers solutions in the field of concrete construction services, bolstering Quanta's capabilities in both the Electric Power and Renewable Energy segments. The third acquisition involves a business focused on procuring components, assembling kits for sale, managing logistics, and installing solar tracking equipment for utility and development clients, primarily enhancing Quanta's operations within the Renewable Energy segment.Story continuesHurdlesLower Margins: Lower equity in earnings from its integral unconsolidated affiliates and lower utilization of Canadian resources have been impacting the Electric segment’s operating margins, which contracted 30 basis points (bps) and 50 bps in the first and second quarters of 2023, respectively.Also, increased costs related to higher levels of resources required to support the expected increase in project activity in the second half of 2023 and into 2024 led to the contraction of the operating margin in Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions unit during the first and second quarters of 2023. Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions unit’s operating margin contracted 446 bps and 85 bps during the first and second quarters of 2023.3 Construction Stocks to ConsiderGibraltar Industries, Inc.

NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has a market capitalization of $153.487 billion.RiverPark Large Growth Fund made the following comment about NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:""NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE): NKE shares were a top detractor in the quarter following FY3Q earnings and guidance that disappointed investors. NIKE generated 19% constant currency revenue growth, reduced excess inventory, had strong China sales, and delivered better than expected earnings of $0.79 (investors were looking for $0.64). Despite this, a 330 basis point decline in gross margins and disappointing FY4Q guidance, including continued gross margin declines and a surprise increase in SG&amp;A, pressured the stock.Nike is, by far, the leading athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment company in the world with over $50 billion in revenue, $4.5 billion in 2022 annual free cash flow, and over $11 billion of excess cash. We believe that over the long term, the global secular growth trend towards active wear will continue to aid Nike’s top-line growth, while we expect gross and operating margin improvements as it shifts its product mix to more premium products and adopts a more direct to consumer approach, driving long-term mid-teens or higher annual EPS growth for the foreseeable future. In the short term, we believe the company will continue to make progress working though the excess inventory the company amassed last year, similar to most US retailers, as COVID-slowed supply chains re-opened and stock-outs turned into supply gluts.""Story continuesnike, retailers, front, retail, clothing, expensive, klcc, outlet, business, sign, buying, couture, wealth, accessories, designer, boutique, asia, tourist, kl, suria, design, tourism,March Marcho / Shutterstock.comNIKE, Inc.

(NYSE:NKE) will be aware, they have not made a gain on their investment in the past three years. What is concerning is that despite positive EPS growth, the share price has not tracked the trend in fundamentals. The AGM coming up on the 12th of September could be an opportunity for shareholders to bring these concerns to the board's attention. Voting on resolutions such as executive remuneration and other matters could also be a way to influence management. We discuss below why we think shareholders should be cautious of approving a raise for the CEO at the moment. See our latest analysis for NIKE How Does Total Compensation For John Donahoe Compare With Other Companies In The Industry?Our data indicates that NIKE, Inc. has a market capitalization of US$153b, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as US$33m for the year to May 2023. Notably, that's an increase of 14% over the year before. While this analysis focuses on total compensation, it's worth acknowledging that the salary portion is lower, valued at US$1.5m.For comparison, other companies in the American Luxury industry with market capitalizations above US$8.0b, reported a median total CEO compensation of US$6.5m. Accordingly, our analysis reveals that NIKE, Inc. pays John Donahoe north of the industry median. Furthermore, John Donahoe directly owns US$19m worth of shares in the company, implying that they are deeply invested in the company's success.Component20232022Proportion (2023)SalaryUS$1.5mUS$1.5m5%OtherUS$31mUS$27m95%Total CompensationUS$33mUS$29m100%Speaking on an industry level, nearly 24% of total compensation represents salary, while the remainder of 76% is other remuneration. NIKE has chosen to walk a path less trodden, opting to compensate its CEO with less of a traditional salary and more non-salary rewards over the last year. If total compensation is slanted towards non-salary benefits, it indicates that CEO pay is linked to company performance.Story continuesceo-compensationA Look at NIKE, Inc.'s Growth NumbersNIKE, Inc.'s earnings per share (EPS) grew 27% per year over the last three years. Its revenue is up 9.6% over the last year.Shareholders would be glad to know that the company has improved itself over the last few years. It's nice to see revenue heading northwards, as this is consistent with healthy business conditions. Moving away from current form for a second, it could be important to check this free visual depiction of what analysts expect for the future.Has NIKE, Inc. Been A Good Investment?Given the total shareholder loss of 10% over three years, many shareholders in NIKE, Inc. are probably rather dissatisfied, to say the least. Therefore, it might be upsetting for shareholders if the CEO were paid generously.In Summary...NIKE primarily uses non-salary benefits to reward its CEO. Despite the growth in its earnings, the share price decline in the past three years is certainly concerning. The stock's movement is disjointed with the company's earnings growth, which ideally should move in the same direction. If there are some unknown variables that are influencing the stock's price, surely shareholders would have some concerns. The upcoming AGM will be a chance for shareholders to question the board on key matters, such as CEO remuneration or any other issues they might have and revisit their investment thesis with regards to the company.Shareholders may want to check for free if NIKE insiders are buying or selling shares.Switching gears from NIKE, if you're hunting for a pristine balance sheet and premium returns, this free list of high return, low debt companies is a great place to look.Have feedback on this article?

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Countries That Produce the Best Quality Leather in the World.Leather Industry Leather is consumed for various products such as high-end shoes, bags, and furniture, among others. Also, leather is considered to be a key component of the fashion industry. The quality of leather defines the price of a particular leather product. Fashion brands use high-end leather produced from cows, sheep, and crocodiles. For instance, crocodile leather bags are quite expensive as croc leather is rare and of high quality. The demand for luxury goods has been a major driver for leather in recent years. In February 2023, Fortune Business Insights published a report on the global leather goods market size. According to the report, the global leather goods market size is expected to grow from $468.49 billion in 2023 to $738.61 billion by 2030. That shows a compound annual growth rate of 6.7% from 2023 to 2030. The majority of the leather industry's share is driven by shoemakers due to leather’s high prevalence of durable shoes for consumers. For instance, ​​in 2022 Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE) launched new shoes in its Air category announcing the Air Force 1 Low ‘07’ Fresh, Air Trainer ‘Midnight Navy,’ and Air Max 97 Coconut and Black. Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE) uses upper and premium leather in the new Air shoes category. The footwear industry is one of the key drivers that create high demand for leather. Meat Industry’s Contribution to Leather IndustryThe leather industry has been a primary player in the global commerce market for millennia. Today, leather is one of the largest markets in the world with its products being used in shoes, fashion accessories, luggage, and automotive industries - to name a few. The production of leather involves the tanning and dyeing of the animal hides. Leather is the by-product of the meat industry as a large portion of leather is generated from cows, camels, pigs, goats, and sheep, among others. Story continuesAccording to Leather Naturally, 99% of the leathers are produced from livestock as a by-product. The core business of livestock is not for hides and skins but for meat and dairy products. However, many activist organizations claim that animals are slaughtered brutally for their hides and skins to produce leather. According to PETA, leather is no friend of the environment as it causes pollution by the use of toxins in tanning. In addition, the meat industry is also responsible for environmental destruction as it contributes to the leather industry. As per PETA:“With every pair of leather shoes that you buy, you sentence an animal to a lifetime of suffering. Instead, you can choose from hundreds of styles of non-leather shoes, clothing, belts, bags, and wallets.”Sustainability in Leather IndustryThe leather industry is working on sustainable ways of producing leather through plants and using non-toxic tanning agents. Multiple other factors are key to the sustainability of the leather industry such as waste management, reducing water consumption, and recycling leather products. As we mentioned, footwear holds a major share in the leather industry.Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE), one of the largest shoemakers in the world, wants to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2050. Nike Inc.’s (NYSE:NKE) leather consumption is one of the major contributors to carbon emissions. To achieve its greenhouse gas emissions target by 2050, Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is using synthetic leather and the company’s non-leather substitute for leather, Flyleather. Still, there are some of Nike’s classics that are high in demand and use animal leather such as Dunks, Air Force 1, and Air Jordan 1. On March 23, Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE) released its Fiscal Year 2022 Impact Report. In the report, Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE) addressed its goals to meet consumer demand through the use of low-impact leather materials while reaching its 2025 target. In the Fiscal Year 2022 Impact Report, Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE) mentioned:“Our plan for 2025 is to decarbonize our portfolio of leather materials by shifting our sourcing toward those materials that are measurably lower impact (for carbon emission and waste) than average. In FY22, we have partnered with key suppliers to measure their impacts across the full value chain, from farm to factory, to inform our sourcing and identify opportunities for additional impact reduction across the supply chain. We are also maintaining our standards, and require 100% of our leather suppliers to be members in good standing with Leather Working Group.”Fashion brands that mainly rely on animal leather are also seeking sustainable ways to manufacture their leather products. LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (EPA:MC) is also working on producing sustainable leather products. On September 1, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (EPA:MC) revealed that its partner Stella McCartney debuted new editions of its Falabella and Frayme bags during the ongoing Paris Fashion Week. The bags are made from a plant-based leather called MIRUM. In addition, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (EPA:MC) operates a sustainable resale platform for fashion and leather goods known as Nona Source. Despite companies' development in sustainable leather products, most of their leather goods are produced from animal leather hides, which use chemicals for tanning. Therefore, companies such as Hermes International SCA (EPA:RMS) and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (EPA:MC) are powering the demand for animal hides and skins. Both Hermes International SCA (EPA:RMS) and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (EPA:MC) are famous for their leather luggage items and bags. Hermes International SCA's (EPA:RMS) famous tote bag Birkin is a trademark among leather handbags. Hermes International SCA (EPA:RMS) being one of the oldest leather goods manufacturers continues to roll on with its new stores. On July 28, Hermes International SCA (EPA:RMS) in its half-year information report announced that it will be opening four new leather goods productions in the next four years. During H1 2023, Hermes International SCA (EPA:RMS) posted a total revenue of EUR 6.69 billion, increasing by 22.3% year over year. Out of the total revenue, leather goods and saddlery accounted for EUR 2.78 billion during H1 2023. With increasing fashion trends and demand for leather from different industries, the production of leather goods will continue to remain strong. Let's now take a look at the countries that produce the best leather in the world.10 Countries That Produce the Best Quality Leather in the WorldOur MethodologyTo compile the list of 10 countries that produce the best quality leather in the world, we have gathered data on leather (hides and skins) exports of each country from the World Bank’s database of World Trade Integrated Solution.

Theres even an online stock markets for trading mostly high end athletic footwear. One company that may benefit from these trends is the 2nd largest retailer of athletic shoes in the U.S., Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE:FL).The company operates 2,599 retail stores in 26 countries including North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, and the Middle East. Its brand portfolio includes Foot Locker, a youth culture brand comprising sneakers and apparel, Kids Foot Locker, which offers athletic footwear, apparel, and accessories for children, and Champs Sports that operates as a mall-based specialty athletic footwear and apparel retailer.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with NKE. Click here to check it out. NKE 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NKEIt also has a comprehensive e-commerce offering through various websites and mobile apps. The company was formerly known as Venator Group, Inc. and changed its name to Foot Locker, Inc. in November 2001. The company was founded in 1879 and is headquartered in New York, New York. The current market capitalization is $1.8 billion.Recent strategic actionsFoot Locker has made strategic efforts to improve its portfolio of stores. It purchased the WSS and Atmos brands while divesting Eastbay, Footaction and Sidestep. The company relies heavily on Nike (NYSE:NKE) products, which represent approximately 70% of sales. The company is hoping to reduce that do under 60% over time.The company also has opened their 3rd new distribution center in the U.S. which should provide 2-day shipping cover for a significant portion of the U.S. market. Lastly, the company continues to transition to more off-mall locations with a larger store footprint.Financial summaryThe company recently reported 2nd quarter results for the period ending July 29, 2023, which showed a difficult operating environment. Total sales decreased 9.9% and same-store sales decreased 9.4%. These declines were primarily driven by driven by ongoing consumer softness, changing vendor mix, the repositioning of the Champs Sports brand, and higher levels of shrink.Story continuesGross margin declined by 460 basis points as compared to the prior-year period which was driven by an increase in promotional activity, which included higher markdowns, as well as occupancy deleverage and higher shrink (theft). SG&amp;A increased by 190 basis points compared with the prior-year period, with savings from the cost optimization program more than offset by underlying deleverage on the sales decline, inflation, and investments in store employee wages.The company reported a net loss of ($5.9) million, or ($0.05) per share in the 2nd quarter, compared to net income of $94 million, or $0.99 per share in the prior-year period. On a Non-GAAP basis, net income was $4.0 million, as compared with $105 million in the prior-year period.At the end of the 2nd quarter, the company's cash and cash equivalents totaled $180 million, while total debt on the balance sheet was $450 million. Working capital was a positive $919 million. Merchandise inventories were $1.8 billion, which was 11% higher than at the end of the second quarter last year but sequentially improved from the 25% increase at the end of the 1st quarter of 2023.The companys President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, ""Our second quarter was broadly in line with our expectations, despite the still-tough consumer backdrop. However, we did see a softening in trends in July and are adjusting our 2023 outlook to allow us to best compete for price-sensitive consumers, while still leaning into the strategic investments that drive our Lace Up plan. Importantly, we are continuing to make progress on our inventory levels and look to best position the business for the upcoming holiday season and into 2024."" ValuationCurrent analyst consensus EPS estimates for the 2023 fiscal year ending January 2024 are $1.34. The company is definitely not earning up to normal capacity levels due to current operating issues. The company earned $4.95 last year and $7.25 the year before that. For fiscal year 2024, earnings are expected to improve to $2.15.Even with these depressed earnings, the stock is selling at approximately 14 times current fiscal year earnings and nine times next years earnings. The EV/EBITDA ratio is approximately 7.0 times on a forward looking basis.The Guru focus DCF calculator creates a value of $29.00 when using more normalized forward EPS of $2.15 and a 10-year growth rate of 6.0%. Returning to the stocks 52-week high of $47.00 would require a 10-year growth rate of approximately 13.0%.There are 14 analysts with current ratings on the company with and average price target of $19.54 including a high target of $30.00 and a low target of $15.00.The company had been paying a dividend, but now is pausing the quarterly cash dividends beyond its recently approved payout on October 27..SummaryFoot Locker represents a potential interesting opportunity for contrarian investors. If it can regain its former earnings power, then the stock is substantially undervalued. However, the slowdown in current consumer purchasing trends cannot be ignored.Tailwinds may include a successful shift to more digital sales as well as replacement of certain Nike products from other brands.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

(The Nike brand has the top spot.)According to Drbul, the hype is still there: In the company's fiscal fourth quarter earnings, the Jordan brand brought in $6.59 billion in revenue — 12.9% of Nike's total fiscal year 2023 sales.And the brand has plenty of momentum heading into the holidays, especially around the re-release of a sneaker that first debuted in 1996.""The sneaker industry is anticipating a Holiday launch of the Air Jordan 11, at $230, which is considered by many as one of the greatest Jordan sneakers ever,"" Drbul wrote, adding that Nike plans to include new colorways and editions in the release, such as the ""Gratitude,"" ""Defining Moments Pack,"" and ""Concord"" colorways.""We expect these sneakers to create a lot of brand Heat and keep Brand Jordan relevant for Sneaker Heads,"" the analyst added.Jordan an 'attractive growth vehicle' amid some concerns for NikeAfter nearly 30 years, the Jordan brand ""remains extremely relevant"" and ""an attractive growth vehicle"" for Nike, even as the footwear space experiences some weakness, Drbul said.Total searches for Jordan brand keywords are up on most major retailers' websites, per Guggenheim and SimilarWeb data, which also included searches on Google, Bing, and the private browser DuckDuckGo in the results.Searches for the brand are up 38.7% year over year on JDSports.com, 67.0% on Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), 139.4% on Foot Locker (FL), 3.3% on the sneaker site goat.com, 492.1% on eBay (EBAY), and up 455.5% on Amazon's website (AMZN).On fightclub.com, however, searches are down 52.4% from a year ago.Story continuesNike Air Jordan shoes at a store in Krakow, Poland on July 5, 2023. (Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)There's another perk for investors: Nike is a brand that is engaging Gen Z by gaining social media hype with innovation and new products, Barclays consumer discretionary analyst Adrienne Yih told Yahoo Finance. The brand also benefits from secular lifestyle trends like health and wellness.Yet despite the Jordan interest, Nike stock is down nearly 14% year to date.Shares hit a rough patch over the last month, dropping over 7% after Foot Locker posted disappointing results and cut its full-year outlook. Historically, Nike accounts for more than half of Foot Locker's total sales, Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reported.One concern for Nike is the drop in monthly downloads and usage of SNKRS, an app created by the athletic apparel giant. However, Drbul argued there have also been signs of weakness within mobile and web traffic for sneaker resellers, which led the team to believe it is ""not a Brand Jordan problem.""As signs of stress begin to show at some large retailers and ""given macro uncertainties and a slowdown in discretionary spending"" so far this year, Drbul added the firm believes ""the weakness in the secondary sneaker market is logical.""Another challenge in recent years has been Nike's efforts to redo its distribution network, Oppenheimer senior analyst Brian Nagel told Yahoo Finance. ""One of the challenges for Nike over the last few or several years now has been that they've had to ... dismantle or ... reconfigure their wholesale distribution network because they had to think about where their partnerships and wholesale [are].""Nike is expected to post its first quarter fiscal 2024 financial results on Thursday, Sept. 28, after the market close.—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

170,ec86edc2-a8a2-3655-bf72-3c3a4530de97,WFC,2023-09-06,Wells Fargo's (NYSE:WFC) investors will be pleased with their decent 86% return over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wells-fargos-nyse-wfc-investors-110039035.html,1693998039,STORY,['WFC'],"[By buying an index fund, you can roughly match the market return with ease. But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. For example, the Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) share price is up 74% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 26% (not including dividends).Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. Check out our latest analysis for Wells Fargo While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Wells Fargo was able to grow its EPS at 85% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is higher than the 20% average annual increase in the share price. So one could reasonably conclude that the market has cooled on the stock. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 10.09 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Wells Fargo has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. This free interactive report on Wells Fargo's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Wells Fargo the TSR over the last 3 years was 86%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 13% in the last year, Wells Fargo shareholders lost 2.5% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. However, the loss over the last year isn't as bad as the 3% per annum loss investors have suffered over the last half decade. We'd need to see some sustained improvements in the key metrics before we could muster much enthusiasm. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Subsequently, two more sizable lenders – Signature Bank and First Republic Bank – collapsed amid deposit flight.But looking at bank stocks, you won’t realize so much time is gone. August turned out to be the worst month since the banking turmoil started in March, as fear gripped the industry. The KBW Bank Index fell 8.8% in August and the S&amp;P 500 Banks Industry Group Index declined 9.5%. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 Index lost just 1.5%.The situation is more dire if we look at the year-to-date performance. So far this year, the KBW Bank Index and the S&amp;P 500 Banks Industry Group Index have lost 19% and 10%, respectively, while the S&amp;P 500 Index is trading in the green, up almost 18%.Even the four large banks – JPMorgan JPM, Bank of America BAC, Citigroup C and Wells Fargo WFC – fared badly last month.Performance in AugustZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSince the early spring, when the turmoil started, investors have been reluctant to add bank stocks to their portfolios as the industry faced ambiguity related to new regulations and the path of interest rates. Concerns related to rising deposit costs and weakening credit, largely in commercial real estate (CRE), also kept investors on the sidelines.No Respite in AugustThe month brought fresh worries. The major rating agencies downgraded the ratings of several big and small lenders. The rating agencies – Moody’s Investors Services and S&amp;P Global Ratings – noted that rising funding costs, potential regulatory capital weakness and heightened risks associated with CRE loans on weak office space demand have been testing the banking sector’s credit strength and will, thus, make survival tough for banks.Another rating agency, Fitch Ratings, wasn’t left behind. Fitch Ratings’ analyst Chris Wolfe said that though slashing of the banking industry’s ratings to AA- from AA in June didn’t lead to ratings downgrades for banks, another one-notch downgrade in the industry ratings to A+ will result in the recalibration of “all our financial measures and would probably translate into negative rating actions.”Such action will place the industry’s ratings below those of Wall Street giants like JPM and BAC. So, the credit ratings of these large lenders will be cut, leading to a cascading effect, as smaller banks’ ratings will have to be adjusted as well. While noting that the downgrades are uncertain, Wolfe stated that the risks are real.Further, banking regulators continued to propose new regulations aimed at bolstering the industry’s resilience. In late July, long-awaited capital reforms tied to Basel III were revealed. This would push big banks, including JPMorgan, Bank of America, C and WFC, to adhere to tighter rules.Then, last month, a new plan for banks with at least $100 billion in total assets was unveiled. Under the proposal, banks will be required to issue adequate long-term debt to absorb losses in the event of a potential seizure. Several regional banks will come under the ambit of this new, stringent rule.Apart from these, the deposit flight continued during August. Per the data available from the Federal Reserve, since the beginning of this year, deposits at all U.S. banks have declined $371 billion, while balances in the money market funds grew more than $769 billion. This poses a huge challenge for banks, leading to intense deposit competition.Story continuesSeptember WoesHistorically, September is the worst month from a trading perspective. The average S&amp;P 500 performance by month dating back to 1950 reveals that the average return in September is -0.7%.The trend is likely to persist this time as well.This month, bank investors look forward to the two-day FOMC meeting for clues on potential interest rate increases at subsequent meetings. The market participants, however, are not expecting any rise in rates in September.Also, the central bank will disclose their short-term interest rate forecasts for 2023-end.These developments will have a huge bearing on banks’ performance.Investors will also be closely following an industry conference hosted by Barclays for updates from banks on how well they are navigating the challenges.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Omicron offshoot carries more than 35 mutations in key portions of the virus compared with XBB.1.5, the dominant variant through most of 2023 and the target of the updated shots.Moderna said it had shared the new finding on its vaccine with regulators and submitted it for peer review publication. The retooled shot has yet to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but is expected to be available later this month or in early October.The Massachusetts-based drugmaker and rival COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers Novavax and Pfizer with German partner BioNTech have created versions of their shots aimed at the XBB.1.5 subvariant.Last month, Moderna and Pfizer each said their new vaccines appeared to be effective against another new subvariant of concern dubbed EG.5 in initial testing.European regulators have since backed the Pfizer/BioNTech shot, with Britain's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency approving the vaccine on Tuesday, but have yet to make any announcements on Moderna’s updated vaccine.BA.2.86 has now been detected in Switzerland and South Africa as well as Israel, Denmark, the U.S. and Britain according to a WHO official.While it is important to monitor the variant, several experts told Reuters it is unlikely to cause a wave of severe disease and death because of immune defenses built up worldwide from mass vaccination and prior infection.(Reporting by Patrick Wingrove in New York; Editing by Bill Berkrot)]"

But although this virus hasn’t disappeared, cancer still remains one of the biggest health challenges of our lifetime, and a battle that the pharmaceutical industry is far from winning.Pfizer Promises To Battle Cancer At The Speed of scienceIn mid-August, The U.S. Food and Drug Administration therapy approved a blood cancer therapy that Pfizer developed. Branded as Elrexfio, Pfizer developed a therapy to empower the body's immune system kill cancerous cells by bringing a cancer cell and an immune cell together. Regulators have allowed the use of this therapy in patients with multiple myeloma that is hard to treat and to those who suffered from recurrence of the disease.Moderna Is Poised To Unlock New Cancer TreatmentAt the end of July, Moderna Inc (NASDAQ: MRNA) and Merck (NYSE: MRK) began a late-stage study of skin-cancer combination treatment that includes a personalized mRNA-based skin cancer vaccine along with the immunotherapy Keytruda. The mid-stage study conducted in 157 melanoma patients revealed that the vaccine combination lowered the risk of recurrence or death by 44% in comparison to treatment with Keytruda alone. The vaccine is tailored for each patient to activate the key player of the body's immune response, T-cells, based on the tumor’s specific mutational signature. BioNTech SE (NASDAQ: BNTX) and Gritstone Bio Inc (NASDAQ: GRTS) are also are also developing cancer vaccines based on the mRNA technology. Scientists have been trying to develop these vaccines for decades without success but this combination of mRNA vaccines with immune boosting drugs promise to create a new generation of cancer therapies.Story continuesYet, There’s Little Talk Of Cancer Prevention And Early Detection.Yet, unlike the COVID-19 scenario, there’s still little talk about prevention or at the very least, early detection of cancer. Today, a molecular genetics diagnostic company specializing in the early detection of life-threatening conditions, Mainz Biomed N.V. (NASDAQ: MYNZ), announced a strategic partnership with Ärztliches Labor Dr. Buhlmann in attempt to strengthen its market positioning. Its flagship product, ColoAlert®, is positioned as an accurate, non-invasive and easy-to-use, early-detection diagnostic test for colorectal cancer. Already marketed across Europe, it is undergoing a pivotal FDA clinical study for US regulatory approval. The company is also developing PancAlert, an early-stage screening test for pancreatic cancer.A Massive Opportunity Ahead For Mainz BiomedIn 2022, The Association of Substitute Health Insurance Funds in 2022 estimated that approximately 10.5% of Germany’s population, which is about 8.7 million individuals, are covered by private health insurance (PHI) and a substantial portion of these beneficiaries are within the critical 50-74 age range, which is the targeted demographic for CRC screening. Moreover, CRC is the third most common cancer in the world, according to the World Cancer Research Fund International. The market opportunity in the U.S. is massive as roughly one-third of the country’s population aged 50-75 have never been screened for colon cancer, translating to more than $4 billion market opportunity for Mainz Biomed.Mainz Biomed Is Poised To Expand Its Footprint Across The GlobeWith its latest strategic partnership with Ärztliches Labor Dr. Buhlmann, a respected player in PCR-based analysis, Mainz Biomed gained the opportunity to further expand into Germany’s private health insurance arena where its ColoAlert® is already eligible for reimbursement. But, this partnership also promises to fuel its vision of facilitating early CRC detection across the globe as besides her public and private sector networks, Dr. Buhlmann’s laboratory will bring considerable expertise in pioneering molecular diagnostic tests to this promising company. Dr. Buhlmann also acknowledged the company’s innovative contribution to dramatically improving CRC testing.Covid Or No Covid, Pharma Has Yet To Win Its Biggest BattleThe Covid-19 virus hasn’t disappeared, but so haven’t many life-threatening diseases which is why innovative companies that focus on prevention of life-threatening diseases and on early detection that has the power to prevent the development of the diseases and a lethal outcome, such as Mainz Biomed, deserve all the support they can get.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

It is indicated for adults as well as pediatric patients aged 12 years and older.The U.K. becomes the fifth country where Novo Nordisk launched Wegovy after the United States, Norway, Denmark and Germany. The company aims to provide an additional option to support people living with obesity by making Wegovy available in the U.K., looking forward to working with healthcare providers to achieve this.Per NVO, the obesity management drug will be made available in the U.K. through two channels. The first channel will be through the specialist NHS weight management services for people in the U.K., who meet the National Institute for Care and Excellence (NICE) criteria. The drug will also be made available privately through a registered healthcare professional.Furthermore, Novo Nordisk reported that patients receiving Wegovy through the specialist NHS services will also receive support with diet and exercise measures to follow through a multi-disciplinary team.Year to date, shares of Novo Nordisk have shot up 39.8% compared with the industry’s 7.2% rise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company also reaffirmed in the press release that it expects the supply of Wegovy to be constrained for the foreseeable future. Under such circumstances, the company has decided to allocate a proportion of the available supply of the drug in the U.K. for use only within the NHS to allow healthcare professionals to implement NICE guidance.However, per a Reuters article, there is a rising concern among medical experts in the U.K. regarding wealthy people who could get easier access to Wegovy compared with those seeking treatment in the country's state-run health service. Availability of Wegovy in the private market, amid increasing demand, is expected to shoot up prices for the drug, which would, in turn, risk worsening health inequality in the country.Story continuesThe increasing demand trend of Wegovy is both a boon and a bane for the Danish pharma company. On one hand, Novo Nordisk increased its sales and operating profit guidance based on Wegovy prescription trends in the second quarter and higher full-year expectations for sales of Wegovy in the United States. On the other hand, the company is struggling to meet demand outside the United States, even with increased production capacity.If the supply issues continue to prevail for a long period, it could result in the loss of market share for the company in the presence of other pharma bigwigs, in the obesity and diabetes care market, like Pfizer PFE and Eli Lilly LLY.In May 2023, Pfizer shared study data showing that its oral type II diabetes candidate, danuglipron, helped patients lose weight faster than Novo Nordisk’s popular diabetes weekly injection, Ozempic. Pfizer’s danuglipron is an orally administered, small-molecule GLP-1 receptor agonist. But this has not been approved yetIn June 2023, Pfizer announced that it is moving forward with the late-stage development of danuglipron to treat adult patients with obesity and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Pfizer’s present phase IIb study in obesity is fully enrolled and plans for the phase III study will be subject to results from the ongoing phase II study on the candidate.Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro/tirzepatide, a dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist (GIP/GLP-1 RA), was launched in the United States last year for type II diabetes and already competes with Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic/Wegovy. Mounjaro is also approved in Europe and Japan. Its Mounjaro showed superior weight-loss reduction in two late-stage clinical studies (SURMOUNT-3 and SURMOUNT-4) for the obesity indication.LLY has already filed regulatory applications seeking the expansion of Mounjaro’s indication to include obesity and weight management in the United States and EU. In the United States, the FDA has assigned priority review to the regulatory filing with a decision expected by the end of the year.Now, if danuglipron is also successful in further studies and eventually approved, it can enjoy strong demand trends as the demand for weight loss drugs is huge and rising, posing a serious threat to Novo Nordisk. Also, danuglipron is an oral pill versus weekly injections with Ozempic/Wegovy, which is an easier-to-use formulation.Novo Nordisk A/S Price and Consensus Novo Nordisk A/S Price and ConsensusNovo Nordisk A/S price-consensus-chart | Novo Nordisk A/S Quote Zacks Rank and Stock to ConsiderNovo Nordisk currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock from the overall medical sector is Dynavax Technologies DVAX, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Dynavax’s 2023 loss per share has narrowed from 51 cents to 24 cents.

NVAX have risen 9.2% since the last month compared with the industry’s 2.9% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis upside is attributable to Novavax’s progress with its updated protein-based COVID-19 vaccine. This vaccine, designed to target the XBB descendent lineage viruses, has also generated neutralizing antibodies against the newly emerging virus variants, including EG.5.1 (also known as ‘Eris’) and XBB.1.16.6.Designated by the World Health Organization (“WHO”) as a variant of interest, Eris is the dominant variant in the United States. Per the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), the Eris variant is responsible for around 21.5% of COVID-19 infections in the country.Infection cases from XBB.1.16.6 are also growing in the United States. The latest CDC data shows that this variant accounted for 9.2% of all cases nationwide.Per the CDC, total hospitalizations due to COVID-19 rose by almost 19% in the most recent week. Last month, Reuters reported that the Biden administration will start a fall campaign urging all citizens to inoculate themselves with the updated COVID-19 vaccines.The updated Novavax vaccine is yet to be authorized by the FDA. If approved/authorized, Novavax’s updated vaccine will be a non-mRNA XBB.1.5 vaccine available in the United States. The company aims to make its updated vaccine available and accessible on par with mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines marketed by Pfizer PFE/BioNTech BNTX and Moderna MRNA.Alongside its second-quarter 2023 results, Novavax announced that it had initiated a filing with the FDA for this updated COVID-19 vaccine and intends to submit one in Europe in the coming weeks. Management stated that it is manufacturing the updated vaccine commercially and planning to launch it in the upcoming fall.With Novavax currently struggling with cash flow needs, a surge for COVID-19 vaccines will help the company generate additional cash resources to fund its business operations. In a quarterly SEC filing last month, management stated they have sufficient cash to fund business for the next twelve months.Story continuesNovavax is one of the few companies which has an authorized vaccine for COVID-19 in the United States. However, the company faces stiff competition from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, which currently dominate the COVID vaccination space. These companies have also updated their COVID vaccines, demonstrating robust immune responses against the newer coronavirus variants.Last month, Moderna reported preliminary results from a clinical study showing that its updated COVID-19 vaccine mRNA-1273.815 significantly boosted neutralizing antibodies against the Eris and FL.1.5.1 (also known as ‘Fornax’) variants.Moderna has also submitted a regulatory application to the FDA seeking authorization for mRNA-1273.815. A final FDA decision is expected in the coming weeks for the vaccine’s launch for the upcoming fall season. A similar regulatory submission is also currently under review in Europe.In June, Pfizer/BioNTech submitted filings in the United States and Europe seeking approval for their Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccine. If approved, the companies intend to launch their vaccine for the fall season. In preclinical studies, the updated BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine has shown efficacy against the Eris variant and multiple other XBB variants, including XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, and XBB.2.3. The companies expect to prepare their updated COVID vaccine for supply immediately post-regulatory approvals.Novavax, Inc. Price Novavax, Inc. PriceNovavax, Inc. price | Novavax, Inc.

181,ab18eb09-c709-30bb-8636-78cc37baabb6,FOXA,2023-09-06,Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price Targets,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-see-upside-111233109.html,1693998753,STORY,"['TGT', '^HSI', 'AVGO', 'LLY', 'MDB', 'ZBRA', 'FOXA']","[In this article, we will discuss the 10 stocks whose price targets were recently raised by analysts. If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 5 Stocks with Rising Price Targets.Global stocks declined on September 6 due to concerns about slowing growth in China and Europe, leading to uncertainty about the overall economic outlook. Simultaneously, the dollar strengthened as investors assessed the potential for Federal Reserve interest rate changes. MSCI's worldwide stock index dropped by 0.1% as of 0845 GMT. European stocks extended their losses for the sixth consecutive session, driven by worries of a global economic slowdown and rising oil prices. The pan-European STOXX 600 index hit a one-week low, down 0.8% by 0845 GMT. In Asia, the Hang Seng Index closed 150 points lower, and China's CSI300 Index fell 0.22% amid expectations of a slower decline in China's exports for August. Chinese investor sentiment also wavered due to a private-sector survey indicating a sluggish pace of service activity in August. Concerns lingered about potential developments in China's property market, increased food and energy prices, and discussions on further oil production cuts, all of which could impact equity sentiment. Manufacturing activity in Germany, Britain, and the eurozone declined, and their service sectors entered contraction territory, adding to the pessimistic sentiment. Corporate bond issuance surged as the U.S. returned from the Labor Day holiday, putting pressure on U.S. Treasury yields. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields fluctuated, while the dollar reached a six-month high against a basket of currencies.  Additionally, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) is set to release U.S. services PMI data on Wednesday.Investors are evaluating recent signals regarding potential U.S. interest rate hikes. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has expressed a cautious approach to raising interest rates, emphasizing that recent data reveals a sustained decrease in inflation. Waller conveyed that there is no compelling reason to take immediate action and that the central bank can exercise patience while observing economic indicators. In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Waller indicated his inclination to maintain the status quo by keeping interest rates unchanged during the upcoming central bank meeting. He stressed the importance of relying on concrete data before making significant monetary policy decisions, suggesting that there is no rush to implement rate hikes. Waller's measured stance is grounded in the belief that the available evidence does not warrant any urgent adjustments to interest rates. This perspective underscores the Federal Reserve's commitment to data-driven decision-making, allowing them to make informed choices that align with the broader economic landscape. It implies that the central bank will closely monitor economic developments and trends before taking decisive action regarding interest rates.Story continuesThe recent resurgence of the US dollar is causing Asian currencies to plummet to levels not seen in several months, reported Bloomberg. This development has prompted authorities in both Japan and China to intensify their efforts to protect and stabilize their struggling exchange rates. In Japan, there has been a heightened concern regarding the rapid depreciation of the yen. The country issued its most robust warning in weeks to address this issue, signaling its readiness to respond to speculative activities in the foreign exchange market. This move underscores Japan's commitment to preventing excessive declines in its currency and maintaining stability. On the other hand, China has taken notable steps to defend its currency, the yuan. The country's central bank issued its most assertive guidance by setting the daily reference rate for the yuan, a managed currency. This action was taken as the yuan was trending towards levels not witnessed since 2007. The move demonstrates China's determination to counteract depreciation pressures on the yuan and ensure its exchange rate remains within acceptable parameters. Japan and China's actions reflect their concerns about the impact of a strengthening US dollar on their respective currencies. They are taking proactive measures to protect the competitiveness of their exports and maintain financial stability in their economies. These moves highlight the delicate balance that central banks and policymakers in Asia must strike as they navigate the challenges posed by currency fluctuations in the global economic landscape.On the stock market front, analysts are bullish on pharma stocks such as Akero Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:AKRO), Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) and ORIC Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORIC). Check out the complete article to see the details of these upward revisions in price targets.Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price TargetsPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on Unsplash10. Zebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:ZBRA)Upside Potential: 6%On September 5, Zebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:ZBRA) received a significant boost in its price target from TD Cowen. At that time, ZBRA was trading at $273.25, with a slight 1.0% decrease in its value. However, the outlook for Zebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:ZBRA) took a decidedly optimistic turn as TD Cowen increased its price target range from $270.00 to $290.00. This upward adjustment in the price target not only signifies TD Cowen's bullish perspective on Zebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:ZBRA) but also suggests a strong vote of confidence in the company's performance potential. It implies that TD Cowen anticipates Zebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:ZBRA) could maintain its outperforming status and potentially see a substantial increase in its stock value.Similar to the way analysts have raised their price targets for Akero Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:AKRO), Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB), and ORIC Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORIC), Zebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:ZBRA) is yet another stock for which analysts have boosted their price projections.09. Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA)Upside Potential: 8%Much like the case with Akero Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:AKRO), Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB), and ORIC Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORIC), analysts have recently increased their price forecasts for Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA). On September 5, investors and analysts turned their attention to Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA) as Rosenblatt Securities made a significant move. Rosenblatt Securities decided to revise its price target for the company. The adjustment garnered significant attention, shifting the target price from its previous $33.00 to a fresh high of $34.00. This update signifies an impressive 8% upward potential from the current market price of Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOXA) stock, which stands at $31.43.

Morgan Stanley decided to raise its price target for the company, elevating it from the prior range of $617.00 to an even more optimistic range of $640.00. This alteration signifies a 15% upside potential for Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stock from its current share price of $558.03. Importantly, Morgan Stanley has retained its ""Overweight"" rating for Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY).This adjustment comes after conducting an exclusive survey among U.S. physicians specializing in Alzheimer's treatment, leading the firm to revise its estimate for Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). The analyst believes that the 2024 consensus estimates for Leqembi are now seen as ""attainable."" With Leqembi receiving full approval in July and anticipated FDA approval for donanemab in Q4, Morgan Stanley expects a relatively modest initial launch, followed by a significant uptick in prescriptions for Alzheimer's medications over the next 12 months in the United States. This increase is anticipated as healthcare centers establish the necessary protocols for prescribing these medications.Morgan Stanley's decision to bolster the price target suggests a continued bullish stance on Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). The adjustment indicates their belief in the potential for Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stock to maintain its ""Overweight"" status and experience growth, potentially reaching the new target of $640.00. This development offers investors valuable insights into the market sentiment and expectations surrounding Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY).07. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)Upside Potential: 15%On September 5, Robert W. Baird made a significant update regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO). Robert W. Baird decided to increase its price target for the company, raising it from the previous range of $900.00 to an even more optimistic range of $1,000.00. This adjustment represents a 15% upside potential for Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock compared to its current market price of $872.17. Robert W. Baird has maintained its ""Outperform"" rating for AVGO.According to the firm, recent checks in the industry suggest a significant uptick in Broadcom's custom ASIC business, with expectations of over 2 million units for the next year. This projection is more than 2.5 times higher than the firm's initial unit estimate for the current year. The growth in Broadcom's semiconductor business is primarily driven by investments in Generative AI, and AI-related revenue has now surpassed the $1 billion mark, as noted by the analyst.Here is what Aristotle Atlantic Partners has to say about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:“Broadcom contributed to outperformance, as the company is seen as a key beneficiary of the investment in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLM). The company’s Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) chips are being custom-built for customers to use in their data centers for accelerated computing. Broadcom’s networking chipsets are also expected to see increased levels of demand, as customers increase investments to enable the high-speed data transfer required by advanced AI training and inference. The company also announced a new multi-year supplier relationship with Apple, the company’s largest customer.”06. MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB)Upside Potential: 23%On September 5, Argus significantly adjusted its outlook for MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB).  In demonstrating their confidence in the company's potential, Argus decided to raise their price target for MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB). The adjustment involved an increase in the price target from $435.00 to a more bullish target of $484.00.

(NASDAQ:MDB).Argus's decision to elevate the price target underscores their ongoing conviction in MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) performance and future prospects. This adjustment signifies their belief that MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) stock not only justifies its existing ""Buy"" rating but also possesses the potential to reach the newly set target of $484.00.ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about MongoDB, Inc.

(NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:""PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL): PayPal shares were a top detractor in the quarter despite reporting better than anticipated 1Q earnings and raising guidance for the remainder of 2023. Revenue of $7 billion grew 9% year over year, an acceleration from the prior year and quarter. EPS of 1.17 grew 33% year over year on better cost discipline leading to better operating margins. The disappointment was centered around weaker gross margins, as unbranded checkout, which has lower gross margins, accelerated faster than branded checkout. Management anticipates this trend to continue and therefore guided to lower gross margins for the remainder of the year. Despite the gross margin headwind, operating margins continue to expand due to expense discipline.PayPal is the most accepted digital wallet – with almost triple the acceptance of Apple Pay, the number two digital wallet - providing the purest exposure to the secular growth in ecommerce-driven digital payments. PayPal is also a key beneficiary of consumer-to-consumer payment trends through its Venmo peer-to-peer (P2P) payment service. With a 1Q non-GAAP operating margin of 23%, PYPL also has significant margin expansion potential given that competitors Adyen, Visa and Mastercard have 50%-65% operating margins. We believe the combination of the secular growth of eCommerce and P2P payments, along with expanding operating leverage and the strategic use of the company’s significant and growing cash balance should fuel at least a high teens earnings growth rate over the next five years. This, to us, presents an excellent risk/reward given that PYPL trades at a below market multiple.""Story continuespaypal, buy, rose, business, app, editorial, technology, touch, computer, phablet, mobile, woman, electronic, smartphone, payment, purchase, background, device, online,Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.comPayPal Holdings, Inc.

The challenge is that they are historically hard to navigate because they require a certain level of technical challenges, but players like MetaMask are working to make them more user-friendly.The cash-out feature initially supports the conversion of only ETH, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, into types of fiats that depend on one's location. To start with, users pick the country they are in. They then will decide the amount to cash out, at which point they will see a list of third-party, so-called ""off-ramp"" providers, including MoonPay and Transact -- which already facilitates MetaMask's cash-in, or what the crypto world likes to call it, on-ramp process.From there, MoonPay will take over and send the ETH to users' designated bank accounts after calculating the exchange rate. Within minutes, the funds will show up in the bank. Users can also withdraw to PayPal, which is already a partner of MetaMask enabling its on-ramp process. The off-ramp option could help accelerate MetaMask's mass adoption -- provided that the solution is smooth and cheap enough for the average user. But fees can add up quickly.For one, users are responsible for the gas fee, which is paid to network validators for conducting transactions on the underlying decentralized network. They also likely have to pay MoonPay or other cash-out providers a transaction fee. Let's see how the costs are divvied up according to the MetaMask demo, using MoonPay in the U.S.:Story continuesThe user chooses to withdraw 0.05 ETH0.00021 ETH goes to the gas fee0.0458 ETH is soldThat means there's an additional transaction cost of 0.00399 ETH, which is about 8% of the total total transaction. Not an insignificant fee.Of course, transaction costs will vary among users depending on the available withdrawal partners in their markets. The feature is rolling out first in the U.S., the U.K. and parts of Europe ""with plans to expand to more regions to cater to our worldwide community,"" according to MetaMask's announcement.MetaMask isn't the only one trying to make it easier for users to spend their crypto. Recently, Gnosis, a blockchain network known for low gas fees, introduced a Visa card that allows users to spend cryptocurrencies from their self-custodial wallets in Europe, with plans to expand the service to the U.S. and Hong Kong.Gnosis launches Visa card that lets you spend self-custody crypto in Europe, soon US and Hong KongThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/06/metamask-crypto-to-fiat-cash-out/]"

So really-- you're really bucking the downward trend that we're seeing more broadly speaking within this space. There were so many critics out there saying that now is an extremely tough time for companies within the buy now, pay later space. You're actually doing pretty well. How?SEBASTIAN SIEMIATKOWSKI: Well, yes. Thank you. It's actually-- well, the thing is that, you know, not a lot of people know, but the company was profitable up until 1819 when we started investing heavily in our expansion to the US and some new markets. We're still generating in Europe about $1 billion of gross profit annually. And now, finally, we've been able also in the last 12 months since kind of investment sentiment shifted, and people wanted to see more profitability than growth. We have been focusing on optimizing and getting our US business to that level. So now we've seen 3/4 of consecutive profitability in the US market as well, which is very, very exciting.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And one thing we're watching closely here at Yahoo Finance is the expiration of that student loan moratorium. How do you expect that to impact your business?Story continuesSEBASTIAN SIEMIATKOWSKI: Well, the point is that like, I think, you know, one thing that is fairly misunderstood in media around the buy-now-pay-now products that we offer is that they have been built with customer's best interest at heart, right. So we don't offer a revolving. We only offer installments as fixed time. We try to always give you both a debit and credit option as opposed to a credit card, so everything is on credit.So the average outstanding balances in the US are about $120 to $250 compared to $5,000 for a credit card, which means that we have a very healthy consumer that is using credit very responsibly. And you also, because we underwrite every decision-- credit decision in real time, when we change-- when a macroeconomic change as we're seeing right now is coming, it actually takes us only two months before we have underwritten half of our balance sheet according to the new model. So it's a very agile business model compared to a bank that may take three years before new underwriting rules actually affect a majority of the balance sheet.So this is why we're seeing 30% losses below credit card industry standards and gives us an opportunity to be much more agile in the macro environment like this. So actually, we do not expect any of those changes that you mentioned like the student loans having any significant impact on our loss rates, even though they may obviously have so on the bigger economic or macroeconomic environment.SEANA SMITH: So Sebastian, you still see, it sounds like you still view the consumer, the customer here as in a very strong position despite some of those headwinds that we've been talking about.SEBASTIAN SIEMIATKOWSKI: Well, [INAUDIBLE], I think, you know, the important thing obviously, and you see that very clearly in the US, is that unemployment has not risen yet, right? And in general, if you look at like people's like long-term economical situation, employment is the critical factor. As much as obviously interest rates increases may mean that spending shifts a little bit, that there's a different, you know, portfolio of spending than there was, and people may be a little bit more careful in their spending. In general, the loss rates for them to increase we would have to see a significant increase in unemployment rates as well.SEANA SMITH: Sebastian, what does that shift look like? What are people spending on now that they weren't six to 12 months ago?SEBASTIAN SIEMIATKOWSKI: Well, I do think that still we're, you know, we're definitely still seeing, you know, e-commerce suffering from a little bit of like coming back to normality, right? So for a while there during COVID, we thought that e-commerce would be 90% of people spending or something in the future. And what you are seeing, though, is also that obviously, in the US, there were the checks and people's savings rates just went through the roof. People were paying down their debt at a massive rate.I mean, you saw Amex had one of its worst quarters during COVID, because they are so related to travel spending, restaurant spending. And now, it's kind of the reverse where Amex has posted some of its fastest growth. It is in those categories, restaurants, and travel is actually still in some sectors doing quite well, even though you do see overall a slowdown due to the recession. So consumers are a little bit, in my opinion, better off than what, you know, maybe the impression that you get from media is.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Sebastian, you mentioned that macroeconomic environment quite a few times here. I want to read this quote from the earnings call. You said some claimed Klarna would face difficulties in the tough macroeconomic climate with high interest rates. But having led the company through the 2008 financial crisis, we knew we had a strong and resilient business model to see us through. What did you learn from 2008 to help set up your business?SEBASTIAN SIEMIATKOWSKI: Well, I think, I mean, when we started the company we were simply providing a digital alternative to classical retail banks and card options. And we copied a lot of their business models, where we had a too big dependency on late fees. We had too much revolving credit, which revolving to me is one of the worst concepts, because people don't really understand revolving, like, what am I paying? And when am I ever going to pay this off? And people build balances.So one of the things that we started experimenting with and trying to learn was to find a healthier credit model, one that would both give consumers an option. And there's a McKinsey study in the US that showed about 20% of the credit card population in the US is very tired of old dirty tricks of it. I always recommend to watch credit cards explain on Netflix is a good-- we'll take you through all the tricks that the banks have been doing on us.And so there's like a big part of the population very tired of those tricks. And so if you build good products for them that they enjoy and that are more friendly and not trying to push you into too much success debt, then as a consequence of that you also get better performance during a tough environment, because you simply have people using it more responsibly as well.So this is very obviously different than the impression people have of buy-now-pay-now-later in media. But actually, if I compare our credit products to the credit cards, they are simply better for consumers.SEANA SMITH: Sebastian, you've jumped in on the recent AI excitement lately here with a number of your investments being in the AI space right now. How does it though-- we talk a lot about companies maybe mentioning AI here and there on their earnings calls. But it's not really impacting their business, helping their revenue, their bottom line here, our top line down the line. How do you see it helping your business, helping Klarna financially?SEBASTIAN SIEMIATKOWSKI: I'm so happy that you asked that question, because I think that's exactly is. There's so much noise. And people are like talking about this and that and making press releases. We have internally had about I think 2025 more kind of serious initiatives, which are targeting different areas. And we just in, I think, it was in May took our first one live that has already by removing basically fairly boring unnecessary work elements that were just boring for people to do but saved a lot of time.So I think we've already seen, you know, about $4 or $5 million worth of savings on an annual basis in unnecessary. So this is like very concrete to me. It's real-- it's real efficiency gains. That's coming out of this. And then you obviously have to be mindful of the privacy aspects and a lot of other things that are consistently being mentioned. And yes, it's not-- if you want to use it for math, don't use it for math. It's not great for math. You know, like there's things that people will write, oh, it didn't do 2 plus 2 correctly, whatever.But if you apply it correctly, there are already very concrete gains from efficiency. And then also, we obviously have a very exciting amount of products coming out soon that we think will have also material impact for consumers but even just like, you know, a few million bucks is quite good.SEANA SMITH: It is quite good. I don't think investors are going to be really hating the fact that you are able to save a few million bucks because of some of these investments. Sebastian, always great to have you. We look forward to having you back on Yahoo Finance soon. Thanks.SEBASTIAN SIEMIATKOWSKI: Thank you for having me.]"

(PYPL) is a Trending Stock",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-paypal-holdings-130010939.html,1693918810,STORY,['PYPL'],"[Paypal (PYPL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this technology platform and digital payments company have returned -1.3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Paypal belongs, has lost 1.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Paypal is expected to post earnings of $1.22 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2%.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.95 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +19.9%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.62 indicates a change of +13.5% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Paypal.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Paypal, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.4 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +8.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $29.7 billion and $32.41 billion estimates indicate +7.9% and +9.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPaypal reported revenues of $7.29 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.1%. EPS of $1.16 for the same period compares with $0.93 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.26 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.43%. The EPS surprise was 0%.Over the last four quarters, Paypal surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Paypal is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Paypal. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In that report, analysts expect IBM to post earnings of $2.13 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 17.68%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $14.82 billion, up 5.02% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $9.43 per share and revenue of $61.49 billion, which would represent changes of +3.29% and +1.58%, respectively, from the prior year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for IBM should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. IBM is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors should also note IBM's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 15.68. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 17.23.Story continuesWe can also see that IBM currently has a PEG ratio of 3.76. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate.

Both executives reiterated they want to reach a ""fair"" agreement without a strike. The executives did not detail GM's economic proposals to the UAW.

Autoblog Editor-in-Chief Greg Migliore agrees with Biden, saying the likelihood of a strike is ""still relatively low."" ""That being said, this is the most aggressive, I would say, bargaining tactics we've seen from the UAW in quite some time,"" Migliore adds. Migliore also explains that with a pro-union president in the White House and the ongoing Hollywood strikes gaining support, ""the mood for labor in this country is definitely swinging to a climate where there would be some support for workers.""Video Transcript- In August, the United Auto Workers union overwhelmingly voted to stop production if demands on pay and benefits were not met. Facing the calls are the big three automakers, General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis. Negotiators are discussing four-year contracts for around 150,000 hourly workers. And specifically, the UAW is demanding a 46% pay raise and a 32-hour week with 40 hours of pay. The Union's current contract expires at just before midnight on September 14, so we're coming up to it. President Biden, often labeled the most pro-union president ever, yesterday downplayed the threat of a strike, saying he thinks any kind of action is unlikely to happen.Joining us now is Greg Migliore, Autoblog's editor in chief. And Greg, I know you've been watching this very closely as well. Put this in perspective for us. The likelihood of a strike, how this compares to past actions because we've got new leadership at the UAW. Give us what we need to going into this deadline.GREG MIGLOIRE: Yeah. Hey, good morning, everybody. I would agree with the President that I think the likelihood of a strike is still relatively low. That being said, this is the most aggressive I would say bargaining tactics we've seen from the UAW in quite some time. They last struck in 2019 against General Motors, and that was, I believe, it was a 40-day strike that cost the company billions of dollars.Story continuesSo it's certainly not in the best interest of the Detroit Three to have to weather another strike. Again, the broader economic impact, even for a relatively short strike, would get into the billions. So they certainly want to-- it's in everyone's best interests, if you will, to try to come to an agreement before that September 14th deadline.- Greg, it sounds like the auto manufacturers, at least GM and Ford, are confident that they'll be able to avert a strike. Ford saying-- or excuse me, GM saying in their most recent earnings call that we have a long history of negotiating fair contracts with both unions that reward employees, support long term success of the business. Goal this time, no different. But if they do not see a similar kind of success as they have seen in the past this time, what type of hit could we be talking about in terms of the prioritization of certain production standards and goals that they had set forth?GREG MIGLOIRE: Well, the way the General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis, which was Chrysler, the way their manufacturing footprints are set up, everything is very interrelated. So the UAW could choose a couple of different paths. They could do like a full national strike, or they could do a targeted strike, which could be just as effective. If you shut down one or two very specific plants that make a specific part, that's essentially as good as shutting down the whole company. So we could see a couple of different paths here.I think it's also worth noting that the UAW is under new leadership. Shawn Fain. He's been in office a relatively short time, and he's taken definitely a more outspoken, some might say argumentative, approach. But I think UAW leadership also sees opportunity. You have a President in the Oval Office who is the most pro-union, as he says, in generations. You have a highly publicized writer's strike going on in Hollywood.I think the mood for labor in this country is definitely swinging to a climate where there would be some support for workers. So I think the UAW president senses some opportunity here. And I think what he's doing is leveraging it. I wouldn't necessarily call it saber-rattling, but I think he's definitely making a lot of demands, which is good negotiation, in an attempt to get probably a part of what he's asking for. Do I think they're going to get a 46% wage increase? I think that's probably unlikely. But I think they could definitely get some significant concessions from the Detroit Three, which would certainly be a victory for the union.]"
198,fc7d12a1-42b1-394e-9ac9-886869576ba1,GM,2023-09-06,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights General Motors and PACCAR,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-industry-outlook-highlights-general-115700108.html,1693915020,STORY,"['PCAR', 'GM', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – September 5, 2023 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses General Motors GM and PACCAR PCAR.Industry: Automakers (Domestic)Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2143422/ride-the-domestic-auto-industrys-resilience-with-these-2-stocksDespite concerns over higher borrowing costs, Americans' unwavering love for cars and pent-up demand are boosting the outlook of the Zacks Domestic Auto Industry. The industry is set to benefit from strong consumer demand and improved inventory levels, rising incentives and the surging popularity of electric vehicles (EVs).Capitalizing on favorable market trends, domestic automakers are enjoying robust recovery and growth as they overcome pandemic-related challenges. Investors can ride the industry's strength with stocks like General Motors and PACCAR to fetch handsome gains.About the IndustryThe Zacks Domestic Auto industry includes companies that are engaged in designing, manufacturing and retailing vehicles across the globe. These include passenger cars, crossover vehicles, sport utility vehicles, trucks, vans, motorcycles and electric vehicles. The industry — which is highly consumer cyclic and provides employment to a large number of people — is at the forefront of innovation, courtesy of its nature and the transformation that it is going through.The widespread usage of technology and rapid digitization are resulting in a fundamental restructuring of the automotive market. Several companies in the industry have engine and transmission plants and conduct research and development, and testing of electric and autonomous vehicles.Key Investing ThemesDemand Remains Strong Despite High Borrowing Costs:  At the outset of 2023, industry experts anticipated a potential deceleration in the U.S. car market amid the increased cost of vehicle financing. However, consumer demand demonstrated greater resilience than anticipated. New vehicle sales in the second quarter of 2023 topped 4 million units, implying year-over-year and sequential growth of roughly 15% and 13%, respectively.Story continuesOver the first six months, the market achieved sales of approximately 7.69 million units, reflecting a 12.3% increase from the same period in 2022. The demand for automobiles remains strong, indicating that the rise in interest rates has not yet significantly affected purchasing decisions. Quoting Cox Automotive's chief economist Jonathan Smoke, ""Consumers have found a way to buy new wheels.""Although the Fed has indicated the possibility of more rate hikes in the near future, the U.S. vehicle sales outlook for 2023 remains strong. Cox Automotive forecasts full-year vehicle sales at around 15 million units, up from 13.9 million units in 2022.Improving Inventory Levels: Supply constraints have been considerably alleviated. Limited new-vehicle inventory over the past two years that had handcuffed sales is no longer a pressing concern. According to Cox Automotive, new vehicle inventory levels in the United States saw a significant increase of more than 70% in July compared to the same period last year.This increase in inventory availability bodes well for the industry, signaling a potential shift toward a more balanced state between supply and demand. Robust inventories are leading to richer incentives and sweeter discount deals. Incentives increased for the 10th straight month in July to the highest level since October 2021. All these factors are driving the prospects of the industry.Soaring EV Popularity: Heightened climate change concerns, advancements in technology, and strict fuel-emission regulations are resulting in the widespread adoption of eco-friendly vehicles. The demand for electric vehicles is on an upward trajectory, consistently setting new sales records. Last year was the biggest for zero-emission vehicles in the United States.Additionally, 2023 is poised to be a landmark year, with U.S. EV sales projected to surpass 1 million units for the first time. Established car manufacturers are putting in substantial efforts to establish a strong presence in the thriving e-mobility sector. Further, the Inflation Reduction Act is expected to provide a further boost to EV sales. With this ongoing momentum and the anticipated growth ahead, the U.S. auto industry's outlook in the EV market appears promising.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe Zacks Automotive – Domestic industry is an 18-stock group within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #72, which places it in the top 29% of around 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group's earnings growth potential.The industry's earnings estimates for 2023 have increased 7% over the past six months.Before we present you two top-ranked stocks from the industry, let's take a look at the industry's stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Domestic Auto industry has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and sector over the past year. The industry has lost 14.2% against the S&amp;P 500's growth of 15.1%. The sector has declined 7.1% over the said time frame.Industry's Current ValuationSince automotive companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 17.49X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 13.46X and the sector's 12.53X. Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 58.44X, as low as 8.78X and at a median of 18.54X.2 Stocks to BuyGeneral Motors: One of the world's largest automakers, General Motors held the largest share of the U.S. auto market at 16% in 2022. General Motors' compelling portfolio with strong demand for its quality full-size pickups and SUVs bodes well. The company's hot-selling brands in America like Chevrolet Silverado, Equinox and GMC Sierra are driving the top line.  Encouragingly, this legacy U.S. automaker will have nine EV models in the North America market this year, which will buoy top-line growth.The company's Ultium platform and battery plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Lansing, MI are set to scale up its e-mobility prowess. Its superior liquidity profile also instills confidence. General Motors' strides in autonomous vehicle development also augur well for long-term growth.GM currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Motors' 2023 sales implies year-over-year growth of 9.25%. The consensus mark for GM's 2023 and 2024 EPS has moved north by 12 cents and 15 cents, respectively, over the past 30 days. Over the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed estimates on three occasions and missed once, the average surprise being 22.6%.PACCAR: Headquartered in Bellevue, PACCAR is one of the leading names in the trucking business with reputed brands like Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF. The new DAF lineup, comprising the XF, XG and XD models, is driving the firm's revenues. Continued growth in aftermarket parts — which is a high margin and a less cyclic business, thanks to the rampant adoption of its proprietary MX engine — bodes well.Accelerated efforts toward electrification, connected vehicle services and advanced driver-assistance system options are set to bolster PACCAR's prospects. A solid balance sheet with low leverage is another tailwind. PACCAR's strong balance sheet is complemented by A+ and A1 credit ratings assigned by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, respectively.PACCAR currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PACCAR's 2023 sales and earnings implies year-over-year growth of 19% and 48.5%, respectively. The consensus mark for PCAR's 2023 and 2024 EPS has moved north by 70 cents and 38 cents, respectively, over the past 60 days. Over the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed estimates on all occasions, the average surprise being 15.2%.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

You can skip our detailed analysis on the spice industry and head over directly to the Top 10 Spice Producing Countries in the World.Spices are used in both fresh and dry form for seasoning and preservation of food, as well as adding flavor to it. They are the 618th most traded product in the world, according to The Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC).In addition to being used by the food and beverages industry, spices are also now being widely utilized by the cosmetics industry due to their organic and healing properties. A number of herbs and spices are used as ingredients in the production of perfumes and colognes, such as cinnamon, vanilla, saffron, chili pepper, ginger, coriander, and cardamom. Terre d'Hermès first used black pepper in its Hermès Twilly perfume to create a warm and sensual fragrance. On the other hand, vanilla is widely used as an ingredient in several other perfume brands, including but not limited to Saint Laurent, Dior, and Chanel.The global spices and seasoning industry is estimated to have had a value of approximately $18 billion in 2021, and is projected to grow to $25.4 billion by 2029 at a compound annual growth rate of 4.67%, as noted by Fortune Business Insights. Asia on a whole constitutes more than 80% of all production of spices, a major chunk of it coming from southern Asia. Some of the largest spice companies in the region include India’s Everest Food Products Pvt Ltd and Mahashian Di Hatti Private Limited (MDH), which both together hold around 30% share of the country's spice market.Everest's products are stocked by more than 400,000 stores nationwide.

For a quick overview of the top 10, read our article 10 Friendliest Cities in America. The United States has become a successful center of cultural blending over the years. Its diversity is a key driver of its success. The 2020 Diversity Index shows that the racial and ethnic diversity within the United States is 61.1%. This index measures the likelihood that two people chosen at random will be from different races or ethnicities. This diversity not only fosters a climate of freedom in terms of political and cultural beliefs but also serves as a magnetic force, drawing people from all corners of the world to immigrate to the United States.According to a Pew Research Center's 2023 survey, 59% of people voted Americans as friendly, indicating that America's soft power remains strong.Therefore, it is not surprising that the US receives a large influx of foreign visitors each year from Canada, Europe, and other regions and is one of the most visited countries in the world. A Peak into the US Tourism IndustryTourism is one of the major contributors to the US economy, with its contribution projected to be $2.6 billion in gross domestic product (GDP) over the next decade. According to the State Comptroller, New York City is among the most popular destinations globally and is especially popular with digital nomads. Moreover, international travel spending in the country has been predicted to surge even further than the $112.1 billion recorded in September of 2022. Experts believe that the figure could go up to $1.39 trillion by the end of 2025.United Airlines (NASDAQ: UAL) published performance reports for the second quarter of 2023 in July, which showed a three-fold growth in its profit. The impressive performance and higher revenue generation of the carrier have been credited to a busy summer international travel season. Story continuesAs reported in a News Release by United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), the airline recorded operating revenue of $14.2 billion from April to June, which was a 17.1% increase from the same time period in 2022. Meanwhile, billings surged to $1.1 billion, a substantial increase from $329 billion recorded in 2022. United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) entered into a commercial agreement in March 2023 with Emirates Airlines to enhance the network for each airline. The agreement will also open up newer destinations for customers.Meanwhile, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) has raised its earnings outlook due to the company closing the second quarter of 2023 on a strong note. It recorded a revenue of $14.01 billion, which exceeded analysts’ expectations and was 4.7% higher than the figure from 2022. The high airline revenues clearly suggest that tourism in the US is booming. Tourists are attracted to the beautiful beaches, rich history, and helpful locals of America. Moreover, volunteering and other Corporate Social Responsibility(CSR) activities from US companies further boost the positive image of the country.Charitable Efforts from Companies in the USMajor companies in the US lead the way when it comes to charitable efforts. For example, Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS)'s Disney Family Volunteering Reward Program in 2020 offered free tickets to people in exchange for a day of volunteer service, which motivated more than 1 million people in the US to participate.In February 2023, the company announced that it would be providing access to its diverse portfolio of innovative programs that have been uniquely developed for children's hospitals. These include complimentary access to digital content, in-hospital installations, and mobile cinema complexes.Another company that is playing its part in enhancing the positive image of the US is Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), a digital travel platform also known as booking.com. It joined hands with a climate tech company, CHOOOSE, in October 2022 to encourage people to travel more mindfully.

Finance Chief Gerald Laderman at the TD Cowen Transportation Conference said the first order of business is the expansion of the flight training center in Denver.Southwest said it continues to forecast a ""solid (third-quarter) profit"", but trimmed its expectations for revenue per available seat mile - a proxy for pricing power - to a 5% to 7% fall, compared with a 3% to 7% fall forecast earlier.Alaska Air expects a quarterly adjusted pre-tax margin of 10% to 12%, lower than its prior expectation of 14% to 16%.U.S. airlines do not generally hedge against fuel costs, making them vulnerable to price swings.""The relatively quick up move in fuel has given the industry little time to respond through fares,"" Citi Research analyst Stephen Trent said in a note.

(ISRG) a Buy Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-intuitive-surgical-inc-130005912.html,1693918805.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (ISRG) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this company have returned +0.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1% change. The Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, to which Intuitive Surgical, Inc. belongs, has lost 1.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.41 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.56 points to a change of +18.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.45 indicates a change of +16% from what Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Intuitive Surgical, Inc.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Intuitive Surgical, Inc. the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $1.77 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $7.13 billion and $8.16 billion estimates indicate +14.7% and +14.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIntuitive Surgical, Inc. reported revenues of $1.76 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.4%. EPS of $1.42 for the same period compares with $1.14 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.73 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.35%. The EPS surprise was +7.58%.Over the last four quarters, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intuitive Surgical, Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

213,1c2ccbeb-9ef4-3372-b919-1df0010b9381,WRK,2023-09-06,4 Paper and Related Products Stocks Countering Industry Headwinds,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-paper-related-products-stocks-134800434.html,1693921680,STORY,"['IP', '^GSPC', 'WRK', 'SMFKY']","[Of late, the Zacks Paper and Related Products industry has been impacted by weak packaging demand, as customer spending has been muted due to inflationary pressures. Nevertheless, increasing packaging requirements due to the rising trend in e-commerce activities and steady demand from consumer-oriented end markets, such as food and beverages and healthcare, will support the industry. The growing preference for paper as a sustainable and eco-friendly packaging option due to environmental concerns will act as a key driver for the industry.Players like International Paper Company IP, Smurfit Kappa Group plc SMFKY, WestRock Company WRK and Sappi SPPJY are likely to gain from the above-mentioned trends.About the IndustryThe Zacks Paper and Related Products industry comprises companies that manufacture and sell paper and paper products. The industry is highly diversified in terms of products ranging from graphic paper and packaging paper to absorbent hygiene products. Graphic papers, which include printing and writing papers, and newsprint, are utilized for communication purposes. The industry provides packaging solutions for liquid, food, pharmaceutical, beauty, household, commercial and industrial products. It also produces fluff and specialty pulps utilized in absorbent hygiene products, tissues and paper products. The industry caters to a wide array of industries, including food and beverage, farming, home and personal care, health, retail, e-commerce and transport. The industry players meet customers’ shipping, storage and display requirements with sustainable solutions.Major Trends Shaping the Future of the Paper and Related Products IndustryLow Consumer Spending, High Costs Are Near-Term Woes: The current inflationary pressures have been impacting consumers, leading to a lower demand for goods. This has impacted packaging demand as consumer priorities have shifted toward non-discretionary goods and services. Customers have been trying to lower their elevated inventories, impacting packaging demand. The companies in the industry had to cut down production levels to align with customer demand. Moreover, the industry is witnessing rising costs of transportation, chemical and fuel, and supply-chain headwinds. Thus, industry players are increasingly focusing on pricing actions and cost reduction, and resorting to automation in manufacturing to boost productivity and efficiency.Digitization Hurts Paper Demand: The transition to digital media has been eroding the graphic paper market for some time now. The same remains a persistent threat to the industry. Paperless communication, the increased use of email, less print advertising, more electronic billing and fewer catalogs dented graphic paper demand. Consequently, the industry is resorting to machine conversions into packaging and specialty papers. Paper consumption in schools, offices and businesses took a hit from the pandemic-led shutdowns. However, the demand picked up on the reopening of schools and offices.E-commerce &amp; Consumer Products to Support Packaging Demand: The industry’s considerable exposure to consumer-oriented end markets, including food and beverages, and healthcare, ensures steady growth in earnings. With e-commerce, packaging gained the utmost importance as it has to maintain the integrity of the product and be durable to withstand the complexity involved in delivering the product. Per Statista, global e-commerce revenues are projected to witness a CAGR of 11.2% from 2023 to 2027, representing a major growth opportunity for the industry. In 2022, e-commerce accounted for nearly 19% of retail sales worldwide and is expected to be 25 by 2027. India is expected to lead retail e-commerce development, seeing a CAGR of 14.11% between 2023 and 2027, closely followed by Brazil, Argentina and Turkey, with growth of 14.07%, 13.63% and 13.57%, respectively.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Paper and Related Products industry is a 12-stock group within the broader Basic Materials sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #236, which places it in the bottom 5% of the 249 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak prospects in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group's earnings growth potential. Year to date, the industry's earnings estimates for 2023 have moved down 13%, and the same for 2024 has declined 35%.Before we present a few Paper and Related Products stocks that investors can consider, it is worth looking at the industry’s stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Versus Broader MarketThe Paper and Related Products industry has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 and the sector over the past year. The stocks in this industry have dropped 3.7%, while the Basic Materials sector has risen 16.4%. The S&amp;P 500 composite has grown 15.6% during this time frame.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio, a commonly-used multiple for valuing Paper and Related Products companies, we see that the industry is currently trading at 9.9X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 11.32X and the Basic Material sector’s forward 12-month EV/EBITDA of 7.01X. This is shown in the charts below.Enterprise Value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio (F12M)Enterprise Value/EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio (F12M)Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 11.55X and as low as 5.00X, with the median being 9.50X.4 Paper and Related Products Stocks to ConsiderInternational Paper: The company is adding capacity to its existing plants and investing in new plants that will help it capitalize on the demand for corrugated and containerboard packaging, going forward.

214,5b442650-3ad6-3bd3-a4c4-ff8fee0cd794,CSX,2023-09-06,Is CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) Potentially Undervalued?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/csx-corporation-nasdaq-csx-potentially-130014072.html,1693918814,STORY,['CSX'],"[Let's talk about the popular CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX). The company's shares saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$34.34 and falling to the lows of US$30.19. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether CSX's current trading price of US$30.63 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at CSX’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for CSX What Is CSX Worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 7.8% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy CSX today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $33.23, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because CSX’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What kind of growth will CSX generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with a relatively muted profit growth of 3.1% expected over the next couple of years, growth doesn’t seem like a key driver for a buy decision for CSX, at least in the short term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in CSX’s future outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on CSX, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing CSX at this point in time. While conducting our analysis, we found that CSX has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore it.If you are no longer interested in CSX, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.Have feedback on this article?

The Fed has been consistently increasing interest rates since March 2022 but that hasn’t deterred consumers from spending on goods and services.Higher spending, driven by demand, has been helping the retail sector also. Moreover, consumers’ willingness to spend freely also benefits the consumer discretionary sector. Given this situation, stocks like Alto Ingredients, Inc. ALTO, Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. HGV, Marriott International, Inc. MAR, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL and OneSpaWorld Holdings Limited OSW are likely to benefit in the near term.Personal Spending IncreasesPersonal income increased $45 billion or 0.2% in July, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said on Aug 31. Even a marginal rise in income looks impressive amid persisting inflationary pressure.However, what’s more interesting is that Americans are spending more than they are earning as personal spending rose a solid 0.8% to $144.6 billion in July. Of these $102.7 billion were spent on services, while $41.9 billion were spent on goods.Solid consumer spending has also benefited the retail sector. Retail sales rose a solid 0.7% in July. This has so far been the best month for the retail sector since January 2023. Year over year, retail sales grew 3.2% in July.From May through July, retail sales grew 2.3% on a year-over-year basis.Understandably, consumers are confident about spending aggressively and are showing resilience despite the Fed continuing with its interest rate hikes. Also, spending has been getting a boost from the personal savings that consumers amassed during the pandemic.Spending Boosting GDPDespite inflationary pressures, which have seen the Fed aggressively increase interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2022 to take its benchmark rate to the range of 5.25%-5.5%, consumers continued spending, which has been boosting economic growth.Story continuesThe U.S.  GDP grew 2.1% in the second quarter, after accelerating 2% in the first quarter, despite growing fears of a recession owing to the aggressive interest rate hikes. Consumer spending, which accounts for the majority of economic activity, grew at an annual rate of 1.6% in the second quarter. This came after a strong performance with a 4.2% annual growth rate in the first three months of the year.Our ChoiceGiven this scenario it would be prudent to invest in consumer discretionary stocks. We have narrowed down our search to five such stocks. Each of these stocks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Alto Ingredients is a producer of specialty alcohols and essential ingredients.

The three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — were down 2.4%, 1.8% and 2.2%, respectively. The Dow posted its worst month since May, the S&amp;P 500 saw the worst monthly performance since February and the Nasdaq Composite recorded its worst month since November 2022. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite terminated a five-month win streak.Last month, U.S. stock markets faced major setbacks for the first time in 2023. Market participants remain worried about how markets will behave this month. September is historically the worst-performing month on Wall Street. In the absence of earnings results, the Fed’s September FOMC meeting will be the key focal point this month.In this regard, investors are hopeful that a series of recently released weak economic data may act as a barrier for the central bank to hike interest rates further. Maintenance of interest rate status quo may ensure a northbound journey for Wall Street.U.S. Economy Seems to be CoolingThe Department of Labor reported that nonfarm payrolls in August came in at 187,000, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 173,000. However, the data for July was revised downward by 30,000 to 157,000. The data for June was also revised downward by 80,000 to 105,000, marking it the smallest monthly gain since December 2020. The unemployment rate climbed to 3.8% in August from 3.5% in July. The consensus estimate was 3.6%. August marked the highest monthly unemployment rate since February 2022. Average hourly wage rate rose 0.2% in August compared with 0.4% in July. The consensus estimate was 0.3%. Year over year, the wage rate increased 4.3% in August, below the consensus estimate of 4.4%.The ADP private sector job data for August, and Job Opening and Labor Turnover Survey of July also indicated that the labor market is cooling. Moreover, second-quarter 2023 U.S. GDP growth rate was revised downward to 2.1% from 2.4% reported earlier.Story continuesThe Conference Board and the University of Michigan reported, respectively, that the consumer confidence index and consumer sentiment index fell sharply in August as consumers remained worried about the prolonged high inflation rate and a lesser number of job openings.The core PCE price Index — the Fed’s most favorite inflation gauge — increased 0.2% month over month and 4.2% year-over-year in July. Both data were lower than the consensus estimates.Buoyed by the above-mentioned weak economic data, the CME FedWatch tool is currently showing 93% probability that the Fed will keep the range of interest rate unchanged in the September FOMC meeting. There is a 7% chance that the rate will be hiked by 25 basis points. Notably, the existing range of 5.25-5.5%, is the highest since 2001.At this stage, growth stocks are likely to outperform markets in September as the Fed is unlikely to raise interest rates further and the fear of a near-term recession has reduced to a great extent.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five growth stocks that have solid upside left for the rest of 2023.

Fresh concerns over the banking sector, a weakening Chinese economy and fears of higher rates for a longer-than-expected period took a toll on investors’ sentiment. SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust SPY, the proxy version of the S&amp;P 500 Index, shed 1.4% last month.Despite the losses, some stocks in the ETF stood tall. We have highlighted five stocks that have gained in double digits or close to double digits and have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). These include Broadridge Financial Solutions BR, Arista Networks ANET, Nvidia NVDA, Eaton Corporation plc ETN and Ross Stores Inc. ROST.An analyst from Fitch Ratings slashed the outlook for the entire U.S. banking industry, possibly affecting the credit ratings of more than 70 banks, including giants JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC). The move came following multiple bank downgrades by fellow credit agency Moody’s and thus deepened worries for the sector. Additionally, retail sales and industrial production in the world’s second-biggest economy grew less than expected in July, thus intensifying worries over the health of the China economy (read: The New ETF That Protects Against All Market Losses).On the other hand, a raft of strong economic data kept alive fears of higher interest rates for a longer period. U.S. retail sales came in better than expected, rising 0.7% in July. Additionally, inflation rose for the first time in July after 12 straight months of decline.The Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, expressed confidence in continued economic growth in the United States, citing “robust” consumer spending and early signs of a recovery in the housing market. However, the Fed warned that inflation is still too high and that the central bank is prepared to raise interest rates further and keep the borrowing costs high until inflation comes down to the target range of 2%.Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of SPY.Story continuesSPY in FocusSPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust holds 503 stocks in its basket, with each accounting for no more than 7.5% of the assets.

Here, we spotlight basketball legend Tamika Catchings' unexpected path in discovering that small business is indeed her cup of tea.Tamika Catchings has transformed many of her dreams into reality.WNBA Champion and league MVP, NCAA Champion and nonprofit founder - check, check, check and check.And now, tea shop owner.""Every single night it came up in my dream,"" recalled Catchings of the two-week period before she purchased Indianapolis small business Tea's Me Caf&amp;eacute; in 2017. Catchings had initially explored other investor options with the former owners after learning the couple planned to move and close the quaint spot she frequented. But that nightly dream kept leading her back to the idea of taking her first shot at being an entrepreneur.""We grew up drinking tea; it's always been part of our family,"" Catchings said. ""I just loved the intimacy of the space, the ambience of this place. This is my own little oasis. To this day, I still lose track of time here.""And these days, you're just as likely to find Catchings behind the counter at Tea's Me as in front of it.""I will mop, I will sweep, clean the counters, whatever I can do,"" she said. ""I'm not going to ask my team to do anything I'm not doing as an owner.""Small-business owner - Catchings' newest title - offered the opportunity to take advantage of Inner City Capital Connections in Indianapolis. Regions Bank brought the tuition-free, ""mini-MBA on steroids"" business training program to the Circle City for the first time in 2022 to empower entrepreneurs whose businesses are in or near urban or economically under-resourced neighborhoods. Topics ranging from business strategy, to marketing, employee retention, access to capital and more are covered. Mentorships are formed. Coaching continues as long as the business owner wants it.The next city where Regions is taking ICCC? Nashville, Tennessee, this September.For Catchings, the ICCC workshop was a business day well spent.""Being able to meet and see people in your own field was really beneficial,"" she said. ""It was a chance to discuss dealing with the same things I'm going through - good and bad. I also loved the marketing and finance sessions and the speakers.""But, true to Catchings' athletic roots, it's ICCC's post-workshop one-on-one coaching that's made the greatest impact.""Having someone to bounce ideas off of has been so valuable,"" she said about her coach, who's based in New York. ""And the ICCC team regularly checks in to see how alumni are doing. They want to make sure the program is working and that you have the right mentor.""ICCC is part of the Initiative for a Competitive Inner City (ICIC), which was founded by Harvard Business School Professor Michael Porter to sow seeds of investment in America's cities. CEO Steve Grossman said training programs like the one Regions is taking to Nashville intentionally match entrepreneurs with coaches who can provide the most meaningful insights.""Soon after the program's opening seminar, we interview participants to learn about their unique pain points and how a mentor can help address the roadblocks they're facing,"" said Grossman. ""Whether it's the need for a marketing plan, an internet strategy or help with employee relations, we're able to foster valuable relationships that help accelerate the business owner's profitable growth.""Catchings will be the first to tell you that to be successful, the coaching relationship is a two-way street.""If you're going to do it, 60 percent is you,"" she said. ""The coaches are there to help, advise and guide, but it's really up to you. Those relationships will go as you go. Everything is only going to go as far as you allow it to go.""Catchings applies that same all-in approach in coaching Tea's Me's team members.""Coming in, what I learned from basketball is what I've tried to implement here,"" she explained. ""It's like locker room management and really being able to lead. It's ensuring we have a system set up for success by doing the little things that go a long way like showing up on time. We've already set you up if you follow the system. We are preparing our team members for the rest of their lives.""Another aspect Catchings has promoted among Tea's Me team members? A positive atmosphere.""I think our culture is one of a servant mindset in everything we do,"" she said. ""It involves teamwork, passion, fun and being inclusive. Similar to sports, you can't allow one person to bring your whole team down. My expectation is that our team is excellent.""That inclusive spirit is something customers feel each time they walk in Tea's Me's doors.""My motto is that everybody belongs here,"" said Catchings.Despite the challenges many small businesses have faced since 2020, Tea's Me recently expanded to three locations. It's also established a shipping model to distribute products nationwide and began bottling their Tea's in-house. Tea's Me's five flavored varieties are making their Indiana State Fair debut this month.It's proof Catchings' latest dream is coming true.But don't think it's all come easily.""Anything worth having, you have to work for,"" she said. ""But it's a blessing. I just love what we do.""And Catchings has some advice for her fellow entrepreneurs following her experience the past six years.""Scale your business according to what you really can do,"" she said.And for anyone considering applying for the Nashville ICCC program?""The question is why wouldn't you do it rather than asking why should you?"" she said.You can nominate an entrepreneur or apply for your small business to participate in the ICCC Nashville cohort.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Regions Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Regions BankWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/regions-bankEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Regions BankStory continuesAn All-American at Tennessee, Tamika Catchings was a 10-time WNBA All-Star / PHOTOS COURTESY OF THE INDIANA FEVER (left) MONICA BRAIZER PHOTOGRAPHY (right)Being able to meet and see people in your own field was really beneficial.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 0.42% loss on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.56%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.08%.Heading into today, shares of the global payments processor had gained 2.73% over the past month, outpacing the Business Services sector's gain of 1.77% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 1.02% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Visa as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.23, up 15.54% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $8.55 billion, up 9.82% from the year-ago period.V's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $8.65 per share and revenue of $32.6 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +15.33% and +11.21%, respectively.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Visa should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. Visa currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).In terms of valuation, Visa is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 28.67. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 14.2.Story continuesInvestors should also note that V has a PEG ratio of 1.86 right now. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Financial Transaction Services was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.26 at yesterday's closing price.The Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Business Services sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 100, putting it in the top 40% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

Their clients now may choose USDC stablecoin settlement instead of receiving fiat currencies.The payments company first started testing USDC for treasury operations in 2021. The company ran a pilot program with crypto exchange Crypto.com, using the Ethereum blockchain for settling cross-border payments made with Crypto.com Visa cards.“By leveraging stablecoins like USDC and global blockchain networks like Solana and Ethereum, we're helping to improve the speed of cross-border settlement and providing a modern option for our clients to easily send or receive funds from Visa’s treasury,” Cuy Sheffield, head of crypto at Visa, said in a statement.9/ It's still early days, but Visa has already settled millions of dollars of USDC over the Ethereum and Solana blockchains between our clients.

225,acfe44f8-130d-3e2f-bcad-2581fddac9c5,V,2023-09-06,Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About Visa (V): Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-bulls-look-optimistic-133005964.html,1693920605,STORY,['V'],"[When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Visa (V) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Visa currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.32, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 22 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.32 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 22 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 17 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 77.3% and 13.6% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for VBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for VCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Visa here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying Visa, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in V?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Visa, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $8.65.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Visa. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Visa.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

226,d06d3bb3-e160-3ac1-95ff-b7a01006c9d4,V,2023-09-06,Visa Inc. (V) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-inc-v-attracting-investor-130010674.html,1693918810,STORY,['V'],"[Visa (V) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this global payments processor have returned +2.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +1% change. During this period, the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, which Visa falls in, has gained 4.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Visa is expected to post earnings of $2.23 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.65 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +15.3%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.76 indicates a change of +12.8% from what Visa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Visa is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Visa, the consensus sales estimate of $8.55 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +9.8%. The $32.6 billion and $35.88 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11.2% and +10.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVisa reported revenues of $8.12 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.7%. EPS of $2.16 for the same period compares with $1.98 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.06 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.72%. The EPS surprise was +2.37%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Visa is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Visa. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

After a purchase, the cardholder’s bank wires money to Visa’s treasury, from which Visa pulls the funds and sends them to the merchant’s bank.This is usually done in fiat currency, but the payments giant has previously allowed companies, mostly crypto-native firms like Crypto.com, to send payments to its treasury via USDC, the dollar-backed stablecoin issued by Circle.Now, Visa, which has a dedicated account with Circle, will begin to send USDC out of its treasury to two large payments firms—Worldpay and Nuvei—which, in turn, can directly facilitate payments for merchants. The companies have decided to send and receive USDC on Solana because of the blockchain’s capacity to process transitions more quickly than on Ethereum’s.“Expanding the pilot exemplifies how pairing USDC with Visa’s innovation opens up the future of payments, commerce, and financial applications,” Jeremy Allaire, Circle’s cofounder and CEO, said in a statement.Despite the promise of stablecoins to speed up bank transfers, the processing time to transfer money into or out of its treasury will remain the same, Cuy Sheffield, Visa’s head of crypto, told Fortune.“In this early stage, we’re really just giving the option to send or receive USDC instead of a bank wire, but we’re not sending money out faster or receiving money in faster necessarily,” he said in an interview. “Over time, I think that there’s potential to start doing that.”The expansion of Visa’s USDC settlement process is yet another new crypto product or pilot to come out of a legacy payments company this year, despite ongoing, expansive regulatory action from the federal government against the crypto industry.In February, the SEC issued a Wells Notice, or a legal document that says the agency intends to sue a company, to Paxos, a stablecoin issuer. PayPal, which had partnered with Paxos to develop its own stablecoin, said it was “pausing” development amid the regulatory scrutiny. However, in August, the publicly traded payments firm indeed launched its stablecoin.Story continuesMastercard also has unveiled a new suite of crypto offerings, most recently it’s so-called Multi Token Network, or MTN. But just months later, Mastercard confirmed it was severing its partnership with Binance on prepaid crypto debit cards, after the SEC sued the world’s largest crypto exchange in June.A spokesperson for Visa also confirmed that the company had stopped issuing Binance cards in Europe as of this summer, and Sheffield, Visa’s crypto head, wouldn’t comment to Fortune on whether the payments firm plans to fully cut off its partnership with Binance.That being said, Visa’s latest pilot suggests that the firm isn’t cutting itself off from crypto, especially stablecoins, anytime soon. “We’ve gotten to the point where there’s a recognition that stablecoins can play a role in payments,” Sheffield told Fortune, “that they can solve real challenges.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

(NASDAQ:MARA) (""Marathon"" or ""Company""), a leader in supporting and securing the Bitcoin ecosystem, today published unaudited bitcoin (“BTC”) production and miner installation updates for August 2023.Management Commentary“We produced 1,072 bitcoin in August, which is a 9% decrease from last month and a more than fivefold increase from August of last year,” said Fred Thiel, Marathon’s chairman and CEO. “The decrease in bitcoin production from July was largely due to increased curtailment activity in Texas due to record high temperatures. These temporary shutdowns more than offset the progress we have made to increase our operational hash rate and optimize our operations.“In August, we increased our U.S. operational hash rate 2% month-over-month to 19.1 exahashes, and we increased our installed hash rate 1% month-over-month to 23.1 exahashes. The sequential increase is primarily due to swapping BITMAIN S19 J Pro miners for more efficient S19 XPs. We are still waiting for the facility in Garden City, Texas to come online as Applied Digital and the utility provider are still finalizing paperwork. Based on the latest updates, we continue to believe energization is imminent.“We also saw continued progress at our joint venture in Abu Dhabi which began hashing in July and mined 50 bitcoin in August of which approximately 10 bitcoin is our share. The JV’s operational hash rate grew to 1.5 exahashes, and we continue to expect the project’s full 7.0 exahashes to be online before year-end 2023.“During August, we reached our primary domestic growth target of 23 exahashes on an installed basis. As we look to our next growth target, I am pleased to announce that we have secured miners in the ordinary course of business for the next 5 exahashes of hash rate growth. With 23 exahashes installed domestically, two exahashes planned internationally, and an additional five exahashes of capacity contracted for, Marathon’s total anticipated hash rate, once fully deployed, is now 30 exahashes.”Story continuesOperational Highlights and UpdatesFigure 1: U.S. Operational HighlightsMetric8/31/20238/31/2022% Δ 8/31/20237/31/2023% ΔBitcoin Produced - U.S. Only1,062184.1     477% 1,0621,176 -10%Average Bitcoin Produced per Day34.35.9     477% 34.337.9 -10%Operational/Energized Hash Rate (EH/s)119.10.6     2884% 19.118.8 2%Average Operational Hash Rate (EH/s)213.2NA  13.214.0 -6%Installed Hash Rate (EH/s)323.10.6     3509% 23.122.8 1%1.

229,11f7e9f7-b0ff-3695-a62f-f8b126dca63f,MAR,2023-09-06,5 Stocks to Add to Your Portfolio on Soaring Consumer Spending,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-stocks-add-portfolio-soaring-134200411.html,1693921320,STORY,"['MAR', 'RCL', 'HGV', 'OSW']","[Consumers in the United States are spending aggressively despite slowing personal income and sharply increasing interest rates. The Fed has been consistently increasing interest rates since March 2022 but that hasn’t deterred consumers from spending on goods and services.Higher spending, driven by demand, has been helping the retail sector also. Moreover, consumers’ willingness to spend freely also benefits the consumer discretionary sector. Given this situation, stocks like Alto Ingredients, Inc. ALTO, Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. HGV, Marriott International, Inc. MAR, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL and OneSpaWorld Holdings Limited OSW are likely to benefit in the near term.Personal Spending IncreasesPersonal income increased $45 billion or 0.2% in July, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said on Aug 31. Even a marginal rise in income looks impressive amid persisting inflationary pressure.However, what’s more interesting is that Americans are spending more than they are earning as personal spending rose a solid 0.8% to $144.6 billion in July. Of these $102.7 billion were spent on services, while $41.9 billion were spent on goods.Solid consumer spending has also benefited the retail sector. Retail sales rose a solid 0.7% in July. This has so far been the best month for the retail sector since January 2023. Year over year, retail sales grew 3.2% in July.From May through July, retail sales grew 2.3% on a year-over-year basis.Understandably, consumers are confident about spending aggressively and are showing resilience despite the Fed continuing with its interest rate hikes. Also, spending has been getting a boost from the personal savings that consumers amassed during the pandemic.Spending Boosting GDPDespite inflationary pressures, which have seen the Fed aggressively increase interest rates by 525 basis points since March 2022 to take its benchmark rate to the range of 5.25%-5.5%, consumers continued spending, which has been boosting economic growth.Story continuesThe U.S.  GDP grew 2.1% in the second quarter, after accelerating 2% in the first quarter, despite growing fears of a recession owing to the aggressive interest rate hikes. Consumer spending, which accounts for the majority of economic activity, grew at an annual rate of 1.6% in the second quarter. This came after a strong performance with a 4.2% annual growth rate in the first three months of the year.Our ChoiceGiven this scenario it would be prudent to invest in consumer discretionary stocks. We have narrowed down our search to five such stocks. Each of these stocks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Alto Ingredients is a producer of specialty alcohols and essential ingredients.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 0.42% loss on the day. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.56%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.08%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the largest U.S. cellphone carrier had gained 7.16% over the past month. This has outpaced the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 2.78% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 1.02% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Verizon Communications as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, Verizon Communications is projected to report earnings of $1.20 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 9.09%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $33.47 billion, down 2.24% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $4.73 per share and revenue of $133.57 billion, which would represent changes of -8.69% and -2.39%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Verizon Communications. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.05% higher. Verizon Communications is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Story continuesValuation is also important, so investors should note that Verizon Communications has a Forward P/E ratio of 7.37 right now.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Atmos Energy ATO, TopBuild BLD and NVIDIA NVDA.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:OI Glass is shaping up to be a sound investment in terms of growth and value landing a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and the Bull of the Day.Formally known as Owens-Illinois, OI Glass stock may be a strong option for investors' portfolios as the largest manufacturer of glass containers in the world.Furthermore, the Zacks Glass Products Industry is currently in the top 7% of over 250 Zacks industries indicating now may be an ideal time to buy OI Glass stock as a leader in the space.Undervalued Growth The broader glass industry is starting to experience new heights in its post-pandemic recovery. The operating environment for many glass products companies has stabilized despite what is still challenging macro conditions.However, OI Glass's main initiative is focused on margin expansion to help offset the impact of softer demand and it's starting to show. Fiscal 2023 earnings are now forecasted to soar 39% to $3.21 per share versus EPS of $2.30 last year.Plus, FY24 earnings are expected to be up another 1% and it's noteworthy that OI Glass has now surpassed EPS estimates for 12 consecutive quarters. Annual earnings estimates for both FY23 and FY24 have continued to trend higher over the last 60 days with OI Glass most recently beating Q2 EPS estimates by 6% in early August.Attractive Valuation &amp; Lofty Price TargetMaking OI Glass's growth and bottom line expansion look undervalued is the fact that its stock trades at $19 and just 6.3X forward earnings.Although OI Glass stock is up a respectable +18% YTD, rising earnings estimates support the notion that OI shares are still cheap, offering a 46% discount to its industry average of 11.7X and trading well below the S&amp;P 500's 21.1X.Story continuesMore reassuring is that analysts are starting to take notice as well. To that point, the Average Zacks Price Target of $27.86 a share represents 37% upside for OI Glass stock. Plus, five of the seven brokers surveyed by Zacks.com that cover OI Glass stock have strong buy ratings.Bottom LineIt's often wise for investors to own stock in a company that has dominance or an edge in its market. Even better is when investors can get this exposure at an attractive discount and OI Glass stock seems to fit the bill.Bear of the Day:Investors may want to start monitoring the premium they are paying for Kforce stock as earnings estimate revisions have remained lower over the last two 60 days.The professional staffing services company is coming off of a weaker-than-expected second quarter and there could be more downside risk ahead.Subpar Q2 Results It has been over a month since Kforce reported underwhelming Q2 results in late July but the trend in earnings estimates remains bleak.Kforce stated its second quarter reflected the continuation of an uncertain economic environment with the company needing to adjust its structural costs to align with lower levels of revenue. Notably, Q2 sales of $389.19 million missed estimates by roughly -2% and dropped -11% from the prior-year quarter.More concerning, Q2 earnings of $0.95 per share came up -3% short of expectations and dropped -27% from a year ago. This also marked the second straight quarter of missing top and bottom line expectations.Following Kforce's Q2 report, annual earnings estimates have remained -8% lower for fiscal 2023 and -11% lower for FY24. Although Kforce's stock is still up a modest +12% YTD, shares of KFRC are down -6% since the company's Q2 report and lower EPS estimates are a sign the decline could continue.Less Attractive ValuationDeclining earnings estimates have made Kforce's P/E valuation less attractive relative to its peers. Trading at $61 a share and 19.3X forward earnings, Kforce stock trades slightly beneath the S&amp;P 500's 21.1X but 22% above the Zacks Staffing Firms Industry average of 15.7X.This industry includes companies like GEE Group JOB and Heidrick &amp; Struggles International HSII which have seen their annual earnings estimates go up despite a challenging operating environment and may be better options at the moment.Furthermore, GEE Group and Heidrick &amp; Struggles stock both trade under 10X forward earnings which is a more specific example of why investors might want to monitor the premium they are paying for Kforce stock.Bottom LineKforce should still have the potential to be a meaningful investment as it relates to the business services sector but now doesn't look like a good time to buy. Right now It may be best to stay on the sidelines in regard to Kforce's stock as there are better options in the Zacks Staffing Firms Industry with GEE Group's stock currently boasting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Heidrick &amp; Struggles stock sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Additional content:3 Winners as Cooling Jobs Market Lifts Rate Hike Pause HopesStock investors, lately, have been focusing on the latest economic reports to ascertain the Federal Reserve's near-term monetary policy pronouncements.Fed Chair Jerome Powell, at the conference in Jackson Hole held in late August, said that price pressures may have lessened, but it is not yet at a satisfactory level. After all, the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation remains higher than its desired target of 2%.However, it seems the Fed is largely done with hiking interest rates as the labor market cools down in August. The jobless rate edged up to 3.8% in August, more than analysts' forecast that it will remain at a multi-decade low at 3.5%, added the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally, the real unemployment rate, which includes discouraged and part-time workers, jumped to 7.1%, the highest since May 2022.Job additions, by the way, have continued to slow down since the beginning of the year. The U.S. economy added 187,000 new jobs in August, but that's below the coveted 200,000 mark for the third successive month. Increases in nonfarm payrolls, in reality, were revised substantially lower for June and July.Average hourly earnings may have increased 0.2% month over month in August and 4.3% from a year ago, but remain less than analysts' estimate of 0.3% and 4.4%, respectively, a tell-tale sign that inflationary pressures are certainly poised to diminish further.Softening labor market data coupled with ebbing inflation, thus, signifies that the Fed has successfully orchestrated a soft landing. Around 93% of market participants expect the central bank to keep interest rates unchanged in the September meeting. Similarly, 62% expect rates to remain unaltered in November, per the CME FedWatch Tool.Hence, from an investment perspective, utility companies like Atmos Energy are well-positioned to gain from a rate hike pause. Being capital-intensive, utility companies need funding from external sources, leading to higher levels of debt. So, a lower interest rate environment reduces their debt levels. This, in turn, helps them pay off liabilities and register profits.Encouraging regulatory outcomes and steady customer additions, in the interim, are helping Atmos Energy's performance. The natural gas distributor presently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 0.3% over the past 60 days. ATO's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 8%. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.The borrowing costs of real estate projects increase along with higher interest rates. Therefore, a rate hike pause bodes well for real estate activities and benefits stocks such as TopBuild.TopBuild, known for providing various building products to the construction industry in the United States, currently has a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 11% over the past 60 days. BLD's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 6.1%.Lastly, tech companies like NVIDIA gain from rate hike pauses since their future cash inflows get disrupted if interest rates edge up. Recently, the chipmaker posted blowout quarterly earnings banking on the stupendous growth in the artificial intelligence field (read more: Nvidia &amp; 2 Other AI Stocks You'll Regret Not Buying Soon).NVIDIA, at present, has a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 36.6% over the past 60 days. NVDA's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 213.2%.Shares of Atmos Energy, TopBuild and NVIDIA have gained 3%, 89.5%, and 231.9%, respectively, so far this year.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Nvidia declined to comment.The Series B funding round was led by the Singapore-based Temasek, and included the Palo Alto, California venture firm Playground Global and Microsoft.""This is capital that understands what it takes to build a semiconductor business,"" CEO Sid Sheth told Reuters. ""They've done it in the past. This is capital that can stay with us for the long term.""The Santa Clara company started its fundraising process roughly a year ago, Sheth said. The company did not disclose the valuation, and it has previously raised $44 million.D-Matrix designs chips that are optimized to help power generative AI applications such as ChatGPT. The company designs the chips with digital ""in-memory compute"" that enables AI computer code to run more efficiently. The company's chip technology uses less energy to crunch data required to spit out generative AI responses, and is optimized for such tasks.D-Matrix sets itself apart from Nvidia, in part, because its technology aims at the ""inference"" portion of AI processing, and does not compete with Nvidia by making technology that trains large AI models.""We have solved the computer architecture,"" Playground partner Sasha Ostojic said. ""We have solved the low power requirements and the needs of a data center - (we) built a software stack to deliver the lowest latency in the industry by orders of magnitude.""Microsoft has committed to evaluating the chip for its own use when it launches next year, Sheth told Reuters.D-Matrix projects that it will receive under $10 million in revenue this year - largely from customers purchasing chips to evaluate.

242,b7b84d87-55fd-4a2d-aefd-912a5b447c87,NVDA,2023-09-06,The deal that could break the IPO logjam: Morning Brief,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-deal-that-could-break-the-ipo-logjam-morning-brief-100001449.html,1693994401,STORY,"['NVDA', 'ARM']","[This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:The chart of the dayWhat we're watchingWhat we're readingEconomic data releases and earningsFor months, we’ve been following the drumbeat of news around the pending IPO of chip-designing giant Arm Holdings. We learned Tuesday that the company’s parent, SoftBank, was looking to raise up to $4.87 billion in the IPO, giving Arm a valuation of more than $52 billion.After the past couple of years, you'd be forgiven if you forgot what an IPO is. But now even just talking about something like this raises hopes that a debut this massive might finally open the IPO floodgates.The catalyst: investors potentially hungry to throw some money at some (hopefully) growthy new entrants besides, well, Nvidia.“It could feasibly be the deal that breaks the IPO logjam,” said Avery Spear, senior data analyst at the IPO research firm Renaissance Capital. It depends in large part on how Arm performs, not just on its first day of trading, but in the days, weeks, and months that follow, she said. A bump in shares could encourage other companies to debut, which could draw investor interest, in turn leading to more deals.Arm is both an indicator and an outlier. Its current estimated market cap is lower than $64 billion, the valuation at which SoftBank bought shares last month. But it’s higher than the $40 billion price tag that Nvidia (yes, Nvidia again) offered to buy Arm for before the deal was axed by regulators.That not-peak but not-as-bad-as-it-was valuation might give some reassurance to IPO hopefuls who have been watching the market and deciding when to strike. Many of them might still have to swallow a lowered valuation compared to the go-go days of 2021. “Many venture-backed companies will have to accept the reality of a ‘downround’ IPO if they raised in the top of the market in 2021,” said Brianne Lynch, head of market insight at EquityZen.Story continuesArm is unusual for an IPO in that it’s far from a startup, having been created in 1990 as a joint venture between Apple, Acorn Computers, and VLSI Technology. It was a public company before its purchase by SoftBank in 2016 for $32 billion. The next-largest IPO this year, Johnson &amp; Johnson spinoff Kenvue, also wasn’t a typical debut.Other years-in-the-making IPOs, like that of Instacart — which may finally come this year — could be more indicative of demand for unicorns going public, said Spear of Renaissance. Klaviyo, a maker of marketing automation software, could also be a good indicator.One encouraging sign for both public-market investors looking for fresh blood and private-company funders looking to exit — the Renaissance IPO ETF, which tracks newly public companies, is up more than 33% this year.Programming note: Brianne Lynch of EquityZen will join Yahoo Finance Live in the 10 a.m. ET hour on Wednesday.morning brief imageClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

DXCM, announced that its DexCom G6 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system can now connect with the Omnipod 5 Automated Insulin Delivery (AID) system in Germany. The Omnipod 5 AID system, developed by Insulet Corporation (PODD), is the first tubeless AID system that integrates with the DexCom G6 CGM system in Germany to automatically adjust insulin delivery and manage glucose levels both day and night.The DexCom G6 CGM system is approved for people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, aged 2 years and older.The Insulet Corporation’s Omnipod 5 AID system is cleared for individuals with type 1 diabetes, aged 2 years and older. Insulet Corporation achieved clearance for Omnipod 5 AID system based on clinical studies where the system achieved clinically meaningful health outcomes only when it is connected to DexCom CGM.DexCom added Omnipod AID to its CGM ecosystem in the U.K. in June.Price PerformanceShares of DexCom have lost 10% year to date against the industry’s 0.3% growth. The S&amp;P 500 Index has gained 18.6% in the same time frame.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDexCom AdvantageThe compatibility of the DexCom G6 CGM system and the PODD’s Omnipod 5 AID system offer a new option in Germany for people with diabetes who want to simplify their diabetes management and improve their health outcomes. The combination of these two devices can help users achieve better glucose control, lower A1C, reduce hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and increase time in range. Users can also benefit from the convenience, discretion, and flexibility of these tubeless and wireless devices.With the Omnipod 5 AID system, DexCom strengthens its position as the world’s most connected CGM, providing patients in Germany with more choice and flexibility for observing glucose data and delivering insulin. The benefits are likely to drive demand higher for DexCom G6 CGM system going forward, boosting the company’s top line.Notable DevelopmentsIn July, DexCom announced that its next-generation DexCom G7 CGM system received Health Canada’s approval for people with all types of diabetes, aged two years and above. The DexCom G7 has been built on the performance of DexCom CGM, which has been clinically proven to lower A1C, reduce hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and improve time in range.Story continuesAlthough approved by Health Canada, DexCom G7 is not yet available for purchase. DexCom Canada is working to make DexCom G7 available to diabetic Canadians by the end of 2023.The same month, DexCom announced better-than-expected second-quarter results. Impressive contributions from the Sensor segment, and domestic and international revenue growth were the key catalysts. Moreover, expansion of coverage for CGM systems during the quarter supported growth that is likely to continue for the rest of 2023. The availability of new sensors like G6 and G7 in new international markets is also boosting revenue growth.Additionally, the glucose monitoring market presents significant commercial opportunities for DXCM. The company’s prospects in alternative markets such as non-intensive diabetes management, hospital, gestational, pre-diabetes and obesity are likely to provide it with a competitive edge in the MedTech space.DexCom, Inc.

247,105463aa-f003-3f2b-8e25-2eec8f8fa73b,TRV,2023-09-06,TRV or ALL: Which P&C Insurance Stock Should You Hold Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trv-p-c-insurance-stock-170100177.html,1693933260,STORY,"['TRV', 'ALL']","[Prudent pricing, an improving rate environment, exposure growth, prudent underwriting and solid capital position poise property and casualty (P&amp;C) insurers well amid a volatile market. However, an active catastrophe environment could weigh on the upside.Global commercial insurance prices rose for 23 straight quarters, though the magnitude has slowed down, per Marsh Global Insurance Market Index. Global commercial insurance prices increased 4% in the first quarter, followed by a 3% rise in the second quarter of 2023.Improving pricing drives improved premiums and claims payment. Per Deloitte Insights, gross premiums are estimated to increase about sixfold to $722 billion by 2030. China and North America should account for more than two-thirds of the global market, per the report. Per Deloitte Insights, trends like commercial lines witnessing growth at a faster pace than personal lines and homeowners’ premiums improving better than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023. Per reports published in Carrier Management, direct premiums written across the P&amp;C business in 2023 are estimated to grow in the double digit.The insurance industry is rate sensitive. The Fed has already made three hikes in 2023, taking the tally to 11 since March 2022. An improving rate environment is a boon for insurers, especially long-tail insurers.Amid the tailwinds, the unpredictable nature of catastrophic events weighs on the underwriting profitability of insurers. Swiss Re estimated a global economic loss of $120 billion in the first half of 2023 from natural disasters, while insured losses were estimated to be about $50 billion. Per a report in the Insurance Journal, the combined net ratio in 2023 is estimated to be 102.2. Underwriting losses are expected to be largely due to soft performance in personal lines, which, in turn, is driven by higher catastrophe losses per Insurance Information Institute and Milliman.Nonetheless, the insurance industry continues to witness accelerated digitalization. Players are investing heavily in technology to improve scale and efficiencies.While a solid policyholders’ surplus will help the industry absorb losses, a sturdy capital level supports insurers in strategic mergers and acquisitions, investing in growth initiatives, engaging in share buybacks, increasing dividends or paying out special dividends.The industry has risen 11.5% year to date versus the Finance sector’s increase of 6.4%. The Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite has witnessed an increase of 18.6% in the said time frame.Here we focus on two P&amp;C insurers, namely The Travelers Companies Inc. TRV and The Allstate Corporation ALL. Travelers Companies, with a market capitalization of $37.2 billion, is one of the leading writers of auto and homeowners’ insurance, commercial U.S. P&amp;C insurer and the largest publicly-held personal lines carrier in the United States. Both companies carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Let’s now see how these P&amp;C insurers have fared in terms of some of the key metrics.Story continuesPrice PerformanceTRV has lost 13.5% year to date compared with ALL’s decline of 18.5%. Return on EquityTRV has a return on equity (ROE) of 10.8%, which exceeds ALL’s ROE of negative 14.7% and the industry average of 6.7%.Dividend YieldALL has a dividend yield of 3.2%, which tops the industry average of 0.3% and TRV’s dividend yield of 2.5%.Debt-to-EquityAllstate’s debt-to-equity ratio of 51.7 is higher than the industry average of 23.4 and TRV’s reading of 36.7.Growth ProjectionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings indicates a 3.3% decrease from the year-ago reported figure for TRV and 105.2% for ALL.The consensus estimate for 2024 earnings indicates a 36.69% increase from the year-ago reported figure for TRV and 712.6% for ALL.The expected long-term earnings growth for earnings is pegged at 10% for TRV and 7% for ALL, though both lag the industry average of 12.1%.ValuationThe price-to-book multiple of TRV is 1.7 lower than ALL’s multiple of 2.16. The industry average is 1.42.To ConcludeOur comparative analysis shows that TRV has the edge over ALL with respect to price performance, return on equity, growth projection, leverage and valuation.

248,2a9808bb-9c96-3fc0-a354-bf630fc2d305,GPC,2023-09-06,Unlocking Long-Term Value: How Genuine Parts and Lowe's Stand as Resilient Dividend Kings,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unlocking-long-term-value-genuine-154946217.html,1693842586,STORY,"['GPC', 'LOW']","[In the dynamic landscape of investing, Dividend Kings stand as the sturdy oaks in a field of willows, epitomizing both financial resilience and shareholder value. Using GuruFocus' All-in-One Screener, I delve deeper than just dividend yield or growth. I examine each company through the lens of five critical metricsshareholder yield, three-year share buyback ratio, three-year free cash flow growth rate (per share), payout ratio and percentage trading below the 52-week highto offer a more comprehensive view of financial health and shareholder friendliness.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with VFC. Click here to check it out. High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' PortfolioThis Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 YearsHow to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?Shareholder yield serves as an amalgamation of dividends and share buybacks, providing a holistic picture of how much capital is being returned to shareholders. Moving in sync with this, the three-year share buyback ratio offers valuable insights into a company's consistent commitment to repurchasing its own shares, which is often a strong indicator of management's confidence in the business. A parallel line of thought leads us to the three-year free cash flow growth rate, an indicator that drills down into how efficiently a company is generating free cash flow, which is essentially the lifeblood of any enterprise.Then comes the payout ratio, a gauge that measures what portion of earnings is being channeled back to shareholders as dividends. While a high ratio may satiate income-focused investors in the short term, it also raises questions about whether the company is reinvesting enough for sustainable growth. Last but not least, we look at the percentage trading below the 52-week high. This metric can signal whether a fundamentally strong Dividend King is currently trading at a discount, potentially offering a lucrative entry point for long-term investors.Story continuesIdentifying the must-have Dividend KingsBy meticulously evaluating Dividend Kings with a 50-year history against these metrics, we distinguish the must-have stocks from the rest of the pack. These companies are holistic performers that blend stability with growth prospects. So as we venture further into the analysis of these two dividend stocks, remember that this endeavor isn't merely about capitalizing on dividends. It's about comprehending the robust financial scaffolding that makes these companies long-term Dividend Kings.Genuine PartsGenuine Parts Co. (NYSE:GPC), despite its year-to-date return of -9%, commands attention as a stable play in the volatile retail - cyclical industry. Recent data puts it ahead of 65% of companies in its sector, showing resilience where others falter. With a second-quarter revenue surge to $5.92 billiona 6% year-over-year jumpGenuine Parts defies gravity, even as it bumps up its full-year outlook.Unlocking Long-Term Value: How Genuine Parts and Lowe's Stand as Resilient Dividend KingsGranted, the net income slid by 8% and operating income tumbled nearly 10%, but let's not forget the company beat its June 2023 earnings per shares expectations by a stunning 4%. Couple this with a three-year per-share revenue growth rate of 9.1% and a similarly laudable earnings per share growth rate of 23.4%, and you have got a mosaic of metrics that's not easy to ignore. So, why should you keep an eye on this Dividend King?First off, Genuine Parts ranks better than nearly 74% of companies in its sector for three-year free cash flow per share growth ratea whopping 23.6%. This prowess in generating cash amplifies its attractiveness. Further, its current price-earnings ratio sits at a modest 18.14, which, given its historical range, indicates that it's reasonably priced. To top it off, the shareholder yield stands at 1.4%, outperforming over half of the companies in its industry. While it may not scream ""high returns,"" this makes Genuine Parts a solid entrant in the cadre of must-have dividend stocks with good growth prospects.Lowe's CompaniesLowe's Companies Inc. (NYSE:LOW) has cemented itself as a dividend king in the retail - cyclical industry, making it one of the must-have dividend stocks for income investors. With a year-to-date return of 17%, Lowe's has showcased resilience even as it reported a year-over-year revenue decline of 9.17%, rounding off at $24.96 billion in August. However, let's not lose sight of the longer-term narrative.Unlocking Long-Term Value: How Genuine Parts and Lowe's Stand as Resilient Dividend KingsThe company's three-year revenue, earnings per share and free cash flow growth rates have been nothing short of stellar. Lowe's flaunts an 18% three-year revenue growth rate per share, better than nearly 80% of companies in its sector. Add to that a 23% earnings growth rate and an astonishing 44% free cash flow growth rate, placing it in the upper echelons of retail performers.Interestingly, the company has found a silver lining in its Pro sales, driving surprising strength amid the noise. This strategy highlights Lowe's focus on big-ticket items and discretionary spending as critical components of its earnings tapestry. Although top executives have pointed out that rising theft is cutting into earnings, the operating income still stands at a formidable $3.89 billion, down just 8% year over year. The net change in cash saw an overwhelming surge of 128%, rounding to $544 million.Moreover, Lowe's boasts an aggressive share buyback strategy, ranking better than 98% of its peers with a 7.6 share buyback ratio. Not to be overlooked, its shareholder yield of almost 3% ranks better than 61% of industry players, making it one of the top dividend stocks now. In essence, despite short-term headwinds, the company continues to offer strong shareholder value through its robust financial metrics and strategic focus. Given its proven track record and unwavering commitment to growth and shareholder return, it remains one of the leading dividend stocks with high returns that should not be ignored.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 5 Stocks with Rising Price Targets.Global stocks declined on September 6 due to concerns about slowing growth in China and Europe, leading to uncertainty about the overall economic outlook. Simultaneously, the dollar strengthened as investors assessed the potential for Federal Reserve interest rate changes. MSCI's worldwide stock index dropped by 0.1% as of 0845 GMT. European stocks extended their losses for the sixth consecutive session, driven by worries of a global economic slowdown and rising oil prices. The pan-European STOXX 600 index hit a one-week low, down 0.8% by 0845 GMT. In Asia, the Hang Seng Index closed 150 points lower, and China's CSI300 Index fell 0.22% amid expectations of a slower decline in China's exports for August. Chinese investor sentiment also wavered due to a private-sector survey indicating a sluggish pace of service activity in August. Concerns lingered about potential developments in China's property market, increased food and energy prices, and discussions on further oil production cuts, all of which could impact equity sentiment. Manufacturing activity in Germany, Britain, and the eurozone declined, and their service sectors entered contraction territory, adding to the pessimistic sentiment. Corporate bond issuance surged as the U.S. returned from the Labor Day holiday, putting pressure on U.S. Treasury yields. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields fluctuated, while the dollar reached a six-month high against a basket of currencies.  Additionally, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) is set to release U.S. services PMI data on Wednesday.Investors are evaluating recent signals regarding potential U.S. interest rate hikes. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has expressed a cautious approach to raising interest rates, emphasizing that recent data reveals a sustained decrease in inflation. Waller conveyed that there is no compelling reason to take immediate action and that the central bank can exercise patience while observing economic indicators. In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Waller indicated his inclination to maintain the status quo by keeping interest rates unchanged during the upcoming central bank meeting. He stressed the importance of relying on concrete data before making significant monetary policy decisions, suggesting that there is no rush to implement rate hikes. Waller's measured stance is grounded in the belief that the available evidence does not warrant any urgent adjustments to interest rates. This perspective underscores the Federal Reserve's commitment to data-driven decision-making, allowing them to make informed choices that align with the broader economic landscape. It implies that the central bank will closely monitor economic developments and trends before taking decisive action regarding interest rates.Story continuesThe recent resurgence of the US dollar is causing Asian currencies to plummet to levels not seen in several months, reported Bloomberg. This development has prompted authorities in both Japan and China to intensify their efforts to protect and stabilize their struggling exchange rates. In Japan, there has been a heightened concern regarding the rapid depreciation of the yen. The country issued its most robust warning in weeks to address this issue, signaling its readiness to respond to speculative activities in the foreign exchange market. This move underscores Japan's commitment to preventing excessive declines in its currency and maintaining stability. On the other hand, China has taken notable steps to defend its currency, the yuan. The country's central bank issued its most assertive guidance by setting the daily reference rate for the yuan, a managed currency. This action was taken as the yuan was trending towards levels not witnessed since 2007. The move demonstrates China's determination to counteract depreciation pressures on the yuan and ensure its exchange rate remains within acceptable parameters. Japan and China's actions reflect their concerns about the impact of a strengthening US dollar on their respective currencies. They are taking proactive measures to protect the competitiveness of their exports and maintain financial stability in their economies. These moves highlight the delicate balance that central banks and policymakers in Asia must strike as they navigate the challenges posed by currency fluctuations in the global economic landscape.On the stock market front, analysts are bullish on pharma stocks such as Akero Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:AKRO), Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) and ORIC Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORIC).

The analyst believes that the 2024 consensus estimates for Leqembi are now seen as ""attainable."" With Leqembi receiving full approval in July and anticipated FDA approval for donanemab in Q4, Morgan Stanley expects a relatively modest initial launch, followed by a significant uptick in prescriptions for Alzheimer's medications over the next 12 months in the United States.

For a quick overview of the top 10, read our article 10 Friendliest Cities in America. The United States has become a successful center of cultural blending over the years. Its diversity is a key driver of its success. The 2020 Diversity Index shows that the racial and ethnic diversity within the United States is 61.1%. This index measures the likelihood that two people chosen at random will be from different races or ethnicities. This diversity not only fosters a climate of freedom in terms of political and cultural beliefs but also serves as a magnetic force, drawing people from all corners of the world to immigrate to the United States.According to a Pew Research Center's 2023 survey, 59% of people voted Americans as friendly, indicating that America's soft power remains strong.Therefore, it is not surprising that the US receives a large influx of foreign visitors each year from Canada, Europe, and other regions and is one of the most visited countries in the world. A Peak into the US Tourism IndustryTourism is one of the major contributors to the US economy, with its contribution projected to be $2.6 billion in gross domestic product (GDP) over the next decade. According to the State Comptroller, New York City is among the most popular destinations globally and is especially popular with digital nomads. Moreover, international travel spending in the country has been predicted to surge even further than the $112.1 billion recorded in September of 2022. Experts believe that the figure could go up to $1.39 trillion by the end of 2025.United Airlines (NASDAQ: UAL) published performance reports for the second quarter of 2023 in July, which showed a three-fold growth in its profit. The impressive performance and higher revenue generation of the carrier have been credited to a busy summer international travel season. Story continuesAs reported in a News Release by United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), the airline recorded operating revenue of $14.2 billion from April to June, which was a 17.1% increase from the same time period in 2022. Meanwhile, billings surged to $1.1 billion, a substantial increase from $329 billion recorded in 2022. United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) entered into a commercial agreement in March 2023 with Emirates Airlines to enhance the network for each airline. The agreement will also open up newer destinations for customers.Meanwhile, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) has raised its earnings outlook due to the company closing the second quarter of 2023 on a strong note. It recorded a revenue of $14.01 billion, which exceeded analysts’ expectations and was 4.7% higher than the figure from 2022. The high airline revenues clearly suggest that tourism in the US is booming. Tourists are attracted to the beautiful beaches, rich history, and helpful locals of America. Moreover, volunteering and other Corporate Social Responsibility(CSR) activities from US companies further boost the positive image of the country.Charitable Efforts from Companies in the USMajor companies in the US lead the way when it comes to charitable efforts. For example, Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS)'s Disney Family Volunteering Reward Program in 2020 offered free tickets to people in exchange for a day of volunteer service, which motivated more than 1 million people in the US to participate.In February 2023, the company announced that it would be providing access to its diverse portfolio of innovative programs that have been uniquely developed for children's hospitals. These include complimentary access to digital content, in-hospital installations, and mobile cinema complexes.Another company that is playing its part in enhancing the positive image of the US is Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), a digital travel platform also known as booking.com. It joined hands with a climate tech company, CHOOOSE, in October 2022 to encourage people to travel more mindfully. Its primary aim for this partnership was to educate travelers on the carbon implications of their actions and help them find environmentally friendly products and services.30 Friendliest Cities in AmericaImage by qgadrian from PixabayMethodologyWe have defined ‘friendliest cities in the US’ as ones that are home to friendly locals who are nice to foreign travelers when asked for help.

257,332f6281-9457-3a8e-bd6c-623023abf8e0,DIS,2023-09-06,Column: A plague on both Disney and Spectrum for treating their customers like crap,LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/column-plague-both-disney-spectrum-100035816.html,1693994435,STORY,"['DIS', 'CHTR']","[For the record:2:04 p.m. Sept. 6, 2023: An earlier version of this column incorrectly stated that Disney paid dividends in 2020 through 2022. Disney has not paid a dividend since the second half of fiscal 2019.Someone — either Walt Disney Co. or Charter Communications, the owner of Spectrum — owes me $38.05.That's what I spent the other day for an indoor antenna to allow me to watch ABC-TV Channel 7, one of the 20 channels that Disney pulled off Spectrum last week in the two behemoths' dispute over how many billions of dollars will flow between them for the privilege of pumping entertainment and sports content into our homes.If you're unfamiliar with the process, think of it this way: Every dime they're fighting over comes out of our pockets, either directly through subscription payments, or indirectly via the cost of commercials that the companies selling us everything from cars to Kleenex pass on to us in their pricing.Disney wants to limit our ability to provide greater customer choice in programming packages, forcing you to take and pay for channels you may not want.Spectrum statement on Disney fightCable subscribers would be justified in thinking, ""Not this again.""As my colleague Meg James has reported, blackouts resulting from so-called carriage disputes have become vastly more common in recent years, as content providers battle with cable operators and satellite services over how much either side is willing to pay, or receive, for the right to transmit content to subscribers.Customers of satellite provider DirecTV have been without Nexstar TV stations, including KTLA Channel 5 in Los Angeles, since July.The underlying problem, of course, is that cable service almost everywhere in the U.S. is a monopoly. Spectrum's roughly 15 million subscribers, including the roughly 5 million in Southern California who make Spectrum the largest pay-TV provider in the region, don't have anywhere else to go for cable service. (Though they can go satellite via Dish Network or DirecTV.)Story continuesIf one could switch from Spectrum to, say, Comcast with the press of a button or a phone call, how long do you think the Disney-Spectrum standoff would last?In this new dispute, both Disney and Spectrum are pretending that they're only out to protect us, the consumers. They're both real apologetic that we're caught in the middle.According to the splash screen on Spectrum that has replaced the content one might prefer to find on the ABC network, ESPN, FX or the other Disney channels, ""Disney wants to limit our ability to provide greater customer choice in programming packages, forcing you to take and pay for channels you may not want.""Read more: Column: How profit-driven turmoil at Turner Classic Movies placed a vast cultural heritage at riskDisney, in its version, says its channels ""are blacked out due to a dispute between Spectrum’s parent company — Charter Communications — and Disney Entertainment.... Disney deeply values its relationship with its viewers and is hopeful Charter is ready to have more conversations that will restore access to its content to Spectrum customers as quickly as possible.""Do you buy either of these statements? Me neither.A couple of relevant points:Spectrum's claim that it's all about offering ""greater customer choice"" must be some sort of a gag. Even if that's true today, its parent, Charter, like every other cable company in the nation, fought for decades against the very concept of ""unbundling"" cable channels.Their fundamental business model was to offer programming packages bristling with channels that you didn't care to watch, just so you'd sign up for access to the few you wanted to watch. It wasn't that long ago that the claim was that offering stripped-down packages that allowed consumers to pick and choose would cost them more. (This turned out to be true, but for the wrong reason, as anyone who totes up the bills for their streaming services will discover.)As for consumer choice today, have you tried to drop Fox News from your Spectrum system lately? Good luck: No matter how repulsed you might be by Fox's mainstreaming of racism and Donald Trump's election lies, you're paying for it.Disney deeply values its relationship with its viewers and is hopeful Charter is ready to have more conversations that will restore access to its content to Spectrum customers as quickly as possible.Disney statement on Spectrum fightDisney's statement is so artful it's almost adorable. Notice the passive voice in its assertions that its channels ""are blacked out due to a dispute"" and that it hopes that further conversations with Charter ""will restore access to its content.""Reading that, you might not realize that the Disney channels are blacked out because Disney pulled them off the Spectrum system, unilaterally, last Thursday afternoon. Disney did it, not Spectrum or the man on the moon.Spectrum further states, by the way, that ""the rising cost of programming is the single greatest factor in high cable TV prices.""Read more: Column: Hate Fox News? Too bad — you still have to pay for itIs that so? According to its annual reports, Charter's profits rose to $5.1 billion on revenue of $54 billion last year, from $3.2 billion on revenue of $48.1 billion in 2020. In other words, its profits rose by 56.8% while revenue rose by only 12.3%. It also spent $7.2 billion to repurchase its shares from Liberty Media in 2022 and 2021. Maybe profits and share buybacks played a teensy little role in its cable TV prices.Disney, which has been pleading poverty lately, also has done pretty well. It recorded a profit of $3.6 billion last year on revenue of $74.2 billion, up from a profit of $2.5 billion on revenue of $61.8 billion in 2021. (The company booked a $2.5-billion loss in 2020, when its theme parks were closed by the pandemic, so leave that aside.)What the Disney-Spectrum dispute is all about is Spectrum's desire to offer its cable subscribers ad-supported versions of Disney's ad-free streaming services (for which Disney charges a stand-alone monthly fee) as part of their cable packages, thus claiming some of the audience that has cut the cable cord to go full-streaming. Disney has refused. And there you are.Charter Chief Executive Christopher Winfrey has threatened to ""move on"" from providing TV service at all, or perhaps permanently doing without Disney's channels entirely. Of course, that would hasten the flight of customers from his television business, so place your bets now on whether that will happen.Winfrey told Wall Street last week, after Disney's blackout, that ""the video ecosystem is broken."" That was nervy of him, since companies like his rode a majestically profitable wave for years before playing their own role in breaking it.Read more: Column: The rich men who control baseball show they don't care about fans, againThe customers of these companies have reason to curse them both. My bill for Spectrum comes to about $320 a month, for which I've had the right to expect that it would provide me with the TV, internet and telephone services without interruption. Its inability to strike a deal with Disney is nothing short of a betrayal of its promise.As for Disney, it is breaking its implicit promise to us customers that it will provide the content that it has placed its name on, without interruption. (This is why when I first wrote about its conflict with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, I called both parties ""detestable in their own way""; I stand by that judgment today.)Can anything break this logjam? Our government regulators gave up their leverage long ago, when they waved through the various mergers that turned Charter into a nationwide cable behemoth and allowed Disney to acquire the ABC network in 1996 and Pixar, Marvel and 21st Century Fox subsequently.Those deals on both sides raised the stakes for consumers when events like the current dispute erupted. It was always clear that none of the acquisitions was about a better deal for consumers — in fact that the public would be trampled in the end.I'm a bit lucky in this case. The only Disney content I crave is ""Jeopardy,"" which airs on ABC's local station and which, for about the next week, is in reruns. But if this stalemate continues, I'll have to fire up that internal antenna. It will be worth the price, just barely. The better outcome would be for both these greedy, grasping companies to go away entirely.This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.]"

Charter, the parent company of Spectrum that serves more than 32 million customers in 41 states, said that Disney removed the programming.According to several media reports, Spectrum is “quietly offering” the $15 credit to customers who request it in an attempt to placate angry viewers and keep them from switching services.The dispute comes amid a decline in traditional broadcast and cable TV viewership, and as prices for many streaming platforms have increased despite more and more companies entering the market.For their part, both Disney and Charter said in statements that negotiations are ongoing.Both sides say they hope to reach an agreementDisney said in a Sept. 4 blog that it hopes to continue talks that will restore access to its content for Spectrum customers as soon as possible. It also said that customers have a lot of choices to access its programming without a cable subscription, including by using Hulu + Live TV. Disney holds a 67% stake in Hulu.“This Labor Day weekend has been a frustrating one for millions of Spectrum cable subscribers,” Disney said in the blog. “Instead of enjoying major sporting events such as the return of college football and the US Open, ESPN and other Disney-owned channels like ABC were blacked out due to a dispute between Spectrum’s parent company—Charter Communications—and Disney Entertainment. Unfortunately, the dispute is still ongoing.”Story continuesOn its website, Spectrum also said that negotiations will continue and that it hopes to reach a fair agreement on behalf of customers. But it blamed Disney for continuing to demand an “excessive increase.”The cable operator said that Disney pulled programming from YouTube TV customers in 2021 and from Dish and Sling customers in 2022.“And now, right as football season kicks off, they’re pulling programming from you, Spectrum customers,” Spectrum said.Meantime, if you're looking for places to get TV and movies online, you have more than a few options for free and paid streaming services that offer some of the biggest movies and TV shows to keep you entertained. Besides an increase in the number of free streaming services, many of the premium services now also offer cheaper, ad-supported membership plans.RELATED CONTENTHow To Save On Streaming Services and Find Streaming Deals9 Places to Watch Shows and Movies OnlineSave on Streaming With 50% Off a Paramount Plus Annual Subscription]"
262,c0b35fd0-8084-3308-b1a0-6d36fbb91e40,OKE,2023-09-06,"Should You Be Excited About ONEOK, Inc.'s (NYSE:OKE) 34% Return On Equity?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/excited-oneok-inc-nyse-oke-111910331.html,1693999150,STORY,['OKE'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE:OKE).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for ONEOK How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for ONEOK is:34% = US$2.4b ÷ US$7.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.34 in profit.Does ONEOK Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, ONEOK has a superior ROE than the average (28%) in the Oil and Gas industry.roeThat is a good sign. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for ONEOK.How Does Debt Impact ROE?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesONEOK's Debt And Its 34% ROEONEOK does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.77. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.But note: ONEOK may not be the best stock to buy.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Stocks to Buy with Steady Dividends.Investment trends have evolved significantly over time in response to shifts in the market and the preferences of investors. Nevertheless, dividend stocks have consistently attracted interest in the market due to their capacity to provide a dependable source of income. Nearly 77% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 pay dividends and the policies of individual companies can vary widely, with some paying higher dividends than others.Over the years, the importance of dividends in contributing to overall investment returns has increased significantly. A report from Morgan Stanley suggested that in the coming years, stock market gains may be smaller with higher volatility. As a result, the portion of the market returns coming from dividends might become more important. From 2013 to 2022, dividends made up about 17% of the total returns in the S&amp;P 500 Index. However, if we look at a much longer period starting from the 1930s, dividends contributed to 37% of the returns. It's expected that the next few years will resemble this longer-term trend. This growing recognition of the role dividends play in long-term wealth accumulation has led to increased attention from investors seeking both income and capital appreciation.Since the start of 2023, a group of giant tech companies has made it difficult for other parts of the market to perform better than the S&amp;P 500. While dividend stocks, in general, have not done well compared to the index this year, there have been some positive developments. The ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL), which invests in companies with dividend growth track records over 25 consecutive years, is aiming to recover with its straightforward approach. The fund has gained 4.98% year-to-date, which is considerably lower than the 18.9% return of the S&amp;P 500. However, this performance represents a promising beginning in terms of a potential recovery for the fund.Story continuesThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the most popular stocks among investors that have raised their dividends for decades. These companies are resilient, profitable, generate substantial cash flow, and are typically capable of enduring various economic conditions.Analysts have been paying close attention to dividend stocks this year due to their possible resurgence in the markets. In one of her recent interviews with CNBC, Sandy Pomeroy, a senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman, presented a positive outlook on dividend stocks over the next years. Here are some comments from the analyst:“Dividend stocks are so cheap right now, that maybe you just have a reversal based on the fact that they are as cheap as they have been since the tech boom of the 1990s. When we did that we were three standard deviations cheaper relative to that period, three standard deviations cheaper now. And they went on to have a great decade. They were the outperformers for the next ten years.”In view of these arguments and the analyst’s remarks, we will discuss some of the best dividend stocks to buy with steady dividends.15 Stocks to Buy with Steady DividendsOur Methodology:For this article, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 910 hedge funds as of Q2 2023 and picked dividend stocks with over 10 consecutive years of dividend growth and dividend yields over 2%, as of September 4. After that, we gathered the price forecasts and ratings given to these stocks by Wall Street analysts and other investment firms.

In Tuesday’s session, Brent peaked at $91.14, its highest since August 2022. The latest two-day gain put the global crude benchmark up 1% for the week, extending last week’s 4.8% rise. Prior to that, it gained a net of 16% over nine weeks.New York-based West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, crude finished Wednesday’s trade at $87.54 per barrel, up 85 cents, or 1%, on the day. It hit a 10-month peak of $88.09 during the session. Week-to-date, WTI was up 2%, extending last week’s 7.2% gain. Prior to that, the U.S. crude benchmark rose a net 16% over nine weeks.“The oil market is going to be tight for the foreseeable future, but right now energy traders need a fresh catalyst or some not-so negative demand news for the recent rally to extend,” said Ed Moya, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.Oil’s race to $90 happened with less than three weeks left for summer, the season Americans like driving the most. With the fall season of lower oil usage set to begin on Sept 23, crude prices would typically retreat a little, sometimes meaningfully, in the world’s largest consuming country.But that may not happen this time, not with the Saudi obsession of ultimately getting oil to $100 a barrel or beyond. The Arabs, who control much of the world’s oil exports, have been fixated on triple digit pricing since losing that advantage in August 2022, when Brent crude hovered above $105.Key to this is the one-million-barrels-per day in additional cuts, on top of other existing production rationing, that the Saudis have been carrying out since July. By extending this till the year-end — and widening it with the help of Moscow which will cut 300,000 barrels per day of Russian production — the kingdom is hoping to create a different sort of market phenomenon for pricing.Story continuesMarket participants were also on the lookout for U.S. weekly oil inventory data, due after market settlement from API, or the American Petroleum Institute.The API will release at approximately 16:30 ET (21:30 GMT) a snapshot of closing balances on U.S. crude, gasoline and distillates for the week ended Sept. 1.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Stocks to Buy with Steady Dividends.Investment trends have evolved significantly over time in response to shifts in the market and the preferences of investors. Nevertheless, dividend stocks have consistently attracted interest in the market due to their capacity to provide a dependable source of income. Nearly 77% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 pay dividends and the policies of individual companies can vary widely, with some paying higher dividends than others.Over the years, the importance of dividends in contributing to overall investment returns has increased significantly. A report from Morgan Stanley suggested that in the coming years, stock market gains may be smaller with higher volatility. As a result, the portion of the market returns coming from dividends might become more important. From 2013 to 2022, dividends made up about 17% of the total returns in the S&amp;P 500 Index. However, if we look at a much longer period starting from the 1930s, dividends contributed to 37% of the returns. It's expected that the next few years will resemble this longer-term trend. This growing recognition of the role dividends play in long-term wealth accumulation has led to increased attention from investors seeking both income and capital appreciation.Since the start of 2023, a group of giant tech companies has made it difficult for other parts of the market to perform better than the S&amp;P 500. While dividend stocks, in general, have not done well compared to the index this year, there have been some positive developments. The ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL), which invests in companies with dividend growth track records over 25 consecutive years, is aiming to recover with its straightforward approach. The fund has gained 4.98% year-to-date, which is considerably lower than the 18.9% return of the S&amp;P 500. However, this performance represents a promising beginning in terms of a potential recovery for the fund.Story continuesThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the most popular stocks among investors that have raised their dividends for decades. These companies are resilient, profitable, generate substantial cash flow, and are typically capable of enduring various economic conditions.Analysts have been paying close attention to dividend stocks this year due to their possible resurgence in the markets. In one of her recent interviews with CNBC, Sandy Pomeroy, a senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman, presented a positive outlook on dividend stocks over the next years. Here are some comments from the analyst:“Dividend stocks are so cheap right now, that maybe you just have a reversal based on the fact that they are as cheap as they have been since the tech boom of the 1990s. When we did that we were three standard deviations cheaper relative to that period, three standard deviations cheaper now. And they went on to have a great decade. They were the outperformers for the next ten years.”In view of these arguments and the analyst’s remarks, we will discuss some of the best dividend stocks to buy with steady dividends.15 Stocks to Buy with Steady DividendsOur Methodology:For this article, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 910 hedge funds as of Q2 2023 and picked dividend stocks with over 10 consecutive years of dividend growth and dividend yields over 2%, as of September 4. After that, we gathered the price forecasts and ratings given to these stocks by Wall Street analysts and other investment firms.

Disney pulled its channels from Spectrum amid a carriage dispute between the two companies. Goldman Sachs Managing Director Brett Feldman says there are two reasons why this dispute is happening.First with the decline in cable subscribers is accelerating, falling about 6% to 7% this year. Feldman says that's interesting because, historically, media companies have been able to raise the prices of their channels by about 5% to 6% a year. ""We've hit this tipping point now where the media companies simply can't raise prices fast enough to offset the loss of paid TV subscribers,"" Feldman says, going on to say that it has ""emboldened"" cable companies to start discussing the possibility of a new model.The second thing is that the cable companies have reached the ""point of economic indifference,"" Feldman says. What that means is that given how much cord-cutting is happening, Charter is losing so much profitability in that business and ""basically what they're saying is we almost don't care anymore whether our customers decide to pay for a channel package or not,"" Feldman says, adding that they are primarily making their money by providing internet service.Click here for more of Yahoo Finance's coverage from the Goldman Sachs Communacopia tech conference.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]BRIAN SOZZI: Welcome back to ""Yahoo Finance Live."" We're still live at the Goldman Sachs Tech and Media Conference in San Francisco. And the other undercurrent at this conference is in fact all things happening in media. Lots of focus, of course, on AI. But that undercurrent is media and what might be happening next.And to that end, Brett Feldman is here, Goldman Sachs Managing Director covering telecom, cable, and media. Thanks for having us to your conference, Brett. We appreciate it.BRETT FELDMAN: We're so excited to have you here. This is one of the biggest events we do all year. We're going to have the senior leaders and CEOs from over 200 global TMT companies that really should be a great couple of days.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: No, it's already shaping up to be that way. And a lot of the chatter in the room is the situation between Charter and Disney. And my question to you is, why is this happening right now?BRETT FELDMAN: That's right. So just for your viewers, who I think probably know by this point in time, if you're a Charter customer, so if you have spectrum cable, you can't get any Disney channels right now. They've been removed from the service. And that includes ESPN.So you made a great point. We've been seeing the number of households that pay for cable and satellite TV bundles decline for years. Why are we now just getting to this point where the distributors, the cable companies are really pushing back? There's really two reasons why. The first is we're going to see the total number of households that pay for TV this year decline by about 6% to 7%. About two years ago, that was negative 5%. A couple of years before that, it was a much more moderate number. So this has been an accelerating pace of decline.The reason why 6% to 7% is interesting is that historically, the media companies, companies like Disney, have been able to raise the price of their channels by about 5% to 6% per year. So we've hit this tipping point now where the media companies simply can't raise prices fast enough to offset the loss of paid TV subscribers. I think that has emboldened the cable companies to look at this relationship and say, listen, we can't absorb these historical price increases. We need to talk about a new model. That's one of the things that Charter talked about.Another point Charter made is the point we actually started making about four years ago, which is that they've reached what they call a point of economic indifference. Basically, they're saying we almost don't care anymore, whether our customers decide to pay for a channel package or not, because they've lost so much profitability in that business as a result of cord cutting. They really make all their money now providing internet service.And so I think that you have the cable companies saying, we can't do this anymore. We were able to deal with it for a couple of years when we were losing a small number of customers. But as this snowball continues to roll down the hill, we have to come up with a new model.BRIAN SOZZI: At the end of the day, when this comes to an end, and it inevitably will, who is the biggest loser? And what does it mean to the broader media landscape?BRETT FELDMAN: It's a great question. And actually, we're going to be asking a version of that question to all these CEOs of the big media and cable companies when they're here this week. And really, the question we're going to be trying to get an answer to is, what's a win-win?If the model that we've had before, the relationship between the media companies, between the cable and satellite companies, and the relationship that they ultimately have with their viewers, if that's not working anymore, what is going to work? And are there other things that have to change? Maybe the way they price their streaming services in order to get something that works for everyone involved, including the consumer.BRIAN SOZZI: Do you agree-- I think it was last week, Barry Diller at IAC said the streaming companies, they're not your friends. They're your enemies is the ultimate problem here companies like a Netflix.BRETT FELDMAN: I think Charter has been trying to make that point. Their view is that the media companies have devalued their entertainment by moving on to streaming platforms. And they give examples of it. They say, historically, you've been able to capture some of that value through advertising. You're barely doing any advertising on your streaming platforms. It's a new thing, and you're not doing a lot of it.There's no security. It used to be that if you wanted to watch what was on cable TV, you had to pay for cable TV in your home. I think we all know that password sharing has become a big deal. Netflix has recently started cracking down on that, but not all of the media companies have. And just in general, I think that the distributors, the cable and satellite companies, they look at what they're being asked to pay to make that content available to their customers. And they look at the price that those same media companies are charging to make it available on a direct basis. They say these are not the same prices. There's got to be a way that we come up with a sustainable economic model we can all agree on.BRIAN SOZZI: Is there any appetite to own these media stocks, and what has to happen?BRETT FELDMAN: Well, I think there is, in part, because they've been under so much pressure. A stock that we have talked a lot about is Warner Brothers Discovery, David Zaslav, the CEO of Warner Brothers--BRIAN SOZZI: He will be here.BRETT FELDMAN: --will be here tomorrow. They are able to do something that some of the other media companies cannot, which is that they're still integrating a very large merger. They had acquired the Time Warner assets, the old Time Warner assets out of AT&amp;T about two years ago. And they quickly realized that there was a lot of inefficiency in how that business was run. And so they have an opportunity here to keep taking costs out of the business. And hopefully make the products better at the same time, so that they can generate cash, they can pay down debt, and ultimately do something that should be accretive to their shareholders by positioning the company to be a winner in the streaming wars.But to be fair, it's a highly debated sector, that's a highly debated stock.BRIAN SOZZI: Not lost on me, Brett, is last year, Bob Chapek was here, now former CEO of Disney. Disney CEO Bob Iger is not here. Of course, there's always scheduling conflicts, et cetera, et cetera. But to me, I think it says a lot that Disney is not at this premier conference. And it says a lot about the challenges they're going through. What has to happen to get investor appetite back into a stock that's about 52-week lows, despite the content power that is Disney?BRETT FELDMAN: Well, Disney has been here for a number of years. And so it would have been great if we could have made the scheduling work. But we'll hopefully, we'll have Bob Iger back.There's a few things they have to do. They have to demonstrate that they can continue to be on a path to profitability in streaming. So one of the nice inflections that we've seen since Bob Iger returned is that the losses they've been incurring in their streaming business have begun to compress very significantly. So proving that they can make money and then give some indication as to what those margins can be over time, I think that's really important.I think in their traditional media networks business, which is really revolves around ESPN, they have to show that they can transition ESPN from being a package of cable and satellite TV channels to being something that you can subscribe to on a direct basis, meaning something you could stream. A lot of people may say, well, hold on, can't you get ESPN Plus right now, you get that in your bundle with Disney Plus? It's not the same thing. It's a niche product they haven't put the full suite of sports rights that they have access to into that product.If they can do those two things, they will really be able to demonstrate that they have a strategy and a model for taking what is a very profitable, historically, very profitable media business, and turning it into a profitable streaming media business.BRIAN SOZZI: And Bob made a lot of headlines a couple of months ago, suggesting everything was on the table. What's the end game here for him? Is it a spinoff of ESPN? Is it a sale of those linear TV assets?BRETT FELDMAN: I don't think we know. I thought what was refreshing about those comments-- I think some people heard them as a little bit alarming. But I think that what was refreshing was to hear him acknowledge that everything is on the table.You know, if you go back a few years when cord-cutting wasn't quite as intense as it is right now. In some cases, you would hear media companies talk about this being manageable, taking a very long time, not likely to get any worse. I think investors were always very skeptical of that. To hear a leader in the industry like Bob Iger acknowledge that you have to put everything on the table right now, I think, shows how seriously they're taking this and is a real signal to the Street that they are going to do what they need to do, so that Disney can have another 100 years of success in the market.BRIAN SOZZI: Are investors waiting for that big move to get back into the stock? Do they want to see him pull the trigger on something mind-blowing?BRETT FELDMAN: I don't know if it's one thing. I think you have to look at this and say, as he's returned to the company, he has made the adjustments that are necessary to put the company on the path they need to be on, because what investors really want is they want to see a company that can execute its way to success. And if you're still debating what they're supposed to do, that can be an overhang on the stock. So the main thing is setting a strategy and then setting a strategy that the market thinks will work if you execute it.BRIAN SOZZI: Along the lines of Disney hit a 52-week low, I look at Paramount. You still rate the stock a sell, right? What has to happen to get investors excited about that name?BRETT FELDMAN: You know, Paramount faces a lot of the same issues that Disney faces a lot of the same issues that Warner Brothers Discovery faces. One of the things that they are very committed to is continuing to invest in their streaming platform. So whereas many of the other media companies have already moved past peak investment, meaning that they're getting closer to breaking even not farther away, this year Paramount will probably see their peak losses, meaning they're still leaning into the investment.To their credit, the service has been much more popular with viewers. And I think a lot of people guessed. And they've had some real hits. They've put the NFL on the platform. So I think they feel very good about the subscriber momentum, what they have to be able to demonstrate to investors is that they can not only pivot away from being an investment phase but accelerate towards making money in their streaming business, because they, just like everyone else, are going to see their legacy networks come under increasing pressure.BRIAN SOZZI: Brett Feldman, Goldman Sachs Managing Director covering telecom, cable, and media. Thank you for having us at your conference. This is one of our favorite ones by far.BRETT FELDMAN: Thanks for being here.]"

Whether it’s managing the plethora of merchandise sales, replaying nail-biting tackles on stadium screens, or asking Miles, the Broncos’ virtual assistant, a question during a game, employees and guests alike can expect reliable experiences backed by Comcast Business.Technology continues to revolutionize the sports industry, transforming experiences for fans and the operations of teams like the Broncos. Fans now expect real-time viewing experiences – regardless of whether they’re in the stadium or watching at home – and are actively participating in gamedays through social media engagement and personalized streaming services. On the backend, technology has ushered in new revenue streams for sports organizations through e-commerce platforms and digital ticketing and point-of-sale applications, and has made it easier to analyze players’ performances during training or game days. All these technology-driven offerings require a strong and reliable network backbone to make them a reality.Solutions provided by Comcast Business include SIP Trunking, between Empower Field at Mile High and the Centura Health Training Center. Additionally, Comcast Business is providing two 10 gig ethernet circuits and Comcast Business Hospitality HD Video for thousands of screens at Empower Field at Mile High.“When it comes to football, players and fans alike know that every second counts, and the same holds true for the technology within sports facilities – if it isn’t fast and reliable, fans and athletes could miss out on exciting experiences,” said Robert Thompson, vice president of business services for Comcast’s Mountain West Region. “We are proud to support the Broncos with technology solutions that not only assist the team’s employees as they work hard to bring these experiences to the Denver community, but that keep fans connected and engaged with the Broncos.”Story continuesComcast Business is the Broncos’ main internet provider for employees, players, staff, and media that attend game days. In addition to supporting stadium operations, the 10 gig circuits power the Broncos TV studio to quickly capture and create real-time content – like player interviews, commentator segments, or fan giveaways within the stadium – then broadcast it on TV screens across Empower Field at Mile High. SIP trunking provides reliable phone lines. The strong network backbone created by the combination of these solutions ultimately contributes to a more connected and convenient game day experience for fans, as well as fast, reliable back-end operations for staff.Between 2008 and today, the Broncos have seen its network of connectivity solutions and devices grow exponentially, going from roughly 400 devices supported on its network to 8,000.

The company is benefiting from a growing wireless subscriber base as witnessed in the second quarter of 2023. The technology will help it in expanding much faster and at a lower cost compared to competitors.Recovery in the park and movie business bodes well for Comcast's profitability. Its streaming service Peacock is a key catalyst in driving broadband sales. Strong free cash flow generation ability is noteworthy.However, Comcast persistently suffers from video-subscriber attrition due to cord cutting. Moreover, broadband prospects are suffering from increased competition from fixed wireless as well as fiber. Additionally, a leveraged balance sheet is a major concern.(You can read the full research report on Comcast here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Linde have outperformed the Zacks Chemical - Specialty industry over the year-to-date (+19.5% vs. +11.3%). With a wide range of applications for its industrial gases, Linde is making the world more productive by the day. The company's primary products in industrial gases include oxygen, which is used as life support in hospitals.Linde has long-term contracts with on-site customers backed by minimum purchase requirements, thereby securing stable cashflows. In the profitable industrial gas market, the merger of Praxair and Linde has created an efficient player with considerable size advantages. Linde reported strong second quarter earnings aided by higher pricing from its Americas segment.However, increasing competition for new projects and developments in emerging markets is concerning.

The Risk and Insurance Services unit has been contributing to revenue growth for a while. Solid cash flows enable business investments. MMC had around $3.7 billion left under authorization as of Jun 30, 2023.However, escalating operating costs might weigh on the margins. The metric jumped 6.1% y/y in 1H23. A debt-laden balance sheet is a concern. Its valuation remains stretched at the current level.

The analysts wrote that the mix effect “should continue to help growth for years to come.”The analysts also see an opportunity for its cloud operations in the AI space, particularly due to the company’s close ties with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and its early adoption of Nvidia's SaaS products.The company is set to report its Q1/24 earnings on Sept 14.Lowe's earns an upgrade at BernsteinBernstein upgraded Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) to Outperform from Market Perform on Tuesday and raised its price target to $282 from $252.The firm now sees a confluence of positive and mutually reinforcing trends for Lowe's that they expect to continue, saying:We believe LOW will continue to deliver modest op margin expansion over the next 24 months, driven by the continued modest gross margin expansion of 5-10bps / year combined with stable to modestly improving OpEx % of sales.Bernstein says it is comfortable with the home-improvement market outlook in the near term and that it sees a return to low-single-digit growth into 2024-2025 ""as the housing market stabilizes.""Two more upgradesNetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) shares gained more than 2% Tuesday after Susquehanna upgraded the company to Positive from Neutral and raised its price target to $100 from $62.The analysts say they believe NetApp’s product revenue is bottoming and expect to see sequential growth, with a resurgence in year-over-year growth anticipated by mid-2024.

With an Earnings Per Share (EPS) (EPS) of 3.06, the question arises: is the stock modestly overvalued? This article aims to answer this question by providing a comprehensive valuation analysis of Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL). We invite you to read on for an in-depth understanding of the company's financial standing and future prospects.Company OverviewWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with ORCL. Click here to check it out. ORCL 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of ORCLOracle Corp, a global leader in database technology and enterprise resource planning software, was established in 1977. The company, which pioneered the first commercial SQL-based relational database management system, now serves 430,000 customers in 175 countries with its 136,000 employees. The company's stock price currently stands at $123.19, while the GF Value, an estimation of its fair value, is $97.7. This discrepancy hints at a potential overvaluation.Oracle (ORCL): A Closer Examination of Its Modest OvervaluationUnderstanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that denotes a stock's intrinsic value. It is computed based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past returns and growth, and future estimates of business performance. The GF Value Line provides a visual representation of a stock's fair trading value.According to our calculations, Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) appears to be modestly overvalued. With a current market cap of $334.40 billion and a stock price of $123.19 per share, the future return of Oracle's stock is likely to be lower than its business growth due to its overvaluation.Oracle (ORCL): A Closer Examination of Its Modest OvervaluationLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with low financial strength could lead to permanent capital loss. Thus, it is crucial to review a company's financial strength before investing. Oracle's financial strength is rated 4 out of 10 by GuruFocus, indicating a weak balance sheet. This rating is based on a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.11, which is lower than 92% of 2736 companies in the Software industry.Story continuesOracle (ORCL): A Closer Examination of Its Modest OvervaluationProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent long-term profitability, is generally less risky. Oracle has been profitable for the past 10 years. With a revenue of $50 billion and an EPS of $3.06 in the past twelve months, Oracle's operating margin stands at 27.37%, ranking better than 93.94% of 2723 companies in the Software industry. This indicates strong profitability.However, Oracle's growth ranks worse than 50.18% of 1989 companies in the Software industry, despite an average annual revenue growth of 15%. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 9.4%.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) with its Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) can provide insights into its profitability. Oracle's ROIC stands at 9.88, slightly below its WACC of 10.07, over the past 12 months.Oracle (ORCL): A Closer Examination of Its Modest OvervaluationConclusionIn conclusion, Oracle appears to be modestly overvalued. Despite its strong profitability, the company's poor financial condition and below-average growth could impact its long-term returns.

Despite poor global economic growth during the last quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023, the International Monetary Fund predicts world trade will grow by 2.4% by the end of 2023.The implications of COVID-19 had only begun to die down when the Russia-Ukraine conflict surged. Russia, a major trade partner for the rest of the world, especially Europe, ultimately limited the flow of goods and services. With a decline in foreign direct investments and a lack of trust in global currencies, the world's economic conditions worsened. However, the decline is less strong than during the coronavirus pandemic. Therefore, economists predict that the impact of the war on world trade will eventually die down, and the world economy will grow back in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first half of 2024.Is Reverse Globalization the New Trend?Globalization occurs when businesses begin to sell and produce their products to markets across borders. While more and more countries continue to engage with each other, concerns related to the impact of globalization on domestic economies are growing. Some countries have begun to restrict imports from developed economies primarily to protect local businesses and cultures. However, globalization is here to stay.""Think Global, Act Local"" was first coined in 1915 by Patrick Geddes. This term reflects the status of globalization as of today. While it is true that globalization has hurt local businesses and developing economies, this does not mean that countries would go back to the pre-globalization era. The term ""Think Global, Act Local"" is a concurrent phenomenon worldwide.Story continues""Think Global, Act Local"" means that companies fixate on global markets while they alter their products to fit local tastes and culture of the region they are operating in. This phenomenon has enabled companies to penetrate untapped markets and grow their business globally. Companies are highly invested in empowering communities across the globe. These companies are more than interested in garnering support and awareness from global markets. The incidence of social media has allowed companies to transgress international markets and learn more about consumer behavior without having to spend millions. According to a report by Forbes published on May 18, 77% of businesses use social media to reach and connect with customers. Moreover, over 90% of social media followers follow at least one brand on social media, and 76% of social media users have purchased an item through social media. Such indicates that the world is getting closer to each other in a virtual space, limiting discrepancies and making it easier for firms to target global markets.How Do Companies Race to Become Global?Thinking globally but acting locally is no less of a challenging task. It requires huge amounts of capital and knowledge of international markets. A few companies are leading the global market by acting globally and thinking locally. Such companies usually experience high returns and have mastered the art of catering to global markets. Such examples include GSK plc (NYSE:GSK), Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), and McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD). You can also view other global stocks to invest in. GSK plc (NYSE:GSK) is a pharmaceutical and biotechnology company based in the United Kingdom. The company has its headquarters based in London. The company is a pioneer in innovating medicine. On March 31, Reuters reported that the company recently signed deals with companies allowing them to produce cheaper versions of their HIV medicine. The company did this to make the medicine available to the masses, especially in developing economies. The companies involved in the production are Aurobindo Pharma, Cipla, and Viatris. The aim of doing so was to propagate the mass availability of the medicine for the global market. You will often find companies enhancing their global supply chain and distribution.Shell Plc (NYSE:SHEL) is a global oil and gas industry leader. The company has its headquarters based in London, United Kingdom. The company differentiates itself from others based on its commitment to society and the environment. On June 14, the company reported that its primary goal was to enhance value to its customers and shareholders by prioritizing an intended decline in emissions and a balanced energy transition. To shed light on this, Wael Sawan, the chief executive officer, stated:“We are investing to provide the secure energy customers need today and for a long time while transforming Shell to win in a low-carbon future. Performance, discipline, and simplification will be our guiding principles as we allocate capital to enhance shareholder distributions while enabling the energy transition.”By 2025, Shell Plc (NYSE:SHEL) aims to become a net-zero emissions energy business. The company plans to invest $10-15 billion between 2023 and 2025 to build on more energy-efficient solutions such as biofuels, hydrogen, electric vehicle charging, and carbon capture storage to achieve this goal.McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is leading the way with its global strategy. The company is known to tailor its menu and offerings based on local tastes and cuisines. From breakfast broth in Hong Kong to a past fried chicken combo in other parts of the world, McDonald's believes their global success comes from satisfying customers across borders. On February 29, CNBC reported the rise of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) in China. The company is set to open 1,900 stores by the end of this year, with half of them located in China. The company's rising success in China comes from the McDonald's Corporation's (NYSE:MCD) ability to adapt to local tastes. McDonald's is also among the top fast-food restaurants.Companies heavily contribute to the global economy. In fact, they keep countries connected. With that, let's discuss the 25 most globalized countries.25 Most Globalized Countries in the WorldPixabay/Public DomainOur Methodology Globalization refers to the process by which organizations and businesses gain international influence.

It is not only about owning, building or selling properties, there are also other wonderful business models that different companies are exercising. Day after day they are innovating processes, technologies and different ways to generate money within this sector. Here I bring you 3 of the top real estate stock picks to watch, that without a doubt are among the leading real estate companies.Realty Income (O)realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browserSource: ShutterstockRealty Income (NYSE:O) focuses on acquiring and then renting specialty properties where companies can set up shop. However, there’s a captivating twist, they don’t keep all the rental income. Instead, they share a portion with their investors in the form of dividends. What’s intriguing is the frequency, these dividends are distributed every month, earning them the nickname “The Monthly Dividend Company.”Realty Income’s financial health is solid. In their most recent financial report, their earnings totaled approximately $195 million, which equates to about 29 cents per share. Additionally, they have adopted sophisticated metrics such as normalized FFO and AFFO to measure their prosperity.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn their quest for growth, the company has made substantial leaps by investing an impressive $3.1 billion in the acquisition of 710 properties. To finance these acquisitions, they opted to sell part of their shares to the public and also raised capital by issuing senior unsecured notes.Realty has not shied away from strategic alliances. One of its most important ventures is the partnership with Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust and MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) to jointly acquire a substantial portion of the famous Bellagio Las Vegas assets. This strategic move underscores its adaptability and ambition for expansion and highlights why it is one of the top real estate stock picks among investors.Story continuesAmerican Tower (AMT)American Tower Corporation logo on a smartphone with the website in the background on a computer screen. AMT stock.Source: T. Schneider / ShutterstockEver wonder about the magic that keeps our phones connected? American Tower (NYSE:AMT) is the manager behind this feat, managing the towering antennas responsible for maintaining our vital lines of communication. Their business model is to own and maintain these antennas on a global scale. Telecommunications companies and other communication players lease space on these towers to ensure that their signals reach us all. Naturally, American Tower charges rent for this invaluable service.They stand out for their differentiated nature. Although it operates in real estate, it does not experience the typical roller coaster of market fluctuations. Why? The answer lies in its revenue stream, which is not tied to residential or commercial properties. Instead, it relies on the long-term leases it holds with media outlets. This peculiar revenue structure gives the company a sense of financial security.The second quarter of 2023 brought a mixed bag of financial updates. Its total revenues saw a modest rebound, rising 3.6% to a remarkable $2.77 billion. However, net income fell by 48.2% to $462 million. Nevertheless, the company deftly navigated this scenario by making adjustments that pushed its EBITDA up by 4.7%.To maintain their track record as one of the top real estate stock picks, they embarked on a public offering of unsecured notes. This financial maneuver is designed to alleviate existing debts and put the company in a more favorable position financially. Beyond its financial objectives, the company wholeheartedly embraces corporate citizenship. It has begun to promote ESG initiatives such as protecting the environment, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, using renewable energy, bridging the digital divide and promoting gender equality.Prologis (PLD)The Prologis (PLD) logo displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.comMany companies need storage and distribution space for their goods. This is where Prologis (NYSE:PLD) comes into play. The company specializes in the development and management of industrial and logistics properties.The second quarter of 2023 yielded notable financial achievements for them. Their net earnings per diluted share increased impressively from 82 cents in the corresponding period of 2022 to a substantial $1.31. In addition, their Core FFO, a key financial metric in real estate, showed solid growth rising from $1.11 in 2022 to $1.83 in 2023.A notable achievement was the acquisition of some 14 million square feet of industrial properties from Blackstone (NYSE:BX), which was a significant investment of $3.1 billion. This strategic move is considered a golden opportunity due to the purchase price reflecting a 4% capitalization rate in the first year, which adjusts to 5.75% when aligned with current rents.Their success is closely tied to their ability to meet the growing demand for warehouse and distribution space. As companies seek ever more efficient locations to manage their products, demand for Prologis real estate will increase. In turn, that should translate into increased revenues and profits.As of this writing, Gabriel Osorio-Mazzilli did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Shares have added about 18.2% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is ADTRAN Holdings due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.ADTRAN's Q2 Earnings Miss Despite Higher RevenuesADTRAN reported soft second-quarter 2023 results, wherein both the bottom line and the top line missed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate owing to a challenging macroeconomic environment. However, revenues increased significantly on a year-over-year basis.Net IncomeOn a GAAP basis, net loss in the June quarter was $33.3 million or a loss of 43 cents per share against net income of $2.1 million or 4 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year decline despite top-line growth and income tax benefit was primarily due to higher cost of revenues and operating expenses. Non-GAAP net loss was $0.08 million or breakeven, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.RevenuesQuarterly total revenues surged to $327.4 million from $172 million in the prior-year quarter, driven by the increasing demand for ADTRAN’s network solutions and fiber broadband products. The top line missed the consensus estimate of $330 million.Revenues from Network Solutions in the reported quarter were $283 million compared with $156 million in the year-ago quarter, with incremental contribution from ADVA. ADTRAN completed the buyout of ADVA in July 2022. The company recorded healthy demand trends, driven by the accelerated expansion of fiber-to-the-home networks, upgrades to in-home Wi-Fi connectivity and the adoption of cloud-based automation tools. The top line was further buoyed by improved customer diversification and end-to-end fiber broadband solutions. Services and Support revenues were $44.4 million, up from $16 million.Story continuesOther DetailsTotal cost of sales increased from $109.5 million to $234.8 million. GAAP gross profit came in at $92.6 million compared with $62.5 million in the prior-year quarter. Operating loss in the quarter was $44.6 million against an operating income of $8.1 million in the year-ago quarter.Cash Flow &amp; LiquidityIn the first six months of 2023, ADTRAN used $36.2 million of cash for operating activities compared with a cash utilization of $5.9 million in the prior-year period. As of Jun 30, 2023, the company had $124.3 million in cash and cash equivalents with $44.6 million of deferred compensation liability.Moving ForwardADTRAN expects the second half of 2023 to remain challenging as customers continue to optimize their inventory levels amid uncertain business conditions. Nevertheless, management remains bullish about the long-term earnings growth prospects of the company.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Analysts were quiet during the last two month period as none of them issued any earnings estimate revisions.The consensus estimate has shifted -950% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, ADTRAN Holdings has a poor Growth Score of F, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookADTRAN Holdings has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerADTRAN Holdings is part of the Zacks Technology Services industry. Over the past month, Seagate (STX), a stock from the same industry, has gained 7.6%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended June 2023 more than a month ago.Seagate reported revenues of $1.6 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -39%. EPS of -$0.18 for the same period compares with $1.59 a year ago.Seagate is expected to post a loss of $0.17 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -135.4%.

Similarly, over half (52%) plan to travel more than they did last fall and only 3% will travel Iess.On trend with increased travel is a rise in international trips. While 65% of U.S. travelers will stay domestic this fall, the remaining travelers set their sights on global destinations: more than a quarter (27%) will travel both internationally and domestically, and nearly one in ten (8%) have fully prioritized international travel over domestic this season. Notably, the share of international travel has recently surpassed pre-pandemic levels, a trend that's been gradually rising over the past two years. Even for those staying in the U.S., the vast majority (80%) plan to travel over four hours from their home.Same cities, new ways to exploreCity breaks are most popular with travelers this fall, as familiar favorites in Europe and Mexico continue to shine. In fact, most travelers (75%) plan to return to a destination they've visited before, as repeat destinations can give travelers a greater sense of security. That said, people want to explore these destinations in more depth, evidenced by the fact that ""culture and sightseeing"" is the number one trip type for Americans this fall, and interest in museums and cultural sites is on the rise. Plus, Tripadvisor first-party data indicates that travelers are keen to try more local tours and activities, booking new and elevated ways to experience classic attractions (as shown below).Story continuesMost Popular International Destinations for Americans This FallParis, FranceMost booked experience: Bateaux Parisiens Seine River Gourmet Dinner &amp; Sightseeing CruiseCancun, MexicoMost booked experience: Chichen Itza, Cenote and Valladolid All-Inclusive TourRome, ItalyMost booked experience: Skip-the-Line Group Tour of the Vatican, Sistine Chapel &amp; St. Peter's BasilicaLondon, United KingdomMost booked experience: Stonehenge, Windsor Castle, and Bath from LondonPunta Cana, Dominican RepublicMost booked experience: Half-Day Adventure: 4x4 ATV, Water Cave and Dominican Culture At Punta CanaCabo San Lucas, MexicoMost booked experience: Sunset Cruise with Open bar and Snacks In Cabo San LucasPlaya del Carmen, MexicoMost booked experience: Tulum Ruins, Turtles in Akumal and Cenote tourBarcelona, SpainMost booked experience: Fast Track Sagrada Familia Guided TourPalm - Eagle Beach, Aruba  Most booked experience: Aruba Pub Krawl TourFlorence, ItalyMost booked experience: Small-Group Wine Tasting Experience in the Tuscan CountrysideFor those staying stateside, the ever-popular Las Vegas, New York City, and Orlando round out the top three most popular destinations Americans will visit, respectively. As U.S. travelers attempt to stretch out their summers, enjoying warmth and sunshine past Labor Day, smaller Sun Belt destinations are seeing increased interest. Below are the top trending domestic destinations for Americans this fall on Tripadvisor, based on places with the greatest year-over-year growth.Little Torch Key, FloridaIndian Rocks Beach, FloridaMiami Springs, FloridaHawley, PennsylvaniaCarefree, ArizonaReno, NevadaCape Canaveral, FloridaHolmes Beach, FloridaRutherford, CaliforniaIndio, CaliforniaSolo travel on the riseOver one-quarter (26%) of American travelers surveyed will take a solo trip this autumn. This is well above the global total of 15% as well the 17% who reported traveling solo last fall. While the reasons behind this trend may vary, it is a sign that travelers are more comfortable to journey alone and want to fully immerse themselves in the local culture. For solo explorers looking for great places to visit, Tripadvisor has recent guides on the best places to travel solo in the world, as well as across the U.S.Americans most excited about their tripsWhen asked how they feel about their upcoming trip, 78% of Americans reported being excited and 70% responded ""happy,"" both being well above global totals of 64% and 60%, respectively, for these positive emotions.This is despite the fact that their trips will be more modest than their international counterparts: Americans are most likely to take trips 2-4 nights in length, well below totals of other countries who will average 5+ nights. Notably, Boomers are more likely to take 5+ day trips compared to other age groups. Americans also over-index in reporting to stay in vacation rentals and with friends and family (versus hotels) and are more likely to be flexible when choosing a destination (60%) than the global population of respondents (48%).With fewer trips on average, Americans are eager to maximize those trips. Thus, U.S. travelers are likely to book more on-trip activities on average (3-5) compared to people living in all other countries surveyed, and are interested in a wide array of components such as food, activities, relaxation, shopping, people and weather, showing that their excitement is multifaceted.Tripadvisor Tip: ""Our first-party data shows that travelers are still focused on the near-term, as most trips being booked right now are for one month out, and the vast majority for 2023. However, the advanced planners booking their 2024 trips now are far more likely to be going internationally. With two in five travelers looking to make the most of seasonal discounts as cost of living continues to rise, taking a page out of the early planner's book can yield savings: If you've yet to book your fall trip, the beginning of November is the most affordable time to visit some of the most popular destinations this season."" – Alice Jong, Research and Insights Senior Analyst, Media at Tripadvisor.Other key drivers among U.S. travelers this fall include:Money matters:Trip type:Activities:Planning:Gen Z and millennials are more likely to feel negative emotions (i.e., cautious, overwhelmed, anxious) compared to older generations.MethodologyThe data cited in this release was gathered and analyzed from three key sources:A Tripadvisor Consumer Sentiment Survey, based on data drawn from an online survey of over 2,400 consumers, in partnership with Qualtrics, conducted between June 20 - July 1, 2023 across six countries, including Australia, Italy, Japan, Singapore, U.K. &amp; U.S.Site behavioral data sourced from first party traffic data on the Tripadvisor platform, gathered between June 1 - July 8, 2023, for searches made by travelers in the U.S., U.K., Australia, Japan, and Singapore for travel between September 1 - November 30, 2023.Tripadvisor internal data, July 1-31, 2023.About TripadvisorTripadvisor, the world's largest travel guidance platform*, helps hundreds of millions of people each month** become better travelers, from planning to booking to taking a trip.

One such stock that merits attention is Newell Brands Inc (NASDAQ:NWL). The stock, which is currently priced at $10.19, recorded a loss of 4.86% in a day and a 3-month increase of 18.66%. The stock's fair valuation is $17.79, as indicated by its GF Value.The GF Value: A Comprehensive Tool for Stock ValuationWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NWL. Click here to check it out. NWL 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NWLThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from our exclusive method. The GF Value Line on our summary page gives an overview of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. It is calculated based on three factors: historical multiples (PE Ratio, PS Ratio, PB Ratio, and Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) that the stock has traded at, GuruFocus adjustment factor based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of the business performance.We believe the GF Value Line is the fair value that the stock should be traded at. The stock price will most likely fluctuate around the GF Value Line. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Is Newell Brands (NWL) Too Good to Be True? A Comprehensive Analysis of a Potential Value TrapUnpacking the Risks: Newell Brands (NASDAQ:NWL) as a Potential Value TrapHowever, investors need to consider a more in-depth analysis before making an investment decision. Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Newell Brands should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 0.69. These indicators suggest that Newell Brands, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. This complexity underlines the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Story continuesUnderstanding the Altman Z-ScoreBefore delving into the details, let's understand what the Altman Z-score entails. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Inside Newell Brands Inc (NASDAQ:NWL)Newell Brands Inc is an American global consumer goods company. The business activities of the group function through five segments namely, Commercial Solutions, Home Appliances, Home Solutions, Learning and Development, Outdoor and Recreation. The learning and Development segment generates most of the revenue for the firm which offers baby gear and infant care products; writing instruments, including markers and highlighters, pens and pencils; art products; activity-based adhesive and cutting products, and labeling solutions.Is Newell Brands (NWL) Too Good to Be True?

NWL has been grappling with a challenging macroeconomic environment and elevated levels of core inflation.  The company has been witnessing slowing retail sales, high household debt and inflation on essentials such as food, energy and housing. Also, continued normalization in demand across home-based categories remains concerning.These factors resulted in dismal year-over-year performance in second-quarter 2023 results. The company’s earnings were 24 cents per share in the second quarter, down 57% from the prior-year quarter’s earnings of 56 cents per share. Normalized gross margin contracted 320 bps year over year to 29.9%. The normalized operating margin contracted 490 bps year over year to 9.1% in the reported quarter.Net sales declined 13% year over year to $2,204 million. This includes the adverse impacts of the sale of the Connected Home &amp; Security business. Also, core sales fell 12% year over year.Consequently, management revised its guidance for 2023, which seems dull. The company anticipates 2023 sales to be $8.2-$8.34 billion, down from the earlier mentioned $8.4-$8.6 billion. Core sales are expected to decline 12-10%, down from the prior stated 8-6%. Normalized earnings per share are forecast to be 80-90 cents, down from earnings of  95 cents to $1.08 per share mentioned earlier. For 2023, the normalized operating margin is expected to be 7.8-8.2%, down from the previously communicated 9.6-10.1%.For third-quarter 2023, net sales are envisioned to be $2.11-$2.16 billion, with a core sales decline of 7-5%. For the quarter, the company expects a normalized operating margin of 8.5-9.4% and a bottom line of 20-24 cents per share.Efforts to Counter HurdlesNewell is on track to leverage its robust e-commerce capabilities, which have remained strong for some time now. Capitalizing on the shift to digital consumption, the company continues to strengthen its e-commerce business via increased investments and better customer engagement. The company had earlier launched buy online and pick up in stores as well as ship from store facilities in its Yankee Candle retail stores, which have been doing well. Going forward, the company expects further digital penetration, driven by expanded omnichannel capabilities.It has been undertaking significant actions to accelerate productivity and efficiency by accelerating fuel productivity plans, driving automation and fully implementing Project Ovid. The company is also evaluating opportunities to optimize the category mix within each business unit. Increased focus on revenue growth management, aggressive efforts to reduce SKU as well as supply network optimization bodes well.Also, it revealed stringent cost-cutting plans, such as rightsizing overhead costs, based on the simplification agenda. Notably, Newell Brands has come up with a restructuring and savings initiative, Project Phoenix, which is to be implemented by the end of 2023. The plan aims to reduce overhead costs, streamline its operating model, centralize supply-chain functions and increase efficiencies.The plan will also result in the reduction of office positions by approximately 13%, starting from the first quarter of 2023, and is expected to be complete by the end of 2023. It is on track to achieve the headcount reduction associated with Project Phoenix, along with the annualized pre-tax savings of $220-$250 million when fully implemented.Management also intends to reduce international dependence by moving to a One Newell go-to-market approach in key regions. The updated operating model now includes three operating segments namely, Home &amp; Commercial Solutions, Learning &amp; Development and Outdoor &amp; Recreation. The move comes after the success of Project Ovid and is likely to drive significant margin improvement in the long term. The new restructuring initiative will also generate significant savings and help offset the impacts of macroeconomic headwinds.Story continuesWrapping UpAll said, we believe that Newell’s aggressive cost-cutting endeavors and solid online show are likely to offset inflation-related headwinds and further drive growth. The P/CF ratio (a great indicator of value) comes in at 3.11, which is far better than the industry average of 9.46. Clearly, NWL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAlso, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company gained 24.3% in the past three months against the industry’s 8.6% decline, which raises optimism.

This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Paccar is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.For Paccar, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for PaccarThis truck maker is expected to earn $8.54 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2023, which represents a year-over-year change of 48.5%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Paccar. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 9.1%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Paccar to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

297,fc7d12a1-42b1-394e-9ac9-886869576ba1,PCAR,2023-09-06,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights General Motors and PACCAR,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-industry-outlook-highlights-general-115700108.html,1693915020,STORY,"['PCAR', 'GM', '^GSPC']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – September 5, 2023 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses General Motors GM and PACCAR PCAR.Industry: Automakers (Domestic)Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2143422/ride-the-domestic-auto-industrys-resilience-with-these-2-stocksDespite concerns over higher borrowing costs, Americans' unwavering love for cars and pent-up demand are boosting the outlook of the Zacks Domestic Auto Industry. The industry is set to benefit from strong consumer demand and improved inventory levels, rising incentives and the surging popularity of electric vehicles (EVs).Capitalizing on favorable market trends, domestic automakers are enjoying robust recovery and growth as they overcome pandemic-related challenges. Investors can ride the industry's strength with stocks like General Motors and PACCAR to fetch handsome gains.About the IndustryThe Zacks Domestic Auto industry includes companies that are engaged in designing, manufacturing and retailing vehicles across the globe. These include passenger cars, crossover vehicles, sport utility vehicles, trucks, vans, motorcycles and electric vehicles. The industry — which is highly consumer cyclic and provides employment to a large number of people — is at the forefront of innovation, courtesy of its nature and the transformation that it is going through.The widespread usage of technology and rapid digitization are resulting in a fundamental restructuring of the automotive market. Several companies in the industry have engine and transmission plants and conduct research and development, and testing of electric and autonomous vehicles.Key Investing ThemesDemand Remains Strong Despite High Borrowing Costs:  At the outset of 2023, industry experts anticipated a potential deceleration in the U.S. car market amid the increased cost of vehicle financing. However, consumer demand demonstrated greater resilience than anticipated. New vehicle sales in the second quarter of 2023 topped 4 million units, implying year-over-year and sequential growth of roughly 15% and 13%, respectively.Story continuesOver the first six months, the market achieved sales of approximately 7.69 million units, reflecting a 12.3% increase from the same period in 2022. The demand for automobiles remains strong, indicating that the rise in interest rates has not yet significantly affected purchasing decisions. Quoting Cox Automotive's chief economist Jonathan Smoke, ""Consumers have found a way to buy new wheels.""Although the Fed has indicated the possibility of more rate hikes in the near future, the U.S. vehicle sales outlook for 2023 remains strong. Cox Automotive forecasts full-year vehicle sales at around 15 million units, up from 13.9 million units in 2022.Improving Inventory Levels: Supply constraints have been considerably alleviated. Limited new-vehicle inventory over the past two years that had handcuffed sales is no longer a pressing concern. According to Cox Automotive, new vehicle inventory levels in the United States saw a significant increase of more than 70% in July compared to the same period last year.This increase in inventory availability bodes well for the industry, signaling a potential shift toward a more balanced state between supply and demand. Robust inventories are leading to richer incentives and sweeter discount deals. Incentives increased for the 10th straight month in July to the highest level since October 2021. All these factors are driving the prospects of the industry.Soaring EV Popularity: Heightened climate change concerns, advancements in technology, and strict fuel-emission regulations are resulting in the widespread adoption of eco-friendly vehicles. The demand for electric vehicles is on an upward trajectory, consistently setting new sales records. Last year was the biggest for zero-emission vehicles in the United States.Additionally, 2023 is poised to be a landmark year, with U.S. EV sales projected to surpass 1 million units for the first time. Established car manufacturers are putting in substantial efforts to establish a strong presence in the thriving e-mobility sector. Further, the Inflation Reduction Act is expected to provide a further boost to EV sales. With this ongoing momentum and the anticipated growth ahead, the U.S. auto industry's outlook in the EV market appears promising.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe Zacks Automotive – Domestic industry is an 18-stock group within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #72, which places it in the top 29% of around 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group's earnings growth potential.The industry's earnings estimates for 2023 have increased 7% over the past six months.Before we present you two top-ranked stocks from the industry, let's take a look at the industry's stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Domestic Auto industry has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and sector over the past year. The industry has lost 14.2% against the S&amp;P 500's growth of 15.1%. The sector has declined 7.1% over the said time frame.Industry's Current ValuationSince automotive companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 17.49X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 13.46X and the sector's 12.53X. Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 58.44X, as low as 8.78X and at a median of 18.54X.2 Stocks to BuyGeneral Motors: One of the world's largest automakers, General Motors held the largest share of the U.S. auto market at 16% in 2022. General Motors' compelling portfolio with strong demand for its quality full-size pickups and SUVs bodes well. The company's hot-selling brands in America like Chevrolet Silverado, Equinox and GMC Sierra are driving the top line.  Encouragingly, this legacy U.S. automaker will have nine EV models in the North America market this year, which will buoy top-line growth.The company's Ultium platform and battery plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Lansing, MI are set to scale up its e-mobility prowess. Its superior liquidity profile also instills confidence. General Motors' strides in autonomous vehicle development also augur well for long-term growth.GM currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Motors' 2023 sales implies year-over-year growth of 9.25%. The consensus mark for GM's 2023 and 2024 EPS has moved north by 12 cents and 15 cents, respectively, over the past 30 days. Over the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed estimates on three occasions and missed once, the average surprise being 22.6%.PACCAR: Headquartered in Bellevue, PACCAR is one of the leading names in the trucking business with reputed brands like Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF. The new DAF lineup, comprising the XF, XG and XD models, is driving the firm's revenues. Continued growth in aftermarket parts — which is a high margin and a less cyclic business, thanks to the rampant adoption of its proprietary MX engine — bodes well.Accelerated efforts toward electrification, connected vehicle services and advanced driver-assistance system options are set to bolster PACCAR's prospects. A solid balance sheet with low leverage is another tailwind. PACCAR's strong balance sheet is complemented by A+ and A1 credit ratings assigned by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, respectively.PACCAR currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PACCAR's 2023 sales and earnings implies year-over-year growth of 19% and 48.5%, respectively. The consensus mark for PCAR's 2023 and 2024 EPS has moved north by 70 cents and 38 cents, respectively, over the past 60 days.

Its operating margin is 17.57%, which ranks better than 90.55% of 2422 companies in the Hardware industry. Overall, the profitability of NetApp is ranked 9 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.One of the most important factors in the valuation of a company is growth.

If the ROIC exceeds the WACC, the company is likely creating value for its shareholders.

Yet, factors like macroeconomic uncertainties, pricing pressure and unfavorable currency fluctuations continue to adversely impact Zimmer Biomet's sales. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Zimmer Biomet has been witnessing a rebound in its business in the past few quarters despite macroeconomic challenges. According to the company, procedure recovery continues successfully, aided by no meaningful impact from COVID or staffing challenges. Accordingly, the company is benefiting from increased provider capacity, resulting in backlog pull-through in recent quarters.In terms of business category, Global Knees grew 10.5% in the second quarter of 2023, driven by the strong execution of the company’s four-pillar strategy. It was backed by a robust Persona portfolio, combined with the benefits of the ROSA robotics platform. Global Hips grew 4.9% on the back of new product flow, execution and market recovery.Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. PriceZimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. PriceZimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. price | Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. QuoteZimmer Biomet recently completed its planned spin-off procedure of the dental &amp; spine arm. According to Zimmer Biomet management, the planned spin-off of its Spine and Dental business is part of the company’s third phase of ongoing transformation, which includes changing the complexion of the business through active portfolio management in order to accelerate growth and drive value creation.Recently, Zimmer Biomet implemented four meaningful pillars inside its Knee business to drive pricing stability, mix benefit and competitive conversions.Over the past year, shares of ZBH have risen 13.1% compared with the industry’s 0.6% rise.On the flip side, although Zimmer Biomet is gradually coming out of the impact of the two-and-a-half-year-long healthcare crisis, the ongoing industry-wide trend of staffing shortages and supply chain-related hazards is denting growth. Deteriorating international trade, with global inflationary pressure leading to a tough situation related to raw material and labor cost as well as freight charges, and rising interest rates have put the dental treatment space (which is highly-elective) in a tight spot.Story continuesFurther, within the S.E.T. category, Zimmer Biomet is facing challenges in the form of reimbursement headwinds, particularly in the Restorative Therapies business. In addition, the company also witnessed acute supply challenges within Sports and Trauma. All these are creating significant pressure on the company’s operating profit.Zimmer Biomet also records a significant portion of its sales from the international market. This makes it highly exposed to currency fluctuations.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Haemonetics HAE, Quanterix QTRX and SiBone SIBN.Haemonetics’ stock has risen 19.9% in the past year.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. Check out our latest analysis for Mondelez International How Quickly Is Mondelez International Increasing Earnings Per Share?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Mondelez International managed to grow EPS by 8.4% per year, over three years. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. While we note Mondelez International achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 14% to US$34b. That's progress.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Mondelez International.Story continuesAre Mondelez International Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$95b company like Mondelez International. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$134m. We note that this amounts to 0.1% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Mondelez International but it's still worth mentioning. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Should You Add Mondelez International To Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of Mondelez International is that it is growing profits.

A Comprehensive Guide,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unveiling-occidental-petroleum-oxy-value-153339476.html,1693928019,STORY,"['OXY', 'VALU', 'NG=F', 'CL=F']","[Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) has recently been in the spotlight, with a daily gain of 2.3% and a three-month gain of 11.5%. Its Earnings Per Share (EPS) stands at 5.89. However, this begs the question: Is the stock significantly overvalued? This analysis aims to answer this question and provide an in-depth valuation analysis of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY).Company IntroductionOXY 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of OXYOccidental Petroleum is an independent exploration and production company with operations in the United States, Latin America, and the Middle East. As of the end of 2022, the company reported net proved reserves of 3.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Its net production averaged 1,159 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2022, with a ratio of 75% oil and natural gas liquids and 25% natural gas. Despite its current stock price of $66.05, the GF Value, an estimation of its fair value, stands at $50.36. This discrepancy calls for a deeper exploration of the company's value.Unveiling Occidental Petroleum (OXY)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure that represents the intrinsic value of a stock. It is derived from historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line gives an overview of the stock's ideal fair trading value. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is considered overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Based on the GF Value, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) appears to be significantly overvalued. The stock's fair value is estimated considering historical multiples, the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. At its current price of $ 66.05 per share, Occidental Petroleum stock appears to be significantly overvalued. As a result, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much lower than its future business growth.Story continuesUnveiling Occidental Petroleum (OXY)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideFinancial StrengthInvesting in companies with poor financial strength carries a higher risk of permanent loss of capital. It is crucial to review the financial strength of a company before deciding to invest in its stock. A good starting point is to look at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage. Occidental Petroleum has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.02, which is worse than 91.67% of 1021 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. GuruFocus ranks the overall financial strength of Occidental Petroleum at 5 out of 10, indicating fair financial strength.Unveiling Occidental Petroleum (OXY)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies carries less risk, especially if the company has demonstrated consistent profitability over the long term. A company with high profit margins typically offers better performance potential than a company with low profit margins. Occidental Petroleum has been profitable 6 years over the past 10 years. During the past 12 months, the company had revenues of $31.50 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $5.89. Its operating margin of 29.55% is better than 73.4% of 966 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. GuruFocus ranks Occidental Petroleum's profitability as fair.One of the most important factors in the valuation of a company is its growth. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders, especially if that growth is profitable. The average annual revenue growth of Occidental Petroleum is 12.3%, which ranks better than 54.64% of 851 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 33.1%, which ranks better than 71.41% of 822 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) to its Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is another way to evaluate its profitability. ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, Occidental Petroleum's ROIC was 10.98, while its WACC came in at 10.02.Unveiling Occidental Petroleum (OXY)'s Value: Is It Really Priced Right? A Comprehensive GuideConclusionIn conclusion, the stock of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) appears to be significantly overvalued. The company's financial condition is fair and its profitability is fair. Its growth ranks better than 71.41% of 822 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry.

Also, the high input price in refining activities is making the outlook for the Zacks Oil &amp; Gas US Integrated industry gloomy.Among the companies in the industry that are likely to survive the business challenges are ConocoPhillips COP, Occidental Petroleum Corporation OXY and Hess Corporation HES.About the IndustryThe Zacks Oil &amp; Gas US Integrated industry comprises companies mostly involved in upstream and midstream energy businesses. The upstream operations entail oil and natural gas exploration and production in the prolific shale plays of the United States. The integrated energy companies are also engaged in midstream businesses through gathering and processing facilities along with transportation pipeline networks and storage sites. Overall, the upstream business is positively correlated to oil and gas prices. The produced commodity volumes are transported through midstream assets, generating stable fee-based revenues. The integrated energy players in the United States also have access to downstream operations wherein the transported oil volumes are converted to finished products, comprising gasoline, natural gas liquids and diesel, through refining activities.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Oil &amp; Gas US Integrated IndustryRecession Chances Still Not Over: Cooling inflation and a resilient labor market are still not erasing all the possibilities of recession in the United States. This is spurring market volatility and could hurt energy demand, affecting the overall business of integrated energy players.Input Costs High in Refining Business:  Oil is trading at more than the $80 per barrel mark, significantly increasing input prices of refining operations. This is squeezing the profit of the refining business of the integrated firms in the United States.Story continuesLow Dividend Yield: Over the past two years, the composite stocks belonging to the industry have mostly generated lower dividend yields than the composite stocks belonging to the energy sector.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bearish OutlookThe Zacks Oil &amp; Gas US Integrated industry is a 12-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #154, which places it in the bottom 38% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bearish near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms Sector, Lags S&amp;P 500The Zacks Oil &amp; Gas US Integrated industry has surpassed the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector, but underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite over the past year.The industry has risen 9.7% over this period compared with the broader sector’s growth of 6.7% and the S&amp;P 500’s increase of 15.7%.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationSince oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt.On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio, the industry is currently trading at 4.45X, lower than the S&amp;P 500’s 13.47X. It is, however, higher than the sector’s trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 3.49X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 13.38X, as low as 3.29X, with a median of 5.00X.Trailing 12-Month Enterprise Value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio3 US Integrated Oil Stocks Trying to Survive the Industry ChallengesConocoPhillips: Considering production and reserves, ConocoPhillips is among the leading upstream energy players in the world. COP is strongly focused on returning capital to shareholders. For decades, COP, carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has been banking on its diversified asset base for generating competitive cashflows.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.  Price and Consensus: COPHess: Headquartered in New York, Hess is a leading upstream firm with a footprint in Bakken, the Gulf of Mexico and offshore Guyana.

However, unfavorable currency movements and stiff competition are a concern.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 32.8% compared with the 0.7% rise of the industry and a 13.3% decline of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned manufacturer of medical devices and products has a market capitalization of $78.51 billion. The company’s long-term projected growth of 12.8% compares with the industry’s growth projection of 13.2%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors At PlayGeographic Expansion Continues: Boston Scientific successfully expands operations across different geographies outside the United States. In 2022, 40% of the company’s consolidated revenues came from international regions.In the last reported second quarter of 2023, despite the ongoing weaknesses in Russia, emerging markets registered sturdy growth, primarily banking on solid performance in China. During this period, emerging markets' net sales grew 24% on an operational basis, year over year.MedSurg Market Share Gain Impressive: Boston Scientific is consistently registering fast recovery within its MedSurg segment following pandemic-led mayhem. The Endoscopy business within MedSurg is gaining from strong worldwide demand for its broad range of gastrointestinal (GI) and pulmonary treatment options. Notably, the company is gaining market share with its biliary franchise led by the AXIOS Stent and Delivery System and the hemostasis, single-use imaging and metal stents franchises.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the second quarter of 2023, the company reported strong organic growth contribution from Baylis Medical (the acquisition was closed in February 2022). The Apollo integration is also progressing well and the company recently received FDA clearance for OverStitchNXT, a suturing system that enables suture placement during advanced endoscopicprocedures.Story continuesUpbeat Guidance: Boston Scientific’s full-year net sales growth is expected in the range of 10.5-11.5% on a reported basis (earlier estimate was 8.5-10.5% growth). Net sales growth is expected to be in the range of 10-11% on an organic basis (8-10%).Full-year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $1.96 to $2.00 ($1.90 to $1.96). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.95, below the guidance.For the third quarter of 2023, revenue growth is projected in the range of approximately 8.5-10.5% on a reported basis (an increase of 7-9% organically).Adjusted earnings are expected in the range of 46-48 cents per share.DownsidesExposure to Currency Movement: With Boston Scientific recording 40% of its sales from the international market, it remains highly exposed to currency fluctuations. Unfavorable currency movements have been a significant dampener over the last few quarters, as with other important MedTech players.Competitive Landscape: The presence of many players has made the medical devices market highly competitive. The company participates in several markets, including Cardiovascular, CRM, Endosurgery and Neuromodulation, where it faces competition from large, well-capitalized companies such as Johnson &amp; Johnson, Abbott, Medtronic, Stryker, Smith &amp; Nephew and Edwards Lifesciences, apart from several other smaller companies.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boston Scientific’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $1.99 per share, indicating an 16.4% increase from the 2022 reported number.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 revenues is pegged at $14.07 billion, suggesting a 10.9% rise from the 2022 figure.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Haemonetics HAE, Quanterix QTRX and SiBone SIBN.

Most people do. However, some of the most significant gains over the long haul are often non-pharma healthcare stocks. In September 2022, Barron’s asked prominent portfolio managers about the emerging themes in healthcare. Wellington Management portfolio manager Ann Gallo mentioned utilization as a big trend, benefiting healthcare facilities and medical device manufacturers. Other non-pharma themes included digital healthcare, managed care, and medical services. The four panelists brought together by Barron’s listed some of their favorite healthcare picks. But we are going to delve into three alternative healthcare investments unrelated to the pharmaceutical industry. Each name will have share prices up in 2023 and rated Overweight or better by the analysts covering each stock. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBecton Dickenson (BDX)Source: ShutterstockBecton Dickenson (NYSE:BDX) is up nearly 9.9% year to date. Of the 19 analysts covering its stock, 14 rate it Overweight or Buy, with a target price of $302. When Barron’s piece was written a year ago, the medical supplies and life sciences tools and technology company traded for 14x earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). It now trades at 18x.   The Q3 2023 results show revenue increase by 6.3%, excluding currency, to $4.88 billion, with adjusted earnings per share increasing 15% to $2.96 a share. Revenues were up in the U.S. (57% of sales) and internationally (43%). For all of 2023, it expects $19.3 billion in revenue, with adjusted EPS of $12.21 at the midpoint of its guidance.Boston Scientific (BSX)a zoom-in on the Boston Scientific logo (BSX) on a web pageSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comBoston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) is up nearly 19% year to date (YTD). Of the 32 analysts covering its stock, 28 rate it Overweight or Buy, with a target price of $60.50. In Barron’s roundtable, Gallo pointed to the company’s “above-market growth in all its key divisions. It is positioned to grow broadly for some years into the future”.Story continuesThe medical device company’s shares rallied on Aug. 28 after it reported positive results from its clinical trial for its atrial fibrillation device.  “The Farapulse Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA) uses electric fields to remove heart tissue causing irregular heartbeats, rather than the more traditional thermal method,” Investopedia reported. “The study involved 607 patients with paroxysmal AF who had previously been unsuccessfully treated with at least one anti-arrhythmic drug.”  In Q2 2023, the company’s revenues rose 12.0% year over year (YOY) on an operational basis to $3.60 billion. The company’s guidance had called for 8% growth at its midpoint. Its adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.53, four cents higher than its guidance.  For the year, it expects sales growth of 10.5% to 11.5%, with adjusted EPS between $1.96 and $2.00.Edwards Lifesciences (EW)An image of a tablet with 'therapeutics' on the screen, a stethoscope and face mask around itSource: ra2 studio/ShutterstockEdwards Lifesciences (NYSE:EW) reported its Q2 2023 results at the end of July. While they were better than expected, its shares fell on near-term growth concerns.“It is exiting the pandemic with its leading TAVR (transaortic valve replacement) franchise well positioned for continued growth after the recent lull,” Barron’s reported on Gallo’s comments last September. “Over the next decade, two newer and currently smaller markets, mitral and bicuspid valve repair, will join TAVR as important growth engines.”Despite the decline at the end of July, EW stock remains in positive territory YTD, up nearly 5%. Over the past five years, it’s up 62%, higher than the S&amp;P 500. Of the 30 analysts covering its stock, 16 rate it Overweight or Buy, with a target price of $99, considerably higher than currently trading.In 2023, Edward Lifesciences expects revenue of $6.0 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, up from its previous estimate of $5.8 billion. It expects to earn $2.55 a share this year, up a penny from its previous guidance. Also, it is hopeful that TAVR will generate $3.93 billion in 2023, accounting for more than 65% of its total revenue. This would deliver growth of 11.5% YOY, excluding currency.   As recently as December 2021, it traded near $130. It’s got the growth to get back there in 2024.  On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company value investors might notice is Textron (TXT). TXT is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 14.11 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 20.92. Over the past 52 weeks, TXT's Forward P/E has been as high as 17.68 and as low as 11.81, with a median of 14.11.Investors will also notice that TXT has a PEG ratio of 1.20. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. TXT's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 1.53. TXT's PEG has been as high as 1.40 and as low as 0.98, with a median of 1.15, all within the past year.We should also highlight that TXT has a P/B ratio of 2.20. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 3.06. TXT's P/B has been as high as 2.27 and as low as 1.78, with a median of 2, over the past year.Story continuesValue investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. TXT has a P/S ratio of 1.18. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.21.Finally, investors will want to recognize that TXT has a P/CF ratio of 12.15. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. TXT's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 19.89. Over the past year, TXT's P/CF has been as high as 12.70 and as low as 10.05, with a median of 11.52.These are just a handful of the figures considered in Textron's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that TXT is an impressive value stock right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 0.42% loss on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.56%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 0.08%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the world's largest beverage maker had lost 3.07% over the past month. This has lagged the Consumer Staples sector's loss of 2.52% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 1.02% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Coca-Cola as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, Coca-Cola is projected to report earnings of $0.69 per share, which would represent no growth from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $11.48 billion, up 3.78% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $2.63 per share and revenue of $45.01 billion, which would represent changes of +6.05% and +4.68%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Coca-Cola. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. Coca-Cola is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Coca-Cola has a Forward P/E ratio of 22.52 right now. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 19.82, so we one might conclude that Coca-Cola is trading at a premium comparatively.Story continuesInvestors should also note that KO has a PEG ratio of 3.48 right now. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate.

An In-Depth Exploration,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/davita-dva-true-worth-overpriced-163314390.html,1693931594,STORY,['DVA'],"[DaVita Inc (NYSE:DVA), a leading provider of dialysis services, experienced a daily loss of 4.8% and a 3-month loss of 1.3%. Despite these figures, the company reported an Earnings Per Share (EPS) (EPS) of 5.03. This raises a critical question: Is the stock modestly undervalued? Our valuation analysis, which delves into the company's financial health, profitability, and growth, seeks to provide an answer. We invite you to read on for an in-depth look at DaVita's valuation.Company OverviewWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with DVA. Click here to check it out. DVA 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of DVADaVita (NYSE:DVA) is the largest provider of dialysis services in the United States, with a market share exceeding 35%. The company operates over 3,000 facilities worldwide, treating over 240,000 patients annually. DaVita's revenue primarily comes from government payers, with commercial insurers accounting for nearly all of the company's U.S. dialysis business profits. The current stock price is $98.05, while the GF Value, an estimation of fair value, is $128.32. This discrepancy suggests that the stock may be modestly undervalued.DaVita (DVA)'s True Worth: Is It Overpriced? An In-Depth ExplorationUnderstanding the GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure of a stock's intrinsic value. It's calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.According to GuruFocus' valuation method, DaVita (NYSE:DVA) appears to be modestly undervalued. The stock's fair value is estimated based on historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. At its current price of $98.05 per share, DaVita stock appears to be modestly undervalued. Thus, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be higher than its business growth.Story continuesDaVita (DVA)'s True Worth: Is It Overpriced? An In-Depth ExplorationLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with poor financial strength has a higher risk of permanent loss of capital. Therefore, it's crucial to assess a company's financial strength before deciding to buy its stock. DaVita's cash-to-debt ratio of 0.03 is worse than 92.81% of 654 companies in the Healthcare Providers &amp; Services industry. GuruFocus ranks DaVita's overall financial strength at 4 out of 10, indicating that the company's financial strength is poor.DaVita (DVA)'s True Worth: Is It Overpriced? An In-Depth ExplorationProfitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over the long term, is less risky. DaVita has been profitable 10 out of the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $11.70 billion and an EPS of $5.03. Its operating margin is 10.73%, which ranks better than 73.57% of 647 companies in the Healthcare Providers &amp; Services industry. Overall, DaVita's profitability is ranked 9 out of 10, indicating strong profitability.One of the most critical factors in a company's valuation is growth. Companies that grow faster create more value for shareholders. DaVita's average annual revenue growth is 17.8%, ranking better than 71.28% of 571 companies in the Healthcare Providers &amp; Services industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth is 13.5%, which ranks better than 56.49% of 524 companies in the same industry.ROIC vs WACCComparing a company's return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted cost of capital (WACC) is another way to evaluate its profitability. ROIC measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. WACC is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, DaVita's ROIC was 6.3, while its WACC came in at 5.31.DaVita (DVA)'s True Worth: Is It Overpriced? An In-Depth ExplorationConclusionIn conclusion, DaVita (NYSE:DVA) appears to be modestly undervalued. The company's financial condition is poor, but its profitability is strong. Its growth ranks better than 56.49% of 524 companies in the Healthcare Providers &amp; Services industry.

PACB, popularly known as PacBio, is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its slew of strategic deals over the past few months. The optimism led by a solid second-quarter 2023 performance and its product development activities are expected to contribute further. However, stiff competition and forex volatility persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 108.2% compared with 6.6% growth of the industry and a 15.6% rise of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned global provider of sequencing systems has a market capitalization of $2.86 billion. The company projects 14.5% growth for 2023 and expects to maintain a strong performance. PacBio’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and broke even once, the average surprise being 9.5%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strategic Deals: We are optimistic about PacBio’s robust growth opportunities via its inking of a slew of strategic deals over the past few months. In August, the company and GeneDx announced a research collaboration with the University of Washington to study the capabilities of HiFi long-read whole genome sequencing to increase diagnostic rates in pediatric patients with genetic conditions.Also, in August, PacBio entered into an agreement to acquire Apton Biosystems, Inc.Product Development Activities: We are optimistic about PacBio's solid potential in the RNA-sequencing market, which has been fortifying the company’s footprint worldwide. In August, PacBio announced the commencement of customer shipments of Onso short-read sequencing instruments.In April, PacBio announced the availability of its new high-throughput Nanobind DNA Extraction kits, another key product from its Circulomics acquisition.Strong Q2 Results: PacBio saw a robust increase in its overall top line, including strong Product and Instrument revenues, in the second quarter of 2023. Solid geographical performances were also recorded. Continued strong prospects in the Revio and Onso systems, with customers placing orders for these, were also seen.Story continuesDownsidesForex Volatility: The majority of PacBio’s revenues, expenses and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. Further, a portion of its operations consists of development and sales activities outside the United States, and therefore, the company has foreign exchange exposures relating to non-U.S. dollars. A strengthening of the U.S. dollar exchange rate against all currencies in which PacBio operates, after considering offsetting positions, would have resulted in a significant decrease in the carrying amounts of its net assets.Stiff Competition: PacBio operates in a highly competitive market where its competitors offer nucleic acid sequencing equipment or consumables. Many of these companies currently have greater resources and may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than PacBio to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements.Estimate TrendPacBio has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its adjusted loss per share has narrowed from $1.29 to $1.18.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $48.1 million, suggesting a 48.9% uptick from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc.

DVA, Encompass Health Corp. EHC, Option Care Health, Inc. OPCH and RadNet, Inc. RDNT.Industry: Outpatient/Home HealthcareLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2143657/4-stocks-to-buy-in-a-booming-outpatient-home-health-industryThe pandemic altered the nature and dynamics of the healthcare industry. The Zacks Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare industry, after struggling with lower outpatient clinic visits and inability to provide quality home healthcare, has gradually shifted to digital healthcare treatment. In the past few years, there has been a significant rise in demand for telemedicine-focused online medical and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered technology services.Post-pandemic, many healthcare companies that were traditionally not technology-based transformed to survive in the market. Per a report by Grand View Research, the global healthcare analytics market was valued at $35.3 billion in 2022 and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 21.4% between 2023 and 2030. Another factor prompting these MedTech players to embrace digital healthcare is the skyrocketing healthcare costs.On a positive note, rising dependence on telehealth and AI is likely to help the industry thrive in the near term. DaVita Inc., Encompass Health Corp., Option Care Health, Inc. and RadNet, Inc. are likely to gain from the prospects.Industry DescriptionThe industry comprises companies that offer ambulatory care in an outpatient setting or at home. They use advanced medical technologies for diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation services. The players include operators of HMO medical centers, kidney dialysis centers and other outpatient care centers. After navigating a tough pandemic era, the payers and providers have been seeing steady growth on the back of innovation in services. This buoys optimism about prospects over the next few years, although persistent inflation in consumer prices could dent the outlook.Story continuesThe potential for scaling up innovation, prompted by the pandemic's pressure on the healthcare system, is an added plus. Also, the acceleration of value-based care models and the increasing application of technology across the healthcare industry are likely to continue in the long run.Major Trends Shaping the Future of the Outpatient and Home Healthcare IndustryCost Effectiveness: The primary advantage of outpatient clinics is cost-effectiveness. Outpatient medical care clinics do not retain patients for long hours (overnight) or charge exorbitantly. Modern-day outpatient clinics offer a broad spectrum of treatment and diagnostic options and even minor surgical procedures. Financial incentives like health plans and government program payment policies supporting services in lower-cost care settings have also been driving outpatient care.Additionally, with value-based models of care steadily emerging as the future of healthcare, the shift from fee-for-service (FFS) to alternative payment models (APM) is an ongoing parallel trend. FFS will be crucial to care organizations as a benchmark through which providers can assess APM.AI's Dominant Role: AI has been a roaring success in healthcare. It is no wonder that it has taken the outpatient and home healthcare space by storm. Outpatient companies prefer bots and automated techniques for managing health information. With the help of AI, hospitals have been achieving better outcomes, with patients receiving more efficient and personalized care. The outpatient industry has been generating huge profits from Electronic Health Records and ePrescriptions.The most visible area where AI can make a significant difference is in mental healthcare at home. Addressing the most prevalent mental health conditions among home care patients —depression, anxiety and dementia — is essential to improve overall patient well-being. In recent years, complex machine learning algorithms have become capable of analyzing large datasets of patient information, including clinical and social diagnoses. These systems can alert caregivers regarding potential triggers or warning signs of mental health deterioration.Dependence on Telehealth: The pandemic caused a decline in outpatient clinic visits where home healthcare providers struggled to offer quality care due to the risk of exposure to the virus. Though the impact of the pandemic has been far-reaching, it has accelerated healthcare innovation. Home healthcare can gain from the benefits provided by Medicare (and several other payers) that comprise a broad range of services that can be delivered in a patient's home, including post-operative and chronic wound care.Home healthcare has seen a surge in the utilization of the telehealth platform in response to the pandemic. With the rise in elderly population and the increasing costs of in-person health care, the demand for home-based health care will emerge. People with chronic illnesses and disabilities also require home-based care.The rising demand for remote patient monitoring (RPM) has considerably driven the demand for wearable technology to monitor patient's health. Although wearables have been popular for several years, their integration with AI has recently increased their popularity immensely and has become a powerful home healthcare tool. AI technology-powered RPM enables healthcare firms to provide consistent patient care without occupying space in their hospitals and facilities, thus reducing overcrowding.Staffing Shortages: The U.S. healthcare industry has been experiencing a severe shortage of workers at every level, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. Among support personnel, there is a laxity of home health aides. The increasing international migration of health workers may aggravate health workforce shortfalls, especially in low-income and lower-middle income countries. Another reason for the acute staffing shortage is high burnout due to physical, emotional and mental exhaustion. Thus, these overworked employees are leaving the profession at an accelerating rate.Healthcare staffing shortages lead to poor patient outcomes that can include hospital-acquired infections, patient falls and increased probabilities of death. With a lesser number of staff available in hospital settings for patient care, there has been a gradual shift toward home healthcare for non-critical patients who can be monitored remotely.Zacks Industry RankThe Zacks Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare industry falls within the broader Zacks Medical sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #41, which places it in the top 16% of nearly 250 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects.

The upside can be linked to strength across the Aerospace segment (which accounts for the bulk of the company’s top line), recovery in GE Vernova’s (the combined operations of GE Power and Renewable) operations and shareholder-friendly policies.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCommercial aerospace strength is driving growth of the Aerospace segment. Significant growth in LEAP engine deliveries is driving commercial engines revenues. Growth in the commercial services business and a significant increase in defense engine orders also bode well for the segment’s growth. The segment’s revenues and orders jumped 27% and 25% in the first six months of 2023, respectively.After months of softness, a rebound in demand at the Power segment augurs well for General Electric. Strength in GE Gas Power’s heavy-duty gas turbine transactional services and GE gas turbine business is aiding the Power segment. The company expects low-single-digit revenue growth for the Power segment in 2023 driven by Gas Power services. The acquisition of Nexus Controls (April 2023), which allows the creation of a single, full-service controls business line for further development of GE’s proprietary Mark Vle controls systems platform, should bolster the segment’s growth.With higher equipment demand at Grid and Onshore Wind in North America, signs of progress in the Renewables segment are encouraging. For 2023, the company expects GE Renewable Energy revenues to increase in the high-single digits.Given continued strength in GE Aerospace and improvement in GE Vernova, General Electric has raised its full-year guidance. The company now expects revenues to increase in low double digits compared with the high-single-digit growth anticipated earlier. It expects adjusted earnings of $2.10-$2.30 per share compared with $1.70-$2.00 estimated earlier. GE expects an operating profit of $4.7-$5.1 billion for 2023. It expects free cash flow of $4.1-$4.6 billion for 2023 compared with $3.6-$4.2 billion estimated earlier.General Electric’s commitment to reward its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks is encouraging. In the first six months of 2023, the company paid dividends of $350 million, up 19% year over year. In the same period, GE repurchased 6.2 million shares for $0.6 million under the above authorization.Story continuesWill the Uptrend in Shares Continue?General Electric is expected to continue to thrive on the back of momentum across its Aerospace segment as demand for jet engine spare parts and services increases with the boom in air travel demand. GE expects Aerospace revenues to increase in the high teens to 20% in 2023.In March, General Electric provided a bullish long-term view for the Aerospace segment. For 2025, the company expects the segment’s revenues to increase in the low double digits to mid-teens. For the long term, GE predicts mid-single to high-single-digit revenue growth for the Aerospace segment. It expects continued margin expansion for the unit over the long term.Continued recovery in GE Vernova’s operations is expected to foster GE’s growth. The recent acquisition of data integration platform company, Greenbird Integration Technology AS, bolsters GE Vernova’s growth. The buyout facilitates GridOS, the first software portfolio designed for grid orchestration, by adding new capabilities for connecting systems and integrating data across the grid smoothly.Zacks Rank &amp; Other Stocks to ConsiderGeneral Electric sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Below we discuss some top-ranked industrial companies:Flowserve Corporation FLS presently sports a Zacks Rank #1.

The pursuit of buyouts, a solid financial position and a robust 2023 outlook are other tailwinds.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceUnitedHealth Group currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock has lost 0.9% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 1.1% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFavorable Style ScoreUNH currently carries an impressive Value Score of A.Rising EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealth Group’s 2023 earnings and revenues is pegged at $24.83 per share and $367.8 billion, respectively, indicating an improvement of 11.9% and 13.5% from the year-ago reported figures.UNH boasts an impressive surprise record. Its earnings outpaced estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 3.4%.Solid Return on EquityUnitedHealth Group’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds can be substantiated by its trailing 12-month return on equity of 26.7%, which remains higher than the industry’s average of 24.7%.Robust 2023 OutlookUnitedHealth Group anticipates revenues between $357 billion and $360 billion, the mid-point of which indicates an improvement of 10.6% from the 2022 reported figure.Adjusted net earnings per share are estimated to be between $24.70 and $25 for the year. The mid-point of the updated guidance suggests 12% growth from the 2022 figure.Key DriversRevenues of UnitedHealth Group continue to benefit from solid contributions from its UnitedHealthcare and Optum businesses. Premiums contributed 78% to the company’s total revenues in the second quarter. It is expected to rise further as UnitedHealth Group continues to serve more people through Medicare and Medicaid Advantage plans.Through the UnitedHealthcare unit, UNH devises effective Medicare and Medicaid businesses, as well as integrates lucrative features within them from time to time. The top line of UnitedHealthcare segment is expected to benefit as the company grows its existing Medicaid markets and serves more people through fee-based and risk-based commercial offerings.Story continuesThe company expects to add more than 900,000 members to its Medicare Advantage plan this year, expanding its membership base and fetching higher premiums. The Medicaid business is set to grow as it continues to support states in initiating redeterminations.Optum Health segment will continue to gain from more people served under value-based care arrangements and consistent strengthening of care delivery services. Optum Insight and Optum Rx are expected to benefit from enhanced capabilities and new sales and opportunities. However, excellent customer retention should also favor Optum Rx results. The company expects to serve more than 4 million patients in value-based care arrangements through Optum in 2023.UnitedHealth Group has been pursuing collaborations with renowned healthcare providers to bolster its capabilities and solidify its nationwide presence. Its acquisition of Amedisys should enhance and expand its in-home capabilities and fuel growth in the Optum Health segment. Moreover, UNH will get access to Amedisys’s Medicare customers, thus enhancing its benefits business in the future. The company’s launch of Price Edge and zero-cost life-saving drugs should help retain more customers in the future.The company also earns through investment income. The metric increased nearly three-fold in the second quarter. A high-interest rate environment should boost this metric in the future.A solid financial position is a dire need for companies that keep an eye on continued business investments. Apart from growth-related initiatives, a sound financial stand instills confidence in UNH in the tactical deployment of capital through share buybacks and dividend payments.

355,9f48e53d-db70-3ea6-8337-67895296c31c,ADP,2023-09-06,Is Now The Time To Put Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) On Your Watchlist?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-time-put-automatic-data-120027887.html,1694001627,STORY,['ADP'],"[It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for Automatic Data Processing How Quickly Is Automatic Data Processing Increasing Earnings Per Share?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. Therefore, there are plenty of investors who like to buy shares in companies that are growing EPS. Automatic Data Processing managed to grow EPS by 13% per year, over three years. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Our analysis has highlighted that Automatic Data Processing's revenue from operations did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. The music to the ears of Automatic Data Processing shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 23% to 25% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.Story continuesYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Automatic Data Processing?Are Automatic Data Processing Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Automatic Data Processing has a market capitalisation of US$104b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$163m. This comes in at 0.2% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.While it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Automatic Data Processing, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$12m.Automatic Data Processing offered total compensation worth US$6.9m to its CEO in the year to June 2022. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Does Automatic Data Processing Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One important encouraging feature of Automatic Data Processing is that it is growing profits. Earnings growth might be the main attraction for Automatic Data Processing, but the fun does not stop there. Boasting both modest CEO pay and considerable insider ownership, you'd argue this one is worthy of the watchlist, at least. Of course, just because Automatic Data Processing is growing does not mean it is undervalued. If you're wondering about the valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

The EMC Index tracks how people think and feel about their jobs, their place on the organizational chart, and their employers. Blending ADP's extensive data set representing more than 25 million U.S. workers with nearly a decade of continued surveys of more than 490,000 workers in 29 countries, Today at Work examines the entire employee lifecycle to provide a people-centered and comprehensive view of the world of work.""With so much data at our fingertips, we have the opportunity to tell the full story of the workforce with an eye toward its continued evolution and change,"" said Dr. Nela Richardson, ADP chief economist and head of the ADP Research Institute. ""For example, productivity has always been a key metric monitored by decision-makers and economists, but understanding what drives productivity has been difficult to measure. In this report, we're able to illustrate the important link between motivation and commitment and productivity.""A NEW RESEARCH-DRIVEN RESOURCE Released quarterly, Today at Work taps into ADP's anonymized and aggregated data, regular surveys, and ongoing ADPRI research to provide a thorough, quarterly analysis. These research-driven insights can provide business leaders with a fresh perspective and ongoing source of actionable metrics to help them make informed decisions in areas where data historically has been lacking.Story continuesTODAY AT WORK, September 2023Part 1: The Hidden Truth About PromotionsCommitted and motivated workers are more likely to land promotions, and keeping these recently promoted employees is key to supporting business growth. ADPRI analyzed the full job histories of more than 1.2 million U.S workers from 2019 through 2022 to see if there was a relationship between receiving a promotion and leaving the company. The model found an unintended consequence associated with promotions under certain conditions.For more information on the model, visit ADP Research Institute's Data LabADPRI's model revealed a flight risk for certain workers within a specific timeframe following their promotion. Within a month after receiving their first promotion, 29 percent of people had left their employer. Had these people not been promoted, only 18 percent would have moved on. By the six-month mark, that risk narrows, and both newly promoted workers and those who had not been promoted had the same chance of leaving the company for any reason.Additional variables can factor into the impact of a promotion. Workers in jobs with fewer entry requirements are more likely to quit after being newly promoted, for example. In roles that demand extensive preparation such as graduate school or an advanced technical degree, a promotion increased a manager's risk of leaving more than it did for non-managerial workers.Preparing for Talent Growth An employer's strategic approach to promotions and their follow-through are key to employee retention.Provide career development opportunities that help workers transition into their new roles and responsibilities, which could, in turn, increase worker commitment to their employer.Be prepared for potential resignations. Have a plan to mitigate losing critical managerial talent.Incentivize retention among key groups and those with the greatest likelihood of leaving, such as low-wage workers.Part 2: The Employee Motivation and Commitment IndexMotivated and committed workers are invaluable to employers, but tracking their state of mind can be challenging. To uncover what drives employees, ADPRI developed a tool to measure worker allegiance. The EMC Index, built on nearly a decade of continued surveys of more than 490,000 workers in 29 countries, measures how employees feel about their place at work and whether they're thriving. This intelligence can help organizations boost productivity and provide insight into labor force dynamics.In August 2023, the EMC Index fell from 108 to 100, its lowest point since June 2022. The index peaked in December 2022 at 121, after a year of robust pay growth, strong hiring, and the rise of remote work.For more on how ADPRI constructed the EMC Index, visit ADP Research Institute's Data LabProductivity, Industry, and Demographics The EMC Index also revealed a strong relationship between output and worker motivation and commitment. High-productivity workers are 2.6 times more likely to respond positively to questions about their work and motivation.A person's industry also might influence their level of motivation and commitment. Technology by far has the biggest share of motivated and committed workers (42%), followed by information (37%), and construction and related trades (34%). Healthcare (22%), education (20%), and transportation and warehousing (19%) fall to the lower levels. Information, which includes publishing, web hosting, television, and telecommunications, has been on a downward trend.Looking at gender, men revealed much higher motivation and commitment scores between the ages of 20 and 54.""This is only the beginning of what this series of reports will offer,"" Richardson said. ""For the first time, we're combining ADP's unparalleled hard data with people-centric surveys to identify actionable insights for decision-makers.""For additional findings, visit Today at Work.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Stocks to Buy with Steady Dividends.Investment trends have evolved significantly over time in response to shifts in the market and the preferences of investors. Nevertheless, dividend stocks have consistently attracted interest in the market due to their capacity to provide a dependable source of income. Nearly 77% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 pay dividends and the policies of individual companies can vary widely, with some paying higher dividends than others.Over the years, the importance of dividends in contributing to overall investment returns has increased significantly. A report from Morgan Stanley suggested that in the coming years, stock market gains may be smaller with higher volatility. As a result, the portion of the market returns coming from dividends might become more important. From 2013 to 2022, dividends made up about 17% of the total returns in the S&amp;P 500 Index. However, if we look at a much longer period starting from the 1930s, dividends contributed to 37% of the returns. It's expected that the next few years will resemble this longer-term trend. This growing recognition of the role dividends play in long-term wealth accumulation has led to increased attention from investors seeking both income and capital appreciation.Since the start of 2023, a group of giant tech companies has made it difficult for other parts of the market to perform better than the S&amp;P 500. While dividend stocks, in general, have not done well compared to the index this year, there have been some positive developments. The ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL), which invests in companies with dividend growth track records over 25 consecutive years, is aiming to recover with its straightforward approach. The fund has gained 4.98% year-to-date, which is considerably lower than the 18.9% return of the S&amp;P 500. However, this performance represents a promising beginning in terms of a potential recovery for the fund.Story continuesThe Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the most popular stocks among investors that have raised their dividends for decades. These companies are resilient, profitable, generate substantial cash flow, and are typically capable of enduring various economic conditions.Analysts have been paying close attention to dividend stocks this year due to their possible resurgence in the markets. In one of her recent interviews with CNBC, Sandy Pomeroy, a senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman, presented a positive outlook on dividend stocks over the next years. Here are some comments from the analyst:“Dividend stocks are so cheap right now, that maybe you just have a reversal based on the fact that they are as cheap as they have been since the tech boom of the 1990s. When we did that we were three standard deviations cheaper relative to that period, three standard deviations cheaper now. And they went on to have a great decade. They were the outperformers for the next ten years.”In view of these arguments and the analyst’s remarks, we will discuss some of the best dividend stocks to buy with steady dividends.15 Stocks to Buy with Steady DividendsOur Methodology:For this article, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 910 hedge funds as of Q2 2023 and picked dividend stocks with over 10 consecutive years of dividend growth and dividend yields over 2%, as of September 4. After that, we gathered the price forecasts and ratings given to these stocks by Wall Street analysts and other investment firms.

For a quick overview of the top 10, read our article 10 Friendliest Cities in America. The United States has become a successful center of cultural blending over the years. Its diversity is a key driver of its success. The 2020 Diversity Index shows that the racial and ethnic diversity within the United States is 61.1%. This index measures the likelihood that two people chosen at random will be from different races or ethnicities. This diversity not only fosters a climate of freedom in terms of political and cultural beliefs but also serves as a magnetic force, drawing people from all corners of the world to immigrate to the United States.According to a Pew Research Center's 2023 survey, 59% of people voted Americans as friendly, indicating that America's soft power remains strong.Therefore, it is not surprising that the US receives a large influx of foreign visitors each year from Canada, Europe, and other regions and is one of the most visited countries in the world. A Peak into the US Tourism IndustryTourism is one of the major contributors to the US economy, with its contribution projected to be $2.6 billion in gross domestic product (GDP) over the next decade. According to the State Comptroller, New York City is among the most popular destinations globally and is especially popular with digital nomads. Moreover, international travel spending in the country has been predicted to surge even further than the $112.1 billion recorded in September of 2022. Experts believe that the figure could go up to $1.39 trillion by the end of 2025.United Airlines (NASDAQ: UAL) published performance reports for the second quarter of 2023 in July, which showed a three-fold growth in its profit. The impressive performance and higher revenue generation of the carrier have been credited to a busy summer international travel season. Story continuesAs reported in a News Release by United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), the airline recorded operating revenue of $14.2 billion from April to June, which was a 17.1% increase from the same time period in 2022. Meanwhile, billings surged to $1.1 billion, a substantial increase from $329 billion recorded in 2022. United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) entered into a commercial agreement in March 2023 with Emirates Airlines to enhance the network for each airline. The agreement will also open up newer destinations for customers.Meanwhile, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) has raised its earnings outlook due to the company closing the second quarter of 2023 on a strong note. It recorded a revenue of $14.01 billion, which exceeded analysts’ expectations and was 4.7% higher than the figure from 2022. The high airline revenues clearly suggest that tourism in the US is booming. Tourists are attracted to the beautiful beaches, rich history, and helpful locals of America. Moreover, volunteering and other Corporate Social Responsibility(CSR) activities from US companies further boost the positive image of the country.Charitable Efforts from Companies in the USMajor companies in the US lead the way when it comes to charitable efforts. For example, Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS)'s Disney Family Volunteering Reward Program in 2020 offered free tickets to people in exchange for a day of volunteer service, which motivated more than 1 million people in the US to participate.In February 2023, the company announced that it would be providing access to its diverse portfolio of innovative programs that have been uniquely developed for children's hospitals. These include complimentary access to digital content, in-hospital installations, and mobile cinema complexes.Another company that is playing its part in enhancing the positive image of the US is Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), a digital travel platform also known as booking.com. It joined hands with a climate tech company, CHOOOSE, in October 2022 to encourage people to travel more mindfully. Its primary aim for this partnership was to educate travelers on the carbon implications of their actions and help them find environmentally friendly products and services.30 Friendliest Cities in AmericaImage by qgadrian from PixabayMethodologyWe have defined ‘friendliest cities in the US’ as ones that are home to friendly locals who are nice to foreign travelers when asked for help.

First up, we've got to take a look at United, shares off just about 3%. Now, the airline moving lower after it issued a brief ground stop nationwide according to the FAA the airline experienced technology issues and was unable to dispatch flights through their normal procedure. So we're looking at United under pressure here.Allie, this is nothing new when it comes to the airline industry, right? We all remember what happened to Southwest back around the holiday season when they were forced to ground flights. They weren't able to get those flights off of the ground because of some of their own tech issues here. But it speaks to one outdated system that these airlines are working on.But that's also not the only story that's going on with airlines today. We were just talking about the jump that we've seen in crude prices, clearly that is also a headwind, a challenge here for the sector going forward.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah. It feels like airlines can't really catch a break. You also have worker shortages that include the pilot shortage. You mentioned that Southwest meltdown back in December. Clearly that was scarring to a lot of consumers.And it made me think about how when anything goes wrong in an airline, you see it online. You see it on social media. People have their phones out. And it adds to this pessimistic outlook when we think about the future of travel.That being said, consumers are still traveling. It makes me wonder what could happen for the holiday season and whether or not these airlines are able to handle that demand both on the tech side, on the worker side, and then as you were mentioning, with fuel prices as well. So a lot of questions there, but you're seeing the sector down across the board right now.]"

Fresh concerns over the banking sector, a weakening Chinese economy and fears of higher rates for a longer-than-expected period took a toll on investors’ sentiment. SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust SPY, the proxy version of the S&amp;P 500 Index, shed 1.4% last month.Despite the losses, some stocks in the ETF stood tall. We have highlighted five stocks that have gained in double digits or close to double digits and have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). These include Broadridge Financial Solutions BR, Arista Networks ANET, Nvidia NVDA, Eaton Corporation plc ETN and Ross Stores Inc. ROST.An analyst from Fitch Ratings slashed the outlook for the entire U.S. banking industry, possibly affecting the credit ratings of more than 70 banks, including giants JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC). The move came following multiple bank downgrades by fellow credit agency Moody’s and thus deepened worries for the sector. Additionally, retail sales and industrial production in the world’s second-biggest economy grew less than expected in July, thus intensifying worries over the health of the China economy (read: The New ETF That Protects Against All Market Losses).On the other hand, a raft of strong economic data kept alive fears of higher interest rates for a longer period. U.S. retail sales came in better than expected, rising 0.7% in July. Additionally, inflation rose for the first time in July after 12 straight months of decline.The Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, expressed confidence in continued economic growth in the United States, citing “robust” consumer spending and early signs of a recovery in the housing market. However, the Fed warned that inflation is still too high and that the central bank is prepared to raise interest rates further and keep the borrowing costs high until inflation comes down to the target range of 2%.Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of SPY.Story continuesSPY in FocusSPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust holds 503 stocks in its basket, with each accounting for no more than 7.5% of the assets. This suggests a nice balance across each security and prevents heavy concentration. The fund is widely spread across sectors with information technology, healthcare, financials and consumer discretionary accounting for a double-digit allocation each.SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust has AUM of $413.4 billion and charges 9 bps in fees per year. The product trades in a heavy volume of around 64 million shares a day on average, ensuring higher liquidity with a tight bid/ask spread, leading to lower trading costs for investors.

372,4aa3db47-3d60-3eaa-a3fc-1395020786e3,AFL,2023-09-06,Here's Why Investors Should Retain Hartford Financial (HIG),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-investors-retain-hartford-140300050.html,1693922580,STORY,"['HIG', 'AFL']","[The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. HIG has gained on growing premiums attributable to rate hikes and new business growth. Acquisitions and product launches, as well as adequate cash-generating abilities, are additional tailwinds for the stock.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceHartford Financial currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The stock has gained 11.4% in a year compared with the industry’s 0.2% growth. The Zacks Finance sector and the S&amp;P 500 composite increased 8.1% and 15.6%, respectively, in the same time frame.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRobust Growth ProspectsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hartford Financial’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $7.80 per share, indicating an improvement of 3.2% from the prior-year reading, while the same for revenues stands at $16.5 billion, implying an 8.4% increase from the prior-year actual.The consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $9.46 per share, suggesting 21.3% growth from the 2023 estimate. The same for revenues stands at $17.9 billion, which indicates a rise of 8.7% from the 2023 estimate.Decent Earnings Surprise HistoryHIG’s bottom line surpassed earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and matched the mark once, the average surprise being 9.36%.Solid Return on EquityThe return on equity for Hartford Financial is currently 17.5%, which is higher than the industry’s average of 10.8%. The figure substantiates the company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds.Business TailwindsHartford Financial gains from strong contributions by its Commercial Lines and Group Benefits businesses. The Commercial Lines unit is aided by continued rate increases, new business growth and strong customer retention rates, which in turn, drive premiums. Improved fully insured ongoing premiums driven by robust sales and solid persistency contribute to the impressive performance of HIG’s Group Benefits business. The insurer makes efforts to bolster its suite of group benefits offerings and its move of introducing a critical illness insurance product covering more than 160 health conditions this year bear testament to the same.Story continuesImproved premiums flowing from Commercial Lines and Group Benefits businesses bode well for the top line of Hartford Financial, since premiums account for a significant chunk of any insurer’s revenues.Though catastrophe losses come with its own share of worries, frequent losses ramp up the policy renewal rate and sustain the steady flow of premiums to HIG. Hartford Financial also has reinsurance agreements in place, which limit the losses suffered.HIG has been resorting to product launches or acquisitions to upgrade capabilities and strengthen its nationwide presence. It has undertaken divestitures to intensify focus on its U.S. operations and release capital, which in turn, offer increased financial flexibility to pursue business investments. Cost-cutting measures are an indication of Hartford Financial’s efforts to provide respite to margins in the days ahead.A strong financial position equips Hartford Financial to engage in the tactical deployment of capital through share buybacks or dividend payments. The insurer had a leftover capacity of $2 billion under its share repurchase program as of Jun 30, 2023.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the insurance space include Arch Capital Group Ltd. ACGL, Aflac Incorporated AFL and Chubb Limited CB. While Arch Capital currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Aflac and Chubb carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Arch Capital’s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average surprise being 26.83%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ACGL’s 2023 earnings indicates a rise of 38.2%, while the same for revenues suggests an improvement of 30.6% from the respective year-ago actuals. The consensus mark for ACGL’s 2023 earnings has moved 2.3% north in the past 30 days.The bottom line of Aflac beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 7.76%.

373,bab040db-fc1f-3922-bb55-62d81ce0f1b3,AFL,2023-09-06,The 3 Most Promising Dividend Stocks to Own Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-most-promising-dividend-stocks-124208532.html,1693399328,STORY,"['CVX', 'AFL']","[Since the market highs in July, stocks have been under considerable pressure. Indeed, 10-year Treasury yields are at the highest level since the global financial crisis. As a result, investors now have an alternative with a higher yield and lower risk than dividend stocks.However, over the long term, dividend stocks offer better returns. Particularly, dividend growth stocks can provide a higher return from an increasing dividend and capital appreciation. According to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, since 1926, dividends have accounted for almost a third of total stock returns.I started with the Dividend Aristocrat list to find the best dividend stock picks. These stocks have increased yearly dividends for the last 25 consecutive years. Then, I screened for those that have grown their dividends by over 5% in the previous one-year and five-year periods. Another requirement was that the payout ratio be below 40% to give enough room for future increases.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLastly, you want to avoid overpaying even for the best dividend stocks. Thus, I included a valuation screen requiring a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) not greater than 10. The screen produced the following promising dividend stocks.Chevron (CVX)Chevron (CVX) sing with ""diesel,"" ""food mart"" and ""car wash"" written underneathSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comIn the energy sector, one of the best dividend stocks to buy is Chevron (NYSE:CVX). The integrated oil major is in a great position to deliver dividend growth. It has a strong balance sheet and diversified operations in oil and gas production, refining and chemicals.Fundamentally, this energy giant has never been in better shape. In 2022, they reported a record $35 billion profit from soaring energy prices. And although crude oil prices declined to the 60s earlier this year, they have rebounded above $80. The only weakness has been in the chemicals business, which is experiencing a downturn this year.Chevron’s prospects going forward are even more attractive. It has made two key acquisitions, Noble Energy and PDC Energy, over the last three years. These acquisitions have enhanced the company’s reserves and are accretive to earnings after considering cost synergies.Story continuesAdditionally, Goldman analyst Neil Mehta expects several projects to come online and has upgraded CVX stock to a “buy” rating. Its Tengiz project in Kazakhstan is 98% complete, and some Gulf of Mexico projects are also coming online. An increase in production volumes in the 2024 -2026 period will significantly boost earnings, especially if oil prices remain above $80.Given the robust fundamental backdrop, the dividend prospects are very attractive. CVX stock yields 3.8%, yet the payout ratio is a low 37%. The company has increased its dividend at a 6.2% annual rate over the last five years. With a 36-year record of consecutive increases, expect more dividend growth down the road.In addition to dividends, the company also has a record $75 billion buyback. In short, this dividend stock is growing and focusing on shareholder returns. Yet it trades at a bargain trailing P/E of only 10.Aflac (AFL)An image of US currency. dividend stocks for steady incomeSource: ShutterstockProfessional / Shutterstock.comAflac (NYSE:AFL) is another stock that should be on your dividend stocks watchlist. The company offers supplemental health and life insurance in Japan and the U.S. In the U.S., it’s the number one supplemental health insurance provider.This insurance stock has a consistent history of cash flow generation and capital returns. Through the years, it has rewarded shareholders with great dividends. Its 41 consecutive years of dividend increases is a record matched by only a handful of dividend stocks.Although interest rates are rising, Aflac is a buy. Among insurance peers, the company is less vulnerable to rising interest rates. Its focus on supplemental health insurance reduces its earnings sensitivity to interest rates. And its fundamental prospects are positive.In the second quarter of FY2023, it continued its rollout of WINGS cancer insurance and Child Endowment policies in Japan. Due to these new products, cancer insurance sales in the country increased 60% year-over-year. Meanwhile, in the U.S., it saw strong growth from agents and brokers.In terms of returns, it paid out $252 million in dividends in the quarter. Additionally, it repurchased $700 million worth of shares. The company has adequate wiggle room to increase dividend payments further. Currently, it has a dividend yield of 2.3% and a payout ratio of only 22%. Regarding dividend growth, it has increased its dividend at an annualized rate of 10.1% in the last five years.Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM)stock market ticker screen with the word ""dividends"" appearing in large text. Must-Have Dividend StocksSource: iQoncept/shutterstock.comArcher-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) has been a key player in the agricultural commodities market. According to ETC Group, it’s one of the companies that dominates the global food supply chain and is the third largest agricultural commodity trader. Today, it’s still among the promising dividend stocks to buy.It acquires, transports, stores, processes, and distributes agricultural commodities and food ingredients. The Chicago-based company is the world’s largest corn processor and oil seed business. Considering that the global population is still rising and the world needs to eat, the company’s future is bright.From the dividend record, it’s clear this consumer defensive company operates in one of the most stable industries. The company has built a moat through its global distribution network that smaller peers can hardly match. To paint a picture of its scale, it originates more than 10% of the worldwide crop.The company has a robust capital allocation framework for the strong cash flows it generates from distribution and processing. It allocates 30% to 40% of free cash flow to reinvestment and growth opportunities. Then, it returns the rest to shareholders.Due to this framework, it holds an impressive 50-year record of dividend increases. Over the last five years, the dividend has grown at a 6.1% annualized rate. Last year, the company reported record profits due to inflation. And in true dividend aristocrat fashion, it increased the dividend by 12.5%.Going forward, ADM is one of the most reliable dividend stocks. Given the defensive nature of its business and its global scale, it will grow its earnings as the population increases. Furthermore, it yields 2.2% and could increase the dividend substantially, given its low 23.1% payout ratio.The stock deserves a higher multiple due to its stability and growth prospects. Yet it trades at a dirt cheap 10 trailing P/E.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Stocks to Buy with Steady Dividends.Investment trends have evolved significantly over time in response to shifts in the market and the preferences of investors. Nevertheless, dividend stocks have consistently attracted interest in the market due to their capacity to provide a dependable source of income. Nearly 77% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 pay dividends and the policies of individual companies can vary widely, with some paying higher dividends than others.Over the years, the importance of dividends in contributing to overall investment returns has increased significantly. A report from Morgan Stanley suggested that in the coming years, stock market gains may be smaller with higher volatility. As a result, the portion of the market returns coming from dividends might become more important. From 2013 to 2022, dividends made up about 17% of the total returns in the S&amp;P 500 Index. However, if we look at a much longer period starting from the 1930s, dividends contributed to 37% of the returns. It's expected that the next few years will resemble this longer-term trend. This growing recognition of the role dividends play in long-term wealth accumulation has led to increased attention from investors seeking both income and capital appreciation.Since the start of 2023, a group of giant tech companies has made it difficult for other parts of the market to perform better than the S&amp;P 500. While dividend stocks, in general, have not done well compared to the index this year, there have been some positive developments.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Stocks to Buy with Steady Dividends.Investment trends have evolved significantly over time in response to shifts in the market and the preferences of investors. Nevertheless, dividend stocks have consistently attracted interest in the market due to their capacity to provide a dependable source of income. Nearly 77% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 pay dividends and the policies of individual companies can vary widely, with some paying higher dividends than others.Over the years, the importance of dividends in contributing to overall investment returns has increased significantly. A report from Morgan Stanley suggested that in the coming years, stock market gains may be smaller with higher volatility. As a result, the portion of the market returns coming from dividends might become more important. From 2013 to 2022, dividends made up about 17% of the total returns in the S&amp;P 500 Index. However, if we look at a much longer period starting from the 1930s, dividends contributed to 37% of the returns. It's expected that the next few years will resemble this longer-term trend. This growing recognition of the role dividends play in long-term wealth accumulation has led to increased attention from investors seeking both income and capital appreciation.Since the start of 2023, a group of giant tech companies has made it difficult for other parts of the market to perform better than the S&amp;P 500.

382,19ee27fa-c238-3cd8-84e2-d2a0a3adb6f4,DGX,2023-09-06,Quest Diagnostics' (NYSE:DGX) Returns Have Hit A Wall,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quest-diagnostics-nyse-dgx-returns-163348105.html,1693931628,STORY,['DGX'],"[Did you know there are some financial metrics that can provide clues of a potential multi-bagger? Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. With that in mind, the ROCE of Quest Diagnostics (NYSE:DGX) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Quest Diagnostics is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.11 = US$1.3b ÷ (US$13b - US$1.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Thus, Quest Diagnostics has an ROCE of 11%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Healthcare industry average of 9.7%. See our latest analysis for Quest Diagnostics roceIn the above chart we have measured Quest Diagnostics' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important.
