It's a solar-paneled gamble in a city where casinos have yet to arrive — though it always seems to be betting big no matter the risk."", 'Rising rapidly from a creek-bound pearling village to a city associated with international glamor, Dubai has a long history of finding economic success amid the war-ravaged woes of the wider Middle East. Its ruling family likely views the upcoming United Nations COP28 climate talks as another such opportunity, though it carries the significant peril of becoming synonymous with a collapse in negotiations on limiting greenhouse emissions, or being overshadowed by the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.', ""There's a risk of reputational damage to the UAE if they fail to make any traction in the talks, particularly as they are a major oil producer, said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a research fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute who has long studied the region."", '“There is also a risk that media and civil society coverage will focus critically on issues such as the UAE’s planned expansion of oil production capacity and depict the UAE as part of the part of the problem rather than the solution in terms of climate politics,” Ulrichsen added.', 'FROM MUD WALLS TO STEEL AND GLASS', 'Given the futuristic skyline of downtown Dubai — and how it gleams at night as one side of the Burj Khalifa lights up with a massive 770-meter (2,525-foot) LED display — it can be easy to forget that the city only received its first electrical generator in 1952. Before that, only candles and kerosene lamps lit the night along its eponymous Dubai Creek, where the village first grew.', 'Oil, first discovered offshore of Dubai in 1966, was never at the levels found in the sands and waters of Abu Dhabi, which would become the capital of the United Arab Emirates when the country formed in 1971. Dubai instead used the oil as seed money for massive infrastructure projects that seemed to strike at just the right moment as the UAE grew into a home for some 9.3 million people — only 10% of them Emirati and the rest foreign workers and their families.', ""The massive Jebel Ali Port, the U.S. Navy's busiest port of call outside of the United States, is the world's largest human-made harbor. It opened in 1979, just ahead of the Iran-Iraq War. Many ships damaged in that conflict ended up dry-docking at Jebel Ali for repairs, bringing money to the area."", ""That money also built the Dubai World Trade Center, which in 1979 stood out as the sole high-rise in a desert expansive. Today, it is dwarfed by all the towers that followed, fueled by a boom in the city's real estate market that came with a 2002 decision to allow foreigners to own property."", ""That decision came after the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan started, and just before the U.S. led an invasion of Iraq. Dubai became a safe harbor for people with the means to flee the conflicts — as well as those needing to park tens of millions of dollars in suspected ill-gotten gains, once again leading to major investments. That has continued with Russia's war on Ukraine, with Russian investors injecting cash into Dubai real estate projects."", ""While benefiting during crises, the Emirates — a federation of seven sheikhdoms — waged a war on Yemen that saw its soldiers and allies criticized for indiscriminate strikes and abuses on the battlefield. The UAE also has ties to leaders who are viewed with great skepticism or, at the worst, targeted with financial sanctions in the West. They include Libyan military commander Khalifa Hifter and Sudan's Rapid Support Forces leader Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, who wages a civil war in Sudan with forces the State Department says have committed “conflict-related sexual violence and killings.”"", '“One of the likely goals of UAE’s hosting of COP28 is reputation laundering,"" said Jodi Vittori, a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who has written extensively on Dubai being a money-laundering haven. “By hosting COP28, UAE can move the media headlines from their support for the murderous RSF in Sudan and facilitation of Russian sanctions busting to their supposed support of green causes.”', 'In response to questions from The Associated Press about criticism over its foreign policy and other issues, the Emirati government said that “the UAE is deeply committed to human rights and building upon its steady progress in this field.”', '“As the host of COP28, the UAE will welcome constructive dialogue and continue to work with international partners and stakeholders to deliver impactful results,” the statement said. “Climate change is a global problem that demands a collective effort, and this significant, momentous event will be a conference of action.”', 'GOING GREEN WHILE PUMPING MORE OIL', ""Generators have powered Dubai's growth for decades, first by noisy diesel units and later through natural gas plants that still provide the bulk of Dubai's power for its skyscrapers and crucial desalination plants to provide water. The gas comes from both Abu Dhabi and nearby Qatar."", 'But in recent years, Dubai has started to focus on renewable energy — despite a moment where it appeared it would launch a coal-fired power plant before switching it to use natural gas instead as its hosting of COP28 loomed.', ""The jewel of Dubai's clean energy efforts is Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) southeast of the city's downtown. There, solar panels stretch far into the distance, taking in the rays in a country that sees, on average, 10 hours of sunlight 350 days a year."", 'Towering over everything in the distance is the world’s tallest solar tower at some 260 meters (850 feet). It collects the light off of 70,000 reflectors to boil salt to run an electricity-generating turbine.', 'In the sparse surroundings of the desert, where camels freely roam, the glowing tower appears otherworldly over the dunes.', 'Dubai spent billions of dollars on the plant, which involves businesses from China, Saudi Arabia and other countries. By 2030, the city hopes to get 5 gigawatts of electricity from the plant, which could power some 1.3 million homes based on U.S. averages. These days, peak demand in the city-state is nearly 10 gigawatts, according to the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, its sole utility provider.', ""Overall, the Emirates says it plans to be carbon neutral by 2050. While not specifically outlining plans to achieve the goal, projects like the solar park and Abu Dhabi's Barakah nuclear power plant, the first on the Arabian Peninsula, aim to make generating electricity a “green” endeavor."", ""But reporting on these projects is difficult in the Emirates, where speech remains tightly controlled. Authorities have not responded to multiple requests for AP journalists to visit the solar plant. Requests to see the country's four-reactor nuclear power plant have been pending for years."", 'On top of all that, while the UAE pledges to zero out its own emissions, it’s also planning to ramp up oil production.', 'A member of OPEC, the UAE produces some 4 million barrels of crude oil a day. In the coming years, it aims to produce 5 million barrels a day, fuel that will be exported, used by other countries and contribute to climate change.', ""Those plans have sparked criticism by activists ahead of COP28, with most aimed particularly at the upcoming talks' president-designate, the oil company chief Sultan al-Jaber."", '“The UAE must end its greenwashing campaign, abandon its plans to dramatically increase state oil and gas production and rectify the profound conflict of interest created by"" al-Jaber\'s appointment, more than 200 groups said in a joint letter in September.', 'Al-Jaber, who also has led billions of dollars in Emirati investments in renewable energy, has dismissed criticism from those who “just go on the attack without knowing anything, without knowing who we are.”', ""The U.S. has backed al-Jaber's appointment, with the White House's top energy envoy praising the Emirati strategy of bringing activists and the oil industry to COP28."", '""I think that the COP28 being hosted here in this region in an oil-producing country gives us moment of opportunity of bringing together the fossil fuel industry and climate advocates to say, ‘How do we work together?’"" American envoy Amos Hochstein said at a summit in Bahrain last week.', ""WORLD'S FAIR SITE TO AGAIN HOST THE GLOBE"", ""Dubai's $7-billion Expo City, built for the 2020 world fair that was delayed a year by the coronavirus pandemic, will host the upcoming climate talks. In recent weeks, hard-hatted workers have been preparing the site in Dubai's far southern reaches for the event. Its exhibition center will host the talks, with the site divided into one secure side for delegates and another, more open site for advocates, business interests and others."", '“The decision to host the conference at Expo City in Dubai is designed to keep Dubai firmly on the world stage and to bolster its credentials as a hub for soft power and aspirational appeal,” Ulrichsen said. ""Expo 2020 … was supposed to symbolize Dubai’s reemergence from the global financial crisis a decade earlier.""', 'In the time since the Expo, Dubai has pivoted to offering the site as a new real estate development, something that will be advertised during the climate talks. One official email from the site about the talks included a link offering “spacious and secluded four-and five-bed semi-detached homes” for sale, beginning at $1.6 million.', ""But the selection of Expo City also raises questions about Dubai's reliance on low-paid foreign workers in its construction boom. Many from Asian and African nations travel to the Emirates to work in jobs to send money back home. However, some find themselves trapped by abusive employers."", ""The Expo site work saw at least three workers killed and some 200,000 laborers exposed to high heat and potentially exploitative labor practices ahead of the world's fair. Those labor abuses continue at Expo City, renewable energy projects and elsewhere in the Emirates, according to Equidem, a labor advocacy group."", '“African and Asian workers … are doubly impacted by the global climate crisis — they migrate in response to climate impacts and find employment in exploitative industrial and service contexts where they work long hours in extreme heat,” Equidem said.', ""While the Expo didn't draw all the world's biggest names, the climate conference already has King Charles and Pope Francis confirming they'll attend, along with other world leaders. That makes it an opportunity for Dubai, as well as a risk given the wider regional tensions over the Israel-Hamas war."", 'Already, a water-and-energy deal signed between the Emirates, Jordan and Israel during the Expo has collapsed due to the war.', 'Meanwhile, the UAE has pledged to allow protests at the summit. The Emirati government told the AP that “participants can assemble peacefully and have their voices heard in designated areas in both the Blue and Green Zones” of the venue. The Green Zone will be accessible to the general public under Emirati control, while the Blue Zone will be the site of formal negotiations, an area governed by the U.N.', '“We invite all participants to express their opinions in a positive and constructive manner, sharing solutions to address the climate crisis,” the government said.', 'That promised openness adds to the challenge ahead for the Emirates, where political parties and unions remain illegal and protests are rare, given the threat of arrest.', 'There\'s a “hypocrisy of having a host that outright forbids and stringently represses human rights, civil society, free speech and political activity amongst its own citizens and residents,"" Vittori said.', '___', 'Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Sealed Air’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.', ' See our latest analysis for Sealed Air ', ""The share price seems sensible at the moment according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Sealed Air’s ratio of 15.67x is trading in-line with its industry peers’ ratio, which means if you buy Sealed Air today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Sealed Air’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity."", 'Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 89% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Sealed Air. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.', 'Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in SEE’s positive outlook, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at SEE? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio?', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on SEE, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the optimistic forecast is encouraging for SEE, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.', ""Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Sealed Air you should be mindful of and 1 of these shouldn't be ignored."", 'If you are no longer interested in Sealed Air, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.', 'Have feedback on this article?

It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!"", 'Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Marathon Oil ', ""We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.', ""The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Marathon Oil as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.369. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business."", 'Strength', 'Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.', 'Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.', 'Weakness', 'Earnings declined over the past year.', 'Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Oil and Gas market.', 'Opportunity', 'Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.', 'Threat', 'Annual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.', ""Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

To skip our detailed analysis of the importance of diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I)\xa0 practices within the current business landscape in 2023, go directly and see 5 Most Disabled-Friendly Countries in the World.', ""According to a 2018 report by McKinsey, the correlation between disability inclusion and the probability of financial outperformance will only continue to strengthen and bolster with the passage of time. Based on one of the organization's most extensive data sets ever conducted in the most disabled-friendly countries in the world, the report discovered that slow growths in diversity and inclusion initiatives within an organization almost always lead to hyper polarization amongst employees in specific, and a tenuous and inhospitable work environment within the company, in general. The report also highlights that companies which tend to make enormous strides in incorporating a DE&I approach to their human resource machinery often undertake a business-led view. The McKinsey report outlined clearly that companies which accommodate disabled individuals within their workforces tend to outperform less inclusive peers dramatically. According to the report, companies in the top-quartile for disability inclusivity on executive teams were 45% percent more likely to have above-average profitability than companies in the fourth-quartile. The greater the level of inclusion, the higher the likelihood and scale of outperformance."", 'Gender diversity and inclusion is another factor which is causally related with outperformance in business. Companies with more than 30% women executives are generally better-positioned to outperform companies where women represent less than 10% of the workforce.\xa0 Despite the fact that overall progress on gender and disability inclusion has been slower than initially expected, this does not consistently apply across all organizations, many of which are located in some of the most disabled-friendly countries in the world. Companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL),\xa0Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Mastercard Inc. (NYSE:MA) have gone further than most companies to ensure diversity, equity, and inclusion in their respective operations and have paved the way for other companies to follow suit. To know more about companies which incorporate a robust diversity and inclusion policy, check out our article on the 20 Best Companies to Work For in 2023.', 'Post the pandemic, consumer interaction with digital devices has quadrupled. However, companies are only now waking up to the fact that although digitization has streamlined everyday tasks for many consumers, it has not always provided an optimal customer experience for everyone. More than two billion people around the world identify as visually-impaired or low vision. The current state of the technology industry either ignores or misunderstands the enormous potential that this market represents. According to an article by McKinsey, there is enormous opportunity for companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Mastercard Inc. (NYSE:MA) to cultivate strong, loyal relationships with this enormous segment of the market, especially in some of the most disabled-friendly countries in the world. The article projects that companies with inaccessible websites and digital strategies lose more than $6.9 billion annually as frustrated consumers with disabilities shift to competitors who offer more inclusive customer experiences. This cost to companies is expected to surge by 2030 as demand for accessible products and services skyrockets amidst rising life expectancy and a rapidly aging population.\xa0', 'Visually-impaired internet users forego more than 70% of their e-commerce and social media interactions because of inaccessibility, forcing them into considering more accessible options. In a survey, McKinsey discovered that disabled respondents cite digital trust as one of the most important considerations when purchasing a product, followed by product cost and delivery time. In other words, to navigate around inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic headwinds, companies can bolster resilience by engaging and securing this segment of the market which is relatively less concerned about product pricing. According to respondents, inaccessibility drives them to abandon entire market segments and companies altogether. To navigate around this, companies are diverting greater investments in some of the most disabled-friendly countries in the world to build up an accessible portfolio and improve customer experience for people with disabilities. One of the ways companies tend to achieve this is by activating accessibility and equity through inclusive design. Respondents have continually cited that cohesive user interfaces, collaborative design practices, and persistent improvements and upgrades are the foundational elements of good design and that good design and inclusive design tend to go hand-in-hand. Investing in good customer experience across the board is more cost-effective than addressing accessibility concerns after the fact.', ""Another way in which companies can retain the disabled segment of their consumer base is by investing in cohesive customer experiences. As companies raced to optimize customer experience in recent years, they began to prioritize customer's end-to-end journeys over individual touchpoints. These strategies need to be focused on attracting and retaining disabled consumers. Including a specially crafted digital persona for consumers with disabilities can facilitate digital-product developers and designers in ensuring accessibility and inclusivity into the overall customer experience from the very get-go. Companies must also engage in codesigning and collaborative practices to ensure that people with actual lived experiences serve as designers, developers, and advisers in some capacity, which in turn will pave the way for the company to deliver a market-leading, popular product and secure market share in some of the most disabled-friendly countries in the world."", 'According to a survey conducted by McKinsey in some of the most disabled-friendly countries in the world, companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Mastercard Inc. (NYSE:MA) are diverting greater investments in establishing trust in products and experiences which leverage gen AI, data, and digital technologies to sustain growth. Research indicates that companies which are best positioned to cultivate digital trust amongst their consumer base are also more likely to have a robust diversity, equity and inclusion policy framework in place and are also expected to generate an annual growth rate of 10 percent or more on their top and bottom lines. Consumers are convinced that digital trust tenets like data protection, data ethics, and accessibility and inclusion practices are the most important factors when it comes to purchase decisions and many companies have begun to recognize this and comply. For instance, in their latest iPhone, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has ensured new features for cognitive and visual accessibility like live speech, personal voice commands, and Point and Speak in Magnifier. According to a press release by the company, these updates draw on improvements in hardware and software, and ""expand on Apple\'s long standing commitment to making products for everyone"".', 'Furthermore, the digital world is an incredibly dynamic and transformational place, with constant upgrades and innovations rendering once-accessible features completely obsolete. Companies are now focusing on creating a culture of continuous improvement and upgrade which will build internal potential in developers to check for changes in inclusivity as soon as new upgrades are put on the market. Although this can be outsourced to accessibility organizations which provide guidance and support, the sheer volume in which digital updates are carried out demands companies to invest in those who work on the products directly.', 'To compile our list of the 20 most disabled-friendly countries in the world, we decided to undertake a consensus-based approach using a diverse variety of credible sources and research which studied accessibility and inclusion in different countries (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). We then shortlisted more than 42 countries which appeared most frequently during our research. Since disability-friendliness is an incredibly multifaceted and complex phenomenon, we established a three-pronged criteria to measure the overall accessibility in each country; the criteria is premised on accessibility in infrastructure (20 points), employment opportunities (15 points), and social inclusion (10 points). We then proceeded to award each country a cumulative score according to the aforementioned criteria and selected 20 countries which scored the highest points. Subsequently, we ranked each entry based on the total points scored, from lowest to highest. Where there was a tie, we broke it based on the accessibility in infrastructure in each country.', 'Photo by Robert Ruggiero on Unsplash', 'You can also read about some of the least disability friendly countries in the world in our coverage of the 11 Worst Countries for Disabled Travelers.', 'Total Score: 11', 'In recent years, Mexico has made substantial efforts to make the country more accessible for people with disabilities.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their previous performance, and go directly to read 5 Best Halal Dividend Stocks To Buy.\xa0', ""Halal stocks refer to shares of companies that comply with Shariah law. These stocks are from companies that operate in line with Shariah guidelines, meaning they avoid industries like alcohol, gambling, tobacco, and non-Islamic finance. Additionally, they maintain ethical business practices, ensuring their sources of income align with Islamic principles. The S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Shariah Index monitors how certain Shariah-compliant companies, selected from the S&P 1500 Composite, perform in the market. These companies are specifically chosen because they've consistently increased their dividend payments for a period of 20 years or longer. This index tracks the performance of long-standing dividend-growing companies that adhere to Shariah principles within the broader market context of the S&P 1500 Composite. The index is down by 0.78% this year so far and its 5-year return came in at 6.98%."", ""Dividend-growing stocks have historically been popular among investors because they provide a regular income stream for them. As these companies increase their dividends over time, investors benefit from higher payouts. Companies that consistently pay increasing dividends usually have a strong financial foundation. They must not only turn a profit but also generate more cash than they require for their operations. A report conducted by Middlefield Capital Corporation found that dividend growers have shown remarkable performance compared to the broader market over the past three decades. This success isn't just chance—it's attributed to the fact that these companies are dedicated to managing their resources and investments with a disciplined approach. The same report also mentioned that chasing high yields without considering the underlying factors can be risky for investors. While a high dividend yield might seem attractive at first glance, it's essential to look beyond the numbers. Sometimes, stocks offering the highest yields might actually carry greater risk or have unsustainable dividend payments."", ""The way inflation affects fixed-income and income portfolios differs significantly. A high-quality company that consistently pays dividends has the potential to increase its income over time, acting as a safeguard against the negative effects of inflation. Research from Ned Davis shows that S&P 500 companies have raised their dividends by 9.70% in the past year, surpassing even the relatively high recent inflation rates. Over the last fifty years, the S&P 500® Index's dividend payments have grown at an average rate of 6%, which notably exceeds the historical inflation rate in the US."", 'Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), AbbVie Inc.

What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We can see that Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) does use debt in its business. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?"", 'Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.', ' See our latest analysis for Zoetis ', 'The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Zoetis had US$6.59b in debt in September 2023; about the same as the year before. On the flip side, it has US$1.75b in cash leading to net debt of about US$4.84b.', 'The latest balance sheet data shows that Zoetis had liabilities of US$1.61b due within a year, and liabilities of US$7.42b falling due after that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$1.75b as well as receivables valued at US$1.26b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$6.02b.', 'Of course, Zoetis has a titanic market capitalization of US$82.7b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.', ""We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio)."", ""Zoetis has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 1.4. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 23.0 times over. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. The good news is that Zoetis has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Zoetis can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting."", 'Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Zoetis recorded free cash flow worth 53% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.', ""The good news is that Zoetis's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. And we also thought its net debt to EBITDA was a positive. When we consider the range of factors above, it looks like Zoetis is pretty sensible with its use of debt. That means they are taking on a bit more risk, in the hope of boosting shareholder returns. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Zoetis , and understanding them should be part of your investment process."", ""Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today."", 'Have feedback on this article?

Net earnings of RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) were also 8.9% higher compared to 2021, with a total $14.1 billion in 2022. Several other armament manufacturers including Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) also posted higher revenues last year.', 'However, the rise in defense expenditure has not been even across countries and regions. More than half of the world’s total military spending came from three countries combined – the United States, China, and Russia. $904 billion were spent in North America, $508 billion in Asia, and $480 billion in Europe. On the other hand, Africa, which is the second most populous continent in the world, spent only $39 billion, just a tad more than Oceania, which is among the least populated regions of the world. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that most of the weakest militaries in the world are African. Although some sparsely populated small European nations make the list as well.', 'Russia is the largest exporter of arms to the African continent and increased its military exports by 23% to Africa between 2016 and 2020 compared to 2011 and 2015, with an eye on fostering strong ties between Moscow and African nations to facilitate trade and build presence at NATO’s southern flank. However, recent western sanctions on Russia have impeded many governments in Africa from trading with Russia and that has created an opening for Chinese and American armament manufacturers.', 'Between 2010 and 2021, China exported $2.04 billion worth of military equipment to Sub-Saharan Africa. Arms sales of the United States during the same period were estimated to be $473 million according to a publication by the Atlantic Council. Washington has also donated military equipment to several weaker militaries in the continent to aid them in combating crime and terrorism.', 'The US government donated two Cessna 208 Caravan aircraft in 2014 to the air force in Mauritania to counter terrorist groups and maritime crimes. Both were valued at $21 million each at the time. These are utility aircraft produced by Cessna, which is owned by Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT). In 2021, the American government gave Niger Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s C-130 aircraft for humanitarian assistance operations and mobility of UN peacekeeping troops. The C-130 is one of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s top-selling tactical aircraft that has been continuously manufactured since its first flight in 1954. The four-engine turboprop aircraft is widely used for airlifting, cargo transport, and other roles such as search and rescue, airborne assault, and maritime patrol.', 'Likewise, the US has been providing assistance to other countries in different parts of the world as well. This year in March, the US embassy in Belize announced that it was donating a Cessna 208 Caravan aircraft to the Central American nation.\xa0The air force in Belize also operates a Bell UH-1 Iroquois helicopter it received from the United States. The year and nature of the deal is unknown. Bell UH-1 Iroquois helicopters are also developed by Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT), and are among the most successful military helicopters ever made. Between 1956 and 1987, more than 16,000 units of these helicopters were manufactured by Bell Helicopters, owned by Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT).', ""Coming to Europe, the United States has been extending military assistance to countries with weaker militaries such as Moldova. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) in 2014 entered into a $6.3 million contract with RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) to provide security solutions to the European nation. The target behind the agreement is to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction across the Moldovan border. Under the signed deal, RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) also provided the required training to Moldova's government officials to ensure smooth transition of capabilities. The US also provides military assistance to several other weaker European nations with security needs.

This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.', 'EPS is set to fall by 0.4% over the next 12 months. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we believe the payout ratio could be 6.0%, which we are pretty comfortable with and we think is feasible on an earnings basis.', ""The company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.20 total annually to $0.80. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 15% over that duration.

The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Baxter International's shares before the 30th of November to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 2nd of January."", ""The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.29 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$1.16 per share to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Baxter International has a trailing yield of 3.2% on the current share price of $36.02. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing."", ' See our latest analysis for Baxter International ', ""Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Baxter International paid out a disturbingly high 261% of its profit as dividends last year, which makes us concerned there's something we don't fully understand in the business. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It paid out more than half (66%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies."", ""It's good to see that while Baxter International's dividends were not covered by profits, at least they are affordable from a cash perspective.

Baxter International has seen its dividend decline 4.3% per annum on average over the past 10 years, which is not great to see. It's never nice to see earnings and dividends falling, but at least management has cut the dividend rather than potentially risk the company's health in an attempt to maintain it."", ""Is Baxter International an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? It's never fun to see a company's earnings per share in retreat. Worse, Baxter International's paying out a majority of its earnings and more than half its free cash flow.

In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth.

Notable products in this industry include widely recognized devices such as pacemakers, imaging instruments, dialysis machines, and various implants.', 'The medical technology industry has been instrumental in saving millions of lives and enhancing the quality of life for countless individuals globally. These companies have a rich history of prioritizing patient-centered innovation, with a significant investment of over $42 billion in research and development in 2022 alone. However, following a decade of robust returns for shareholders, MedTech companies experienced significant challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Factors such as decreased procedure volumes, disruptions in the supply chain, the ""great resignation,"" and volatile capital markets collectively weakened what was fundamentally a solid industry. In 2022, the total revenue for the MedTech industry reached $573 billion. However, growth decelerated from the post-pandemic high of 16% in 2021 to a modest 3.5% in 2022, marking the lowest level since 2015. This slowdown persisted into the first half of 2023, with revenues for commercial leaders (public pure-play MedTechs with at least $500 million in annual revenue) essentially remaining flat, showing only a 0.4% growth compared to the previous year. According to Ernst & Young, the continuation of this trend from 2022 implies that the industry\'s robust performance in 2021 may have been an anomaly—a one-time post-COVID-19 correction—rather than a return to the trajectory observed from 2000 to 2007 when medical technology averaged 15% annual revenue growth, as opposed to the 5% average seen from 2008 to 2020.', 'The limitations imposed on in-person interactions due to COVID-19 prompted the adoption of new practices and preferences, placing increased significance on factors beyond the product itself. According to a McKinsey survey involving healthcare professionals (HCPs) globally, the percentage of US-based HCPs favoring in-person interactions with medical device sales representatives declined from 76% before COVID to 58% by August 2021. Conversely, their preference for remote engagement witnessed a 30% increase, and digital channels saw a 20% rise during the same period. Recognizing the increasing significance of Customer Experience (CX), several prominent players in the medical technology (MedTech) sector are beginning to design innovative experiences for their customers.

Notable products in this industry include widely recognized devices such as pacemakers, imaging instruments, dialysis machines, and various implants.', 'The medical technology industry has been instrumental in saving millions of lives and enhancing the quality of life for countless individuals globally. These companies have a rich history of prioritizing patient-centered innovation, with a significant investment of over $42 billion in research and development in 2022 alone. However, following a decade of robust returns for shareholders, MedTech companies experienced significant challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Factors such as decreased procedure volumes, disruptions in the supply chain, the ""great resignation,"" and volatile capital markets collectively weakened what was fundamentally a solid industry. In 2022, the total revenue for the MedTech industry reached $573 billion. However, growth decelerated from the post-pandemic high of 16% in 2021 to a modest 3.5% in 2022, marking the lowest level since 2015. This slowdown persisted into the first half of 2023, with revenues for commercial leaders (public pure-play MedTechs with at least $500 million in annual revenue) essentially remaining flat, showing only a 0.4% growth compared to the previous year. According to Ernst & Young, the continuation of this trend from 2022 implies that the industry\'s robust performance in 2021 may have been an anomaly—a one-time post-COVID-19 correction—rather than a return to the trajectory observed from 2000 to 2007 when medical technology averaged 15% annual revenue growth, as opposed to the 5% average seen from 2008 to 2020.', 'The limitations imposed on in-person interactions due to COVID-19 prompted the adoption of new practices and preferences, placing increased significance on factors beyond the product itself.

To skip our detailed analysis of the global apparel industry in 2023, go directly and see 5 best rain jackets for men and women.', 'According to a report by McKinsey, company performance across the apparel industry has remained significantly fragmented, with certain enterprises faring much better than others in the wake of intense macroeconomic challenges. The global functional apparel market was valued at more than $345.6 billion in 2022, and is estimated to hit valuations of up to $623.2 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 6.1% from 2023 to 2032. The revenue of the global apparel industry was projected to amount of $1.53 trillion in 2022, a slight decrease when compared to 2021. However, the industry has been estimated to post earnings of more than $1.7 trillion in 2023. Demand for functional apparel is highly concentrated in a select variety of markets, namely the United States, China, India, and much of Europe. China led the ranking for highest value of apparel exports in 2022, followed by the EU and the United States. Some of the most prominent players within the global apparel industry are Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE), Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU), and Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BOOT). To read more on the apparel industry, check out our coverage of the 20 Largest Apparel Countries in the World.', ""As 2023 comes to close, apparel companies are getting clobbered under the extremely high operational costs impacting margins as inflation continues to skyrocket. Persistent inflationary pressure, complemented by an increasingly susceptible consumer base and the prospect of deteriorating macroeconomic headwinds owing to the Federal Reserve cracking down on inflation, is causing commodity and transport prices to surge across the value chain. In the United States for instance, prices increased by 7.2% in October 2023 compared to October 2022. Conventionally, price realization in the apparel sector has always trailed behind inflation rates and household income growth. Although this gap has narrowed overall, price gains are still lagging significantly behind CPI growth by about one percentage point. According to an analysis by McKinsey, apparel retailers and brands are getting crushed under the current tenuous macroeconomic climate. With costs of manufacturing inputs, freight, fuel and wages rising significantly, navigating a tricky growth atmosphere and depreciating consumer sentiment is becoming increasingly complex. There has been a substantial shift in consumer behavior, where consumers are now being much more value-conscious even when it comes to purchasing some of the best rain jackets for men and women, according to McKinsey's Consumer Pulse survey."", ""To navigate these headwinds, top apparel companies like Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE), Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU), and Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BOOT) are indulging in more comprehensive action on pricing, merchandising, and supply chains. They are focusing on specific measures aimed at ensuring that consumers, who are already struggling with pricing surges, are not alienated and kept within the ecosystem of the company. McKinsey also suggests that some apparel companies can leverage the credibility of their brand image and pass off some of the additional costs associated with manufacturing on to the consumer, either through higher ticket prices or fewer promotions. Reticketing is usually an operational quagmire for apparel companies operating within a restrictive labor environment. In the near term however, companies which manufacture some of the best rain jackets for men and women can relieve margin pressures by holding off on promotional pricing. Additionally, companies can also restrict the use of clearance pricing. By making the transition to leaner inventories, retailers can escape inventory overhang. However, if a company's brand does not garner a significant amount of traction from the market, they are better advised to try to absorb higher costs whilst holding the fort on prices and promotions to retain near-term market share."", ""Moreover, as inflationary pressures continue to squeeze the apparel industry, it is an ideal opportunity for companies and retailers to get rid of operational bottlenecks and streamline processes with vendors, supply teams, design, or store operations. Strategically, this could bolster visibility into the company's financial structure and pave the way for information communication across the enterprise. By streamlining decision-making processes, apparel companies can reserve focus on store labor pricing activities which deliver impressive returns on investment.\xa0Furthermore, as global supply chain turbulence persists, smaller start-ups, like Shein, are further disrupting the known paradigms of apparel retailing. Established companies and retailers can balance the preservation of margins and navigate inflationary pressures, all the while resisting the inclination to price out their growing core-consumer segments. You can read more on how apparel companies are navigating inflationary headwinds in our article Top 10 Clothing Companies in the World in 2022."", 'Despite macroeconomic headwinds, China is one of the most lucrative markets in the world for multinational apparel companies like Nike Inc. (NYSE:NKE), Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU), and Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BOOT). The apparel industry in the country continues to be widely regarded as one of the most dynamic and fastest-growing sectors in the world. Post the COVID-19 pandemic and easing of restrictions in China, the industry is projected to resume double-digit growth, catalyzed by a growing middle-class with increased buying power. However, multinational companies which deal in apparel have traditionally found it challenging to continue operations in China, owing to stiff competition from local players which can afford a more agile operating model and a streamlined supply chain to build up greater resilience to changing consumer dynamics and meet demands for the best rain jackets for men and women.\xa0', 'However, an article by McKinsey outlines certain tactical moves global players can use to bolster long-term competitiveness in the Chinese market, one of the ways being clearly defining and communicating brand image to elevate positioning. Consumer preferences in China are an incredibly dynamic enterprise which is constantly changing at starkly different trajectories when compared to other markets. Global brands which make some of the best rain jackets for men and women need to ensure that they are well positioned to tailor brand image in order to attract local customers and develop a robust marketing framework to deliver value propositions effectively. Secondly, global companies need to optimize store networks and formats to capitalize on changing consumer requirements. Consumers are making a conscious shift away from traditional department stores and increasingly opting to shop at shopping centers at premium locations. Companies looking to increase their foothold in China could adapt by relocating store presence in areas with greater foot traffic and investing in a variety of formatting options. Furthermore, Chinese consumers have largely gravitated towards an omnichannel approach and tend to switch between online and offline platforms before finally making a purchasing decision. Global companies should capitalize on this phenomena and divert greater investments in the implementation of an effective omnichannel D2C mechanism to effectively capture value at stake and ensure a reliable market for some of the best rain jackets for men and women.\xa0', 'Photo by Greg Rosenke on Unsplash', 'To compile our list of the 16 best rain jackets for men and women, we decided to use a consensus based approach by acquiring data from a variety of different credible sources (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).

(NYSE:NKE) is about to go ex-dividend in the next 4 days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. This means that investors who purchase NIKE's shares on or after the 1st of December will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 2nd of January."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.37 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$1.36 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, NIKE stock has a trailing yield of around 1.4% on the current share price of $107.64. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to investigate whether NIKE can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow."", ' View our latest analysis for NIKE ', ""If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Fortunately NIKE's payout ratio is modest, at just 42% of profit. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Thankfully its dividend payments took up just 46% of the free cash flow it generated, which is a comfortable payout ratio."", ""It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. That's why it's comforting to see NIKE's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 23% per annum for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing very quickly, and the company is paying out a relatively low percentage of its profit and cash flow. Companies with growing earnings and low payout ratios are often the best long-term dividend stocks, as the company can both grow its earnings and increase the percentage of earnings that it pays out, essentially multiplying the dividend."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, NIKE has lifted its dividend by approximately 13% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it."", ""Is NIKE worth buying for its dividend? NIKE has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination.

These stocks are from companies that operate in line with Shariah guidelines, meaning they avoid industries like alcohol, gambling, tobacco, and non-Islamic finance. Additionally, they maintain ethical business practices, ensuring their sources of income align with Islamic principles. The S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Shariah Index monitors how certain Shariah-compliant companies, selected from the S&P 1500 Composite, perform in the market. These companies are specifically chosen because they've consistently increased their dividend payments for a period of 20 years or longer. This index tracks the performance of long-standing dividend-growing companies that adhere to Shariah principles within the broader market context of the S&P 1500 Composite. The index is down by 0.78% this year so far and its 5-year return came in at 6.98%."", ""Dividend-growing stocks have historically been popular among investors because they provide a regular income stream for them. As these companies increase their dividends over time, investors benefit from higher payouts. Companies that consistently pay increasing dividends usually have a strong financial foundation. They must not only turn a profit but also generate more cash than they require for their operations. A report conducted by Middlefield Capital Corporation found that dividend growers have shown remarkable performance compared to the broader market over the past three decades. This success isn't just chance—it's attributed to the fact that these companies are dedicated to managing their resources and investments with a disciplined approach. The same report also mentioned that chasing high yields without considering the underlying factors can be risky for investors. While a high dividend yield might seem attractive at first glance, it's essential to look beyond the numbers. Sometimes, stocks offering the highest yields might actually carry greater risk or have unsustainable dividend payments."", ""The way inflation affects fixed-income and income portfolios differs significantly. A high-quality company that consistently pays dividends has the potential to increase its income over time, acting as a safeguard against the negative effects of inflation.

I am usually very skeptical of hefty valuations, but when it comes to Intuitive Surgical, it’s quite likely that investors will always be willing to pay a premium. The robotic surgery market leader continues to innovate and grow in a market that is still in its infancy, signaling exceptionally promising prospects ahead. Given the very probable sustainability of Intuitive’s upward momentum in this evolving market, I am bullish on the stock.', 'Intuitive Surgical continues to chart an impressive growth trajectory, riding the wave of increasing global adoption in the robotic surgery industry. Despite substantial strides made in the field over the last few decades, the industry is still in its infancy, offering vast potential for expansion. Through following the industry, I see that a prominent trend toward minimally invasive procedures has gained momentum.', 'Essentially, hospitals enthusiastically embrace these cutting-edge techniques, recognizing the potential for increased surgical revenues and reduced expenses through fewer complications and shorter hospital stays. At the same time, a growing number of patients are searching for a more comfortable and efficient surgical experience. Intuitive has leveraged the harmonious integration of state-of-the-art technologies with eager reception from both hospitals and patients, resulting in unparalleled success over the years.', 'If you go and check Intuitive’s growth metrics, the initial impression may not immediately evoke a sense of “spectacular.” To provide context, the company has maintained a compound annual growth rate of 11.5% and 8.2% in revenues and EBITDA, respectively, over the past decade. However, the true marvel lies in the enduring success story that Intuitive has crafted. Embarking on a long growth journey since its inaugural sales in 1999, Intuitive stands as one of the pioneering innovators in the field of robotic surgery.', 'The momentum behind Intuitive’s success persists to this very day. Its most recent Q3 results underscore the widespread adoption of the company’s cutting-edge systems on a global scale.', 'The company achieved a remarkable 13% year-over-year expansion of its da Vinci Surgical Systems installed base, reaching a total of 8,285 systems. The persistent demand from hospitals remains robust, with 312 systems placed compared to 305 in the preceding year, underscoring Intuitive’s sustained growth despite its seemingly mature operations. This trend solidifies my earlier observation of Intuitive’s momentum, highlighting the still-early, growing industry-wide adoption of robotic surgery in healthcare.', 'With a record number of systems online and a rising preference among patients for minimally invasive procedures, as highlighted earlier, da Vinci procedures experienced an increase of approximately 19% worldwide. Consequently, Intuitive Surgical achieved an impressive 11% revenue increase, reaching $1.74 billion.', 'Intuitive Surgical’s sustained expansion, coupled with its one-of-a-kind investment proposition, continues to underpin the stock’s substantial valuation. A glance at the company’s forward P/E might reveal a seemingly exorbitant multiple of 56.6. However, a deeper consideration of Intuitive’s near-monopoly in the industry provides insights into why investors are willing to pay a hefty price for the stock.', 'Much like how Intuitive Surgical has adeptly capitalized on the global surge in adoption of robotic surgery, fueling its impressive and consistent growth over the decades, the market anticipates this upward trajectory to endure for the foreseeable future. This confidence is rooted in the company’s leading position within the sector, suggesting a sustained competitive advantage that positions it well for continued success in the years to come.', 'Another interesting factor to consider when assessing the stock’s valuation is the company’s hefty cash position. In the midst of the prevailing upward trend in interest rates, the absence of long-term debt on its balance sheet shields the company from adverse effects. Furthermore, the substantial cash reserve of $6.5 billion not only fortifies its financial standing but also generates a growing stream of interest income.', 'Illustrated in the Q3 results, the company notched an impressive $56.2 million in interest income, marking a staggering leap from the previous year’s $3.9 million. This element undeniably contributes to a more optimistic reception from investors, fostering the bullish sentiment towards the stock.', 'As far as Wall Street’s view on the stock goes, Intuitive Surgical features a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 16 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. At $333.44, the\xa0average ISRG stock forecast\xa0implies 4.9% upside potential.', 'If you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell ISRG stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is\xa0Richard Newitter\xa0from Truist Financial, with an average return of 23.36% per rating and an 81% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.', 'Overall, I would argue that waiting for a discount on Intuitive Surgical stock may be an exercise in futility. The company’s relentless innovation and dominant position in the still-infant robotic surgery market signal promising prospects. Despite seemingly modest growth metrics, Intuitive’s enduring success story, reflected again in its recent Q3 results, solidifies its momentum and underscores the industry’s ongoing adoption of robotic surgery.', 'The stock’s valuation, while seemingly hefty, appears to be supported by Intuitive’s unique investment case, near-monopoly status, and robust financial position, which form a rather compelling choice for long-term investors.', 'Disclosure']"

With shares now trading at a fairly large discount (9.6 times earnings) to gaming stocks (which sport a median multiple of (14.7), I still believe there’s merit in going contrarian with BYD stock.', 'With so much pessimism now baked into Boyd’s valuation, low expectations today could mean positive surprises with subsequent earnings releases.

Statutory earnings per share are presumed to shoot up 133% to US$17.80. Before this latest update, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$80b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$15.20 in 2025.

The analysts are definitely expecting NVIDIA's growth to accelerate, with the forecast 72% annualised growth to the end of 2025 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 28% per annum over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 16% per year. Factoring in the forecast acceleration in revenue, it's pretty clear that NVIDIA is expected to grow much faster than its industry."", ""The most important thing to take away from this upgrade is that analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates for next year, expecting improving business conditions. They also upgraded their revenue estimates for next year, and sales are expected to grow faster than the wider market. The lack of change in the price target is puzzling, but with a serious upgrade to next year's earnings expectations, it might be time to take another look at NVIDIA."", ""With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year.

These stocks are from companies that operate in line with Shariah guidelines, meaning they avoid industries like alcohol, gambling, tobacco, and non-Islamic finance. Additionally, they maintain ethical business practices, ensuring their sources of income align with Islamic principles. The S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Shariah Index monitors how certain Shariah-compliant companies, selected from the S&P 1500 Composite, perform in the market. These companies are specifically chosen because they've consistently increased their dividend payments for a period of 20 years or longer. This index tracks the performance of long-standing dividend-growing companies that adhere to Shariah principles within the broader market context of the S&P 1500 Composite. The index is down by 0.78% this year so far and its 5-year return came in at 6.98%."", ""Dividend-growing stocks have historically been popular among investors because they provide a regular income stream for them. As these companies increase their dividends over time, investors benefit from higher payouts. Companies that consistently pay increasing dividends usually have a strong financial foundation. They must not only turn a profit but also generate more cash than they require for their operations. A report conducted by Middlefield Capital Corporation found that dividend growers have shown remarkable performance compared to the broader market over the past three decades. This success isn't just chance—it's attributed to the fact that these companies are dedicated to managing their resources and investments with a disciplined approach. The same report also mentioned that chasing high yields without considering the underlying factors can be risky for investors. While a high dividend yield might seem attractive at first glance, it's essential to look beyond the numbers. Sometimes, stocks offering the highest yields might actually carry greater risk or have unsustainable dividend payments."", ""The way inflation affects fixed-income and income portfolios differs significantly. A high-quality company that consistently pays dividends has the potential to increase its income over time, acting as a safeguard against the negative effects of inflation.

Robinson Worldwide an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? We're not enthused by the flat earnings per share, although at least the company's payout ratio is within reasonable bounds. Additionally, it paid out a lower percentage of its free cash flow, so at least it generated more cash than it spent on dividends. While it does have some good things going for it, we're a bit ambivalent and it would take more to convince us of C.H. Robinson Worldwide's dividend merits."", ""If you're not too concerned about C.H.

For this reason, we're glad to see M&T Bank's earnings per share have risen 15% per annum over the last five years."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, M&T Bank has lifted its dividend by approximately 6.4% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders."", ""Should investors buy M&T Bank for the upcoming dividend? Typically, companies that are growing rapidly and paying out a low fraction of earnings are keeping the profits for reinvestment in the business. This strategy can add significant value to shareholders over the long term - as long as it's done without issuing too many new shares.

If you want to read about some more LNG and LNG shipping stocks, go directly to the 5 Best LNG and LNG Shipping Stocks to Buy Now.', 'The United States has witnessed a surge in natural gas production since the fracking boom in the mid-2000s. In October, U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) producers substantially increased exports to 7.92 million metric tons, marking the second-highest monthly level on record. While slightly below the record 8.01 million metric tons in April, the October figures reflected an increase from 7.12 million metric tons in September, when plant maintenance led to a reduction in U.S. production. Europe remained the primary recipient of U.S. LNG, constituting 60% of all exports last month—a rise of 8 percentage points. Asian customers accounted for 20% of exports, down from 30% in September, while Latin America received 5% of cargo, down from 8% in the previous month.', 'Approximately two-thirds of the total U.S. production originates from Texas, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, and West Virginia, typically being transported via pipelines to fuel power plants and heat homes across the nation. Historically, domestic natural gas supply and demand have closely mirrored each other, with international trade involving minimal imports from Canada through pipelines. However, the proliferation of new liquefied natural gas export terminals has transformed these dynamics, increasingly connecting domestic gas prices to global markets. Similar to the impact on crude oil, the growing exports of LNG will lead to U.S. natural gas prices being determined by the international market. This implies that domestic prices will become susceptible to global price fluctuations, extending beyond the influence of domestic consumption and production. Specifically, according to the EIA, the projections indicate that in the scenario of higher volumes of U.S. LNG exports, prices are expected to rise by $1.50 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), equating to approximately a 10% price increase. This increase will be reflected in household natural gas bills, and electricity utility costs, and will have an impact on various manufacturing industries.', 'Further forecasts from the EIA, utilizing data from the International Group of Liquefied Natural Gas Importers (GIIGNL) and trade press, compare the expected LNG import capacity to the levels in 2022. The analysis has revealed that in the initial seven months of 2023, three countries – Germany, the Philippines, and Vietnam – commenced their first-ever LNG imports. By the close of 2024, the EIA anticipates that Antigua, Australia, Cyprus, and Nicaragua will also initiate their LNG imports, and several other nations are in advanced stages of developing their LNG import infrastructure. To provide further context to this, the global LNG import capacity, often referred to as regasification capacity, expanded by 49%, equivalent to 45.8 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d), reaching a total of 140 bcf/d across 48 countries. The EIA projects that by the end of 2024, 55 countries will have completed LNG regasification terminals, boasting a combined capacity of 163 bcf/d.', ""With these details in mind, let's look at some of the best LNG and LNG shipping stocks in the market, which include the likes of Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), Cheniere Energy, Inc.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Hasbro, this is the formula:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.11 = US$717m ÷ (US$8.3b - US$2.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2023).', ""Thus, Hasbro has an ROCE of 11%.

Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 11% from 15% five years ago. And considering revenue has dropped while employing more capital, we\'d be cautious. This could mean that the business is losing its competitive advantage or market share, because while more money is being put into ventures, it\'s actually producing a lower return - ""less bang for their buck"" per se.', ""From the above analysis, we find it rather worrisome that returns on capital and sales for Hasbro have fallen, meanwhile the business is employing more capital than it was five years ago. Investors haven't taken kindly to these developments, since the stock has declined 40% from where it was five years ago. With underlying trends that aren't great in these areas, we'd consider looking elsewhere."", ""On a final note, we've found   2 warning signs for Hasbro  that we think you should be aware of."", 'For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.', 'Have feedback on this article?

These companies have a rich history of prioritizing patient-centered innovation, with a significant investment of over $42 billion in research and development in 2022 alone.

Factors such as decreased procedure volumes, disruptions in the supply chain, the ""great resignation,"" and volatile capital markets collectively weakened what was fundamentally a solid industry.

This slowdown persisted into the first half of 2023, with revenues for commercial leaders (public pure-play MedTechs with at least $500 million in annual revenue) essentially remaining flat, showing only a 0.4% growth compared to the previous year. According to Ernst & Young, the continuation of this trend from 2022 implies that the industry\'s robust performance in 2021 may have been an anomaly—a one-time post-COVID-19 correction—rather than a return to the trajectory observed from 2000 to 2007 when medical technology averaged 15% annual revenue growth, as opposed to the 5% average seen from 2008 to 2020.', 'The limitations imposed on in-person interactions due to COVID-19 prompted the adoption of new practices and preferences, placing increased significance on factors beyond the product itself.

The surge in spending has led to a boom in the defense industry. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) generated a revenue of $66 billion and net profit of $5.7 billion last year. Net earnings of RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) were also 8.9% higher compared to 2021, with a total $14.1 billion in 2022. Several other armament manufacturers including Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) also posted higher revenues last year.', 'However, the rise in defense expenditure has not been even across countries and regions. More than half of the world’s total military spending came from three countries combined – the United States, China, and Russia. $904 billion were spent in North America, $508 billion in Asia, and $480 billion in Europe. On the other hand, Africa, which is the second most populous continent in the world, spent only $39 billion, just a tad more than Oceania, which is among the least populated regions of the world. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that most of the weakest militaries in the world are African. Although some sparsely populated small European nations make the list as well.', 'Russia is the largest exporter of arms to the African continent and increased its military exports by 23% to Africa between 2016 and 2020 compared to 2011 and 2015, with an eye on fostering strong ties between Moscow and African nations to facilitate trade and build presence at NATO’s southern flank. However, recent western sanctions on Russia have impeded many governments in Africa from trading with Russia and that has created an opening for Chinese and American armament manufacturers.', 'Between 2010 and 2021, China exported $2.04 billion worth of military equipment to Sub-Saharan Africa. Arms sales of the United States during the same period were estimated to be $473 million according to a publication by the Atlantic Council.

The target behind the agreement is to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction across the Moldovan border. Under the signed deal, RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) also provided the required training to Moldova's government officials to ensure smooth transition of capabilities.

The S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Shariah Index monitors how certain Shariah-compliant companies, selected from the S&P 1500 Composite, perform in the market. These companies are specifically chosen because they've consistently increased their dividend payments for a period of 20 years or longer. This index tracks the performance of long-standing dividend-growing companies that adhere to Shariah principles within the broader market context of the S&P 1500 Composite.

As these companies increase their dividends over time, investors benefit from higher payouts. Companies that consistently pay increasing dividends usually have a strong financial foundation. They must not only turn a profit but also generate more cash than they require for their operations. A report conducted by Middlefield Capital Corporation found that dividend growers have shown remarkable performance compared to the broader market over the past three decades. This success isn't just chance—it's attributed to the fact that these companies are dedicated to managing their resources and investments with a disciplined approach. The same report also mentioned that chasing high yields without considering the underlying factors can be risky for investors.

It paid out more than half (67%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.', ""It's positive to see that Waste Management's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Waste Management, with earnings per share up 5.2% on average over the last five years. While earnings have been growing at a credible rate, the company is paying out a majority of its earnings to shareholders. Therefore it's unlikely that the company will be able to reinvest heavily in its business, which could presage slower growth in the future."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Waste Management has delivered 6.7% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders."", ""Is Waste Management an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Earnings per share growth has been modest, and it's interesting that Waste Management is paying out less than half of its earnings and more than half its cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends. In summary, while it has some positive characteristics, we're not inclined to race out and buy Waste Management today."", ""In light of that, while Waste Management has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. To help with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Waste Management that you should be aware of before investing in their shares."", ""Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

Notable products in this industry include widely recognized devices such as pacemakers, imaging instruments, dialysis machines, and various implants.', 'The medical technology industry has been instrumental in saving millions of lives and enhancing the quality of life for countless individuals globally. These companies have a rich history of prioritizing patient-centered innovation, with a significant investment of over $42 billion in research and development in 2022 alone. However, following a decade of robust returns for shareholders, MedTech companies experienced significant challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Factors such as decreased procedure volumes, disruptions in the supply chain, the ""great resignation,"" and volatile capital markets collectively weakened what was fundamentally a solid industry. In 2022, the total revenue for the MedTech industry reached $573 billion. However, growth decelerated from the post-pandemic high of 16% in 2021 to a modest 3.5% in 2022, marking the lowest level since 2015. This slowdown persisted into the first half of 2023, with revenues for commercial leaders (public pure-play MedTechs with at least $500 million in annual revenue) essentially remaining flat, showing only a 0.4% growth compared to the previous year. According to Ernst & Young, the continuation of this trend from 2022 implies that the industry\'s robust performance in 2021 may have been an anomaly—a one-time post-COVID-19 correction—rather than a return to the trajectory observed from 2000 to 2007 when medical technology averaged 15% annual revenue growth, as opposed to the 5% average seen from 2008 to 2020.', 'The limitations imposed on in-person interactions due to COVID-19 prompted the adoption of new practices and preferences, placing increased significance on factors beyond the product itself.
