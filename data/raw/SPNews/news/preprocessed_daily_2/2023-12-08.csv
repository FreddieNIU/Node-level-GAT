If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on decoding the social security dilemma, you may go to the 5 States with Highest Average Social Security Payment.', 'Americans may be living longer, but the equation to fund longer retirements remains unchanged. In less than a decade, crucial funds such as Social Security and Medicare are expected to run out. By this time, these funds will be able to pay 80% of benefits only. As a result of this fear, many Americans are planning to tap their benefits earlier than they should, even if it means giving up nearly $200,000 in the process.', 'According to the 2023 Schroders U.S. Retirement Survey, only 10% of Americans plan to wait until 70 to start claiming their social security checks. Meanwhile, 40% of people who aren’t retired yet plan on claiming their benefits between the ages 62 to 65.', '“The choice to forgo larger Social Security payments is a deliberate one, as 72% of non-retired investors – and 95% of non-retired ages 60-65 – are aware that waiting longer earns higher payments.”', '-Schroders, an Asset Management Company', ""Even though potential retirees are giving up a significant portion of their earnings by claiming their benefits early, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK)'s Read on Retirement survey states that only 21% of workplace savers are confident in having enough money that can last them through retirement. Struggling with longevity and risks of inflation, it is only but obvious that potential retirees live with this fear. For those already on social security, the 2024 COLA doesn't look like a big enough raise anyway. However, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) asserts that this only means that inflation is cooling off, and given that inflation continues to ease, retirees get to keep the higher benefits."", '""Social Security benefits generally do keep up with inflation, though there is a lag… At the same time, the average retiree\'s expenses generally shrink over time, which can complement those higher benefits.""', '- Rob Williams, managing director for financial planning, retirement income, and wealth management at The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) Center for Financial Research.', 'Even though funds are expected to deplete, organizations such as BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) and The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) still recommend waiting until the Full Retirement Age. On trying 100,000 different variations to come up with the best-case scenario for the average worker, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) has discovered that adding guaranteed income and delaying social security benefits until the age 67 is the best thing a worker can do.', 'Besides delaying social security benefits and working longer than planned, potential retirees can do one more thing that might help them get fatter checks in retirement. According to the Social Security Administration, if an individual retires at the age of 70 in 2023, they can get a maximum benefit of $4,555. Apart from waiting until 70, the individual would have to earn the maximum taxable amount for at least 35 years, which is $160,200 for 2023.', 'In conclusion, it is safe to say that states with high-paying jobs and thriving industries are more likely to receive the fattest social security checks. While other factors are also at play that determine the highest paying state for social security, such as how long its residents delay social security, if high-income earners have moved to that state for retirement, and more such causes, it is very likely that thriving and high-paying states receive one of the highest average social security payments.', 'A close-up view of a hand writing out checks from a company checkbook.', ""To determine the states with the highest average social security payments, we have used data from the Social Security Administration's Annual Statistical Supplement 2023.

The UAW strike and lower cost of raw materials (including scrap prices) also weighed on HRC prices.

While both companies operate in the paint and coating industry and are benefiting from improving margins as raw material prices have come down of late, we believe Sherwin-Williams’ dominant retail footprint affords it better pricing power through the cycle. The company provided conservative 2023 guidance and has been successfully gaining market share in the pro segment. While PPG has more European and industrial exposure, Sherwin-Williams’ residential and more domestic focus should also benefit the company as housing indicators appear to be troughing.

A resilient non-residential construction market and healthy demand in the energy space also act as tailwinds for the industry.The sizable infrastructure investment augurs well for the U.S. steel industry. Infrastructure spending and higher end-market demand are also expected to support steel prices. Players from the industry, such as Nucor Corporation NUE, United States Steel Corporation X and Universal Stainless & Alloy Products, Inc. USAP are set to gain from these trends.', 'About the Industry', 'The Zacks Steel Producers industry serves a vast spectrum of end-use industries such as automotive, construction, appliance, container, packaging, industrial machinery, mining equipment, transportation, and oil and gas with various steel products. These products include hot-rolled and cold-rolled coils and sheets, hot-dipped and galvanized coils and sheets, reinforcing bars, billets and blooms, wire rods, strip mill plates, standard and line pipe, and mechanical tubing products. Steel is primarily produced using two methods — Blast Furnace and Electric Arc Furnace. It is regarded as the backbone of the manufacturing industry. The automotive and construction markets have historically been the largest consumers of steel. Notably, the housing and construction sector is the biggest consumer of steel, accounting for roughly half of the world’s total consumption.', ""What's Shaping the Future of the Steel Producers' Industry?"", 'Strong Demand in Major End-use Markets: Steel producers are set to gain from strong demand across major steel end-use markets, including automotive and construction. They are expected to benefit from higher order booking from the automotive market. Steel demand in automotive is expected to rise on the back of an easing global shortage in semiconductor chips that weighed heavily on the automotive industry for nearly two years. Also, the United Auto Workers (UAW) reached a deal with the Detroit Big Three in November 2023, ending the roughly six-week strike that weighed on the U.S. steel industry due to a slowdown in automotive demand. The resolution to the UAW strikes augurs well for steel demand moving ahead. Meanwhile, order activities in the non-residential construction market remain strong, underscoring the inherent strength of this industry. Demand in the energy sector has improved on the back of strength in oil and gas prices. Favorable trends across these markets bode well for the steel industry.A Recovery in Steel Prices Bodes Well: Steel prices witnessed a sharp correction globally in 2022 as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, skyrocketing energy costs in Europe, persistently high inflation, interest rate hikes and the slowdown in China due to new COVID-19 lockdowns dampened demand for steel across key end-use markets. After rebounding during the first three months of 2023, the benchmark hot-rolled coil (""HRC"") prices tumbled more than 40% from their April 2023 peak of around $1,200 per short ton to below the $700 per short ton level. The downward drift was partly driven by shorter lead times. The UAW strike and lower cost of raw materials (including scrap prices) also weighed on HRC prices. However, HRC prices have rebounded of late, driven by U.S. steel mills’ price hike actions and supply tightness, as well as a recovery in demand. The massive infrastructure development project should also act as a catalyst for the American steel industry and U.S. HRC prices. The sizable federal infrastructure spending should favor the U.S. steel industry, given the expected rise in consumption of the commodity. Moreover, the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act will spur demand for domestic steel in the United States.Slowdown in China a Worry: Steel demand in China, the world’s top consumer of the commodity, has softened due to a slowdown in the country’s economy due to the protracted property crisis and weak global demand. The real estate sector has taken a hard hit amid a decline in new home prices, property investment and housing sales. Notably, real estate accounts for roughly 40% of China\'s steel consumption. A slowdown in manufacturing activities has led to a contraction in demand for steel in China. The manufacturing sector has taken a beating due to weaker external demand for manufactured goods and a slowdown in infrastructure spending. China has also seen a slowdown in the construction sector. The sluggishness in these key steel-consuming sectors is expected to hurt demand for steel over the short term.', 'Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Upbeat Prospects', 'The Zacks Steel Producers industry is part of the broader Zacks Basic Materials Sector.

Also, elevated interest rates are a key concern.', ""ARE's primary emphasis is on the development of Class A/A+ properties strategically located within AAA innovation cluster regions. These locations are highly appealing to life science, agtech and technology companies seeking tenancy.

As always, insider activity is just one piece of the puzzle, and a comprehensive analysis should include a review of the company's financials, market position, and growth prospects."", ""It is important for investors to conduct their own due diligence and not solely rely on insider transactions when making investment decisions.

Unfortunately the share price is down 6.3% in the last year."", ""Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns."", ' See our latest analysis for State Street ', 'There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.', 'During five years of share price growth, State Street achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 3.7% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 3% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 9.63.', ""The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers)."", ""Dive deeper into State Street's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of State Street's earnings, revenue and cash flow."", ""When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of State Street, it has a TSR of 36% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""Investors in State Street had a tough year, with a total loss of 2.9% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 17%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 6% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for State Street  you should be aware of."", 'If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

Thom Tillis (R-N.C.).', 'At issue are higher capital requirements that regulators are hoping to finalize in the coming months after they were unveiled this summer by Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr. Those requirements focused on the amount of capital that banks must have in reserve to protect themselves from insolvency.', 'In the months since, the banks have launched a campaign to roll back the new rules — or scrap them entirely.', '“We hope the Federal agencies will be open to changes and will review the industry’s comments thoughtfully,” added Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman during his testimony.', 'Perhaps importantly, the proposed rules also came under scrutiny from moderate Democrats on the Senate panel who could be important to the debate in the weeks ahead as the Federal Reserve weighs the proposed changes to rule, known as Basel III endgame measures.', 'Figures like Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) weighed in to raise concerns about things like how much the proposed regulations could spur the movement of additional financial services outside of the formal banking system.', '“I think the timing at this moment is very problematic with interest rates as high as they are,” said Sen. Warner. But he also noted that the big banks object “anytime there is any proposed new regulation.”', 'Players in the financial sector have pushed for deep changes to the proposal. Meredith Whitney of Meredith Whitney Advisory Group told Yahoo Finance in an interview Wednesday (see video above) that the proposal was ""hamfisted"" and represents a ""risk ... for the US consumer.""', ""The proposal would raise banks' capital requirements by 16% in aggregate, and widen the scope of new requirements to institutions with as little as $100 billion in assets — an effort to include smaller banks like Silicon Valley Bank, which failed this spring."", 'All Republicans on the committee aligned on a letter released last month that calls on the Biden administration to withdraw the Basel III endgame entirely. Ranking member Tim Scott (R-S.C.) called Basel a “nightmare proposal” that will make it harder for average Americans to access loans.', 'Some GOP lawmakers tried to prod the Federal Reserve to make changes. “Regulation does not exist in a vacuum and the federal reserve must take this into account,” said Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.)', 'Likewise, the assembled bank CEOs universally assailed the proposal, but signaled some areas that could get a second look in the weeks ahead.', 'Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon used some of his time to argue that the more stringent market-making provisions in the rules were “particularly punitive” and could increase costs for consumers from airlines tickets to pension plans.', '“These costs will likely get passed on to consumers,” he noted.', ""The hearing is part of Congress's annual oversight of the financial sector. It featured the industry's top bosses from Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Solomon to Brian Moynihan of Bank of America (BAC). The CEOs of Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), State Street (STT), BNY Mellon (BK), and Morgan Stanley (MS) also appeared before the panel of 23 senators for questioning that covered an array of topics."", 'More left-leaning questioners gave the rules a warmer reception with Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown kicking things off by telling the assembled CEOs he thought their campaign against the tighter requirements was based on little more than profit.', '“Absolutely nothing in these rules would stop your banks from making loans to working families,” he noted, slamming the bank’s lobbying efforts. He added that “you would rather fund risky trading and derivatives bets than boring, bread-and-butter small business lending.”', 'While Barr proposed the new outline this summer, not every member of the central bank has been onboard.', 'Fed Governor Christopher Waller recently called the proposal ""excessive"" in a conversation with the American Enterprise Institute. He told the think tank last week that if the proposal did away with separate requirements for so-called operational risk — risk from potential losses from disruptions due to internal mismanagement like fraud, or external shocks like a cyberattack — that he could support the proposal. The capital requirement for operational risk is a major sticking point with the banks.', 'There is also a broader sense that changes could be in the offing. ""Michael Barr knows he went too far on a few things,"" said David Wessel, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, in an interview this week before the hearing. He predicted that regulators will look at issues like operational risk and debate ""you should fix this or you should fix this"" in the months ahead as lawmakers work to finalize the proposal.', 'Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.', 'Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance']"

(NASDAQ:QRVO), is not the largest company out there, but it saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Qorvo’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Qorvo ', ""Good news, investors! Qorvo is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $162.78, but it is currently trading at US$100 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Qorvo’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity."", ""Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. In Qorvo's case, its revenues over the next few years are expected to grow by 49%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. If expense does not increase by the same rate, or higher, this top line growth should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value."", 'Are you a shareholder? Since QRVO is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on QRVO for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy QRVO.

For instance, among the stocks in the S&P 500, those paying dividends in 2022 decreased by 11.1%, whereas the ones that didn't pay dividends experienced a larger loss of 38.7%.

To begin with, dividends have been a crucial factor in total market returns over the last 50 years. Looking back to 1960, approximately 69% of the overall return of the S&P 500 Index can be traced back to dividends that were reinvested, harnessing the strength of compounding. As mentioned above, dividend growers are more popular among investors because of their ability to provide regular and growing cash. According to a report by Hartford Funds, companies that either started paying dividends or increased their dividends have seen the most substantial returns compared to other stocks since 1973. Importantly, these stocks have shown considerably less fluctuation and volatility in their performance. The report highlighted that dividend growers and initiators delivered a 10.24% return from 1973 to 2022, compared with a 3.95% return for non-dividend payers."", ""Analysts often view inflationary periods as a crucial test of stocks' ability to maintain stability in their performance. During times of inflation, the value of money decreases, leading to rising prices for goods and services. In such periods, stocks that can sustain their performance despite these economic challenges are considered more stable. Fortunately, dividend stocks have demonstrated robust performance in past periods marked by inflation. The S&P U.S. Dividend Growers Index and S&P Global ex-U.S. Dividend Growers Index include companies that have raised dividends for 10 and 7 years respectively.

But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does.

Of course, the future is what really matters."", ""Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in U.S. Bancorp. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.8% of shares outstanding. With 7.3% and 4.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and MUFG Bank, Ltd.,Investment Banking Arm are the second and third largest shareholders."", 'On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.', ""While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance.

However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.', 'Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of U.S. Bancorp in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company.

Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Cintas' TSR for the last 5 years was 239%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""It's nice to see that Cintas shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 23% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. However, that falls short of the 28% TSR per annum it has made for shareholders, each year, over five years.

If you want to read about some more stocks in the Asness portfolio, go directly to Cliff Asness Stock Portfolio: 5 Top Stock Picks.', 'Cliff Asness, the chief of AQR Capital Management, is one of the most successful hedge fund managers on Wall Street. His fund, short for Applied Quantitative Research, has roots in the asset management department of Goldman Sachs, one of the premier investment banks in the world. Asness - whose academic career boasts undergraduate degrees in economics and engineering, a doctorate in finance, and research under Nobel-winning economist Eugene Fama - pioneered a quant trading method during his Goldman stint that used computerized models to identify underpriced equities, currencies, bonds, and commodities. These markers were then used for high frequency trading and short selling in order to maximize investment returns.\xa0', 'Starting with $10 million from a select group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to employ this quant method to grow what would later become the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund to over $100 million within a few months. Even though Asness left Goldman Sachs to start his own hedge fund in 1998, the Alpha Fund continued to grow, managing $12 billion in assets by 2007. At his own hedge fund, with a lot more room to deploy his investment ideas, Asness generated even greater returns. According to a report in The New York Times, Asness made $37 million for clients in 2002 and $50 million in 2003. Within a decade of starting his own hedge fund, Asness had over $33 billion in assets under management. This number has continued to grow since then.', 'Asness recently made headlines when he said that he prefers bonds over equities in the present market, given the returns that were being offered by the United States Treasury. Asness manages an equity portfolio worth more than $48 billion at the end of September 2023, per latest data. His remarks echo statements made earlier this year in which he predicted that US dominance of equity markets was nearing an end, ushering in an era for emerging markets that would last years.\xa0Even though Asness prefers bonds over equities, it is noteworthy to look at the moves his hedge fund has made in the market over the past few months. ', 'This is because Asness has increased the value of his equity portfolio by more than $1 billion between June and September this year by employing quant strategies that have made him famous. Regulatory filings show that in the third quarter, Asness made new purchases in 254 stocks, additional purchases in 1,140, sold out of 123, and reduced holdings in 905 stocks.\xa0The top ten holdings in his equity portfolio account for nearly 15% of the total portfolio. Some of the top stocks in the AQR Capital Management portfolio include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).\xa0', 'Our Methodology', 'These were picked from the investment portfolio of AQR Capital Management at the end of the third quarter of 2023.

With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 81', 'Walmart Inc.

Most of the Company’s customers have seen near-term weakness in demand due to pandemic normalization. However, we think the longer-term trend of more silicon per device is still very much intact, and the Company is well-positioned to serve this, given its commanding market share in leading edge capacity. The Company’s aggressive investment in leading-edge equipment combined with tight development with fabless IC designers, plus the embrace of open development libraries, should continue to foster a superior competitive position and attractive long-term growth.”“Semiconductor giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) detracted in the first quarter due to rising geopolitical tensions, macroeconomic uncertainties, and concerns over softening demand for consumer electronics. We retain conviction that Taiwan Semi’s technological leadership, pricing power, and exposure to secular growth markets, including high-performance computing, automotive, and IoT, will allow the company to deliver above its 15% to 20% revenue growth target over the next several years.”', '\xa0', 'Click to continue reading and see Cliff Asness Stock Portfolio: 5 Top Stock Picks.', '\xa0', 'Suggested Articles:', '15 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy Now', '10 Best NFT Stocks to Buy Now', '10 Best SPACs to Invest In According to Reddit', 'Disclosure.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the top 5 most valuable American companies today.', 'When the U.S. sneezes, the world catches a cold. This one saying illustrates the importance of the U.S. economy to the world, the country with the highest GDP in the world not just in 2022 but for at least a century now. Over the past decade, the U.S. economy has seen performance levels that will be impossible for even it to replicate in the future, and its higher government spending and tax cuts have helped cash flow through global markets in addition to domestic markets. One example of U.S. influence on the global economy can be seen in the 2008 recession, which started off in the U.S., but its impact reverberated across the world as the U.S. was driving global growth rates, led by the most valuable American companies today.', 'A financial trader monitoring stock charts and indicators on a high tech computer setup.', 'Currently, the U.S., like most countries, has struggled to contain record inflation, which in turn have led to consistent hikes in interest rates by the Federal Reserve and has seen its economic growth slow down. Towards the end of 2022, fears of a recession in the U.S. were continuing to increase, even as U.S. stock markets saw their worst first half in nearly half a century. Most stocks, with a particular focus on tech, were absolutely devastated and the NASDAQ-100, where most of the top tech stocks including many of the most valuable American companies today are listed, finished with a full-year loss of 32.4% while the S&P 500 recorded a loss of 18.1%.\xa0 However, a more positive than expected landing delayed fears of a recession, and now, expectations of a recession in 2024 are abating further, with an expected growth rate of 1.5% for 2024, after a spectacular landing in Q3 2023.', ""Even as the warnings of a recession continued to ramp up, the U.S. delivered growth of nearly 5% in Q3 2023, with an increase in wages from a tight labor market contributing to increased consumer spending and hence, an uplift in the country's economy. On the other hand, there is still some cause for concern as business investment declined for the first time in two years, and while the performance in Q3 was extraordinary, growth in Q4 is still expected to slow down as student loan payments resume, strikes from the United Auto Workers take place and the delayed impact of rate hikes affects performance. According to a Morgan Stanley report in August 2023, consumer spending declining in 2024 is a major risk for the country as current household savings are estimated to be a mere $350 billion, and student loans and credit-card balances could result in household savings running out in Q1 2024. Additionally, the U.S. Treasury is likely to issue around $1 trillion in debt in 2023 which would make the financial system of the U.S. more illiquid and the Bank of Japan allowing the country's interest rates to increase could also see more investment being diverted to the Asian giant."", ""One of the primary drivers behind the economic dominance of the U.S. is its innovation, which is why it is the most advanced country in the world. This is also why tech stocks are generally among the most valuable American companies today, and further innovations will continue to help in advancing America's economy. One such example is the country's advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is perhaps the hottest industry in the world right now. Some of the most valuable companies in America today have invested heavily in AI, and we'll discuss their investments and approaches to AI in more detail when mentioning which companies make our list."", 'Similarly, tech stocks have dominated U.S. stock performance in 2023, and rebounded strongly from the disastrous performance in 2022. The total return of the Nasdaq composite in 2023 has been 22.51% YTD, and many top tech stocks have seen their share price more than double in these 10 months! However, what goes up, must come down and in the past few days, Nasdaq has taken a beating after some tech stocks underperformed expectations in Q3 2023 and suffered heavy losses. However, towards the end of the week starting 23rd October, Nasdaq did see its performance increase thanks to confidence boosting performances from some of the most valuable American companies today.', 'Methodology', ""To determine the most valuable American companies today, we headed over to Yahoo Finance and first determined the 100 most valuable American companies today, which were then sorted by their market cap.

We saw that same consistency until October,” he said."", 'But for the last two weeks of October, consumer spending was “off-trend,” a pattern that could be linked to weather, Halloween being on a Tuesday and potentially other factors, Rainey said, noting that consumer behavior returned to being more “on trend” in the first week of November.', 'As Walmart approaches 2024, Rainey said the retailer hasn’t seen enough changes in consumer spending to dramatically change its merchandising or pricing strategies.', ""“If times get tougher and there’s probably more pressure on [the] consumer, again, I think our value proposition resonates,” Rainey said. “If we get to a better, healthier economy and we see more growth, I think a lot of the things that we're leaning into ... really resonate with customers as well.”"", 'Because general merchandise generally yields higher gross profits than grocery for Walmart, the retailer wants to see the mix of products it sells shift toward those goods if consumers have more spending power, Rainey said.', 'For Walmart, general merchandise is deflating today in the 5% to 6% range,\xa0getting to a point where prices are lower than two years ago, while food is flat to slightly up, Rainey said. The retailer is focused on selling more units and seeing consumers buy more general merchandise, Rainey said.', 'Commenting on Walmart executives’ remarks during its most recent earnings call, Rainey clarified that the retailer sees deflation as a possible scenario for 2024 given its overall mix but “it is not our base planning assumption, necessarily.”', 'If Walmart is faced with a deflationary environment, it expects to see more pressure on units, Rainey said.', ""Rainey also said that Walmart is confident it can grow profits faster than sales over the next few years: “On a multi-year basis, we think that that's a very achievable outcome.”"", 'To protect itself against adverse economic scenarios in the future, Walmart is investing in automation, robotics and supply chain improvements, which will allow it to expand its amount of merchandise and handle more volume, Rainey said.', ""“If you've ever been to the back of the store and you see how items are unloaded from a truck, it's a very manual, cumbersome process,” Rainey said.\xa0“And by automating the pallet storage and even making it where pallets, when they get to the stores can go to a particular aisle to have the merchandise unloaded, there's a huge savings.”"", 'Automation is also helping Walmart’s efforts to boost e-commerce. Walmart’s U.S. online sales were up 24% in the third quarter, fueled by strength in pickup and delivery and a 26% increase in the retailer’s Walmart Connect ads business.', 'Rainey also said Walmart is leaning into “convenience” as a major value proposition in the digital space, alongside price and value.', '“If you look at other companies that saw a lot of their e-commerce trends during the pandemic, they accelerated, right? But a lot of those reverted back to pre-pandemic trends afterwards. Not Walmart,” Rainey said.', 'As Walmart works toward e-commerce profitability without subsidization from the revenue of higher-margin business units, the retailer is relying on its extensive store fleet in the U.S. to help lower the costs of e-commerce operations, Rainey said.', ""“The most expensive part of delivery is the last mile and that's where our physical footprint of 4,700 stores in the United States that are within 10 miles of 90% of America give[s] us an enormous advantage,” he said."", 'This story was originally published on Grocery Dive.

But even Walmart is grappling with what the implications are for the next 12 months.', 'John David Rainey, Walmart’s CFO, told the Morgan Stanley Global Consumer and Retail Conference on Wednesday that consumers behaved so strangely in October it made bosses “sit up in their chairs.”', 'Spending patterns during the last two weeks of October were particularly “puzzling” when compared with prior months, he continued, though he said he did not intend to be “alarmist” in any way.', 'Unfortunately for Rainey, Wall Street may already be spooked. The retailer’s share price has slumped this month: down 7% after a nosedive following the group’s Q3 earnings call.', 'On the call in mid-November, Rainey first hinted at shifting consumer behavior, saying: “We see our customers showing ongoing discretion in seeking value to manage within their household budget.”', 'This week Rainey sought to reassure, with Reuters reporting he said the “anomalous” behavior of shoppers and deflationary price pressures haven’t prompted Walmart, a $415 billion company, to rethink its long-term plans.', 'Customers may still be spending big en masse—the 2023 Black Friday period broke records after Americans shelled out $9.8 billion on goods—but individuals are getting increasingly wary of the price tags on day-to-day items, Walmart’s CEO said.', 'On the same day as Rainey’s update, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon sat down with CNBC for a more in-depth discussion about shopping habits. “Customers generally speaking are really sensitive right now. They’re prioritizing their orders, and they know there’s a chance that prices might be lower right before Christmas or right after Christmas with clearance, so that’s what we expect to happen.”', 'Previously Wall Street titans had said they were seeing the most softening on the lower end of the income spectrum. Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser, for example, said earlier this year that “cracks” were beginning to show in consumers who earn less.', 'McMillon said that’s not the case Walmart is seeing, explaining: “Everybody‘s price sensitive. We went through this period of inflation which has now changed—we’re starting to see some deflation, which we’re happy to see—but as that price sensitivity went up, everybody was looking for value.”', 'According to the latest data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, some food prices are indeed beginning to come down. Data from October showed the prices of dairy products and nonalcoholic beverages, for example, had decreased while the price of gas also dropped by 4.9%. Overall this meant the consumer price index change from September to October was exactly zero.', 'Walmart isn’t alone in its observations: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said his team saw similar trends from the top of the online tree, and seemed confident consumers would continue to turn to them for the essentials.', '“Consumers are still spending,” Jassy said in an interview with CNBC this week. “They’re being careful about what they spend on, and they’re looking for bargains and deals wherever they can. Wherever they can trade down price they’re trying to do so.”', 'Despite some categories of the consumer price index coming down, inflation is still above the Fed’s target 2%; it was 3.2% in October. And yet, Jassy said, consumers remain resilient.', 'Indeed, it would take a major spike to stop them from buying the essentials: “I think people are going to buy certain retail items,” he noted. “A lot will have to go bad before people stop investing in detergent and shampoo and soap. If you look at our consumables business, the growth rate is pretty exceptional.”', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

By combining high-efficiency pumps and advanced digital technologies, the utility has reduced energy consumption by up to 60%, accelerating its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2040.', ""As Scotland's publicly owned water supplier, Scottish Water provides essential water and wastewater services to more than 2.6 million homes and 150,000 business premises across Scotland. Its pump stations move water across a large geography, including remote villages and islands, so the utility was challenged to keep energy consumption and emissions down."", 'In collaboration with leading global water technology company Xylem (NYSE: XYL), Scottish Water began trialing a smart pumping solution at two pilot sites, Maple Grove and Cross Dene. The trial delivered pronounced cost savings, including a 99% reduction in unplanned maintenance and a 40% reduction in energy, prompting the utility to adopt the technology across its network.', '""Moving and treating wastewater is incredibly energy intensive. Around 17% of transport emissions in Scotland are from the water and wastewater operations sector, so anything we can do will have a big impact for both Scottish Water and the country,"" Nathan Wield, Wastewater Operations West Manager for Scottish Water, said. ""By deploying smart technology, we can prolong the lifetime of our equipment, prevent callouts, and reduce downtime, so there is less service disruption and reduced risk of environmental impact.

Using Xylem’s SoundPrint Acoustic Fibre Optic System – the first of its kind in Europe – Scottish Water carried out extensive inspections of the pipeline, allowing the utility to reduce the possibility of failure by proactively maintaining areas found to be at risk.', 'Data from the inspection showed that only 2% of the pipeline needed maintenance attention. Scottish Water achieved significant cost savings by extending the life of the remaining pipe sections resulting in fewer disruptions to customers.

As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Microchip Technology’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity.', ' View our latest analysis for Microchip Technology ', 'According to my valuation model, Microchip Technology seems to be fairly priced at around 3.26% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Microchip Technology today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $80.98, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Microchip Technology’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.', 'Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with a negative profit growth of -1.6% expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth certainly doesn’t appear to be a driver for a buy decision for Microchip Technology. This certainty tips the risk-return scale towards higher risk.', 'Are you a shareholder? MCHP seems fairly priced right now, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to reduce the risk in your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock beneficial for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on the stock, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.', 'Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on MCHP for a while, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The stock appears to be trading at fair value, which means there’s less benefit from mispricing. Furthermore, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help crystalize your views on MCHP should the price fluctuate below its true value.', ""Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved. For example, Microchip Technology has 2 warning signs (and 1 which is concerning) we think you should know about."", 'If you are no longer interested in Microchip Technology, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.', 'Have feedback on this article?

The company’s share is down 29.68% over the past year. This decline in SLAB’s stock price started in July but accelerated amid posting forward guidance that disappointed the market.', 'The weak guidance can largely be chalked up to the short-term lack of demand for its chips, which still account for most of its earnings and revenues. On a bright note, these headwinds are expected to inverse long-term. Its business execution remains strong, managing to beat EPS estimates despite a bearish backdrop.', 'Analysts remain bullish on SLAB, which has a potential upside of 47.31% over the next year.

The recent increases in crude and fuel inventories, coupled with an uninspiring production cut announcement from OPEC, have overshadowed the energy demand prospects.', ""The situation is further complicated by China's economic downturn. Natural gas is also not immune to the broader market decline, trading notably lower year to date. Despite macro challenges causing uncertainties in demand, the sector exhibits resilience, particularly for companies prioritizing growth and operational efficiency. EOG Resources, Matador Resources Co., Northern Oil and Gas and Evolution Petroleum are noteworthy options for investors navigating this intricate landscape, offering potential amidst prevailing economic headwinds."", 'The Zacks Oil and Gas - US E&P industry consists of companies primarily based in the domestic market, focused on the exploration and production (E&P) of oil and natural gas. These firms find hydrocarbon reservoirs, drill oil and gas wells, and produce and sell these materials to be refined later into products such as gasoline, fuel oil, distillate, etc.', ""The economics of oil and gas supply and demand is the fundamental driver of this industry. In particular, a producer’s cash flow is primarily determined by the realized commodity prices. In fact, all E&P companies' results are vulnerable to historically volatile prices in the energy markets. A change in realizations affects their returns and causes them to alter their production growth rates. The E&P operators are also exposed to exploration risks where drilling results are comparatively uncertain."", 'Sustainable Cost-Cutting Efforts: The energy companies have changed their approach to spending capital. Over the past few years, producers have worked tirelessly to cut costs to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil and gas. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques and extracting favorable terms from the beleaguered service providers.', 'Moreover, driven by operational efficiencies, most E&P operators have been able to reduce unit costs, while the coronavirus-induced collapse in crude forced them to adopt a more disciplined approach to spending capital. These actions are expected to preserve cash flow and support balance sheet strength.', ""Signs of Softening Consumption: WTI crude, the U.S. benchmark, recently closed under $70 per barrel for the first time in over five months due to a substantial build in gasoline inventories and near-record domestic production. Despite OPEC+'s announcement of nearly 2 million additional barrels per day in production cuts, oil prices remained weak as the market sought more robust commitments."", ""China's economic challenges added to the gloom, affecting global demand forecasts. Shifting focus to natural gas, the commodity, which had slumped to a 25-year low in June 2020 but reached $10 per MMBtu in August 2022, is now trading below $3. This decline is attributed to heightened production levels and predictions of lackluster weather-related demand."", 'Inflationary Pressure: Many U.S. energy upstream firms are grappling with escalating costs, predominantly tied to increased expenditures on maintenance and inventory. The current inflationary backdrop, coupled with tightness in the supply chain, not only elevates expenses but also adversely impacts capital programs. The substantial rise in costs, hard to overlook, is overshadowing any advantages derived from an increase in commodity prices.', ""We expect that the challenges posed by inflation-related headwinds will persist, posing obstacles to growth and margin figures without a swift resolution in sight. This could result in a challenging path ahead for oil and gas equities, particularly amid concerns of weakened energy demand amid recessionary threats, potentially jeopardizing the commodity's upward trajectory."", 'Substantial Shareholder Returns: The triple-digit crude prices achieved post-pandemic in the previous year enabled upstream operators to exhibit robust financial performance. Notably, cash from operations has maintained a sustainable trajectory, with improved revenues and companies reducing capital expenditures from pre-pandemic levels amid stable commodity realizations.', 'In essence, the favorable pricing environment in 2022 facilitated E&P firms in generating substantial ""excess cash,"" which they plan to deploy to enhance returns for investors. Indeed, an increasing number of energy companies are channeling their growing cash reserves through dividends and buybacks, aiming to appease long-suffering shareholders.', 'The Zacks Oil and Gas - US E&P industry is a 38-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector.

Despite recording such tremendous gains, Salesforce’s rally seems to have no brakes. Investors’ enthusiasm is powered by Salesforce’s vigorous revenue growth and even more impressive earnings growth. This trend is set to be upheld in the coming quarters, as Salesforce is currently benefiting from a favorable margin expansion trend whose effects were again evident in the company’s most recent quarterly report. Consequently, I remain bullish on the stock.', 'The enterprise software market remains sluggish, with companies in the space experiencing a significant deceleration in revenue growth. Despite Salesforce being a mature behemoth within this space, already recording annual revenues north of $30 billion, revenue growth remains in the double digits.', 'In its Q3 financial report, Salesforce showcased a strong performance, with revenues reaching $8.72 billion, reflecting a robust constant-currency growth rate of 11% compared to the previous year. This figure mirrored the momentum observed in the preceding quarter (Q2 revenue growth was also 11%), underscoring a sustained upward trajectory in a tough market environment.', 'This noteworthy expansion in revenues was propelled by the tireless success across Salesforce’s diverse cloud platforms, encompassing Tableau, Slack, MuleSoft, the Data Cloud, Sales Cloud, and Service Cloud.', 'Despite a climate of fiscal prudence among enterprises and the widespread deployment of Salesforce’s software across major corporations leveraging CRM solutions, the company exhibited an exceptional ability to cross-sell its offerings. I believe that this demonstration underscores Salesforce’s ability to navigate and even transcend the prevailing market dynamics. This resilience not only impresses but also explains the enduring enthusiasm among investors, vividly reflected in the wild share price rally.', 'Further, it’s worth mentioning that Salesforce reported a remarkable 80% increase in deals exceeding $1 million during the quarter. Notably, nine out of the top 10 deals featured a wide bundle of six or more clouds. By achieving wide bundle sales, the company is able to achieve significant growth with reduced selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenditures.', 'During the ongoing surging tide of artificial intelligence, Salesforce stands at the forefront, strategically poised to seize the GPT-equivalent throne within the CRM domain. It wasn’t long ago that the company introduced Einstein GPT, the world’s premier generative AI for CRM. Since then, the trajectory of Einstein GPT has been nothing short of remarkable, with an astonishing fusion of predictive and generative capabilities facilitating a staggering one trillion transactions every week.', 'Noteworthy is the fact that, despite hitting the market just a few months ago, Einstein GPT Copilot has swiftly garnered a customer base that includes 17% of Fortune 100 companies. This rapid adoption is a testament to its capabilities, signaling that it should propel Salesforce into a trend of exponential growth. While precise figures remain undisclosed, the unmistakable trend of growth in multi-million-dollar deals, as mentioned above, stresses the pivotal role played by Einstein GPT Copilots in this achievement.', 'Following activist investors swarming the company in early 2023, essentially demanding Salesforce’s management to focus on improving margins, earnings have started to snowball. In Q3, the company’s adjusted operating margin came in at 31.2%, up 850 basis points year-over-year. This follows the 1,000 basis points expansion reported in the previous two quarters, clearly forming a positive trend for the company.', 'The substantial increase in profit margins has truly unlocked the company’s capacity to generate substantial profits, a stark departure from the predominantly breakeven performance observed in the past. Notably, the operating cash flow in Q3 surged to $1.5 billion, marking an extraordinary 389% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, free cash flow soared to $1.4 billion, reflecting an astonishing 1,088% year-over-year increase and underscoring exceptional free cash flow conversion.', 'When reading such crazy earnings growth metrics from such a highly established company with two decades of consistent growth in the industry, it becomes evident why Salesforce’s stock price has experienced such remarkable fluctuations this year.', 'Further, given management’s guidance, which points towards the continuation of Salesforce’s exceptional earnings growth, it becomes apparent why shares may sustain their strong rally despite their already significant gains.', 'Regarding Wall Street’s view on the stock, Salesforce features a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 26 Buys, 12 Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. At $275.00, the\xa0average Salesforce price target implies 10.5% upside potential.', 'If you’re not sure which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell CRM stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is\xa0Keith Bachman\xa0from BMO Capital, boasting an average return of 21.64% per rating and an 85% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.', 'Salesforce’s astounding 88% year-to-date stock surge appears to be justified by its robust revenue growth, impressive margin expansion, and profitability metrics. With revenues outpacing industry norms, marked success in AI integration, and efficient cross-selling of its cloud platforms to prominent customers, Salesforce appears well-positioned to keep winning despite the shaky enterprise software market. With such momentum, share price gains could persist, sustaining their market-beating trajectory.', 'Disclosure']"

On November 14, the S&P 500 rose by 1.9%, and the Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller companies more sensitive to economic fluctuations, experienced an approximate 5% increase.

More and more young investors are gravitating towards the idea of investing their money into broader market index funds instead of individual stocks. Jeremy Siegel in his book “Stocks for the Long Run” wrote a chapter titled “Building Wealth Through Stocks.” In this chapter the Professor of Finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia shares some data showing how difficult it is to say with confidence that the money manager you are trusting with your savings actually knows their job.', '“Even if money managers choose stocks that have an expected return of 1 percent per year better than the market, there is only a 62.7 percent probability that they will exceed the average market return after 10 years and only a 71.2 percent probability that they will exceed the average market return after 30 years. If managers pick stocks that will outperform the market by 2 percent per year, there is still only a 74.0 percent chance that they will outperform the market after 10 years. This means there is a 1-in-4 chance that they will still fall short of the average market performance. The length of time needed to be reasonably certain that superior managers will outperform the market will most surely outlive their trial period for determining their real worth.”', 'AI is taking over the world and with AI-powered machines beating chess masters, creating songs and world-class art, many are asking why can’t AI be used for stock picking? AI and machine learning has been used by a lot of hedge funds for years now. But we are still years away from a time when AI would be able to process billions of data points and do predictive analysis on stock movements to pick stocks for the future. Bloomberg’s Justina Lee in October talked to hedge funds who are trying to use AI to beat the market. So far their performance hasn’t been impressive because, according to Lee, the financial data is a lot “noisier” and there are many moving parts which AI algorithms still need to process.', 'But the advances made by AI in stock picking are huge. Back in 2021, Bloomberg had reported that researchers at the University of Oxford said they have designed a machine learning model with a capability to predict stock price movements.

The company’s subscriber growth re-accelerated following the company’s crack down on password sharing, and the rollout of the advertising supported subscriber offering known as the Ad Tier, but the average revenue per user came in below expectations and is expected to remain muted in the near term. NFLX reiterated expectations for full year 2023 operating margins of 18-20%, and guided free cash flow to at least $5 billion, up from prior guidance of $3.5 billion. Despite the positive momentum in the company’s business, market participants took comments from management at a recent conference to mean revenue growth may be slower in the coming years than expected. This was not our interpretation of these comments.', 'In fact, the recent re-acceleration of subscriber growth, plus price increases on premium memberships and a stabilization of content investments, should position the company for low double digit annual revenue growth over the next few years while driving improved operating margin to more than 25% (revenue grew 3% for 2Q23 and operating margin was 22.3%, up from 13% in 2019).

Now we'll open up the call to your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions). Our first question is from the line of Ken Wang from Oppenheimer.', 'Hoi-Fung Wong', 'Fantastic. My first question is for Peter, maybe Paul. At the Investor Day, you guys talked about getting an emotional commitment from customers to move over to Vault CRM. It looks like you got 2 written commitments now. Maybe give us some color into what went into that decision-making process for these large enterprises. And what kind of signal do you think this might send to the rest of the industry that are potentially looking at Vault CRM?', 'Paul Shawah', ""Ken, thanks for the question. This is Paul. Yes, so we're super excited about Bayer and GSK. You probably -- everybody on the call may have seen the press releases but we also have them join us during the keynote on the main stage at Europe Summit, which was last week. A super exciting survey. Essentially answered your question on the main stage, which was why did they select Vault CRM. And it came for them, it came down to something very similar, which was innovation. They were -- they're thinking about the future. They are excited about the next generation of CRM. And for them, even I'll paraphrase what GSK said because they said it very concisely, it was this idea that Pharma CRM is not a commodity but it's a solved problem, thanks to Veeva. And with what that means is this is something that's very hard. It's difficult. It's something that they've done multiple CRM implementations in the past and it's not something they want to spend any energy on. They want a solution that works and that's proven and they want to be able to innovate and look forward. So that, in a nutshell, is the reason is it's innovation, it's looking forward. It's building for the future. So we are super excited to have both Bayer and GSK talk about their selection."", 'Hoi-Fung Wong', ""Got it. And then the follow-up for you, Brent. Just as we look at the billings number for the year, you guys trimmed it $40 million. Any way to help us segment how much of that might be the services piece, the FX piece? And I think you kind of mentioned there's a little bit of maybe some combination of duration and timing involved. But would just love to kind of understand what the moving pieces are that got you to that $40 million."", 'Brent R. Bowman', ""Yes, happy to, Ken. So about half of it is related to services, so the services reduction we talked about on Investor Day. The balance of it is really split into a couple of buckets. One is on the proportion of quarterly billers versus annual billers in our new business. So we had a higher mix of quarterly billers than we expected. And then the other portion of that is related to timing of deals. So some deals we expected to close in the Q4 time frame. Now it's going to be early fiscal year '25. And then to another extent, there was some FX headwinds as well, so relative to our prior expectations. So those are the pieces of it, but the biggest portion of it was clearly [flat] services."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Brian Peterson from Raymond James.', 'Brian Christopher Peterson', ""So I'll start with Brent. I think there's been some debate in the past on how the services business correlates to subscription. Is that a leading indicator or not? I've gotten the question from investors. So I love any perspective you have on how we should think about the correlation between subscription and services."", 'Brent R. Bowman', ""Yes, services. Brian, services is not a leading indicator and there's a number of reasons. There's the timing of deals. There's product requirements that are different between the type of product you're buying, customer-specific requirements. So that's not going to be a good leading indicator. And then on the subscription side, you have things like ramping deals and pricing and the like. So there a number of reasons why those 2 don't directly correlate and you shouldn't think of it that way."", 'Brian Christopher Peterson', 'Great. And maybe just as a follow-up, on the marketing and automation side. I thought it was an interesting part of the product announcements out at the Investor Day. How do we think about the ramp of that product? And any early feedback or thought process on what your customers are using today?', 'Peter P. Gassner', ""I'll take that one. Yes, a little -- we'll start the development of that next year in 2024. So I think that's one thing you're seeing from Veeva as a strategic partner. We have a lot of products across R&D and commercial data, software and services. So we're a very strategic partner to our customers. So in general, once we know we're going to do something, we let our customers know, so that they can do long-range planning around that. So in this case, you saw us announce that before we have established a development team, for example, for it. So it's very, very early and too early to say what the revenue ramp would be. In terms of what most of our customers are using, they might use Salesforce.com Marketing Cloud. They might use a product from Adobe. Some of the smaller customers will outsource this to agencies. But those are probably the -- those are the predominant products that are used."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink from Baird.', 'Joseph D. Vruwink', ""In years past, just in the 3Q period, I think Veeva has had a fair amount of visibility and inclination just on the upcoming year because of where big pharma customers stand in their budgeting process. I'm wondering if you can maybe compare current visibility on that FY '25 revenue target versus what's been the case over recent history? And then just related to that topic since Brian, you were calling out some variables on just billings in this year. How do some of those things you called out maybe start to influence the puts and takes going into 2025?"", 'Brent R. Bowman', ""Hi, Joe. So we reiterated the $2.75 billion and the visibility that we have, every day you move forward you have better visibility, and we have no less visibility than we had a year ago. So similar as we look out in front of us. And some things that to contemplate is we have some multiyear ramping deals that will contribute a larger amount next year. That's something that comes into play. But we have a long runway for growth. Our visibility is not less than it has been historically, it's at least as good, and we're confident in our ability to execute to the number."", 'Joseph D. Vruwink', ""That's great. And then I wanted to ask the outlook for the commercial segment. It's gone up more than I expected over the course of this year. And in the prepared remarks, I think you were referencing commercial content and like. So kind of a barbell in that, you have a very mature product growing nicely and what's still very early product growing nicely, there's understandably been a lot of focus on CRM of late. But how would you kind of frame performance from the non-CRM piece of commercial and kind of what you're seeing in market so far to drive what seems like has been upside to your original forecast?"", 'Brent R. Bowman', ""Yes, Joe, it's Brent. I'll take that one as well. So we have increased that commercial number through the course of the year. And you put it quite nicely in that it's a combination of our more established products continuing to contribute revenue growth by content. And then our newer products like Link really kicking in nicely and we're still very early days there. And then the data products, I think you saw in Peter's prepared remarks, really coming along nicely. We're very early days, but we're optimistic in a very long journey there. So those are the things that we think about. And Crossix is another one that's contributing nicely as well to our growth."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Dylan Becker from William Blair.', 'Dylan Tyler Becker', ""Maybe staying on the theme of data here as well. Brent, you just called out Compass, maybe for Paul on that side. There's a lot of new customer momentum. I know we're releasing some new offerings there early next year. But how do you think about that enthusiasm, maybe kind of validating the strategy and some of the encouraging momentum from customers around that strategy as we think about that upcoming opportunity? I know it's beyond 2024. But as we think about kind of the going -- or having that kind of full suite as we think about early next year?"", 'Paul Shawah', ""Yes. So it is a great validation of what we're doing. We have -- we're excited. We have a very clear product strategy with what we're doing in data and more broadly overall with Data Cloud. We're building a modern data platform. Compass is a key part of that. We started with patient data. We did announce the expansion of that portfolio at the beginning part of next year with Prescriber and National. So with those 3 products in Compass, we are well positioned to be the standard data provider for even the very largest pharma companies. And the momentum that you saw in the quarter is a good indicator for us. It's a good indicator that new customers are starting and trialing our data products but that existing customers are expanding, where we started with one brand and then we expand to an additional brand. So it is, in fact, a great validation product strategy, our commitment to getting product excellence. So we're on the right path with Compass. We feel good about that."", 'Dylan Tyler Becker', ""Got it. And then maybe for Peter, too, right? As you think about that evolution of Data Cloud to R&D, obviously, a lot of kind of pertinent use cases there. But how do you think about that data standardization playing in with the kind of work flow or process standardization in some of the momentum you're seeing in that clinical suite today? And maybe what the value can accrue from having kind of both the connected workflow and standardized data as we think about development life cycles as well."", 'Peter P. Gassner', ""Yes, I'm really excited about that. I think our clinical opportunity in data can be as large or maybe larger than our commercial one. It really can be large. Now we're much earlier, so that has to all be proven out. And there's a very strong, very strong synergy between our software in clinical and the data products that we can build. So if you look at it big picture, I think Veeva has been working pretty hard at cleaning up the software side of life sciences over the last 15 years, and we've made a lot of progress, still more to go with adoption, but we've clearly got great footprint for it. Now with Data Cloud, I see us cleaning up the industry data and harmonizing the industry data, and then we'll make our data and software work very well together. So that's really what we're talking about for the industry cloud, that it's a digital transformation, which is software and data all working together. So I'm very excited about it. I think the special sauce on the clinical side is -- the clinical data all on its own is not as valuable as clinical data that can work with clinical software. And I think we're going to revolutionize that area. It will just take some time."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Ryan MacDonald from Needham & Company.', 'Ryan Michael MacDonald', ""Maybe the first one for Brent. You talked about hiring fewer people in the quarter. And as we just look out into next year, what areas might you be adding still? And how you're thinking about the hiring environment or hiring plan, given that we're starting now to see more and more companies rightsize their organization structure heading into next year again?"", 'Brent R. Bowman', ""Yes. So overall, our hiring strategy hasn't changed. We're focused on hiring for growth and we're going to focus on areas where we can drive customer success and innovation. So that's always been our approach. And we're going to do it in a disciplined way. You saw in Q3, we had a lower hiring quarter than you have seen in the recent past. And looking out to the balance of fiscal year '24, it's reasonable to expect that, that lower higher rate continues. I'm not going to get into fiscal year '25 at this point. In 90 days, we'll provide our traditional metrics, which would include operating income and margin. And obviously, headcount will be factored into that."", 'Ryan Michael MacDonald', 'Super helpful. I appreciate the color. Peter, maybe just a follow-up for you. You talked about in the prepared remarks about some of the lower clinical data products around CDB, RTSM, ePRO; and at your Analyst Day, you were talking about how this really expands the TAM within that area. As you start to speak with customers or prospective customers about some of these newer products, what sort of appetite are you seeing for -- from those customers around development or co-development on some of these newer areas and sort of willingness to make some of those earlier investments with you in innovation on the product road map amidst the evolving environment?', 'Peter P. Gassner', ""Yes. Great question about the clinical data software. You have EDC which is the core of it, the first thing and then you have others CDB, we have study training. We have ePRO and RTSM. Customers are generally going to be very conservative in that area. So really, we have to innovate first and then they will come along because this is -- these are their studies, right? And they plan these studies for a long time, so they're going to be pretty conservative. So I think it's an area that starts slowly, but then for the same reason why it starts slowly, then it develops momentum. And if customers end up having something that they really like, boy will they stick to -- with it. And right now, the industry is not well served. If you look at the sort of, I would say, the professionalism of the ePRO applications out there or the RTSM applications out there, they're not of the level of professionalism of Veeva, of what Veeva is doing. Our products are getting there. So that's one thing, which is both the products and the services. And then I think the real topper is the integration, the process integration, for example, between our RTSM and ePRO. We had a discussion last week with some clinical leaders at a top 20 pharma. And when we were discussing the integration that we will do between our RTSM and our EDC and how that affects the prescreening -- the screening process and the ability to get patients into the right trials, this can be transformational. In some cases, when that workflow breaks down, you might lose 6 months exclusivity on a blockbuster product because of the delay of a pivotal trial. That's money you never get back. That's the criticality of these systems, and it causes a little bit of conservatism, right?Well, so I might use your RTSM. Who else is using your RTSM for all of your studies? Well, nobody is yet, you can be first. Well, hey, I'll just -- I'll wait and see on that. So it's that type of thing. Hard to get in there, really hard to get out if you're doing a good job."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Jack Wallace from Guggenheim Securities.', 'Jack Dawson Wallace', 'I just wanted to ask about Compass and the event around clients migrating to the Vault CRM platform. How much does Compass come up as a logical upsell here? And is it fair to think about the migration event being a natural upselling opportunity?', 'Peter P. Gassner', ""It's a great question, Jack, about Compass and Vault CRM. I would say they're not the same at all. They're quite disconnected. Compass in many ways, is a much more strategic decision because that really affects how you apply your resources. And in Compass we're reinventing how you can do data, so it's a much more strategic decision. It's related to analytics and its purchased at the brand level for brand analytics, so it has these dynamics. Also, for example, Compass is something we sell to companies that are 2 years sometimes away from having a field force. They're doing their planning involved of their market potential. So it's quite disconnected versus where CRM is. Hey, now you're ready to launch, you just need a system with the full functionality. Veeva, that's kind of a solved problem. So there would be the CRM playing into that. On Compass, well, gosh, we've been using IQVIA for 20 years. You're coming with a different approach. Well, hey -- they're really out of phase, and they don't depend on each other. Now it's nice to have multiple products to be able to bring in to a customer, so you can provide the full commercial solution, be it the CRM, commercial content, Crossix for your media measurements, Link for your deep data, Compass. So we have a lot of things that can fit together. And especially for a smaller company, they will look for that partner, hey, I just -- I need to get all this in a hurry. But in general, those things aren't linked together, and I wouldn't view Vault CRM as a catalyst for Compass. The catalyst for Compass is going to be its product excellence and how well we do on our launch of Prescriber and National [annually]."", 'Jack Dawson Wallace', ""That's helpful. And then one for Brent around billings. Just to put a bow around the change in terms and cadence of billings, help me with the math here. If we had a $12 million headwind in the third quarter. Does that mean about $6 million of billings from the third quarter slipped into the first half of next year? And then is that number of, say, $6 million to $9 million from the fourth so add it all up, $12 million to $15 million or so, that's just due to billing cadence got pushed into '25?"", 'Brent R. Bowman', ""Yes. I'm not going to break down to the specific numbers, but I can give you like the directional numbers around this. So I said about half was services. And then there is the duration piece of it, right? So then the balance is split pretty much between 2 buckets with a little bit of FX. So that duration piece, that's a -- that's just a matter of over time when it's going to build. So we have more quarterly billers than we expected for our new business. So that's about 25%-ish of the residual. And then the other piece was literally the timing of deals. Again, some of that was deals that pushed out from the back half of the year into the first part of the year. So that's at the high level how to break down the buckets and that's been contemplated in our 2,750 (sic) [$2.75 billion] revenue number for fiscal year '25."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Stan Berenshteyn from Wells Fargo Securities.', 'Stanislav Berenshteyn', ""First, Peter or Paul, in the prepared remarks, it was mentioned you had solid bookings under Crossix including brand expansions. I recall that Crossix has seen some choppy demand in prior quarters. Is the reason that you're seeing a pickup of activity on this front?"", 'Paul Shawah', ""I guess the reasons are some is just timing, how things laid out. Also just solid execution by the Crossix team on the product and on the sales and marketing. And I think some of our competitors also last year sort of maybe oversold what they could actually deliver. So we had a few potentials where the customers last year went for some things because they were promised quite a few things. Actual delivery didn't match. And so they, in some cases, went -- came back to Crossix. In some cases, they went to Crossix for the first time. So really just solid execution and some timing."", 'Stanislav Berenshteyn', 'Got it. And then maybe one for Brent. Services gross margin in the quarter, I think, was the highest in 8 quarters or so. Is there anything to call out here besides hiring? And how should we think about the progression going forward?', 'Brent R. Bowman', ""Yes. We're talking about from quarter-to-quarter, you're going to see vacillation in services margins. If you look forward in Q4, Q4 is a lower margin quarter because of holidays and you have less days to be utilized. But we're always going to focus on having the right amount of capacity to address the service demand we have. And we did a nice job of executing to that in Q3, we saw a little bit higher service margin in the quarter. So the range of margins you've seen over the last 4 to 8 quarters, that's probably a reasonable amount to think about. We're not looking to maximize it to 50% or anything like that."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of David Windley from Jefferies.', 'David Howard Windley', ""Pharma company -- so as a backdrop, pharma companies have been trying to move commercial -- excuse me, commercial insights deeper into clinical development stages of their R&D. Veeva is unique in its span of solutions across clinical and commercial. I'm wondering how much you think about the integration of those solutions across clinical and commercial to drive stickiness of Veeva's solutions? How important is the transition of Vault in that effort? And how important is data in that effort?"", 'Peter P. Gassner', ""It's Peter. I'll take that one. I would say the most important thing that Veeva can deliver in that area is data, data on a common data platform. So enabling pharma companies to have a common data architecture across specifically commercial and clinical. So talk about product classes in the same way, disease areas, therapeutic areas in the same way and so have a common vocabulary and a common source of truth for the data on both sides. And to be able to interact with key opinion leaders, the same view of commercial key opinion leader with a clinical key opinion leader. That's a key thing, the most important thing that Veeva can do. And I think we're really the only one setting out to do that. The second one is enabling the process flow between commercial and clinical. So the connection between, for example, our CTMS system and our CRM system, that's useful. And then maybe potentially, the biggest barrier is process inside of pharmaceutical companies. Do they have processes? Do they have operating models? Do they have responsibility for enabling that flow? Our business consulting can really help there, especially as we're building up our business consulting in clinical, I think we're going to be experts at helping companies with their business process. Because you're right, I do feel, and I know most executives of large pharmaceutical companies feel that there's lost value because their integration, process integration between commercial and clinical is not where they'd like it to be."", 'David Howard Windley', 'Sorry, go ahead.', 'Peter P. Gassner', ""Just to give you one more. I don't -- I think you can't do that if you're not looking at a common view of the data. You won't be able to accomplish it. That's not [deficient] to make that connection happen, but I don't -- but I think it's necessary to make it happen."", 'David Howard Windley', ""That's great. As a follow-up and on a different topic, just on thinking about pipeline, funnel discussions for -- in your sales team. I think you've talked over multiple quarters as have others in life sciences, talked about slower decision-making, budget scrutiny. You mentioned in your prepared remarks IRA. Could you shed -- I mean, not that you haven't talked about it before, but give us the most updated view on how these kind of macroeconomic and IRA-related effects are affecting decision-making? And do you feel like that is getting worse or getting better?"", 'Peter P. Gassner', ""Yes. In terms of interest rates, IRA, global conflicts. Over the last 60 days, I don't view it as getting worse or better per se, it's kind of staying stable. It does result in questioning on decision-making conservatism. It's kind of a damper on innovation for small biotechs who are, hey, maybe I'm going to start up a biotech company, I need to raise funding. Oh, maybe I can't get funding now. So I don't start that up. I don't create that research. So that's a little bit downward. One of the things that has been happening through COVID and this downturn is some deferral things, right? Veeva is -- a lot of the things we do are core capabilities. You're trying to modernize your core capabilities. During COVID, sometimes they had other priorities. When there's uncertainty, like conflicts, interest rates, et cetera, interest rates, et cetera, okay, comparative shift a little bit. But I do feel there's more deferred maintenance building up, especially in sort of top 100 [lifetime] companies, more deferred modernization of systems that's going to have to be taken care of over the next 2, 3, 4 years. So I think there's some demand starting to get pent up."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke.', 'Tyler Maverick Radke', ""Apologies if you covered this. I've been jumping around a few earnings calls tonight. But I wanted to touch on the top 20 pharmas that you did migrate over to Vault CRM. I'm just curious, post that announcement, what's the interest in conversations been with others? And then if you could just share any milestones or other goals that you have in terms of the number of pharmas that you hope to have, call it, over the next few quarters or years?"", 'Paul Shawah', ""Yes. Tyler, this is Paul. Yes. So in terms of you mentioned kind of migrations. These companies have announced their selection. The migration will follow. So we'll do a little bit of services work next year, but you can think of their migration starting in 2025. That's when we are -- we'll have early customers next year. You can think about that as a milestone. We'll have some early customers go through the migration process with us. We treat it like an early adopter program like we do with any other product. So that's what we'll use next year for, and then 2025, we'll be ready to scale. So that's what's next for these companies. They've announced their selection. They want to be able to communicate that internally and align their organization on what their go-forward strategy is. That's really important for them to get organized and focused and aligned. So they're -- they've shifted from decision mode to execution mode. Now in terms of other companies, we're ready when they are, right? I think this has created some additional urgency or expanded our new Commercial Cloud has created some additional excitement and energy that moving to the Vault platform unlocked a lot of that innovation. But there's no time line. We're not forcing our customers to go on any particular time line. I do expect most will go starting in 2025, but 2026, '27, that's when you'll start to see the majority of customers moving."", 'Peter P. Gassner', ""I would if I just chime in there, a question about momentum. Our Customer Summit in Europe calls over 1,000 people there, right? And Bayer were there and GSK were there and they speak both in a large session and in smaller executive sessions. So it's certainly a momentum builder, right? Not only that they're going to Veeva [for] year end, but why? And what was their thought process? Because these companies are kind of leading the charge. The great reference selling there. Also things like we demo-ed -- we did a concept demo of service center for the first time live to the customers there. And I think that was very well received. So the vision starts to get clear and it's building the momentum."", 'Tyler Maverick Radke', ""Got it. And yes, sorry, I didn't mean migration, though I would have been impressive if you migrated those customers. And in weeks, I meant more the signing. So good to hear the excitement from other customers. Just as a follow-up, Brent, I know your favorite topic here on billings. But I guess 2 quick clarifications. Number one, as we think about the updated normalized billings guide for this year, and if you walk through some of the puts and takes that's driving it down. I guess the changes to billings terms and invoicing duration, wouldn't that be normalized, if you will, in the normalized billings? Or is the normalization just for TSC? And then I know you're not guiding the billings for FY '25, but just as we think about the historical relationship between revenue and billings and what does seem to be maybe some modest duration headwinds, anything to keep in mind there?"", 'Brent R. Bowman', ""Sure. On your first part of your question, so what we normalize is we would normalize this for changes in our renewal base. So if you have an existing customer renewal base, they change frequency or they change duration, we normalize that out. So we take the noise out. What we do for new business is we do our best effort to model what we expect the profile of that new business to come in. And so what you're hearing me say is the expectation we had for new business, there was -- the actual fact pattern was a bit different. So we have more quarterly billers in that new business than we anticipated. We thought we'd have a bit more annual. So it's new business, not normalized. It's the renewal portion that we do normalize. And then your second question is we contemplated in the billings that we are exiting fiscal year '24 in our reiterated fiscal year '25 total revenue number. So $2.75 billion, and we feel good about our ability to execute against that."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs.', 'Unidentified Analyst', ""This is Callie Valenti on for Gabriela. Just one for me and going to be again on the billings dynamic. But just related to the deals that you talked about being pushed from the back half of this year into early next year, there was clearly a change versus your initial expectations. And I know you said there's nothing incremental in the past 90 days on macro, but can you help us reconcile those 2 comments a little bit?"", 'Brent R. Bowman', ""Yes. I mean you're going to have -- it's going to be customer by customer, right? There is no exact pattern, that you can say across the larger cohorts. And in the first half of the year, I recall, the actual -- we had favorable linearity. So from period to period, it's going to ebb and flow depending on the specific customer situation, what approvals they require, the size and scale and the complexity of the deal. So it's a continuation of what we've seen. Sometimes it's in your favor, sometimes it's not. And that's what we saw."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI.', 'Kirk Materne', ""Paul, just -- there's going to be a lot of discussion about migrations over the next couple of years. How should we think about sort of the services work around all this, meaning you're going to have a lot of customers, obviously, going through the migration process? How do you make sure that there's not sort of a bottleneck from a services perspective so that -- and maybe there's just not enough work, so that's not that big of a deal. But I was just kind of curious, how do you make sure that you had the right customers, especially your big ones, are aligned with either your own services capabilities or your GSI partners. Can you just talk about that a little bit?"", 'Paul Shawah', ""Yes, sure. And one of the things we're laser focused on right now is making the migration as repeatable as possible, and that's going to include some product work that we're doing to automate some of the migration. But it also includes scaling out the Vault CRM services team, and we have people now dedicated and focused to that. Part of this is focus pays off. And this is the specific -- the kind of thing that we think about when we think about executing really well. Part of our strategy is to execute really well in this area, and we're putting dedicated people on it. And that's going to help us create the focus but also the team to expand and scale and support customers as they -- we know roughly what that time line looks like, so we'll be ready to support it. And I would say the third part of it is enabling our partner ecosystem. So we are working closely to make sure that they know what our role is and they know what their role is and how they can help us and how we can scale, support customers really across the globe. Remember, this is the U.S., it's Europe, it's Asia, it's LatAm. So we have a lot of customers, and we're going to -- we're making sure that we're ready with our own tooling, our services and our partners."", 'Kirk Materne', 'Yes. And you mentioned that -- go ahead, please.', 'Peter P. Gassner', ""I'll just chime in there a little bit. One way to think about it is you had a big bolus of work around Veeva CRM between 2012 and 2017. Roughly speaking, maybe we move somewhere around half the market, a bit less than that from Siebel or Cegedim or some other things to lead this year. And that was a big bolus of work that was done by Veeva Services and our partners like Accenture and regional partners over a 5-year period. Now we have the year period from 2025 to 2030. And we probably have about as much work to do. Now we have more movement to do because we have to move 90% of the industry over, but the effort is less than -- significantly less than half of the effort and certainly in the migration of [plus now]. So we have to mobilize our own services and the partners to do that. But these are things that we know how to do."", 'Kirk Materne', ""That's helpful, Peter, for dimensionalizing that. And then, Brent, one more just on billing. In terms of the duration changes that you're seeing? Are these bigger customers that just want to break it up into bite-size pieces from a payments perspective, smaller customers just trying to save cash? I was just wondering if there's any commonality that you're seeing that's sort of hitting duration right now? I realize it fluctuates, but has anything changed, I guess, on that front?"", 'Brent R. Bowman', ""Again, nothing fundamentally changed. I mean specifically, a couple of the large items were simple co-terms. So you have -- they're just co-terming to the number of deals they have onto a common date. So it's nothing more fundamental than that."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Jailendra Singh from Truist Securities.', 'Jailendra P. Singh', 'Given some of the macro issues you guys have talked about. I was just curious how are price increase conversations trending so far, especially in the environment when macro has got a little challenging? Making sure you still feel good about your 4% price increase expectations for next year.', 'Peter P. Gassner', ""I can take that one. overall, we're not doing price increases, we are doing -- we keep up with the CPI, and we're doing in a very customer-friendly way. So we're capping that by 4%. And we're doing that in arrears by giving the customers at least 8 months notice depending on when their order form is. So no, it's going well. And I definitely don't view it as a price increase. It's very predictable from Veeva. So the macro is not really affecting that."", 'Jailendra P. Singh', 'Then my follow-up is around the comment you had in your prepared remarks about data market and life science moving somewhat slower than the softer market, and you called out anticompetitive behavior from one of your peers. Can you elaborate more on that? Is that something you have observed more recently after your push in this market? And how does those market dynamics impact approach and generally just pushing this market?', 'Peter P. Gassner', ""Yes. I called out the behavior of our competitor IQVIA. No, that's not a dynamic. I've been aware of that for more than 10 years. And of course, IQ has been in court multiple times for this. So it's not a -- it's just not a new dynamic. I just felt in the prepared remarks to call it out. But in data, it can be a bit slower moving because of the conservative in that area -- conservatism in that area. That's understandable. And then the anticompetitive behavior of IQVIA also creates significant barriers there because let's say the customer is using the IQVIA data for 1 data product, and we're selling 1 data product. And our services are necessary to mix those 2 data products together to provide a solution for the customer as well. IQVIA is not going to allow us to do that. They're not going to grant, let's call it a third-party agreement. So that's what slows things down. But we're making great progress, and it's easier for a small company when they start up. So I think next year, you'll see some smaller companies commercializing for the first time that just decide, look, I'm going to be IQVIA free for my whole life, and I'm going to start out that way. I don't need to deal with that old stuff anymore. I think that's going to happen, but it's -- that's a long way from, hey, most of the top 20 using Veeva for most of their data products for most of their brands. That's a that's a 15-year journey."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley.', 'Craig Matthew Hettenbach', 'Just following up on the Bayer and GSK commentary. Is there anything in particular about those customer relationships that made it logical for them to be early adopters on both CRM? And how are you thinking about the cadence for additional customers from an announcement perspective like next year?', 'Paul Shawah', ""Yes. quite good question. And every customer is unique. They're all in their own different stages, whether that's things related to their business or their pipeline or when they may have product launches. GSK and Bayer, we've had good, long-standing partnerships with both companies for a very long time. And they're thinking, they both had this idea of leading thinking. We want to put the decision-making process behind us, and we want to start focus on executing. They were confident, they did their due diligence. They very quickly became very confident in their answer and their approach, so they wanted to put a clear stake in the ground and make that decision and communicate it and now shift into execution mode. So I would say just a strong partnership. We've delivered very well and consistently for them for a very, very long time. They trust Veeva. So they're ready to move forward. In terms of other customers and the rest of the market, we're certainly in conversations with the rest of top 20, all of the large enterprise companies, of course, our small and medium-sized customers. Many of those conversations have started. It's not a mathematical thing. You won't see -- we know we have the next roughly 5 or 6 years, but it's not mathematical. It's dependent upon many different factors and variables. So I would think of it as we're in that early summer stage right now, and then over time, we'll start to see it ramp in. And some of these, you may not see announcements. I think the way to think about it is we'll provide updates when there's kind of a material update to give. You may not see an announcement from -- for every customer, but we when -- there's something material, we'll kind of let the [registry] know."", 'Craig Matthew Hettenbach', ""That's helpful, Paul. And then, Peter, you made a comment regarding the IRA in terms of smaller biotech innovation and that's certainly and focus here. I'm curious just your larger pharma companies, any feedback you're hearing from them, whether it's maybe trade-offs they're making as they kind of manage around this? Any feedback there?"", 'Peter P. Gassner', ""Yes, they're looking at that in terms of their product planning, where will they invest. Hey, should they invest in that molecule, should they delay running a trial or accelerate running a trial. So certainly, it affects their planning. But pharma is good at that. They have to adjust to these factors, these government factors around the globe. And so I think they're adjusting and it may become the new normal in a year or two. So no dramatic change then, it's just causing some adjustments."", 'Operator', 'Your next question call comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from TD Cowen.', 'Lucas Cole Romanski', ""This is Lucas on for Charles. I want to ask about the development cloud and the subscription growth framework you guys have going forward. If I look back at the Investor Day slides, where you guys break out customers and products per customer. It shows that you guys are seeing fewer total products sold in the Development Cloud through fiscal first half. At the same time, you're guiding to 22% to 23% growth in 4Q after accounting for the impact of TFC, which is a step down from 3Q and 2Q. You guys have noted that you're not seeing an impact from macro on subs quite yet, but this is a notable step down in growth. Is this an indication that the segment is starting to mature a bit and that we think about this category growing at a more mature rate going forward? And then understand that we'll get guidance at the next print, but is this 22% growth rate ex-TFC, a good jumping off point for R&D subs growth in fiscal '25?"", 'Brent R. Bowman', ""Yes. So to your point, we reiterated the fiscal year '25 guide at $2.75 billion. So clearly, that factors in subscription and services and the mix underneath that. What we did see was timing when you talk about in the year. So there's some timing that impacted fiscal year '24 that will have less of an impact on fiscal year '25. But importantly, we have a long runway for growth in front of us. We're very early days and across the portfolio, specifically in R&D and to your point, we'll get into the details in about 90 days."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin from Piper Sandler.', 'Hannah Sable Rudoff', ""This is Hannah Rudoff on for Brent. Encouraged to hear about your early traction with Vault CRM. For those 6 non-Vault Veeva CRM customers you landed in the quarter, do most of them plan to migrate to Vault CRM before that 2030 deadline? Or is that even part of the discussion when you're signing with them?"", 'Paul Shawah', ""Yes. So we did have -- we had a good strong quarter with CRM overall. So we had 9 wins. And you're right, some of them are on Veeva CRM. And each of those is a discussion with the customer, and what's right for them and based on their timing. And yes, of course, that's the strategy is to -- they'll start on Veeva CRM. And then at some point before 2030, they'll move over to Vault CRM. And certainly, for some of these customers that are now doing Veeva CRM, that transition path becomes pretty clear and very, very clean. So they have full awareness and knowledge and that's part of the strategy."", 'Hannah Sable Rudoff', 'Great. Super helpful. And then at your European Commercial Summit other than Vault CRM, what commercial developments were customers most excited to hear about?', 'Paul Shawah', ""Yes. Sure we do pick one. We had a very lively Europe summit. So -- and part of that is related to -- we now have our commercial products, our software products that are moving in all parts of the Vault platform. So that unlocks a lot of potential for us. So we were able to announce quite a bit. One is that Peter alluded to the service center demo. Remember, we announced that 5 or 6 months ago at our U.S. Summit and now we demo-ed it live. So really strong execution that resonated really well. The announcements around marketing and outpatient CRM were certainly appreciated. And then in the data space, we had a new data announcement around Pulse data, and Peter talked a lot about that during our Investor Day. But more broadly, what we're doing in data, the innovation we're bringing in data by creating this common data architecture. So you asked for one thing, I gave you 4 or 5, but it was really kind of an action-packed summit with lots of announcements and we created a lot of momentum in multiple different areas."", 'Peter P. Gassner', ""I think (inaudible) there was a lot of -- Paul, there was a lot of excitement around modular content in the commercial content area as well, right? That track was very lively because we've done things over the last year in modular product content and now it's getting adopted in the field, so there is great excitement over that one, too."", 'Paul Shawah', ""For sure -- and that -- and just to go into that a little bit deeper, that we're executing really well on the commercial content side and modular content. But as we think about what Vault allows us to do, it's bringing that content closer to the engagement channel. It's a platform that uniquely sorts both of those content and the engagement, whether it's the sales channel or field medical or even marketing in the future. So it's highly unique in that we're in a unique position to be able to solve that, that content distribution from the time you create it in a very modular efficient way all the way to the time it gets out to the end customer, whether it's a marketing channel or a sales channel. So yes, that was also an exciting announcement."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Brad Sills from Bank of America.', 'Bradley Hartwell Sills', 'Great. I wanted to ask about the comments on some of the deals flipping that affected the quarterly billings into the next year. Any more color there? I mean we typically hear about deals flipping and then they close in the subsequent quarter. So what are the puts and takes that are impacting that? And what gives you that confidence that these will close next year?', 'Peter P. Gassner', ""I will take that one. The feel is different, but I would say, by and large, just timing that gets pushed out by some random bounces of the ball and some conservatism and extra scrutiny. So that's what it is. What gives us confidence is the competitive environment is stronger than ever, right? So that is what gives us real confidence, both in each of our product areas and then customers seeing that, wow, we can bring complete solutions across R&D and commercial software and data. Also, the customers being slightly a bit more conservative, they're not -- customers are spending less on speculative projects. So they tend to go more towards Veeva and core capabilities. So that's what gives me even more confidence about our strong market position. And then since our products aren't optional over time, I have a lot of confidence that our market share -- we're in a better market position than we were 12 months ago."", 'Bradley Hartwell Sills', ""Wonderful. And then if you could comment, please, Peter, on just the clinical deal pipeline and how that's been impacted. It would seem less impacted by the macro because it's trial-related but these are also big transformational projects, if it's a new customer, for example. So any commentary or observations on how the macro has impacted that clinical business, which is such a critical growth driver."", 'Peter P. Gassner', ""Yes. We have a small amount of our business in the clinical and the very small customers maybe that have under 500 employees, under 300 employees. So that certainly impacted because sometimes people can't get funding to do the trial or they maybe go out of business. So that's impacted specifically. Other than that, the general conservatism doesn't impact clinical any more than it would be regulatory or safety or quality. These are large infrastructure projects [we know you're] -- and they're just having a bit more scrutiny than they used to."", 'Operator', 'Your next question comes from the line of Richard Poland from RBC Capital Markets.', 'Rishi Nitya Jaluria', ""This is actually Rishi Jaluria from RBC. Not sure why it put my colleague's name. Actually wanted to ask 2 questions around generative AI. First, I would like to maybe drill a little bit into kind of a theme that we've been hearing more as we've been doing our conversation with partners and industry -- which is that as generative AI is working behind clinical trials, it is leading to maybe more of a tailwind towards personalized and precision medicine, which feels like not only should that benefit your CDMS platform, but even on the data side, what you have with Compass -- correct me if I'm wrong, it seems like it's maybe a little bit more tailored to that. So maybe if you could help us understand some of the trends that you're seeing out there and how that can play out. And then I have a follow-up."", 'Peter P. Gassner', ""In terms of the generative AI, honestly, I haven't seen a big impact in clinical. There was good experimentation and projects around helping to write or evaluate protocols, for example, but not using things like generative AI to do statistical analysis or predict where the patients are. I think there, the more appropriate tool which people are using and continue to use more and more data science. Really having the right data, running the right algorithms, being systematic about it. So yes, I just haven't seen that impact of generative AI. You see it more in other areas that relate to content creation and asking of questions, writing safety narratives, things like that."", 'Rishi Nitya Jaluria', ""Got it. No, that's really helpful. And then maybe just sticking on the theme of clinical and Gen AI, coming off the EU Commercial Summit. I'm sure you heard a lot of use cases from customers that they want to explore around Gen AI and the [clinical] side. I think a lot of those very straightforward. Maybe on clinical side, right? I mean you talked a little bit -- but I imagine there's a lot of data you have, as you put through for around content, including regulatory submissions to the FDA. I imagine there's probably use cases around, just have the language that people can use to expedite their approvals and so on and so forth. Maybe just to talk a little bit about what sort of use cases you're hearing from customers that they want you to be part of when it comes to the clinical side of the equation, that would be really helpful."", 'Peter P. Gassner', ""Yes. So -- some are just very straightforward what's called the clinical master data. [Who] are the investigators who are in the sites around the world and what is their patient characteristics like? That's hugely important for site selection, but also for recording your internal operations, how efficient are you. Then -- so that's what we call OpenData clinical.Site base is the deep profiles around all the sites and investigators, all their specialties, all their activity. So that's again for more detailed site section. Then clinical pulse. That's something we've announced, which we'll be producing next year. And that's things like, okay, I'm a pharmaceutical company, and I picked these 2 milestones to measure. What's the time between my last patient visit and my lock of my clinical database. And I'm a pharmaceutical company, what's my time there. Okay. And now what's the industry's average time there? So that I can start to see. Am I ahead or behind there? What's my opportunity for improvement or not. And that's just one measurement. So I think it's those 3 areas that customers are excited about from Veeva, the clinical master data. The deep data, specifically around site selection, critically important. And then the clinical pulse to optimize their internal business processes and benchmarks against the industry."", 'Operator', 'We have no further questions in our queue at this time. I will now turn the call over to Peter Gassner, Chief Executive Officer, for closing remarks.', 'Peter P. Gassner', ""I'd like to close by thanking our customers for their trust and partnership and our employees for their continued commitment to our values and do the right thing, customer success, employee success and speed."", 'Operator', ""And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.""]"

The global economy suffered heavily due to the rising prices of oil and gas after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The US was hit by a 40-year high inflation and subsequent drastic rate hikes by the Federal Reserve to tackle it.', 'Moving on to 2023, oil and gas prices remained relatively low throughout the year. However, recent events such as the Hamas-Israel conflict coupled with production cuts from OPEC and Russia led to an increase in oil prices in the third quarter. The Middle East conflict created fears that the per-barrel oil prices might even touch as high as $150, and with interest rates already high, it could lead to an even more devastating impact on the global economy. Even though the conflict is still ongoing, the oil and gas prices have not gone much higher.', 'While the world is moving to transition completely to renewable energy, some challenges remain to consider. One of the biggest problems is the high cost of renewable energy infrastructure. The high-interest rate environment is one of the factors that is slowing down renewable investments.

Please go ahead, sir."", ""Rob Ballew: Good morning, welcome to Signet Jewelers third quarter earnings conference call. During today's discussion, we will make certain forward-looking statements. Any statements that are not historical facts are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially. We urge you to read the risk factors, cautionary language, and other disclosures in our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K.

For further discussion of the non-GAAP financial measures, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, investors should review the news release we posted on our website at ir.signetjewelers.com."", ""With that, I'll turn the call over to Gina."", ""Gina Drosos: Thank you, Rob, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Our team delivered this quarter with non-GAAP operating income at the high end of our expectations. Recall, the jewelry category is experiencing its second COVID as engagements are down 25% due to the disruption of dating three to three and a half years ago. Through this environment, our team has continued to be agile and innovative, resulting in Signet growing our bridal market share again this quarter. I'm confident we'll grow from this trough next year just like we rebounded strongly from the closures of the pandemic. Our team knows our customers, create unrivaled experiences to meet their needs, and delivers on our commitments. In this time of year, their expertise really shines."", ""I'm honored to work alongside them. I'd like to leave you with three key takeaways today. First, we delivered our financial commitments this quarter, and remain on track to deliver the year. Even as we delivered a profitable third quarter, we invested in marketing and merchandise strategies to deliver our fourth quarter commitment and to drive share gains. Jewelry continues to be an important gifting category particularly among Gen Z, with Black Friday weekend results in line with our expectations. Second, the multi-year engagement recovery has begun as we predicted with engagement ring units beginning to rebound in recent weeks. While we still expect a gradual recovery over the next three years of the 45 proprietary relationship milestones that we track, we have seen the expected progression to late-stage milestones over the past few months."", 'This progression is highly correlated with engagement ring purchases, which we have also seen increase over the last several weeks. Importantly, engagement rings are the catalysts to lifetime value, which makes them a competitive advantage for establishing sustainable long-term growth. Third, our company is strategically positioned to leverage our scale and competitive advantages to help weather the highs and lows of our category and general macro pressures. For example, we are the largest advertiser in our industry by far with three times the annual spend of our nearest competitor. The scale and effectiveness of our marketing spend is reflected in the fact that our top three banners, Kay, Zales, and Jared have top-of-mind awareness among jewelry consumers that is twice that of nearly any other US retailer.', ""Our consumer insights also give us foresight, which, for example, helped us predict the engagement slowdown and reduce our inventory double digits, even while investing in newness for the holidays. Let's look at each of these points beginning with the quarter. We delivered sales of roughly $1.4 billion this quarter and $24 million of non-GAAP operating income. Prior to the pandemic, the third quarter was consistently a loss quarter for Signet. It's the one quarter of the year without a major gift-giving occasion and is when we are investing in marketing and merchandise delivery for our largest gifting occasion, the winter holiday season. As a result of our transformation, we delivered four years in a row of positive Q3 earnings, all while continuing to invest in both our holiday strategy, and our long-term growth."", 'Adding to the obstacles our team navigated this quarter, over inventoried independent jewelers continue to drive heightened levels of promotion in our category. That said, our brand equities, services, targeted promotional cadence, and sourcing efforts allowed us to increase gross merchandise margin in the quarter, up 250 basis points to last year. Further, inventory was down 14% from a year ago, allowing us to bring in more newness, creating a competitive advantage. This includes value-engineered pieces that offer great looks and value at high price points, along with broad assortments of on-trend gold jewelry, such as sculpted gold earrings and necklaces, and strong presence in lab-created items that also provide excellent value. Compared to last year, sell-through of new SKUs increased by 30% in the third quarter.', ""The next point I want to underscore is that, we are in the midst of the most popular time of year for engagement ring sales, October through February. As I highlighted above, we've crossed the trough and the engagement recovery has begun. For example, couples moving in together, a late-stage milestone was up 9 points from early 2022, and Google searches for engagement rings are now 10% higher than last year, the first time they've exceeded the prior year in nearly two years. The percentage of couples moving to the engagement phase has improved by five points, a statistically significant movement over the last 18 months. Beyond the COVID-driven engagement recovery, we are also seeing more positive attitudes among younger, unmarried consumers toward getting engaged and married."", ""In our most recent survey, nearly 80% of non-married Millennial and Gen Z adults say they want to eventually get engaged and married, which is a notable improvement to younger adults from a 2018 survey. That's encouraging, as are the multi-cultural changes we're seeing in engagements. Moving forward, the majority of engagements in the US will be multicultural, led by growth in Hispanic Americans. This multicultural trend is steering our merchandise and marketing strategies as we lean into higher penetration of products like yellow gold and provide bilingual marketing and sales expertise that makes our multicultural customers feel respected and welcome. It's working. In the third quarter, Zales performance at high Hispanic doors is better by 130 basis points compared to the balance of Zales fleet, driven by assortment, bilingual consultants, and signage, as well as increased Hispanic-targeted media."", ""So our data is clear, engagements are on their way back and we are positioning ourselves to win. We continue to expect a gradual return to pre-pandemic levels of engagements that will play out over the coming three years. A three-year tailwind that we can leverage for business and market share growth, given our scale and our position as the engagement leader of the industry. The recovery of engagement rates is also our catalyst to lifetime value. We provide services that cement customer relationships, including nearly 80% attachment rate to extended service agreements on bridal pieces. We are also increasingly using our customer data platform, loyalty program, and personalized marketing capabilities to meet our customers' ongoing needs for jewelry to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, and holidays for years to come."", ""For example, we are now approaching 4 million loyalty members and this quarter, their average transaction value or ATV was 40% higher than our non-loyalty members. It's a clear reflection of loyalty as a long-term growth driver and scaled competitive advantage. This brings me to my third and final point. Signet is well-positioned to grow reliably over time. Thanks to the moat of competitive advantages and scale, we've built that are unique in our category. Signet is able to withstand and even gain share through cyclical dynamics of the jewelry industry in general macro pressures, thanks to those advantages. A good example is how we are managing the price decline of larger loose diamonds this year. The elevated promotional activity of overstock independence is a key contributor to driving down diamond prices to pre-pandemic levels in recent months."", 'In contrast to independent jewelers, our product innovation and assortment, promotional priorities, and scaled buying power have delivered stable ATVs all year, including in recent months, both for natural and lab-created diamonds. Within the industry, the natural diamond oversupply situation, which has been pressuring retail prices is beginning to abate. Independents have been buying less in recent months and their inventory levels have improved by more than 15 points since the first quarter. Mid-stream inventory appears to have peaked in June and major jewelry manufacturers have dramatically reduced their output. Large diamond miners have recently suspended mining activities and sales for two months or longer. Further, for the first time in more than a decade, DeBeers is stimulating category demand with a branded natural diamond marketing campaign over the holiday season.', ""Combined with the upcoming engagement multi-year tailwind, we believe that natural diamond market should normalize through next year. But what's most important for us as the world's largest retailer of diamond jewelry is that, we are strategic with our partners to drive better pricing, better assortment, and better value for our customers by leveraging our inventory discipline, and vertical integration. The other growth pillars of our midterm goals are also meaningfully progressing. Our services business up 5% in the quarter and year-to-date has contributed close to one point of our gross merchandise margin expansion. For example, we continue making great progress with ESA attachment up to last year again this quarter, improving by 310 basis points."", ""In accessible luxury, we've opened five Diamonds Direct stores this year, including three since the quarter ended, bringing our total to 30 stores. These stores once reaching full maturity generate over $15 million a year in average revenue per store. Our Foundry custom jewelry at Jared has grown, including 40% unit growth in Q3 compared to a year ago. This is complemented by our premium assortment doors, which outperformed the balance of the Jared fleet by nearly 900 basis points this quarter. Our digital and marketing capabilities continue to drive efficiencies, led by our use of AI in North America in reflecting a [role-out] (ph) improvement this quarter of 30% to last year in our core banners. We are activating Signet's new CDP for this holiday season, more fully than ever before as we target the 35 million people we know have purchased jewelry in the US in recent years and 14 million people we know are in various stages of dating relationships."", ""To summarize my comments today, the competitive advantages that we've built are working. We are positioned to deliver our commitments this fiscal year and are on track to meet our midterm goals. With that, I'd like to hand it over to Joan."", ""Joan Hilson: Thanks, Gina, and good morning, everyone. Our performance this quarter reflects our continued ability to deliver free cash flow improvement on lower comp sales. We generated nearly $1.4 billion in sales this quarter, down 12.1% compared to this time last year with same store sales down 11.8%. Our performance reflects a 1% improvement in North America's total ATV compared to this time last year, or flat on a same store sales basis, also a one-point improvement over first half trends. Traffic was down compared to last year in the mid-single digits. Trends from the second quarter were largely consistent throughout the third quarter, across both bridal and fashion, as well as across most price points. As expected, the decline in engagements impacted sales in the quarter, especially in our digital banners, given there are more than 80% bridal penetration."", 'Consumer access to credit remains healthy. Overall payment plan penetration was 46% for the quarter similar to last year. Approval rates in store improved compared to last year and the amount financed was in line with the prior year. Credit health has continued into the fourth quarter. We delivered $501 million of gross margin this quarter with non-GAAP margins increasing 80 basis points to 36% of sales. Within that improvement is a 250 basis point expansion of merchandise margin that reflects the continued strength of our merchandise strategy and the growing penetration of services. Partially offsetting these gains was the deleveraging of occupancy on lower sales. Turning to SG&A, our non-GAAP spend of $477 million or 34.2% of revenue was 280 basis points higher than last Q3.', 'This year-over-year change reflects a 50 basis point improvement compared to the first half of this year, driven by our meaningful cost savings initiative in our seasonally lowest sales quarter. We achieved $65 million in cost savings this quarter in line with our expectations, bringing year-to-date savings to approximately $140 million. Key drivers of the cost savings include non-customer impact initiatives, such as lower inventory costs related to material recovery, enhanced credit agreements, and overhead efficiencies. Deleverage in SG&A was primarily driven by investments in our digital banners and strategic initiatives in our seasonally lowest revenue quarter. For the third quarter, non-GAAP operating income was $24 million or 1.7% of sales.', ""As Gina said, this represents our fourth year in a row of positive earnings in the third quarter. This reflects the flywheel nature of our operating model, as we leverage scale and performance to drive consistent cash generation that we then invest to extend our competitive advantages and return cash to shareholders. Turning to services. Customers continue to see the value of extended service agreements or ESAs outperforming merchandise by more than 15 points this quarter. Consumers continued to be attracted to the great value of our warranty plans driving overall attachment 310 basis points higher to a year ago with gains in both bridal and fashion categories. Turning to repair. We've made progress, ramping up the capacity of our enterprise-wide service center in Seattle, and now insource appraisal services through Kay in sales."", ""The Tennessee repair facility continues to grow its B2B client base, while also bringing in-house all of Kay and Jared's watch repair needs, with Zales plan to be integrated next year. Turning to fleet optimization. Subsequent to the quarter, we sold 15 stores, primarily luxury watch showrooms in the UK to the Watches of Switzerland Group. The accretive sale multiple generated proceeds of approximately $53 million. This sale represents a gain of approximately $12 million and will be treated as a one-time event. The divestiture of this non-strategic business allows Signet to accelerate key elements of our UK transformation plan. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with more than $640 million of cash and equivalents, up more than $315 million compared to a year ago."", ""In terms of free cash flow, we outperformed last year by nearly $100 million in the quarter on lower sales, driven by sustainable working capital improvement. We repurchased $35 million or nearly 0.5 million shares in the quarter. Since the end of the quarter, we've repurchased an additional $11 million or 135,000 shares. This brings our year-to-date total to more than $128 million and we have approximately $672 million in remaining repurchase authorization as of today. This morning, we also declared a $0.23 dividend to common shareholders. Our return of capital is driven by our consistent free cash flow, led by our flexible operating model and a robust balance sheet, consistently converting over 70% of non-GAAP EBIT to free cash flow in recent years, driven by the structural changes we've implemented."", 'We ended the quarter with $2.1 billion in inventory, which was down $333 million compared to last year or approximately 14% or 12.5% excluding the divestiture of inventory held for sale. Our inventory churn of 1.4 times has improved considerably from a roughly one-time churn five years ago. We still see opportunity to improve our inventory turns over the mid-term as we leverage AI to drive perfect merchandise assortment by store, leverage, flexible fulfillment, and continue to optimize our product life cycles. Each point one churn improvement translates to approximately $100 million of additional free cash flow. Our leverage ratios remain below our target, with our adjusted gross debt leverage ratio now measuring 2.3 times or 1.8 times on a net basis.', ""Additionally, our net debt to EBITDA ratio is only 0.2 times compared to 2.1 times in FY 2020, which highlights the improvement to our balance sheet over the last four years. Now let's look at guidance, we are reaffirming our FY 2024 outlook, excluding the 15 store asset sale in the UK. The updated outlook reflects the removal of approximately $25 million of revenue and $5 million of four-wall EBIT for the 15 store sale in the UK in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we anticipated these 15 locations to generate approximately $60 million of revenue and $8 million of four-wall EBIT this year. Our top line outlook for the fourth quarter reflects expectations of a continued elevated promotional activity over the holiday season. We expect engagements to be down mid to high single digits compared to the previous year versus down mid-teens year-to-date."", ""In the last three weeks, we've seen a more than 300 basis point improvement to engagement trends from our Q3 exit rate, and we anticipate further improvement as the quarter progresses. This outlook also reflects Black Friday weekend results in line with our previous guidance expectations for the quarter. Additionally, we have a 53rd week in the fourth quarter, which is worth between $80 million to $100 million in revenue. We're also lapping UK strikes last year, which is worth a point in comp sales. We continue to expect cost savings in the range of $85 million to $110 million for the fourth quarter. And finally, we expect somewhat less deleveraging on fixed costs in occupancy and labor on higher revenue. Before we move on to Q&A, I want to thank our team for their commitment to our customers as we head into the peak holiday selling season, and wish them all a happy and safe holiday."", ""With that, we'll open the lines for Q&A."", 'See also 30 Most Profitable Online Businesses To Start In 2024 and 13 Best Tech Stocks For Long Term Investment.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Nine units will be located in the Dallas-Fort Worth and San Antonio metro areas.', 'CosMc’s appears to be challenging Starbucks and other major chains, like Panera, that are innovating with caffeinated, non-coffee drinks.\xa0CosMc’s beverage menu includes iced tea, lemonade and slushes that can be caffeinated and highly customized with add-on ingredients.\xa0The concept also offers soft drinks and several hot and iced coffee beverages alongside select McDonald’s food products and signature food items.', 'CosMc’s emphasis on hypercustomization\xa0mirrors Starbucks’ offer of personally tailored, complex beverages. The small-format restaurant could be a legitimate competitor for the coffee chain if scaled beyond the initial pilot, because Starbucks has struggled to balance the personalization its customers demand with its efforts to reduce employees stress.', '“CosMc’s seamlessly blends brand-new, otherworldly beverage creations with a small lineup of food, including a select few McDonald’s favorites —\xa0all designed to boost your mood into the stratosphere, if only for a few moments,” the company wrote in a press release emailed to Restaurant Dive.\xa0', 'It’s unclear how many employees each CosMc’s restaurant will staff, but in a video presentation detailing CosMc’s operations, McDonald’s said “the crew is able to flex across roles” thanks to a “streamlined labor model.” Starbucks is preparing to roll out its Siren System, a kitchen operations overhaul which is designed to bolster cold beverage assembly, on a large scale in 2024 and 2025 to take pressure off of its workers.', 'CosMc’s most complex cold beverages offer up to nine categories of customization. For example, the Berry Hibiscus Sour-Ade\xa0allows customers to select how much ice they want, and if they would like to add dried dragonfruit, dried blueberries and dried strawberries or remove dried lemon wheels. Additionally, customers can select two fruit syrups from a lineup of eight options; a boost, such as an “Energy Shot,” “Pre-Workout Shot” and Vitamin C Shot;”\xa0and fruity boba and sweet popping boba.', 'The restaurant’s hot beverages offer even more customization opportunities — the most complex drinks include 15 personalization category opportunities. For example, the Tumeric Spiced Latte lets customers select one of four milk options; up to eight flavored syrup options (that can be “Lite” or “Extra”); an espresso shot; black pepper sprinkles; up to 10 servings of three sweeteners (liquid cane syrup, Splenda and sugar); hot foam; whipped cream and a temperature of choice (“Not Too Hot” or “Extra Hot”).', 'Though these beverages offer many more permutations than McDonald’s drink menu, they don’t match or exceed the number of customizations Starbucks customers can request. The coffee chain’s Iced Toasted Vanilla Oatmilk Shaken Espresso, for example, includes a whopping 20 points of personalization — including coffee roast selection and the option to blend.', 'CosMc’s menu also includes sandwiches, snacks and sweet and savory “Bites” that could compete with Starbucks’ growing food menu. On an investor call last month, Starbucks CMO Brady Brewer said “in service of driving afternoon and all-day visits,” the company “will expand with new all-day snacking platforms and introduce an elevated fresh-baked offering over time.”', 'This story was originally published on Restaurant Dive.

We also learned that CosMc’s “is a small format concept with all the DNA of McDonald’s but its own unique personality,” in the words of CEO Chris Kempczinski, who discussed the concept during an analyst call in July.', 'On Wednesday, Kempczinski finally revealed more during an investor event. Late in the day, after a detailed discussion of the company’s plans for bigger burgers and more restaurants, Kempczinski got to CosMc’s, with a Steve Jobsian intro.', '“There is one more thing,” he told attendees. “CosMc’s.”', '“What would happen if a McDonald’s character from the 1980s that was part alien, part surfer, part robot — what would happen if this character were to open a restaurant in 2023?” Kempczinski asked.', 'The answer: The robot-surfer-alien would open a Starbucks rival with even more indulgent drinks, and name it after himself.', 'McDonald’s wants to get into the specialty coffee business, an “attractive and fast growing category,” Kempczinski said. But, he added, McDonald’s can’t just add a bunch of new drinks to its regular menus – it would complicate kitchen operations and slow service down.', 'So it’s testing out this new concept to see if people will swing by CosMc’s during their afternoon slumps to buy a churro frappe, s’mores cold brew, chai frappe burst, or another customizable beverage. Maybe they’ll even pair it with cookies, ice cream, or one of a few sandwiches.', 'With CosMc’s, McDonald’s seems to be looking at Starbucks’ playbook — a focus on cold, sweet beverages that can be modified to taste. Cold drinks make up the majority of Starbucks’ sales. In November, Starbucks said that high-priced lattes and customized drinks helped lift the coffee chain’s US sales in the quarter ending on October 1.', 'Kempczinski warned investors not to get too excited: CosMc’s is still just a test. So far, there’s one location opening in Bollinbrook, Illinois, later this week. Through the first half of next year, McDonald’s plans to open nine more locations all\xa0in Texas.', 'McDonald’s sees an opportunity for coffee not just in the limited test, but at its regular locations, as well.', '“Coffee is a very attractive category,” said Jo Sempels, who oversees markets where McDonald’s has licensed its brand, earlier on Wednesday. “It is large, highly profitable, growing quickly, and obviously with strong habitual behavior.”', 'When it comes to McCafe, “we still haven’t realized our full global potential,” Sempels said.', 'To strengthen the company’s coffee business, “we will establish McCafe as part of our core menu offering and as our only brand for coffee at McDonald’s,” he said, adding that the company will also streamline the equipment it uses to make sure coffee tastes consistent across locations.', 'Plus, he said, the company is working on a cold coffee plan. Here, too, McDonald’s may be learning from Starbucks’ cold drink bonanza.', 'For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com']"

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 most expensive medical treatments/procedures in the US.', ""The U.S. is unique in that it is one of the only advanced countries in the world to not offer universal healthcare. Instead, a person's healthcare is generally tied to employment, and those without insurance can even go bankrupt while attempting to pay off bills. In fact, a person without insurance can often be charged exorbitant amounts without any basis, as hospitals expect insurance companies to haggle and reduce the bill and if you're wondering how much does surgery cost without insurance, it can vary widely from hospital to hospital, your negotiating skills and the type of surgery, but odds are overwhelming that the cost will be much higher than if a person was insured."", ""Unfortunately, despite the U.S. topping the list of countries with the best hospitals in the world, said healthcare is often only available to some of the population. You might even be surprised to know that healthcare is among the most lucrative industries in the country, and doctors and surgeons can command top salaries. While in other advanced countries the entire population can access healthcare services, including Canada and most European countries such as Germany, France, Spain and Poland. Since the U.S. has repelled any advances towards universal healthcare, it also has some of the highest per capita spending on healthcare and in 2021, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services demonstrated that per capita healthcare spending in the U.S., driven mainly be the most expensive medical treatments / procedures in the U.S., stands at $12,914. At the same time, healthcare spending in the country stands at a staggering $4.3 trillion per year, and yet, is still unable to provide quality service to the overall population. Some of the most expensive medical treatments in the world are mostly present here, which is why many people even consider going to Mexico for cheaper medical treatments. It's also not surprising that likely the most expensive hospital bill ever also took place in the U.S. in Florida, worth $9.2 million."", 'A surgeon in a modern operating theatre performing a transplant surgery with medical technology. Editorial photo for a financial news article. 8k. --ar 16:9', 'According to McKinsey & Company, the healthcare industry is expected to demonstrate growth of 4 percent CAGR from 2021 to 2016, where it will likely reach profits of $790 billion. This is a downwards revision from an earlier prediction of 6% growth by McKinsey from 2021 to 2026, as inflationary pressures have threatened growth. While inflation is no longer as high as the peak it reached in 2022, it is still relatively high and combined with labor shortages, is providing additional difficulties to the healthcare industry. A 2021 report by the American Association of Medical Colleges predicted that around 15,800 - 30,200 shortages would be seen across all surgical sectors by 2030, which will prevent people from receiving the necessary treatment, including the most expensive medical treatments in the country, which can cost several hundreds of thousands of dollars. One of the primary reasons behind this shortage is due to the high costs of medical education as huge student debts along with high interest rates are acting as a further deterrent.', 'Meanwhile, the aforementioned expected increase in profits is likely to come from various sources, one of which is a change in payer mix, as the over-65 population continues to grow, which prefers Medicare Advantage. However, based on legislation that allows states to determine again eligibility, could see enrollment decline by around 10 million people over the next five years. At the same time, margins have declined in the industry in 2021 as opposed to 2019, though margins are now expected to recover post-pandemic and grow at a CAGR of 15%. At the same time, annual costs as a result of endemic Covid-19 will be in excess of $200 billion.', 'This uncertainty in the industry has impacted some of the most valuable healthcare companies in the world. One of the biggest such company in the world is CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), which has seen its share price decline by more than 23% YTD. In its Q2 2023 earnings call, CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) stated ""This growth reflects our differentiated product offerings that address the total cost of care and the whole health of a member through our integrated solutions. Medical cost trends were well controlled in our commercial and Medicaid books of business. Consistent with the broader industry, elevated medical costs emerged in our Medicare Advantage business which became apparent in the latter part of the quarter. The primary driver of these elevated medical costs was greater than expected utilization in outpatient settings. Shawn will discuss these trends in more detail. In Medicaid, the State of Oklahoma awarded us a new statewide Medicaid contract beginning in April 2024 that will add approximately 200 members. This win demonstrates our market-leading ability to comprehensively support Medicaid populations through our deep local relationships, investment in clinical programs, and integrated wellbeing solutions. This quarter, we were able to offset the pressures in our healthcare benefits segment with continued strong execution in our health services segment. Revenues grew to $46.2 billion, an increase of nearly 8%. Adjusted operating income grew 3.5% to $1.9 billion. These results were driven by our pharmacy services business."" This shows that increased costs even among the most expensive medical procedures in the U.S. are continuing to drive growth, while also demonstrating the company\'s strategy.', 'Coho Partners Relative Value Equity Fund made the following comment about CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its second quarter 2023 investor\xa0letter:', '“In December of 2017,\xa0CVS Health Corporation\xa0(NYSE:CVS) agreed to buy Aetna, which broadened its offering by entering the managed care business.

We were willing to accept the leverage that came with the deal because CVS has a very cash generative model, and we anticipated the free cash flow would enable the company to de-lever fairly quickly.', 'By mid-2022, CVS was in a position to use the free cash flow that had been going to debt repayment to do bolt-on deals to further prepare for the value-based outcome model and/or return more cash to shareholders in the form of higher dividends or share repurchases. However, CVS lost a “star” in its largest Medicare plan in late 2022 and this will adversely impact earnings in 2024.

The award-winning Apple Card has seen a great reception from consumers, and we will continue to innovate and deliver the best tools and services for them."" However, the breakup seems imminent.

But, when asked about it indirectly at the Goldman Sachs US Financial Services Conference, American Express CEO Steve Squeri seemed to throw cold water on the idea. ""When we look at co-brand partnerships - and we have over 50 co-brand partnerships - you\'re really looking for one plus one equals three,"" Squeri said without naming Apple Card specifically, as reported by Payments Dive on Thursday. Squeri went on to say that there need to be ""great value propositions"" for American Express when there\'s a partnership like there would have to be for Apple Card. Reportedly, a big consideration for Amex is premium customer targeting. ""Because that\'s what you want a co-brand partnership for, is the distribution, as well,"" Squeri said.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 biggest financial scandals in U.S. history.', ""There are few things as serious as a major financial scandal, which don't just threaten the reputation and integrity of a company, but can also result in massive losses for investors. This is why the auditing industry was created, to manage oversight of companies' accounting procedures and determine whether the information being provided was correct or not. However, there is a huge gap in what the general public expects auditors to carry out and what an auditor is actually required to. For example, auditors do not check each and every transaction of a company to ensure that they're correct, but in fact, carry out sampling and test a subset of transaction. Additionally, auditors also use their own professional judgement and skepticism while performing audit procedures. However, it is important to remember that an auditor's responsibilities include assessing the risk of material misstatement of financial statements due to fraud, with the SEC assessing that around 5% of revenue globally is lost to fraud every single year, amounting to nearly $4.7 trillion globally. Not following proper procedures significantly increases the risk of fraud, which is why audit firms racked up around $50 million in fines in just one year!"", 'PTstock/Shutterstock.com', ""Some of the biggest financial scandals in U.S. history, such as the Enron accounting scandal, led to the demise of one of the biggest audit firms of the time in Arthur Anderson. But a more recent scandal which gripped the world, and especially the cryptocurrency world recently, was the demise of FTX, a fraud which resulted in the loss of billions of dollars. Normally, when serious frauds are detected, especially financial frauds, the companies end up having to close down, which is why many of the biggest bankruptcies in American history happened as a result of fraud. Of course, that doesn't mean that all bankruptcies happen due to fraud, as evidenced in the closure of three major banks earlier this year after a bank run led to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank."", 'A study on Research Gate explored the impact on public confidence especially in the wake of some of the biggest financial scandals in U.S. history. The study considered the Enron accounting scandal, and concluded ""Accounting scandals to a large extent reduces the confidence of the public in the financial reports and this confidence is so because they believe that the accountants/auditors should exercise integrity and professional skills in giving an opinion on the true and fair view of the financial statements audited; Hence, enhancing the level of public confidence in financial report rests with the auditors and directors who prepare the financial statements. This paper therefore recommends that company directors should have the interest of the stakeholders above personal interests and Professional bodies should constantly review and broaden existing professional, standards, guides and codes of ethics. The accounting and auditing professionals who are responsible for the preparation of financial statements need to adhere strictly to the codes of ethical accounting and auditing standards to produce reliable, relevant, timely, accurate, understandable and comprehensive financial statements in a true and fair view of the firm financial position and performance. This is because such financial statements and reports form the basis upon which the stakeholder should have confidence to make an informed decision."" The conclusion reemphasized the impact on public confidence being impacted negatively because of accounting scandals, and could even inform investment decisions in the future.', ""Of course, all scandals or frauds aren't financial in nature, even if involving financial services companies in the world. One of the biggest consultancy firms in the world, PwC, has faced several scandals in recent years but perhaps the biggest came in 2023, after a former partner of the firm in Australia leaked confidential government tax plans to companies, in a bid to sign them up and earn new business. One-fifth of PwC Australia's revenue was derived from governmental work, but in the wake of the disclosure of the scandal, the firm had to sell its government practice for the amount of $0.67. No, it is not in millions or billions, the total amount was exactly $0.67. Earlier in the year, PwC was embroiled in another issue after Brazilian retailer Americanas collapsed in January with $4 billion in accounting irregularities."", 'While some of the biggest financial scandals in U.S. history can have devastating consequences, bankruptcies can actually provide benefits to a company. For example, when Credit Suisse collapsed amid the aforementioned bank collapses involving Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, it was bought by rival UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS) for CHF 3 billion in the first half of 2023. Currently, UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS) has seen its share price rise by more than 20% YTD 2023, and mentioned the integration of Credit Suisse in its Q3 2023 earnings call, stating ""Lastly, we decided to fully integrate the Swiss business of Credit Suisse after a thorough strategic review.

The donation from Simons was the largest unrestricted donation to an institution of higher education in US history, per news publication Forbes. Simons, who oversees one of the largest hedge funds in the world, called it a gift for a wonderful institution.\xa0', 'Simons can afford to donate this much money to his alma mater because of his incredible success in the finance world. Before becoming a hedge fund titan worth more than $30 billion, Simons used to study and teach at Stony Brook. This was in the early 1950s and 1960s, before he left the school to start his hedge fund. In the years since, his fund has grown exponentially, becoming the envy of everyone on Wall Street. At the end of September, the value of the equity portfolio at Renaissance Technologies was over $58 billion.\xa0', ""There aren't any hedge fund managers on Wall Street with the mathematics prowess of Simons. To put this into additional context, Simons, in addition to being one of the richest men in the world, helped the development of string theory in physics through his work in pattern recognition. He has several degrees in mathematics, including a doctorate from the University of California. Simons even worked at the National Security Agency in the 1960s to break codes owning to his mathematical genius. He was also employed at famous colleges like Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University for teaching his favorite subject."", 'Simons employs mathematics in his trades as well. Renaissance Technologies uses computerized models to isolate non-random movements in equities, bonds, currencies, and other securities. Simons then makes calculated bets on the upward or downward trajectory of these cases. Gregory Zuckerman, a veteran Wall Street reporter, claims in his book The Man Who Solved the\xa0Market that Medallion, the flagship fund for the Simon hedge fund, closed to outside investors, has earned more than $100 billion for investors since it was founded. Averaging this number to 2018, when the book was released, this translates to average gross annual return of more than 66% and average net annual return of close to 40%.', 'Simons employs quant investing strategies at the stock market. Latest filings reveal that between June and September this year, the value of the equity portfolio of his fund decreased by about $10 billion. During this period, Simons made new purchases in 465 stocks, additional purchases in 1,329, sold out of 713, and reduced holdings in 1,801 stocks.

The company’s subscriber growth re-accelerated following the company’s crack down on password sharing, and the rollout of the advertising supported subscriber offering known as the Ad Tier, but the average revenue per user came in below expectations and is expected to remain muted in the near term. NFLX reiterated expectations for full year 2023 operating margins of 18-20%, and guided free cash flow to at least $5 billion, up from prior guidance of $3.5 billion. Despite the positive momentum in the company’s business, market participants took comments from management at a recent conference to mean revenue growth may be slower in the coming years than expected. This was not our interpretation of these comments.', 'In fact, the recent re-acceleration of subscriber growth, plus price increases on premium memberships and a stabilization of content investments, should position the company for low double digit annual revenue growth over the next few years while driving improved operating margin to more than 25% (revenue grew 3% for 2Q23 and operating margin was 22.3%, up from 13% in 2019).

Weighted average 2023 revenue growth expectations for the portfolio were up 3.8% during the third quarter or up 0.8% if we exclude NVIDIA. We wrote at length about NVIDIA earlier this year, but it is worth mentioning that the company has continued to exceed its own projections and the Street’s most optimistic expectations. After raising its revenue and EPS guidance for 2023 by 40% and 69%, respectively, following its last quarter, NVIDIA increased it further by 26% and 35%, respectively, after reporting the most recent one. Consensus expectations now call for revenues to grow 94% this year, while earnings per share are expected to increase by 192%. You may have seen these kinds of growth rates before, but we doubt you saw them from a company generating $50 billion in revenues. The skeptics who continue to question and doubt the accelerating demand for Generative artificial intelligence forgot to tell NVIDIA about it. But we digress…back to the portfolio…profit expectations have risen even faster than revenues and were up 11% during the third quarter (or up 7.8% ex-NVIDIA) with margin expectations up 149bps (107bps ex-NVIDIA). So, broadly speaking, our companies are seeing improvement in overall business trends, which flow through to their bottom lines, driving higher margins.

Vertex is one of the only pharmaceutical companies in the world with an effective drug for cystic fibrosis, but the market has deemed it a slow-growth company due to existing market penetration. However, the drug is enabling patients to live longer, and the drug’s patient base is growing. Also, the company is developing a more potent formulation that we believe could increase efficacy while giving Vertex an opportunity to reprice and improve margins. Finally, its cystic fibrosis franchise is very cash generative, and the company has been using the capital to invest in a pipeline that we believe includes some interesting longer term opportunities. We added to the position after a couple of positive developments this quarter. First, its competitive position strengthened when a competitor, AbbVie, announced it will discontinue all work in cystic fibrosis.

Currently, the wireless carrier offers a Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN+ bundle as a perk to myPlan customers for just $10. That’s an $8.99 savings off purchasing the bundle through Disney Plus or Hulu. If you sign up for the bundle as a Verizon customer, monthly charges for the three services will be added to your Verizon Wireless bill.', 'Now, in an unprecedented move, the carrier is also offering a streaming bundle that includes Netflix and Max (formerly HBO Max). Why is this unusual?', 'While Disney Plus, Hulu and ESPN all share the same parent company (The Walt Disney Company), Netflix and Max are completely separate entities.

Both Netflix and Max have ads in this offer, although you’ll be eligible to upgrade your Netflix subscription for an added cost.', 'On the heels of The Wall Street Journal reporting a potential partnership between Apple TV+ and Paramount+, the Netflix & Max bundle could indicate a new trend where competing services join forces under a third party to boost subscribers and retain customers.', 'However, USA Today shared that it is unclear if the Paramount+ and Apple TV+ deal will also function through an intermediary such as Verizon.', '“I think we will see companies start to experiment with the bundling of competing services and analyze the data to evaluate the impact it has on their balance sheet,” streaming media analyst Dan Rayburn told USA Today. “However, there is no guarantee that bundling will cause more users to sign up and fewer users to churn.”', 'If you don’t mind ads, it’s hard to argue with, essentially, getting Netflix free with the purchase of Max.

An ABR of 1.90 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.', 'Of the 36 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 21 are Strong Buy and one is Buy.

According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.', 'Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.', ""In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement."", ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision."", 'Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR', 'In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.', 'Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', ""It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', 'There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.', 'Is NFLX Worth Investing In?', 'Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Netflix, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $12.07.', ""Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Netflix.

In exchange for the support, Elliott seeks big changes in the company. However, a second catalyst involving favorable options dynamics may catapult sentiment. In turn, I am bullish on PSX stock.', 'At face value, Elliott Management’s interest in PSX stock may be enough to sustain optimistic sentiment toward the business. Much of the argument centers on the hedge fund’s proven success story with Phillips 66 rival Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC). In Elliott’s letter to the former enterprise, the activist emphasized its plans with Marathon in 2019, which ultimately led to improved operating performances.', 'What’s more, it’s difficult to argue with the results. Over the trailing five years, MPC shares gained nearly 146%. During the same period, PSX – inclusive of its recent rally – only moved up around 44%. What’s more, as TipRanks contributor Steve Anderson pointed out, Phillips 66 CEO Mark Lashier enjoys the support of Elliott regarding plans to turn the company around.', 'Still, as Anderson is quick to note, Elliott’s endorsement is modestly backhanded. While it’s behind the turnaround plan, the activist also expects to see “meaningful progress” in the next year. Otherwise, the hedge fund could pull support. Stated differently, the clock is on Lashier to make good. Ultimately, that’s a strong case for PSX stock.', 'Keep in mind that Marathon isn’t the only entity outperforming Phillips 66. Elliott’s letter also mentioned downstream peer Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO). Over the trailing five years, VLO gained more than 66%, less than MPC but superior to PSX stock. It’s difficult to argue against basic math, particularly when the targeted company acknowledges its shortcomings.', 'While activists sometimes light up a fire under their targeted enterprises, their involvement is also not a surefire catalyst. Research into activist investor campaigns reveals that success rates are mixed. While performance may improve in the near term, returns typically become negative after a half-year period. So, it’s quite possible that PSX stock could be responding to another catalyst: favorable options dynamics.', 'Specifically, it appears that bearish traders were caught off guard by Elliott’s stake in Phillips 66 and the subsequent rise in its shares. Looking at options flow data – which exclusively filters for big block transactions likely made by institutions – a major entity bought 695 contracts of the Jan 19 ’24 115.00 put on November 17, paying a premium of $294,540.', 'At the time of the above transaction, PSX stock traded hands at $115. At writing, shares trade at roughly $128. Even more compelling, in July, another major player sold 1,245 contracts of the Jun 21 ’24 110.00 call. That’s incredibly problematic for the call writer because this option is in the money (ITM) for countervailing call holders.', 'What’s more, the open interest for this option stands at 1,284 contracts. Thus, it’s quite possible that whoever bought these calls never sold them, waiting for the day that PSX stock would come good. That day is right now, adding to the anxieties of bearish investors.', 'If the price of PSX continues to rise, the losses that the call writer may incur in covering the position will likewise accelerate, and financially, it’s well within reason that Phillips 66 could attract new investors.', 'Despite the rising value of PSX stock, it’s still relatively underappreciated. Currently, the price/earnings (PE) ratio of PSX lands at 7.74x, 45% lower than its 10-year average. Also, the downstream component of the hydrocarbon energy value chain (that is, refining and marketing) features a PE ratio of 8.38x.', 'Looking forward, if Phillips 66 implements the actions requested – which include improving refining operations and possibly selling the company’s Speedway retail operation – the value of PSX stock may potentially skyrocket. Thus, daring investors may want to secure this deal now before it no longer offers a discount.', 'Turning to Wall Street, PSX stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on eight Buys, four Holds, and zero Sell ratings. The average PSX stock price target is $133.20, implying 4.3% upside potential.', 'With activist investor Elliott Management lighting a fire under the seat of Phillips 66, it put pressure on management to make good for stakeholders. That alone may be enough to justify a speculative position. However, it’s also quite possible that bullish options dynamics may be the true catalyst for PSX stock. Either way, circumstances look quite favorable for the optimists.', 'Disclosure']"

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Best Clothing Stocks to Buy Now.', 'The global clothing industry has had to battle many challenges in 2023. These include high inflation, greater scrutiny over manufacturing processes, the increased budgets on digital marketing, as well as shifting consumer patterns. Even though the post-pandemic bounce for the clothing world lasted for well over a year starting 2021, hyper inflation forced consumer spending to slow down dramatically thereafter. As inflation numbers stabilize and spending resumes, the clothing industry looks set for another comeback.\xa0', 'Some of the top stocks to monitor in this context include The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX), Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE). According to a report by consulting firm McKinsey, in 2021, the fashion industry, a subset of the clothing sector, delivered a 21% increase in revenues in 2021, and earnings before taxes more than doubled from around 6% to over 12%. One of the prime reasons behind these numbers were luxury brands that outperformed the broader industry.', 'Investors eager to pour their money into apparel firms should keep in mind certain industry trends that are likely to shape the clothing market in 2024. These include increased emphasis on sustainable apparel, the desire for customization and personalization, and the increase in demand for clothes as the holiday season approaches, hitting supply channels. The use of the metaverse and artificial intelligence is also an exciting development in the clothing world. Rest assured, the clothing market is set to deliver impressive growth numbers in the coming months.', 'One measure of the success of clothing firms in the past few years is the extraordinary performance of retail ETFs. In the past five years, the SPDR S&P Retail ETF has returned more than 43% to investors. It is up by close to 6% year-to-date. Similarly, the Global X Health and Wellness ETF has returned close to 20% to investors in the past five years. It is up nearly 4% year-to-date. A major factor in this stellar performance has been the shift from brick-and-mortar to online stores. The coronavirus pandemic accelerated this shift.', 'According to a report by market research firm eMarketer, global retail ecommerce sales are expected to surpass $6 trillion this year, accounting for more than a fifth of overall retail sales. Within two more years, this number will jump above $7 trillion, despite slowing growth. Companies like Amazon, which generates a huge chunk of revenue from online sales already, is already preparing for this by shutting down brick-and-mortar apparel stores that were only launched last year.', 'Another interesting trend that apparel investors should take note of is the expansion of the secondhand apparel industry. The global secondhand apparel market is likely to expand three times faster than the global apparel market in the next five years. By 2026, the secondhand apparel market will cross $218 billion in valuation, up from $141 billion in 2023. Online marketplaces are driving this growth. Research by online consignment store ThredUp reveals that 70% of consumers believe that it is now easier to shop for secondhand clothes online than it was five years ago.', 'The perspective of apparel CEOs should also be taken into account before making decisions about investments in the clothing industry. After all, running a business is never easy. Richard Hayne, the CEO of popular apparel brand Urban Outfitters, Inc. (NASDAQ:URBN), recently said during an earnings call that the apparel world was witnessing a watershed moment, much like the start of ecommerce at the turn of the century and of mobile commerce the following decade. Hayne said machine learning technology had the potential to transform retail.', '""Current advances in machine learning technology hold the promise to transform the business of retail once again. Data science and artificial intelligence have the potential to deliver much shorter product lead times, more accurate demand forecasts, better allocations, more personalized marketing, and optimized inventory planning, among many other benefits. These technologies should improve efficiency, reduce waste, and provide cost savings across a wide range of functions. Our brand teams and I are especially excited by the potential for generative AI to augment and enhance our already superb creative capabilities.

BOOT is the largest retail chain devoted to western and work-related footwear, apparel, and accessories in the U.S. They believe that they have a $40 billion addressable market, and they focus their marketing and sales effort on four customer segments: work, western, country, and fashion (the smallest segment). The majority of their sales are for work-related products, which we believe will hold up relatively well even through a downturn. With 356 stores in 41 states, they are more than three times the size of their next largest competitor (in terms of store count), and because of their scale, we believe Boot Barn can offer competitive pricing and a very broad selection with good availability for customers – so in terms of niche dominance, BOOT is the biggest player in a fragmented industry with strong and growing margins and significant brand loyalty. A notable part of our investment thesis is confidence in their ability to grow. We see a path from 356 stores (currently) to 900 stores over the next 7-10 years by growing their store count more than 10% annually – a level this team has shown the capacity to achieve over a number of years. As you may remember, we owned Tractor Supply Company (TSCO) for many years and see a lot of similarities in these businesses and their footprint/target customers. TSCO has more than 2000 stores and is one data point that suggests BOOT has a long runway for growth.', 'As you know, a company’s financial flexibility is also very important to us; BOOT has a solid balance sheet and currently has more cash than long-term debt. We believe they can fund the opening of new stores with internally-generated cash flow and project that the investment in each new store should pay back in less than two years. Over the past six months, our team has met with the CEO and the rest of the management team multiple times, and we have learned a lot about their customers, real estate, pricing and retail strategies, competition, and corporate culture. We have gained confidence that their leadership is focused on the right initiatives: 1) expanding their store base; 2) driving same store sales growth; 3) continuing their omni-channel leadership; and 4) building out their higher margin exclusive brands. They have taken their exclusive brands from 16% in 2019 to 34% of overall sales in the most recent trailing twelve months with more room for growth over time. In short, we are confident that Boot Barn is a good fit for our portfolio and has a long runway for growing shareholder value.”', '\xa0', 'Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Clothing Stocks to Buy Now.', '\xa0', 'Suggested Articles:', '11 Best Low Risk Dividend Stocks To Invest In', '15 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the World', '11 Best Pet Stocks To Buy', 'Disclose.

Investors are piling into gold and gold stocks like Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) and Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC) amid several factors, including expectations that the Fed might start cutting interest rates in 2024, a decline in real yields and weakening dollar. But the underlying factor fueling the popularity of gold remains constant: investors are buying gold amid uncertainty about the future path of economy. While the US economy was able to avoid a recession in 2023, what lies ahead is still up for debate. A latest Wall Street Journal report cited Nicky Shiels, metals strategist at MKS PAMP, who said that gold has become a “proxy” for the Federal Reserve’s rate cut expectations and “general unhappiness.”', 'Another important catalyst for gold prices is rising interest in the precious metal from central banks. Central banks around the world bought a whopping 1,100 metric tons of gold this year, which account for about 30% of the world’s mining production.', 'Perhaps one of the biggest catalysts for gold prices in 2023 was geopolitical instability, caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and tensions in the Middle East. Gold is a highly sought-after asset and investors flock to it during times of geopolitical tensions.', 'Wisdom Tree in its gold outlook report for 2024 painted a bull case for gold and said:', '“In this scenario the Federal Reserve reacts to the recession warning signs and pivots away from its higher for longer mantra. If the US central bank signals it will begin monetary expansion in 2024 by end of 2023, bond yields will be falling and assuming it moves before the European Central Bank and other major central banks, we could see the US Dollar depreciate at a faster rate. If recession does materialise, we expect inflation will fall below target levels. Assuming that the recession fears that the Fed is responding to are real, we expect positioning in gold futures to remain elevated. In this scenario, gold could reach US$2,300/oz. That would be 12% higher than the all-time nominal high reached in August 2020, and about 7% below that in real terms. However, it would be 33% below the all-time real high reached in 1980.”', 'Methodology', ""Dividends and gold is a match made in heaven for risk-averse investors.

This injection of capital is underway amidst a challenging labor market, fluctuating energy prices, and persistent endeavors to curtail carbon emissions in both the energy and industrial domains. The U.S. manufacturing industry, constituting a substantial segment of the overall U.S. materials sector, leveraged the momentum generated by the aforementioned pieces of legislation. This resulted in a nearly twofold increase in investments for semiconductor and clean technology manufacturing compared to the commitments made in 2021, and an allocation nearly 20 times greater than the amount designated in 2019.

The potential advantages of smart factories are extensive, encompassing improvements in asset efficiency, labor productivity, and product quality, leading to substantial cost reductions.

For example, the governance factor’s role is to enhance the transparency of accounting practices and internal controls, subsequently providing investors with a better understanding of an entity’s true worth.

Lastly, the environmental factor dials in on efficient resource utilization and renewable energy implementation.', 'I can elaborate on the above if you want me to.

This group includes platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, osmium, and ruthenium. Also, these elements are not typically found in distinct ores, but rather, they are recovered as by-products from the processing of primary minerals such as iron, copper, nickel, and cobalt. Consequently, the average annual production of platinum is less than that of gold, reflecting its rarity in the earth's crust (0.005 parts per million). This scarcity contributes to platinum's high value, with its current price per gram being $28.85."", 'In 2022, the global platinum market saw a consumption of approximately\xa06,518.3 koz. Key mines contributing to the worldwide platinum output include Mogalakwena Mine, Marikana Mine, Impala Mine, and Union Mine. By the end of 2023, there are projections of a shortfall in platinum production, primarily due to ongoing deficits in the palladium supply. This anticipated scarcity is expected to be influenced by factors such as the high cost of palladium and its substitution with platinum, especially in the automotive industry for catalytic converters.', 'Must Read:\xa0Top 20 Diamond Producing Countries in the World', 'Platinum is used in vehicle catalytic converters, often in conjunction with palladium and, at times, rhodium. Within a catalytic converter, platinum expedites chemical reactions without undergoing consumption itself. As exhaust gases from an engine pass through the catalytic converter, platinum enables a series of chemical transformations. These reactions minimize harmful pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and unburned hydrocarbons, transforming them into less detrimental substances, namely nitrogen (N2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and water vapor (H2O). Given its pivotal function in the automotive industry, approximately 61% of platinum group metals (PGMs) are allocated for use in this sector.', 'Additionally, platinum is a favorite in the jewelry industry, constituting roughly 30% of its market utilization. Platinum group metals also find application in various other domains, including computer hard disks, laboratory equipment, thermocouples, and electroluminescent diodes, among others.', ""Furthermore, the increasing preference for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has expanded platinum's presence in the investment sector.

To skip the detailed analysis of the energy industry and its outlook, go directly to Billionaires Are Betting On These 5 Energy Stocks.', 'The energy sector has been going through significant volatility over the past few years. While governments around the globe are enacting policies and regulations to promote the transition toward renewable energy, fossil fuels still play a crucial role in the global economy, and it is a formidable challenge to replace them quickly.', 'One of the biggest issues the markets faced last year was the economic disasters caused by disruptions in energy supply chains due to geopolitical tensions. The global economy suffered heavily due to the rising prices of oil and gas after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The US was hit by a 40-year high inflation and subsequent drastic rate hikes by the Federal Reserve to tackle it.', 'Moving on to 2023, oil and gas prices remained relatively low throughout the year. However, recent events such as the Hamas-Israel conflict coupled with production cuts from OPEC and Russia led to an increase in oil prices in the third quarter. The Middle East conflict created fears that the per-barrel oil prices might even touch as high as $150, and with interest rates already high, it could lead to an even more devastating impact on the global economy. Even though the conflict is still ongoing, the oil and gas prices have not gone much higher.', 'While the world is moving to transition completely to renewable energy, some challenges remain to consider. One of the biggest problems is the high cost of renewable energy infrastructure. The high-interest rate environment is one of the factors that is slowing down renewable investments. Furthermore, technological challenges coupled with the deep integration of fossil fuels in several economies around the globe are some hurdles that need to be taken care of.', 'Renewable energy investments hit a record high in 2023. In the first half of the current year, renewable energy investments went up 22% to $358 billion. Despite that, the energy sector as a whole did not perform well throughout the year. The third quarter gave the fossil fuels industry a little breather, but the segment still seems to be struggling.\xa0', 'Two-thirds of all renewable investments in the H1 were directed toward solar energy, yet it was the worst-performing industry, according to our November 1 report.

In addition, the agency believes that the prices will average around $3.40 this winter and will reach their peak in January 2024 at $3.60 per MMBtu.', 'According to a Deloitte report, the utility-scale solar capacity increased more than any other generation source between January and August 2023, and the additions were up 9% year-over-year (YoY). In 2022, renewables accounted for two-thirds of utility-scale power generation additions but accounted for half of the total new capacity additions in 2023, as wind additions were down 57% YoY.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) is making moves in the industry and announced adding 39 new renewable energy projects in Europe in 2023 alone.', 'While the energy industry has shown a lot of volatility in recent years, the sector has also proven to be a money-maker for its investors.

With market sentiments fluctuating, there's a growing recognition of the significance of having cash readily available. Dividend investments address this need by providing a source of regular income. However, dividend investing is not solely about immediate earnings, it also presents the potential for growth over time. Companies that consistently grow dividends often demonstrate financial strength and stability, reflecting their ability to generate profits consistently. For this reason, analysts advise investors to focus on dividend aristocrats, which are companies that have raised their payouts for 25 consecutive years or more. According to a report by Fortune, despite trailing its benchmark, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index has outperformed almost every US active manager in the last decade. Rupert Watts, head of factors and dividend indices at S&P Dow Jones Indices, spoke with the global media organization about dividend growers. Here is what the analyst said:"", '“Raising your dividend for 25 plus years is no easy feat. These are high-quality companies.”', ""Throughout history, dividends have been a crucial component of investors' overall returns, particularly in times when market returns remained below ten percent for extended durations. In the long run, dividends have substantially contributed to the returns received by investors. Looking back over the last five decades, approximately 72% of the total return of the S&P 500 Index has been credited to reinvested dividends and the remarkable effect of compounding, according to a report by RBC Wealth Management. The report further mentioned that firms that consistently increase their dividends or begin paying dividends altogether have typically offered higher overall returns with lower volatility compared to companies that either kept their dividends steady or reduced them."", ""While dividend stocks might be trailing the overall market performance in 2023, it's essential to note that they have outperformed the broader market during specific periods throughout history, as reported by ProShares.

Its resilience shines through notably during market downturns, evident from its standout performance in 2022 when it surpassed the broader S&P 500 by a substantial 12%. Remarkably, this index has outperformed the S&P 500 in eight out of the ten worst quarterly market downturns since 2005.

To be sure, no guarantees exist in the market; otherwise, everyone would pour money into the guaranteed space. However, over the long run, the healthcare sector may be as close to a sure thing as you can get.', 'Primarily, healthcare stocks inherently carry a defensive posture. Many other sectors face volatility as the major indices print red ink due to fading discretionary spending directly impacting underlying businesses. However, healthcare providers and specialists represent a “permanent” necessity. Basically, when you get sick or injured, you’ve got to do whatever it takes to get better. It’s a cynical argument but it works.', 'Also, demographic trends may help healthcare stocks. According to the Population Reference Bureau, in 2016, baby boomers hit the ages of between 52 and 70. As this demographic continues to get older, their personal care needs will likely increase. Therefore, whatever red ink may be impacting this sector now may turn black soon enough.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'On that note, below are top healthcare hidden-gem stocks to add to your portfolio.', 'Source: Supavadee butradee / Shutterstock.com', 'A healthcare communications specialist, Spok (NASDAQ:SPOK) provides a secure platform to automate clinical workflows for various activities. These include patient alerts, clinician consults, code calls, and test results. It’s not the most well-known enterprise, featuring a market capitalization of about $344 million. Nevertheless, SPOK has more than doubled since the beginning of this year and is one of the top hidden-gem stocks to consider.', 'So, what’s behind this incredible performance? Generally, Spok tends to either meet or exceed analysts’ expectations for earnings. In its last disclosure for the third quarter, the company posted earnings per share of 22 cents. However, analysts were looking for an EPS of 18 cents. Also, revenue landed at $35.43 million, noticeably above the consensus view of $33.7 million.', 'Also, in Q2, Spok saw a 90% increase in software bookings, representing a stunning print. While it’s not the most consistently profitable company, it features strong trailing-year margins. Right now, Spok carries a massive forward dividend yield of 7.28% (albeit with a high payout ratio of almost 123%).', 'As long as Spok maintains momentum, this could be one of the top healthcare hidden-gem stocks available.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com', 'Based in Saint Paul, Minnesota, Patterson Companies (NASDAQ:PDCO) is another one of the top hidden-gem stocks that provides products, technologies, services, and business solutions to oral and animal health customers in North America and the U.K. With fears of COVID-19 dropping sharply, more people are returning to the dentists’ offices. Also, with the employment market stabilizing (for now), workers are likely to take advantage of their health plans.', 'In theory, these dynamics should help boost demand for Patterson. Oh yeah, Americans love their four-legged family members, spending a total of nearly $137 billion on them last year. So, PDCO enjoys a massive total addressable market, making it one of the most attractive healthcare stocks to buy. Sure enough, PDCO posted a modest double-digit return since the beginning of this year.', 'Financially, Patterson also benefits by being out of the spotlight, thus offering a deal to investors. Presently, shares trade at 12.35x forward earnings, below the sector median of 15.65x. Enticingly, the company also offers a forward yield of 3.31% with a payout ratio of only 38.86%.', 'Source: Roman Zaiets / Shutterstock.com', 'Headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, Premier (NASDAQ:PINC) primarily represents a group purchasing entity. Per its website, Premier was among the first companies to translate the purchasing power of a healthcare alliance into significant cost savings. In addition, the enterprise offers a performance improvement technology and analytics platform along with a consultancy service, among other relevancies.', 'While Premier offers a pertinent business, Wall Street has a difficult time trusting PNC. Since the start of the year, the company suffered a heavy loss of equity value. What hasn’t helped the cause is earnings performance. While Premier generally meets or exceeds EPS estimates, it has disappointed with revenue in recent quarters. Most notably, in fiscal Q3 2023, Premier posted sales of $322.23 million against a consensus view of $350.53 million.', 'Still, a patient approach could be key to this troubled but compelling example among healthcare stocks. Specifically, its consistently profitable while trading at a lowly 9.07x forward earnings. Additionally, Premier offers a forward yield of 4.06% and a payout ratio of only 39.61%.', 'Source: Giovanni Nastukov / Shutterstock.com', 'While I may be talking about Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE) a bit too much, I can’t help myself. From a fundamental point of view, KVUE easily symbolizes one of the top healthcare stocks. Spun off from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Kevnue focuses on the consumer and personal care product segment. In my opinion, that’s valuable real estate heading into an unknown economic future.', 'Frankly, during difficult circumstances, it might not be possible for many patients to afford the latest and greatest in pharmaceutical and medical technologies. However, everyone can (reasonably) afford bottles of Tylenol for various aches and pains. And since these nuisances always pop up, Kenvue should theoretically benefit from a predictable revenue stream.', 'Moreover, with KVUE suffering a steep loss since its first public trading session, it may be ripe for a comeback rally. In the meantime, investors can enjoy the company’s generous forward yield of 3.97%. Yes, its payout ratio is elevated at 62.47% but it’s not anything truly out of the ordinary. In my opinion, it’s worth a shot.', 'Source: Susan Montgomery / Shutterstock.com', 'One of the riskiest ideas among top healthcare stocks, CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) may be worth a look for astute speculators; that is, gamblers who don’t mind taking calculated risks in fundamentally relevant enterprises. To be sure, the pharmacy retailer faces disruption from the usual suspects like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). However, the company is also well aware of the challenges and has been responding in kind.', 'For me, it’s difficult to see CVS being disrupted. Yeah, certain segments of the business may face some headwinds. But when you combine the holistic advantages of CVS – infrastructure, convenience and brand awareness and trust, among other attributes – the bear case could arguably be overblown. Still, you do want to acknowledge the heavy loss on a 52-week basis.', 'At the same time, shares appear to have stabilized since mid-May. Also, the market prices CVS at a discount, only 8.22x forward earnings compared to the sector average of 12.88x. Significantly, the company offers a forward yield of 3.49% along with a very sustainable payout ratio of 28.43%.', 'Source: Microgen / Shutterstock', 'Hailing from Houston, Texas, US Physical Therapy (NYSE:USPH) bills itself as one of the largest publicly traded pure-play operators of outpatient physical and occupational therapy clinics. While not the most talked-about space among healthcare stocks, it’s crucially important to overall wellness. According to Grand View Research, the U.S. physical therapy services market reached a value of $44.8 billion last year.', 'What’s more, experts project that by 2030, the sector will print revenue of $58.6 billion. That comes out to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.56% from 2023. Now, even though it’s up modestly for the year and is down quite sharply during the trailing half-year period, USPH features a premium multiple. That might not be the greatest news ever.', 'However, the company is consistently profitable. In turn, it offers a forward yield of 2.01%. At first glance, that might not seem like much. Nevertheless, Wall Street analysts peg USPH a unanimous strong buy. Also, their average price target lands at a lofty $110.', 'Source: THICHA SATAPITANON / Shutterstock', 'Based in Pennsylvania, Select Medical (NYSE:SEM) is a leader in poste-acute recovery and rehabilitation. Per its website, Select Medical is one of the largest providers of critical illness recovery hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, outpatient rehabilitation centers and occupational health clinics in the U.S. Also, the company commands an army of 54,000 healthcare professionals to help restore patients’ quality of life.', 'That said, the Street is looking for something to kick SEM into a higher gear. Since the beginning of the year, shares are down modestly on a year-to-date and trailing-52-week basis. Still, it’s possible that the market is being too harsh on Select. In the three quarters this year, the company handily analysts’ EPS estimates. And that applies to the revenue front as well, although with less bravado.', 'Another compelling factor to keep in mind is that unlike US Physical Therapy above, Select is undervalued against traditional metrics. For example, SEM trades at only 9.55x forward earnings, below the sector median of 23.78x.', 'Finally, analysts also rate SEM a unanimous strong buy with a $32.67 average price target.', 'On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\xa0The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com\xa0Publishing Guidelines.', 'A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$865.8m', 'US$903.4m', 'US$929.0m', 'US$951.9m', 'US$974.7m', 'US$997.5m', 'US$1.02b', 'US$1.04b', 'US$1.07b', 'US$1.09b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x8', 'Analyst x4', 'Analyst x1', 'Est @ 2.47%', 'Est @ 2.39%', 'Est @ 2.34%', 'Est @ 2.31%', 'Est @ 2.28%', 'Est @ 2.26%', 'Est @ 2.25%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.4% ', 'US$799', 'US$769', 'US$730', 'US$690', 'US$652', 'US$615', 'US$581', 'US$548', 'US$517', 'US$488', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$6.4b', ""The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage.

Given that we are looking at Masco as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.234. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

This group includes platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, osmium, and ruthenium. Also, these elements are not typically found in distinct ores, but rather, they are recovered as by-products from the processing of primary minerals such as iron, copper, nickel, and cobalt. Consequently, the average annual production of platinum is less than that of gold, reflecting its rarity in the earth's crust (0.005 parts per million). This scarcity contributes to platinum's high value, with its current price per gram being $28.85."", 'In 2022, the global platinum market saw a consumption of approximately\xa06,518.3 koz. Key mines contributing to the worldwide platinum output include Mogalakwena Mine, Marikana Mine, Impala Mine, and Union Mine. By the end of 2023, there are projections of a shortfall in platinum production, primarily due to ongoing deficits in the palladium supply. This anticipated scarcity is expected to be influenced by factors such as the high cost of palladium and its substitution with platinum, especially in the automotive industry for catalytic converters.', 'Must Read:\xa0Top 20 Diamond Producing Countries in the World', 'Platinum is used in vehicle catalytic converters, often in conjunction with palladium and, at times, rhodium. Within a catalytic converter, platinum expedites chemical reactions without undergoing consumption itself. As exhaust gases from an engine pass through the catalytic converter, platinum enables a series of chemical transformations. These reactions minimize harmful pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and unburned hydrocarbons, transforming them into less detrimental substances, namely nitrogen (N2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and water vapor (H2O). Given its pivotal function in the automotive industry, approximately 61% of platinum group metals (PGMs) are allocated for use in this sector.', 'Additionally, platinum is a favorite in the jewelry industry, constituting roughly 30% of its market utilization. Platinum group metals also find application in various other domains, including computer hard disks, laboratory equipment, thermocouples, and electroluminescent diodes, among others.', ""Furthermore, the increasing preference for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has expanded platinum's presence in the investment sector. Its recyclability further underscores its value, with a prominent quantity being reclaimed from used automotive catalysts, in addition to smaller amounts obtained from old jewelry and electronics."", 'Also Read:\xa020 Countries With the Largest Copper Reserves in the World', 'The\xa0largest platinum-producing mine\xa0is the Bushveld Complex in South Africa, which is a vast mineral-rich area.

These Russian mines have a high palladium-to-platinum ratio, unlike South African mines where platinum predominates. Similarly, the Stillwater mine in the United States, located in Montana, is another source known for its high-grade deposits and the production of palladium and platinum. Collectively, these mines shape the global platinum market, influencing prices and the availability of PGMs (Platinum Group Metals)."", 'Speaking of the United States, in the financial year 2022, a company based in Montana produced precious metals known as PGMs, valued at approximately\xa0$880 million.

In\xa02023, the world faces a significant deficit in platinum supply, attributed to a shortage of palladium, another platinum group metal. This shortage is exacerbated by various global factors, including operational difficulties in key platinum-producing countries such as South Africa, where issues like power outages and labor disputes have disrupted mining operations."", 'In Colombia, the mining industry, which includes platinum and other metals, stands at a critical juncture. The country is in the process of transitioning towards renewable energy sources, moving away from its traditional reliance on fossil fuels. This transition requires the establishment of clear and stable government policies and investment conditions to support exploration and development within the mining sector. While specific platinum mines or projects are limited, the sector encompasses a copper project with an annual output of\xa010,000\xa0metric tons, in addition to other projects in various exploratory stages.', 'Average Annual Platinum Production: 1432 kilograms\xa0', ""Similar to other\xa0top platinum-producing countries, Finland's platinum output primarily results from the mining of other metals. A good example is the Hautalampi Nickel-Cobalt-Copper Project, situated in the renowned Outokumpu Mining camp area, approximately 345 kilometers from Helsinki. This project is a collaborative effort between FinnCobalt and Eurobattery Minerals. Eurobattery Minerals initially acquired a\xa040%\xa0interest in FinnCobalt in July 2022 and subsequently expanded its stake to 70% in March 2023.

According to experts, generative AI will become more targeted. Systems like ChatGPT, Google’s Bard, and Microsoft’s Copilot — previously called Bing Chat — are general purpose platforms. They’re basically designed to answer everyone’s questions. But they’re not experts in individual fields.', 'In the coming year, companies will begin releasing models that are tailored to specific tasks, rather than those meant for broad uses.', 'The idea is to make generative AI less of a jack of all trades and more a master of one. Add to that the continued proliferation of more generalized AI models, and 2024 is shaping up to be another year dominated by AI.', 'While generative AI was the talk of 2023, there are still huge swaths of the world who haven’t used the technology.

Even though things seem positive now, investor sentiment can change suddenly because of things like global tensions, economic news, or unexpected events. Ned Davis Research pointed out that in 2024, the focus will be on the Federal Reserve and its Chair, Jerome Powell. Powell's goal is to guide the economy smoothly, aiming for a soft landing. According to NDR, they estimate a 70% likelihood of Powell achieving this objective. Here is what the investment management services said in its 2024 outlook note:"", '""Lower inflation should allow the Fed to cut rates and the 10-year Treasury to fall toward 3.5%.

In addition to this, historical analysis consistently highlights the outperformance of dividend stocks compared to various other asset classes across different market cycles. According to a report by T. Rowe Price, growing dividends have the potential to enhance investment gains and counteract the effects of inflation by offering a continuously growing source of income. The report further mentioned that between the late 1980s and the end of 2022, companies within the Russell 1000 Index that consistently increased their dividends performed better than the overall index. Not only did they deliver higher returns, but they also showed less fluctuation or instability in their performance.', ""Despite experiencing lower performance in 2023 compared to some other investments, analysts maintain a positive outlook on dividend stocks, particularly those companies that consistently raise their dividend payouts. When a company consistently pays dividends over the long haul, it typically indicates that the company is making strides in the right direction and prioritizing the creation of value for its shareholders. According to Wolfe Research, stocks from these companies have typically shown better performance both before and after economic downturns like recessions. Chris Senyek, Wolfe Research's chief investment strategist, mentioned to Barron’s that he favors dividend aristocrats as his top dividend strategy.

You can skip our detailed analysis on trends in the aerospace industry and head over directly to the 5 Most Expensive Fighter Jets in the World.', 'Fighter jets play a significant role for militaries in securing control over enemy airspace. These jets have evolved considerably from their earliest versions that were seen during World War II, to what we see now.', 'The first version of fighter jets, also known as the first-generation fighter jets, were recognizable for their straight and unswept wings, and their aircraft did not use avionics for communication and navigation. The Me 262, built by German manufacturer Messerschmitt, was the world’s first operational fighter jet introduced in 1944. Other prominent fighter jets during the era included Lockheed F-80, Gloster Meteor, and Heinkel He 162.', 'The second-generation of fighter jets catered to the need for more innovation, which resulted in jets being equipped with homing missiles and radars to improve the accuracy and managing aerodynamics, which was previously hard because of high speeds at which these jets traveled. The third-generation jets came to be known for their multi-purpose roles. Not only were they able to carry weapons, but also engage in aerial interceptions, and deploy missiles and bombs.', 'A major shift in technology and avionics came with the advent of fourth-generation aircraft that equipped fighter jets with infrared capabilities, maneuverability, fly-by-wire, and synthetic radars. These jets were a major advancement in stealth and aerodynamics. The most notable fighter jet of this era was the General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)’s F-16 Fighting Falcon.', 'Fifth-generation fighters are the most advanced fighter jets currently in operation, and include using major technologies that were developed during the 21st century, such as stealth, supercruise performance, and low-probability-of-intercept radars. These features made it hard for enemy radars to detect these jets. Examples of fifth-generation fighter jets include Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II, Chengdu J-20 built by China’s Chengdu Aerospace Corporation, and Sukhoi Su-57 used by the Russian Air Force.', 'Fighter jets are among the most expensive and potent military technologies that countries across the world are deploying to strengthen their defense. Considering how much each aircraft costs, it is very likely that a big chunk of all defense expenditure of $2.24 trillion in 2022 was incurred on procurement of fighter jets. For instance, Finland’s military spending rose 36% between 2021 and 2022, and the increase was mainly attributed to the arms procurement, especially Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-35 fighter jets, which made up nearly one-thirds of its defense expenditure that year according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).', 'Several Middle Eastern countries have racked up their defenses in recent decades and continue to spend heavily on advanced fighter jets. The UAE, which received 80 F-16 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) as part of a $6.4 billion deal signed in 2000, has now placed an order for 80 Dassault Rafale F4 multirole jets from France worth $19 billion, which is the largest order ever placed for the French fighter jet.', 'In 2011, the United States and Saudi Arabia signed a $30 billion deal to provide 84 F-15SA aircraft produced by The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA). The Royal Saudi Air Force received the final delivery of these fighter jets in December 2020. At the time of signing the contract, it was reported on CNN that the program would support 50,000 to 60,000 jobs across the US with more than 600 suppliers across 44 states being involved in making the aircraft for Riyadh.', 'The United States Air Force (USAF) launched a highly classified Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program in 2014 aimed at increasing the lethality of its fighter jets and to maintain aerial superiority. The program plans on launching a sixth-generation fighter jet by 2030 to succeed Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-22 Raptor. The NGAD is estimated to cost $16 billion over the next five years between 2023 and 2028. Approximately $1.7 billion were included by the USAF in their 2023 fiscal year budget request. Their ask for FY24 is $2.3 billion.', 'In August 2022, five companies were awarded a $975 million contract each spanning ten years to work on the NGAD. These included Lockheed Martin, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), Pratt & Whitney, and General Electric.', 'Given the ongoing research and development on the future of fighter jets in the US, it is safe to say that America is likely to continue to rule the globe in this area of military power for the foreseeable future. The United States has the most number of fighter jets in the world with 1,914, followed by China at a distant second with 1,199. Russia holds the third spot with 773 fighters.\xa0', 'The 15 most expensive fighter jets in the world are ranked in ascending order of their estimated prices. Data has been sourced from a variety of credible sources, including AeroTime, Flight Global, Shephard Media, and The Diplomat, among other news agencies.', 'Let’s now head over to the list of the most expensive fighter jets in the world.', 'Price: $29-42 million', 'India’s light multirole fighter jet, Tejas, was built by the Aeronautical Development Agency to replace the MiG-21 fighters. It is one of the lightest aircraft in its class of supersonic fighters. There are currently three variants of it, starting from $29 million, with the latest and most advanced version called Mk1A being priced at $42 million, as per reports in the Indian media.\xa0', 'Price: $40-45 million', 'Sukhoi Su-57 is Russia’s first stealth fighter jet that has been designed to rival its American counterparts, F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II. It is currently the most advanced aircraft in the Russian Air Force’s fleet. The unit cost of the fighter jet has not been made public by Russia, but it is expected to be between $40-45 million, according to a report in The Diplomat magazine. In 2018, Yuri Borisov, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister then, said in an interview that Moscow does not plan on mass-producing the Su-57 until Russia’s older fighter jets lag behind their western equivalents.', 'Price: $63 million', 'Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-16 Block 70/72 is among the most advanced fighter jets from the fourth-generation class. Cheaper variants of this light and maneuverable jet can cost as low as $30 million, according to AeroTime, but the advanced versions are costlier. The Block 70/72 is the most up-to-date iteration of this fighter, and has an estimated price of $63 million per unit. This version comes with superior avionics capabilities, and includes an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar and a modernized cockpit along with several other new features.', 'Price: $65 million', 'South Korea’s defense sector, in 2022, received a significant boost after the successful first flight of its indigenous KF-21 Boramae fighter jet. Manufacturers claim the advanced multirole fighter jet is stealthier than any other fourth-generation fighter jet. The KF-21 Boramae is Seoul’s second locally produced fighter jet after the FA-50. The Korean military is set to receive 40 of these jets by 2028, with each set to cost about $65 million.', 'Price: $67-70 million', 'The F/A-18E and F/A-18F Super Hornet, developed by The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), are variants of the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet series. These supersonic, twin-engine fighter jets are equipped with M61A2 rotary cannon and can carry a variety of weapons, including the air-to-air-missiles and surface-to-air-missiles. In addition to the United States Air Force, other primary users of The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet are Australia and Kuwait. AeroTime estimates the per unit cost of these jets to be $66.9 million, while TS2 Space quoted it at $70.5 million.', 'Price: $70 million', 'The Shenyang FC-31 is China’s prototype multirole fighter jet designed to serve the same purpose as western fifth-generation fighter jets, and can be used for various missions like ground attack, reconnaissance, and air security. According to defense experts, Shenyang FC-31 is likely to be used as an aircraft carrier based naval fighter jet. Its price is estimated to be $70 million, as per AeroTime.\xa0', 'Price: $85 million', 'The JAS 39 Gripen was known to be among the cheapest 4 or 4.5 generation fighter jets with its C and D variants. That has now changed with the launch of its E and F versions. These upgraded single-engine, supersonic fighter jets manufactured by Swedish defense company Saab AB are now one of the most expensive fighter jets in the world after improved radars, avionics, and its advanced weapon systems. While prices may vary based on specifications, an average Saab JAS 39E/F Gripen can cost about $85 million per unit according to AeroTime, which is still significantly lower than Lockheed Martin’s F-35 and F-22 fighter jets.', 'Price: $85 million', 'The Sukhoi Su-35 is a highly advanced Russian multirole fighter jet, which is a significant evolution of the Su-27 after incorporating several improved features in avionics, maneuverability, radar systems, and weapon capabilities. The Russian Air Force has 110 of these jets in its inventory. The aircraft has also had immense export success, and continues to do so. In 2019, China received 24 Su-35 fighter jets from Russia for $2.5 billion. The Diplomat estimated the price per unit to be $85 million.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 countries with free health care.', ""The U.S. is one of the only advanced countries in the world to not have free healthcare, which is said to cost the country trillions of dollars. According to Public Citizen, if Medicare for All is not implemented, the Federal government will end up spending $42.9 trillion on healthcare in just the next decade alone. The primary reason behind this is that health insurance is generally tied to a person's employment in the U.S., because of which attempts to make healthcare free have failed consistently. The individual healthcare market in the U.S. is worth an astonishing $1.68 trillion. On the other hand, Europe is home to the most countries with free healthcare."", 'The healthcare industry is one of the most valuable and important sectors in the world, not just in terms of direct value but also in the indirect value it generates by improving the standard of living in a country. In fact, it was because of healthcare advancements that the world was able to emerge so quickly from the Covid-19 pandemic. At the same time, the pandemic has revolutionized the healthcare industry which is changing rapidly, especially in terms of new technology and innovation.', 'A healthcare professional discussing a treatment plan with a patient in an outpatient clinic.', ""According to Deloitte, one of the ways that the healthcare industry is changing is virtual health delivery. One way that the pandemic has changed lives on every level is through increased remote interaction, initially out of necessity and then out of efficiency and cost-effectiveness. While this doesn't mean that in-person care is being replaced, it will provide new methods of care delivery, and will allow for a reach far greater than what has been possible before, especially in remote areas where there are barely any doctors or healthcare facilities available. The first step in this is electronic health records, followed by using many different digital and tech innovations including machine learning and cloud computing to cut costs and alleviate the shortage of physicians, even in countries with free healthcare as population needs outweigh the number of healthcare staff available in many such countries, including in the UK, whose National Health Service is currently in a crisis due to lack of staff and low payment."", 'Most of the most profitable pharmaceutical companies in the world\xa0have started to incorporate digital and tech solutions in the products and services they provide. This was mentioned by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in its Q2 2023 earnings call, where it mentioned the pivot to tech solutions stating ""This was a strong quarter for Johnson & Johnson with market-leading performance, important advances across our innovative pharmaceutical and medtech pipelines, and a successful initial public offering of Kenvue. We delivered solid sales and earnings growth for the second quarter of 2023, reporting operational sales of 7.5% and adjusted operational EPS growth of 9.7%. These strong results contributed to our confidence in raising our expectations for this year. You may have seen this morning the announcement that we intend to split of Kenvue shares through an exchange offer as the next step in the separation of Kenvue. Joe will provide additional information later in the call. We are excited about entering a new era for Johnson & Johnson, one built around science, innovation, and technology, and strategically focused on pharmaceutical medtech while maintaining our position as the world\'s largest, most diversified healthcare products company with 25 platforms over $1 billion in annual sales. And on today\'s call, I would like to share recent highlights and achievements from across the business that have contributed to our year-to-date results, as well as upcoming catalysts that give me great confidence in our near and long-term future performance. Starting with medtech. For the second quarter of 2023, we generated 14.7% operational and 9.9% adjusted operational growth, which excludes the impact of the Abiomed acquisition. On a pro forma basis, using sales publicly reported by Abiomed prior to our acquisition, medtech grew 10.2%. These strong results continue to show that our efforts to improve the growth of the medtech business are working.""', ""While Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has mentioned how well medtech has performed, traditional portfolios haven't been performing as well, which has led to a decline of nearly 12% in share price YTD. Even then, it is important to remember, especially in uncertain times right now, that the healthcare sector has historically demonstrated resilience even when the economy has been stagnant or declining, as evidenced in 2022 when the MSCI World Index declined by 18.1%, while the MSCI World Health Care Index only declined by 5.4% in the same time period. In the last 7 recession, on average, the healthcare industry has outperformed the overall broader market by 10%, while also delivering above-average earnings growth in similar times."", 'While major pharmaceutical companies are undoubtedly behind the progress in healthcare available to the world right now, they often also rightly face criticism on medicines being priced too highly for the average person to be able to afford them. While pharma companies do have programs where they provide medicine for free in impoverished countries, medication prices are a huge concern in the U.S., where price caps are not imposed by the government. On one hand, this is beneficial to the development of healthcare as higher prices result in higher revenue and profit, which then allows greater investment into R&D which in turn results in innovation, often times, patients have to bear the brunt of this and costly medicine can even result in people having to forego them in the worst cases.', ""Having realized this, some prominent personalities and companies are stepping in to make medicine cheaper for the average person. Mark Cuban, a billionaire entrepreneur, started Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drugs Company (MCCPDC), which sell medicine for the lowest possible prices to make sure every American has access to the medicines they need. The company is said to have revolutionized the healthcare space in the country and currently has a customer base of more than 1.5 million people, and is looking to engage in manufacturing generic drugs too, possible paving the way for even lower costs. In fact, pharmaceutical companies are even taking a leaf out of MCCPDC by applying similar pricing, while other companies such as Cosette Pharmaceuticals are even partnering with the company to make medicine more affordable."", 'Similarly, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), the largest retailer in the world, has slowly started making its presence felt in various industries, and has similarly established itself in the pharmacy sector, by launching Amazon Pharmacy in 2020. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) aims to make drugs more affordable to the general population and in August 2023, announced that manufacture-sponsored coupons would now automatically be applied to 15 diabetes and insulin medication, which will greatly reduce costs. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) called out progress in this space in its Q3 2023 earnings call, stating ""The Amazon Pharmacy customer experience has significantly evolved this year, and customers are responding that both in their purchasing behavior and qualitative feedback. We built RxPass for customers to get unlimited supply of eligible medications for $5 per month, meaningfully reduce the cost for customers to get insulin and diabetes products, and partnered with Blue Shield of California to offer a first-of-its-kind model to provide more affordable pharmacy care to its 4.8 million members, providing fast and free delivery of prescription medications and 24/7 access to pharmacists. We remain convinced that we can be part of the solution of making healthcare a better customer experience. And our low Earth orbit satellite initiative Project Kuiper, which aims to bring fast, affordable broadband to underserved communities around the world, took a meaningful step forward in the last few weeks with the successful launch of two prototype satellites.""', 'At the same time, biotech is also where the future of the healthcare industry is moving towards, both in countries with free healthcare and in countries where healthcare is private. One of the largest drug companies in the world, GSK plc (NYSE:GSK) spun off its consumer healthcare business in 2022 and rebranded itself as a biotech company. Keeping in line with trends in the pharma industry, GSK plc (NYSE:GSK) has also placed increased focus on tech which it mentioned in its Q2 2023 earnings call, stating ""For me, this really means two bits, first, doubling down on leveraging our scientific capabilities with the use of new platform and data technology; and second, developing our partnering and external sourcing capabilities.\xa0With AI and machine learning applications now rapidly maturing access to proprietary data to feed models and generate novel insights as a key strategic differentiator. For example, we recently presented data needs better reversal from the B-Clear Phase IIb trial.

I want us to vigorously scale and build on these foundations to better derisk targets and rapidly test and progress high-quality first-in-class candidates, all with the aim of accelerating and improving success rates of our department progress."" GSK plc (NYSE:GSK) has seen its share price increase by over 4% YTD 2023, illustrating the trend of biotech stocks outperforming other stocks in the healthcare sector, with biotech stocks returning 10.3% in 2022, as opposed to 3.2% for pharmaceutical companies, 2.6% for healthcare providers and -25.1% for medical devices & supplies companies.', 'Methodology', 'At this point in time, universal healthcare is available in dozens of countries, though even among the countries with free healthcare, Brazil probably has the best plan, where all surgeries, treatments and medications are provided for regardless of whether a person there is a resident or a non-resident.

Jeremy Siegel in his book “Stocks for the Long Run” wrote a chapter titled “Building Wealth Through Stocks.” In this chapter the Professor of Finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia shares some data showing how difficult it is to say with confidence that the money manager you are trusting with your savings actually knows their job.', '“Even if money managers choose stocks that have an expected return of 1 percent per year better than the market, there is only a 62.7 percent probability that they will exceed the average market return after 10 years and only a 71.2 percent probability that they will exceed the average market return after 30 years. If managers pick stocks that will outperform the market by 2 percent per year, there is still only a 74.0 percent chance that they will outperform the market after 10 years. This means there is a 1-in-4 chance that they will still fall short of the average market performance.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the top 5 most valuable American companies today.', 'When the U.S. sneezes, the world catches a cold. This one saying illustrates the importance of the U.S. economy to the world, the country with the highest GDP in the world not just in 2022 but for at least a century now. Over the past decade, the U.S. economy has seen performance levels that will be impossible for even it to replicate in the future, and its higher government spending and tax cuts have helped cash flow through global markets in addition to domestic markets. One example of U.S. influence on the global economy can be seen in the 2008 recession, which started off in the U.S., but its impact reverberated across the world as the U.S. was driving global growth rates, led by the most valuable American companies today.', 'A financial trader monitoring stock charts and indicators on a high tech computer setup.', 'Currently, the U.S., like most countries, has struggled to contain record inflation, which in turn have led to consistent hikes in interest rates by the Federal Reserve and has seen its economic growth slow down. Towards the end of 2022, fears of a recession in the U.S. were continuing to increase, even as U.S. stock markets saw their worst first half in nearly half a century. Most stocks, with a particular focus on tech, were absolutely devastated and the NASDAQ-100, where most of the top tech stocks including many of the most valuable American companies today are listed, finished with a full-year loss of 32.4% while the S&P 500 recorded a loss of 18.1%.\xa0 However, a more positive than expected landing delayed fears of a recession, and now, expectations of a recession in 2024 are abating further, with an expected growth rate of 1.5% for 2024, after a spectacular landing in Q3 2023.', ""Even as the warnings of a recession continued to ramp up, the U.S. delivered growth of nearly 5% in Q3 2023, with an increase in wages from a tight labor market contributing to increased consumer spending and hence, an uplift in the country's economy. On the other hand, there is still some cause for concern as business investment declined for the first time in two years, and while the performance in Q3 was extraordinary, growth in Q4 is still expected to slow down as student loan payments resume, strikes from the United Auto Workers take place and the delayed impact of rate hikes affects performance. According to a Morgan Stanley report in August 2023, consumer spending declining in 2024 is a major risk for the country as current household savings are estimated to be a mere $350 billion, and student loans and credit-card balances could result in household savings running out in Q1 2024. Additionally, the U.S. Treasury is likely to issue around $1 trillion in debt in 2023 which would make the financial system of the U.S. more illiquid and the Bank of Japan allowing the country's interest rates to increase could also see more investment being diverted to the Asian giant."", ""One of the primary drivers behind the economic dominance of the U.S. is its innovation, which is why it is the most advanced country in the world. This is also why tech stocks are generally among the most valuable American companies today, and further innovations will continue to help in advancing America's economy. One such example is the country's advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is perhaps the hottest industry in the world right now. Some of the most valuable companies in America today have invested heavily in AI, and we'll discuss their investments and approaches to AI in more detail when mentioning which companies make our list."", 'Similarly, tech stocks have dominated U.S. stock performance in 2023, and rebounded strongly from the disastrous performance in 2022. The total return of the Nasdaq composite in 2023 has been 22.51% YTD, and many top tech stocks have seen their share price more than double in these 10 months! However, what goes up, must come down and in the past few days, Nasdaq has taken a beating after some tech stocks underperformed expectations in Q3 2023 and suffered heavy losses. However, towards the end of the week starting 23rd October, Nasdaq did see its performance increase thanks to confidence boosting performances from some of the most valuable American companies today.', 'Methodology', ""To determine the most valuable American companies today, we headed over to Yahoo Finance and first determined the 100 most valuable American companies today, which were then sorted by their market cap.

It can tell you what they value—whether holding that top spot matters to them, or if other parts of their work—or personal lives—are more important. For instance, Sarah Jones Simmer, a former Bumble exec who became the CEO of the weight-loss startup Found, told me that she realized becoming a CEO was important to her after she was diagnosed with cancer. Alicia Boler Davis, a former Amazon exec who's now CEO of prescription delivery startup Alto Pharmacy, says she realized that a Fortune 500 CEO job wasn't for her.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend aristocrats and the performance of dividend growers in the past, and go directly to read Dividend Aristocrats List: Top 10 Among Billionaires.\xa0', ""Investing in dividend stocks offers a distinct opportunity for investors seeking consistent income. With market sentiments fluctuating, there's a growing recognition of the significance of having cash readily available. Dividend investments address this need by providing a source of regular income. However, dividend investing is not solely about immediate earnings, it also presents the potential for growth over time. Companies that consistently grow dividends often demonstrate financial strength and stability, reflecting their ability to generate profits consistently. For this reason, analysts advise investors to focus on dividend aristocrats, which are companies that have raised their payouts for 25 consecutive years or more. According to a report by Fortune, despite trailing its benchmark, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index has outperformed almost every US active manager in the last decade. Rupert Watts, head of factors and dividend indices at S&P Dow Jones Indices, spoke with the global media organization about dividend growers. Here is what the analyst said:"", '“Raising your dividend for 25 plus years is no easy feat. These are high-quality companies.”', ""Throughout history, dividends have been a crucial component of investors' overall returns, particularly in times when market returns remained below ten percent for extended durations. In the long run, dividends have substantially contributed to the returns received by investors. Looking back over the last five decades, approximately 72% of the total return of the S&P 500 Index has been credited to reinvested dividends and the remarkable effect of compounding, according to a report by RBC Wealth Management. The report further mentioned that firms that consistently increase their dividends or begin paying dividends altogether have typically offered higher overall returns with lower volatility compared to companies that either kept their dividends steady or reduced them."", ""While dividend stocks might be trailing the overall market performance in 2023, it's essential to note that they have outperformed the broader market during specific periods throughout history, as reported by ProShares. With an upside-downside capture of 91% and 80%, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index has proven its strength in both upward and downward market movements. Its resilience shines through notably during market downturns, evident from its standout performance in 2022 when it surpassed the broader S&P 500 by a substantial 12%. Remarkably, this index has outperformed the S&P 500 in eight out of the ten worst quarterly market downturns since 2005. The report further mentioned by steadily increasing their dividends, dividend aristocrats have shown higher yield-on-cost than companies with initially higher dividend yields, even though their starting yields might be lower."", 'The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Medtronic, it has a TSR of -23% for the last 3 years.

The center already has a big name customer on the docket here."", 'Well, Republic Services CEO John Vander Ark is here to tell us more. Thank you so much for joining us this morning, John.

It's not going to go in the landfill, but at the end of the life of that product, it's going to end up in a landfill. And what the Polymer Center really unlocks is for us to get to true circularity, so turning that detergent bottle back into the detergent bottle, or the water bottle, or the beverage bottle back into the beverage bottle.

And then that can go right into the bottlers or the other manufacturers, right back into food grade product."", ""No one has ever done this before in the United States, and it's a big investment. We're going to spend $75 million in Las Vegas and $300 million across the country in these four centers to get this product where it needs.

For instance, among the stocks in the S&P 500, those paying dividends in 2022 decreased by 11.1%, whereas the ones that didn't pay dividends experienced a larger loss of 38.7%.

To begin with, dividends have been a crucial factor in total market returns over the last 50 years. Looking back to 1960, approximately 69% of the overall return of the S&P 500 Index can be traced back to dividends that were reinvested, harnessing the strength of compounding. As mentioned above, dividend growers are more popular among investors because of their ability to provide regular and growing cash. According to a report by Hartford Funds, companies that either started paying dividends or increased their dividends have seen the most substantial returns compared to other stocks since 1973. Importantly, these stocks have shown considerably less fluctuation and volatility in their performance. The report highlighted that dividend growers and initiators delivered a 10.24% return from 1973 to 2022, compared with a 3.95% return for non-dividend payers."", ""Analysts often view inflationary periods as a crucial test of stocks' ability to maintain stability in their performance. During times of inflation, the value of money decreases, leading to rising prices for goods and services. In such periods, stocks that can sustain their performance despite these economic challenges are considered more stable. Fortunately, dividend stocks have demonstrated robust performance in past periods marked by inflation. The S&P U.S. Dividend Growers Index and S&P Global ex-U.S. Dividend Growers Index include companies that have raised dividends for 10 and 7 years respectively.

In the U.S., the overall five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with lung cancer is 26.2%, which is a 22% improvement over the last five years. Improved survival rates are due, in part, to advances in diagnostic and surgical procedures, as well as the introduction of new therapies. However, screening, early detection and improving treatment rates remain an important unmet need, as 44% of lung cancer cases are not found until they are advanced. Only 4.5% of people in the U.S. who are eligible were screened for lung cancer in 2022.', 'About Merck’s research in lung cancer', 'Merck is advancing research aimed at transforming the way lung cancer is treated, with a goal of improving outcomes for patients affected by this deadly disease.

MGPI is a leading supplier of premium distilled spirits and specialty wheat starches and proteins in the U.S. MGPI operates through three distinct segments, each of which has attractive opportunities for growth. Through its distilling solutions segment, MGPI is a leading supplier of distilled spirits, facilitating the creation of bourbons, rye whiskeys, American single malt whiskey, distilled gins and vodkas. U.S. spirits have gained significant share of total beverage alcohol over the last decade on a revenue basis, and American whiskey volumes, in particular, have experienced strong growth, driven in part by the growth of craft brands. In our opinion, these trends in consumption habits tend to be generational, which suggests that this recent demand strength is sustainable. MGPI maintains a large inventory of distilled spirits of various ages, which is used to produce its own branded spirits and sold to both multinational and craft producers of branded spirits. The time and capital required to age new distillate is significant, and that capital is often better used in marketing new brands, and MGPI is in a unique position to serve this market. As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, the vast majority of MGPI’s new distillate capacity was contracted for both this year and next as well as the majority of its aged distillate for this year.', 'In addition to its distillation capabilities, MGPI also develops its own branded spirits, and the branded spirits segment provides a platform for both organic and acquisitive growth opportunities. Building individual spirits brands can be challenging, in part due to the three-tier distribution system in the U.S., which requires individual brands to comply with various state laws and state-licensed distributors. In 2021, MGPI acquired Luxco, Inc., which significantly expanded its portfolio of branded spirits and brought with it distribution capabilities across all 50 states. Since acquiring Luxco, MGPI has continued to expand its distilling capacity and increase sales of its premium, super premium and ultra premium brands, which generate higher gross margins than other portfolio brands. In June of 2023, MGPI announced the acquisition of Penelope Bourbon, adding a popular, growing bourbon brand to the portfolio. This transaction is the first tangible example of how we believe management will leverage its national distribution platform and existing distillation capacity to bring other brands into the fold.

You can skip our detailed analysis on trends in the aerospace industry and head over directly to the 5 Most Expensive Fighter Jets in the World.', 'Fighter jets play a significant role for militaries in securing control over enemy airspace. These jets have evolved considerably from their earliest versions that were seen during World War II, to what we see now.', 'The first version of fighter jets, also known as the first-generation fighter jets, were recognizable for their straight and unswept wings, and their aircraft did not use avionics for communication and navigation. The Me 262, built by German manufacturer Messerschmitt, was the world’s first operational fighter jet introduced in 1944. Other prominent fighter jets during the era included Lockheed F-80, Gloster Meteor, and Heinkel He 162.', 'The second-generation of fighter jets catered to the need for more innovation, which resulted in jets being equipped with homing missiles and radars to improve the accuracy and managing aerodynamics, which was previously hard because of high speeds at which these jets traveled. The third-generation jets came to be known for their multi-purpose roles. Not only were they able to carry weapons, but also engage in aerial interceptions, and deploy missiles and bombs.', 'A major shift in technology and avionics came with the advent of fourth-generation aircraft that equipped fighter jets with infrared capabilities, maneuverability, fly-by-wire, and synthetic radars. These jets were a major advancement in stealth and aerodynamics. The most notable fighter jet of this era was the General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)’s F-16 Fighting Falcon.', 'Fifth-generation fighters are the most advanced fighter jets currently in operation, and include using major technologies that were developed during the 21st century, such as stealth, supercruise performance, and low-probability-of-intercept radars. These features made it hard for enemy radars to detect these jets. Examples of fifth-generation fighter jets include Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II, Chengdu J-20 built by China’s Chengdu Aerospace Corporation, and Sukhoi Su-57 used by the Russian Air Force.', 'Fighter jets are among the most expensive and potent military technologies that countries across the world are deploying to strengthen their defense. Considering how much each aircraft costs, it is very likely that a big chunk of all defense expenditure of $2.24 trillion in 2022 was incurred on procurement of fighter jets. For instance, Finland’s military spending rose 36% between 2021 and 2022, and the increase was mainly attributed to the arms procurement, especially Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-35 fighter jets, which made up nearly one-thirds of its defense expenditure that year according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).', 'Several Middle Eastern countries have racked up their defenses in recent decades and continue to spend heavily on advanced fighter jets. The UAE, which received 80 F-16 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) as part of a $6.4 billion deal signed in 2000, has now placed an order for 80 Dassault Rafale F4 multirole jets from France worth $19 billion, which is the largest order ever placed for the French fighter jet.', 'In 2011, the United States and Saudi Arabia signed a $30 billion deal to provide 84 F-15SA aircraft produced by The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA). The Royal Saudi Air Force received the final delivery of these fighter jets in December 2020. At the time of signing the contract, it was reported on CNN that the program would support 50,000 to 60,000 jobs across the US with more than 600 suppliers across 44 states being involved in making the aircraft for Riyadh.', 'The United States Air Force (USAF) launched a highly classified Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program in 2014 aimed at increasing the lethality of its fighter jets and to maintain aerial superiority. The program plans on launching a sixth-generation fighter jet by 2030 to succeed Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-22 Raptor. The NGAD is estimated to cost $16 billion over the next five years between 2023 and 2028. Approximately $1.7 billion were included by the USAF in their 2023 fiscal year budget request. Their ask for FY24 is $2.3 billion.', 'In August 2022, five companies were awarded a $975 million contract each spanning ten years to work on the NGAD. These included Lockheed Martin, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), Pratt & Whitney, and General Electric.', 'Given the ongoing research and development on the future of fighter jets in the US, it is safe to say that America is likely to continue to rule the globe in this area of military power for the foreseeable future. The United States has the most number of fighter jets in the world with 1,914, followed by China at a distant second with 1,199. Russia holds the third spot with 773 fighters.\xa0', 'The 15 most expensive fighter jets in the world are ranked in ascending order of their estimated prices. Data has been sourced from a variety of credible sources, including AeroTime, Flight Global, Shephard Media, and The Diplomat, among other news agencies.', 'Let’s now head over to the list of the most expensive fighter jets in the world.', 'Price: $29-42 million', 'India’s light multirole fighter jet, Tejas, was built by the Aeronautical Development Agency to replace the MiG-21 fighters. It is one of the lightest aircraft in its class of supersonic fighters. There are currently three variants of it, starting from $29 million, with the latest and most advanced version called Mk1A being priced at $42 million, as per reports in the Indian media.\xa0', 'Price: $40-45 million', 'Sukhoi Su-57 is Russia’s first stealth fighter jet that has been designed to rival its American counterparts, F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II. It is currently the most advanced aircraft in the Russian Air Force’s fleet. The unit cost of the fighter jet has not been made public by Russia, but it is expected to be between $40-45 million, according to a report in The Diplomat magazine. In 2018, Yuri Borisov, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister then, said in an interview that Moscow does not plan on mass-producing the Su-57 until Russia’s older fighter jets lag behind their western equivalents.', 'Price: $63 million', 'Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)’s F-16 Block 70/72 is among the most advanced fighter jets from the fourth-generation class. Cheaper variants of this light and maneuverable jet can cost as low as $30 million, according to AeroTime, but the advanced versions are costlier. The Block 70/72 is the most up-to-date iteration of this fighter, and has an estimated price of $63 million per unit. This version comes with superior avionics capabilities, and includes an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar and a modernized cockpit along with several other new features.', 'Price: $65 million', 'South Korea’s defense sector, in 2022, received a significant boost after the successful first flight of its indigenous KF-21 Boramae fighter jet. Manufacturers claim the advanced multirole fighter jet is stealthier than any other fourth-generation fighter jet. The KF-21 Boramae is Seoul’s second locally produced fighter jet after the FA-50. The Korean military is set to receive 40 of these jets by 2028, with each set to cost about $65 million.', 'Price: $67-70 million', 'The F/A-18E and F/A-18F Super Hornet, developed by The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), are variants of the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet series. These supersonic, twin-engine fighter jets are equipped with M61A2 rotary cannon and can carry a variety of weapons, including the air-to-air-missiles and surface-to-air-missiles. In addition to the United States Air Force, other primary users of The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet are Australia and Kuwait. AeroTime estimates the per unit cost of these jets to be $66.9 million, while TS2 Space quoted it at $70.5 million.', 'Price: $70 million', 'The Shenyang FC-31 is China’s prototype multirole fighter jet designed to serve the same purpose as western fifth-generation fighter jets, and can be used for various missions like ground attack, reconnaissance, and air security. According to defense experts, Shenyang FC-31 is likely to be used as an aircraft carrier based naval fighter jet. Its price is estimated to be $70 million, as per AeroTime.\xa0', 'Price: $85 million', 'The JAS 39 Gripen was known to be among the cheapest 4 or 4.5 generation fighter jets with its C and D variants. That has now changed with the launch of its E and F versions. These upgraded single-engine, supersonic fighter jets manufactured by Swedish defense company Saab AB are now one of the most expensive fighter jets in the world after improved radars, avionics, and its advanced weapon systems. While prices may vary based on specifications, an average Saab JAS 39E/F Gripen can cost about $85 million per unit according to AeroTime, which is still significantly lower than Lockheed Martin’s F-35 and F-22 fighter jets.', 'Price: $85 million', 'The Sukhoi Su-35 is a highly advanced Russian multirole fighter jet, which is a significant evolution of the Su-27 after incorporating several improved features in avionics, maneuverability, radar systems, and weapon capabilities. The Russian Air Force has 110 of these jets in its inventory. The aircraft has also had immense export success, and continues to do so. In 2019, China received 24 Su-35 fighter jets from Russia for $2.5 billion. The Diplomat estimated the price per unit to be $85 million. Last month, the Voice of America (VOA) reported that Iran had also finalized a deal to procure these fighters from Russia. The number of units and monetary aspects of the contract were not disclosed.\xa0', 'Price: $100 million', 'Turkish stealth, twin-engine air superiority fighter jet, TAI KAAN, is being developed by the Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) to replace its fleet of General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)’s F-16 Fighting Falcon. The first ground running tests of the prototype of this combat aircraft were held in March this year.

It’s also worth pointing out that the enterprise enjoys solid margins, leading to consistent annual net income. As a bonus, analysts peg OTEX as a strong buy with a $46.60 average price target. Thus, it’s also one of the tech stocks for growth.', 'Source: madamF / Shutterstock.com', 'A semiconductor company, Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) specializes in chips for use in mobile communication systems and radio frequency (RF). While the focus may be narrower than other tech stocks to buy for growth and passive income, the RF sector commands exceptional relevance. According to Grand View Research, the global RF components market size reached a value of $30.68 billion last year.', 'Even better, experts project that by 2030, this segment will hit a valuation of $88.12 billion. That comes out to a CAGR of 14.2% from 2023. It’s also wroth mentioning that at time of writing, Skyworks features a market capitalization of $15.2 billion. Therefore, the company enjoys a large total addressable market. And we haven’t even talked about the mobile communications sector.', 'Per Gurufocus, Skyworks offers a forward yield of 2.86%.

Nevertheless, it could make a case for tech stocks to buy for growth and passive income.', 'While the company doesn’t post impressive long-term sales stats, its acquisitive nature should boost its industry presence. It’s also consistently profitable (for the most part) and features a lowly forward earnings multiple of 8.62x.

Looking back in the past five years, shares have only gained a bit over 31%.', 'Now, compare that to the tech-centric Nasdaq Composite index, which moved up almost 95% during the same period. Stated differently, you could have passively bought a basket of the Nasdaq and done much better than IBM. However, this narrative of the hapless legacy tech giant could be shifting. In the trailing six months, IBM stock gained over 20% of equity value.', 'With that, it makes a case for tech stocks to buy for growth and passive income.

This makes the dividend yield 1.8%, which is above the industry average.', ' View our latest analysis for TE Connectivity ', ""If the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. However, prior to this announcement, TE Connectivity's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow."", 'The next year is set to see EPS grow by 52.9%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 27%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.', ""Even over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.84 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.36. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 11% a year over that time. We can see that payments have shown some very nice upward momentum without faltering, which provides some reassurance that future payments will also be reliable."", ""Investors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. In the last five years, TE Connectivity's earnings per share has shrunk at approximately 3.7% per annum. Declining earnings will inevitably lead to the company paying a lower dividend in line with lower profits. Earnings are forecast to grow over the next 12 months and if that happens we could still be a little bit cautious until it becomes a pattern."", ""In summary, it's great to see that the company can raise the dividend and keep it in a sustainable range. With shrinking earnings, the company may see some issues maintaining the dividend even though they look pretty sustainable for now. The payment isn't stellar, but it could make a decent addition to a dividend portfolio."", 'Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

Similarly, the Global X Health and Wellness ETF has returned close to 20% to investors in the past five years. It is up nearly 4% year-to-date.

(NYSE:BOOT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:', '“We added Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:BOOT) to the Small Cap portfolio in the second quarter. BOOT is the largest retail chain devoted to western and work-related footwear, apparel, and accessories in the U.S. They believe that they have a $40 billion addressable market, and they focus their marketing and sales effort on four customer segments: work, western, country, and fashion (the smallest segment). The majority of their sales are for work-related products, which we believe will hold up relatively well even through a downturn. With 356 stores in 41 states, they are more than three times the size of their next largest competitor (in terms of store count), and because of their scale, we believe Boot Barn can offer competitive pricing and a very broad selection with good availability for customers – so in terms of niche dominance, BOOT is the biggest player in a fragmented industry with strong and growing margins and significant brand loyalty. A notable part of our investment thesis is confidence in their ability to grow. We see a path from 356 stores (currently) to 900 stores over the next 7-10 years by growing their store count more than 10% annually – a level this team has shown the capacity to achieve over a number of years. As you may remember, we owned Tractor Supply Company (TSCO) for many years and see a lot of similarities in these businesses and their footprint/target customers. TSCO has more than 2000 stores and is one data point that suggests BOOT has a long runway for growth.', 'As you know, a company’s financial flexibility is also very important to us; BOOT has a solid balance sheet and currently has more cash than long-term debt. We believe they can fund the opening of new stores with internally-generated cash flow and project that the investment in each new store should pay back in less than two years. Over the past six months, our team has met with the CEO and the rest of the management team multiple times, and we have learned a lot about their customers, real estate, pricing and retail strategies, competition, and corporate culture. We have gained confidence that their leadership is focused on the right initiatives: 1) expanding their store base; 2) driving same store sales growth; 3) continuing their omni-channel leadership; and 4) building out their higher margin exclusive brands. They have taken their exclusive brands from 16% in 2019 to 34% of overall sales in the most recent trailing twelve months with more room for growth over time. In short, we are confident that Boot Barn is a good fit for our portfolio and has a long runway for growing shareholder value.”', '\xa0', 'Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Clothing Stocks to Buy Now.', '\xa0', 'Suggested Articles:', '11 Best Low Risk Dividend Stocks To Invest In', '15 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the World', '11 Best Pet Stocks To Buy', 'Disclose.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Best Clothing Stocks to Buy Now.', 'The global clothing industry has had to battle many challenges in 2023. These include high inflation, greater scrutiny over manufacturing processes, the increased budgets on digital marketing, as well as shifting consumer patterns. Even though the post-pandemic bounce for the clothing world lasted for well over a year starting 2021, hyper inflation forced consumer spending to slow down dramatically thereafter. As inflation numbers stabilize and spending resumes, the clothing industry looks set for another comeback.\xa0', 'Some of the top stocks to monitor in this context include The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX), Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE). According to a report by consulting firm McKinsey, in 2021, the fashion industry, a subset of the clothing sector, delivered a 21% increase in revenues in 2021, and earnings before taxes more than doubled from around 6% to over 12%. One of the prime reasons behind these numbers were luxury brands that outperformed the broader industry.', 'Investors eager to pour their money into apparel firms should keep in mind certain industry trends that are likely to shape the clothing market in 2024. These include increased emphasis on sustainable apparel, the desire for customization and personalization, and the increase in demand for clothes as the holiday season approaches, hitting supply channels. The use of the metaverse and artificial intelligence is also an exciting development in the clothing world. Rest assured, the clothing market is set to deliver impressive growth numbers in the coming months.', 'One measure of the success of clothing firms in the past few years is the extraordinary performance of retail ETFs. In the past five years, the SPDR S&P Retail ETF has returned more than 43% to investors. It is up by close to 6% year-to-date. Similarly, the Global X Health and Wellness ETF has returned close to 20% to investors in the past five years. It is up nearly 4% year-to-date. A major factor in this stellar performance has been the shift from brick-and-mortar to online stores. The coronavirus pandemic accelerated this shift.', 'According to a report by market research firm eMarketer, global retail ecommerce sales are expected to surpass $6 trillion this year, accounting for more than a fifth of overall retail sales. Within two more years, this number will jump above $7 trillion, despite slowing growth. Companies like Amazon, which generates a huge chunk of revenue from online sales already, is already preparing for this by shutting down brick-and-mortar apparel stores that were only launched last year.', 'Another interesting trend that apparel investors should take note of is the expansion of the secondhand apparel industry. The global secondhand apparel market is likely to expand three times faster than the global apparel market in the next five years. By 2026, the secondhand apparel market will cross $218 billion in valuation, up from $141 billion in 2023. Online marketplaces are driving this growth. Research by online consignment store ThredUp reveals that 70% of consumers believe that it is now easier to shop for secondhand clothes online than it was five years ago.', 'The perspective of apparel CEOs should also be taken into account before making decisions about investments in the clothing industry. After all, running a business is never easy. Richard Hayne, the CEO of popular apparel brand Urban Outfitters, Inc. (NASDAQ:URBN), recently said during an earnings call that the apparel world was witnessing a watershed moment, much like the start of ecommerce at the turn of the century and of mobile commerce the following decade. Hayne said machine learning technology had the potential to transform retail.', '""Current advances in machine learning technology hold the promise to transform the business of retail once again. Data science and artificial intelligence have the potential to deliver much shorter product lead times, more accurate demand forecasts, better allocations, more personalized marketing, and optimized inventory planning, among many other benefits. These technologies should improve efficiency, reduce waste, and provide cost savings across a wide range of functions.

BOOT is the largest retail chain devoted to western and work-related footwear, apparel, and accessories in the U.S. They believe that they have a $40 billion addressable market, and they focus their marketing and sales effort on four customer segments: work, western, country, and fashion (the smallest segment). The majority of their sales are for work-related products, which we believe will hold up relatively well even through a downturn. With 356 stores in 41 states, they are more than three times the size of their next largest competitor (in terms of store count), and because of their scale, we believe Boot Barn can offer competitive pricing and a very broad selection with good availability for customers – so in terms of niche dominance, BOOT is the biggest player in a fragmented industry with strong and growing margins and significant brand loyalty. A notable part of our investment thesis is confidence in their ability to grow. We see a path from 356 stores (currently) to 900 stores over the next 7-10 years by growing their store count more than 10% annually – a level this team has shown the capacity to achieve over a number of years. As you may remember, we owned Tractor Supply Company (TSCO) for many years and see a lot of similarities in these businesses and their footprint/target customers. TSCO has more than 2000 stores and is one data point that suggests BOOT has a long runway for growth.', 'As you know, a company’s financial flexibility is also very important to us; BOOT has a solid balance sheet and currently has more cash than long-term debt. We believe they can fund the opening of new stores with internally-generated cash flow and project that the investment in each new store should pay back in less than two years. Over the past six months, our team has met with the CEO and the rest of the management team multiple times, and we have learned a lot about their customers, real estate, pricing and retail strategies, competition, and corporate culture. We have gained confidence that their leadership is focused on the right initiatives: 1) expanding their store base; 2) driving same store sales growth; 3) continuing their omni-channel leadership; and 4) building out their higher margin exclusive brands. They have taken their exclusive brands from 16% in 2019 to 34% of overall sales in the most recent trailing twelve months with more room for growth over time. In short, we are confident that Boot Barn is a good fit for our portfolio and has a long runway for growing shareholder value.”', '\xa0', 'Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Clothing Stocks to Buy Now.', '\xa0', 'Suggested Articles:', '11 Best Low Risk Dividend Stocks To Invest In', '15 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the World', '11 Best Pet Stocks To Buy', 'Disclose.

This time, though, I think they've got an argument,” Warner said. “I think that you've got the circumstance where interest rates are at a recent high, the idea of additional capital requirements and additional buffer beyond what's already in place will mean there'll be less capital available for lending.”"", 'Warner’s comments come after the chief executives of the nation’s eight largest banks — including JPMorgan (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Wells Fargo (WFC) — testified before the Senate Banking Committee Wednesday, repeatedly saying in unison that the Fed’s proposed capital requirements will hurt consumers, first-time homebuyers, and the economy — and that changes need to be made to the proposed rules.', '“If you have the same capital requirements increased by 20% to do the exact same activities you did yesterday, you have to get a higher return and that higher return will be borne by the customer base,” Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan told lawmakers.', '“We hope the federal agencies will be open to changes and will review the industry’s comments thoughtfully,” added Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO James Gorman during his testimony.', ""Last summer, the Fed proposed raising banks' capital requirements by 16% and widening the scope of new requirements to institutions with as little as $100 billion in assets — an effort to include smaller banks like Silicon Valley Bank, which failed in March."", 'The proposal known as the Basel III endgame has been prescribed by the financial crisis-era Dodd-Frank Act for a decade now to put the world on equal footing.

Warmer states plainly: “they’ve got an argument.""

I asked him whether he shares executives' concerns that the Fed's proposed capital requirements could hurt lending and consumers. He told me the banks have an argument this time and he's been told by regulators a lot of revisions are coming to that plan. Take a listen."", ""MARK WARNER: My friends in the banking industry, whenever there's a new regulation or rule, they always say the sky is falling. The sky didn't fall. This time though, I think they've got an argument."", ""I think that you've got the circumstance where interest rates are rather recent high. The idea of additional capital requirements and additional buffer beyond what's already in place will mean there will be less capital available for lending. And when you've got even civil rights organizations saying this is not the right time, and I've been told by the regulators that they have a lot of revisions, so I'm going to be anxious to see how this plays out. But I do think they have some concerns that ought to be heard out."", ""At the same time, though, I get a little frustrated with them at times because there are other tools that could deal with issues like liquidity. If we go back to the very beginnings of the Federal Reserve, when it was first created, there was what's called the discount window where if you've got a bank that's got a liquidity issue, you would go to that discount window. As a matter of fact, two of the major failures this year, SVB and Signature didn't even know how to use that tool."", ""So one of the things I've been exploring is-- I know banks are reluctant to use it because it comes with a stigma, but you can't complain about other regulations if they don't use existing tools. So could we have a requirement that on some level of random basis, so that there was this-- you had to demonstrate that you knew how to use the window? And can I work with the banking community, so that they can use that window in a way that doesn't create a stigma, doesn't hurt their stock price, but also is frankly a tool on liquidity that was set up in the first place?"", ""JENNIFER SCHONBERGER: If regulators don't make changes up to your liking, that you still feel like it's going to impede the economy, credit availability, the consumer, what is the prospect if that rule does pass close to its current form that you could enact the Congressional Review Act to stop implementation? And would you support that?"", 'MARK WARNER: I know that a whole lot of my Republican friends already are making that threat. I felt like it was, like, kind of, yin and yang at the hearing. You had some people saying, you know, these banks have created every problem in capitalism.', ""You've got the other group saying the regulators have created all these problems. I'm not frankly in either camp. I'm going to reserve judgment until I see what this final rule looks like, how many revisions are made, and then we can have that conversation.""]"

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 biggest financial scandals in U.S. history.', ""There are few things as serious as a major financial scandal, which don't just threaten the reputation and integrity of a company, but can also result in massive losses for investors. This is why the auditing industry was created, to manage oversight of companies' accounting procedures and determine whether the information being provided was correct or not. However, there is a huge gap in what the general public expects auditors to carry out and what an auditor is actually required to. For example, auditors do not check each and every transaction of a company to ensure that they're correct, but in fact, carry out sampling and test a subset of transaction. Additionally, auditors also use their own professional judgement and skepticism while performing audit procedures. However, it is important to remember that an auditor's responsibilities include assessing the risk of material misstatement of financial statements due to fraud, with the SEC assessing that around 5% of revenue globally is lost to fraud every single year, amounting to nearly $4.7 trillion globally. Not following proper procedures significantly increases the risk of fraud, which is why audit firms racked up around $50 million in fines in just one year!"", 'PTstock/Shutterstock.com', ""Some of the biggest financial scandals in U.S. history, such as the Enron accounting scandal, led to the demise of one of the biggest audit firms of the time in Arthur Anderson. But a more recent scandal which gripped the world, and especially the cryptocurrency world recently, was the demise of FTX, a fraud which resulted in the loss of billions of dollars. Normally, when serious frauds are detected, especially financial frauds, the companies end up having to close down, which is why many of the biggest bankruptcies in American history happened as a result of fraud. Of course, that doesn't mean that all bankruptcies happen due to fraud, as evidenced in the closure of three major banks earlier this year after a bank run led to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank."", 'A study on Research Gate explored the impact on public confidence especially in the wake of some of the biggest financial scandals in U.S. history. The study considered the Enron accounting scandal, and concluded ""Accounting scandals to a large extent reduces the confidence of the public in the financial reports and this confidence is so because they believe that the accountants/auditors should exercise integrity and professional skills in giving an opinion on the true and fair view of the financial statements audited; Hence, enhancing the level of public confidence in financial report rests with the auditors and directors who prepare the financial statements. This paper therefore recommends that company directors should have the interest of the stakeholders above personal interests and Professional bodies should constantly review and broaden existing professional, standards, guides and codes of ethics. The accounting and auditing professionals who are responsible for the preparation of financial statements need to adhere strictly to the codes of ethical accounting and auditing standards to produce reliable, relevant, timely, accurate, understandable and comprehensive financial statements in a true and fair view of the firm financial position and performance. This is because such financial statements and reports form the basis upon which the stakeholder should have confidence to make an informed decision."" The conclusion reemphasized the impact on public confidence being impacted negatively because of accounting scandals, and could even inform investment decisions in the future.', ""Of course, all scandals or frauds aren't financial in nature, even if involving financial services companies in the world. One of the biggest consultancy firms in the world, PwC, has faced several scandals in recent years but perhaps the biggest came in 2023, after a former partner of the firm in Australia leaked confidential government tax plans to companies, in a bid to sign them up and earn new business. One-fifth of PwC Australia's revenue was derived from governmental work, but in the wake of the disclosure of the scandal, the firm had to sell its government practice for the amount of $0.67. No, it is not in millions or billions, the total amount was exactly $0.67. Earlier in the year, PwC was embroiled in another issue after Brazilian retailer Americanas collapsed in January with $4 billion in accounting irregularities."", 'While some of the biggest financial scandals in U.S. history can have devastating consequences, bankruptcies can actually provide benefits to a company. For example, when Credit Suisse collapsed amid the aforementioned bank collapses involving Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, it was bought by rival UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS) for CHF 3 billion in the first half of 2023. Currently, UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS) has seen its share price rise by more than 20% YTD 2023, and mentioned the integration of Credit Suisse in its Q3 2023 earnings call, stating ""Lastly, we decided to fully integrate the Swiss business of Credit Suisse after a thorough strategic review. The thing I’m proudest about is that clients have rewarded our unwavering commitment with extended trust. Thanks to their restore belief in the combined firm, we were able to swiftly stabilize the current Swiss score, its Wealth, Asset Management and Swiss Bank franchises. We are happy to see markets recognizing our ongoing work. Our strategy is unchanged and the Credit Suisse acquisition will act as an accelerant to our plans.""', 'Bronte Amalthea Fund made the following comment about UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS) in its first quarter 2023 investor\xa0letter:', '“The biggest thing that happened in markets in the quarter was the collapse of three banks:—Credit Suisse, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.

We initiated positions in UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS), which has purchased Credit Suisse under advantageous terms, and First Citizens Bank, which purchased much of Silicon Valley Bank on even more advantageous terms.', 'We will go through each of these banks in turn as they are (a) interesting in their own right and (b) have resulted in some changes in our portfolio.', 'Swiss banks were sharply weakened by the end of banking secrecy.

(NYSE:PFE) today announced the European Commission (EC) has granted conditional marketing authorization for ELREXFIO® (elranatamab). ELREFXIO is a targeted immunotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who have received at least three prior therapies, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 antibody and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. ELREXFIO is an off-the-shelf (ready-to-use) B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-CD3-directed bispecific antibody (BsAb) immunotherapy that induces deep and durable responses, with a manageable tolerability profile as well as convenient subcutaneous dosing.', '""More than 50,000 Europeans are diagnosed with multiple myeloma each year, and too often, they face relapse and treatment resistance,"" said Chris Boshoff, Chief Oncology Research and Development Officer and Executive Vice President, Pfizer. ""Today\'s approval provides a new, broadly available option for people with hard-to-treat multiple myeloma, and we continue to explore the use of ELREXFIO in earlier lines of treatment so that more people may ultimately benefit from this therapy.""', 'The conditional marketing authorization for ELREXFIO is valid in all 27 EU member states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. This authorization follows the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommendation for a conditional marketing authorization on October 12, 2023.', 'Authorization was based on data from cohort A of the Phase 2 MagnetisMM-3 study (NCT04649359) showing meaningful responses among heavily pretreated RRMM patients – at least three prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody – who received ELREXFIO as their first BCMA-directed therapy. In an analysis of these patients (n=123), the objective response rate was 61%, with a 71% probability of maintaining a response at 15 months.', 'The results from MagnetisMM-3 also established once-every-other-week dosing with ELREXFIO for all responding patients after 24 weeks of weekly therapy, which means less time at the clinic and potentially greater long-term treatment tolerability. Among responding patients who switched to every-other-week dosing at least six months prior to the data cut-off date (n=50), 80% maintained or improved their response after the switch, with 38% attaining a complete response (CR) or better after the switch. These data were published in Nature Medicine.', 'The most common adverse reactions to ELREXFIO are cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (58%), anemia (54%), neutropenia (45%), fatigue (44%), upper respiratory tract infection (39%), injection site reaction (38%), diarrhea (38%), pneumonia (37%), thrombocytopenia (36%), lymphopenia (30%), decreased appetite (27%), rash (26%), joint pain (arthralgia) (25%), fever (pyrexia) (27%), hypokalemia (23%), nausea (21%), and dry skin (21%). Serious adverse reactions are pneumonia (31%), sepsis (15%), CRS (13%), anemia (6%), upper respiratory tract infection (5%), urinary tract infection (3%), febrile neutropenia (3%), dyspnea (2%), and pyrexia (2%). Most cases of CRS were Grade 1 (44% of patients), with Grade 2 in 14% and Grade 3 in less than 1% of patients.', 'Due to the risk of CRS and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms for 48 hours after administration of each of the two step-up doses within the ELREXFIO dosing schedule and instructed to remain in proximity of a healthcare facility. In the EU, precautionary hospitalization is not required. Patients are not required to stay near a healthcare facility for the 76-mg first treatment dose.', 'About Multiple Myeloma', 'Multiple myeloma (MM) is an aggressive and currently incurable blood cancer that affects plasma cells made in the bone marrow. Healthy plasma cells make antibodies that help the body fight infection.1 MM is the second most common type of blood cancer, with over 50,000 new cases diagnosed annually in Europe and 176,000 new cases diagnosed globally each year.2,3 About 40% of those diagnosed with MM won’t survive beyond five years,4 and most will receive four or more lines of therapy due to relapse.5 While disease trajectory varies for each person, relapses are nearly inevitable.6 The goal of therapy for people with RRMM is to achieve disease control with acceptable toxicity and improved quality of life.7', 'About ELREXFIO® (elranatamab)', 'ELREXFIO is a subcutaneously delivered B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-CD3-directed bispecific antibody (BsAb) immunotherapy that binds to BCMA on myeloma cells and CD3 on T-cells, activating the T-cells to kill myeloma cells.', 'In August 2023, ELREXFIO was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under its Accelerated Approval Program, which allows for earlier approval of drugs that treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. ELREXFIO has also received approval in Switzerland and Brazil under Project Orbis, a framework for the concurrent submission and review of oncology drugs among international partners to potentially expedite approvals. Three other countries (Canada, Australia, and Singapore) are participating in Project Orbis. The UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has granted ELREXFIO Innovative Medicine Designation and the Innovation Passport for the treatment of MM.', 'Pfizer’s extensive MagnetisMM clinical development program is continuing to investigate ELREXFIO’s use across the entire spectrum of patients with MM, from RRMM to newly diagnosed MM. Ongoing registrational-intent trials are exploring ELREXFIO both as monotherapy and in combination with standard or novel therapies. These include MagnetisMM-5 in the double-class exposed setting, MagnetisMM-6 in newly diagnosed patients who are ineligible for stem cell transplant, and MagnetisMM-7 in newly diagnosed patients after transplant.', 'Detailed information on this medicinal product is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu.', 'U.S. INDICATION', 'ELREXFIO may cause side effects that are serious, life-threatening, or can lead to death, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic problems.

The Boeing 787, using Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines, was fueled by a blend that included BioForm® synthesized aromatic kerosene (SAK) made by Virent, a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum Corp. BioForm SAK is a critical ingredient that enabled the flight to be powered without any petroleum-based fuel."", 'It was just the latest of a string of successful demonstration flights that Virent has helped make possible - others have included United Airlines, Bell Helicopter, Emirates Airline, and Gulfstream. We spoke with Virent President and General Counsel Dave Kettner and Vice President of Strategy and Business Development Bob Rozmiarek, both of whom were on the flight.', 'Q: First, what exactly did Virent contribute to this flight, and why is it important?', 'Dave Kettner: Our BioForm® SAK provided a critical component that made this flight possible. Most sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, has to be blended with petroleum fuel to work in today\'s jet engines. This is because SAF generally consists of paraffinic compounds but lacks the aromatics of petroleum-based jet fuel. BioForm® SAK, made out of plant sugars, is almost entirely aromatics, and so when we blend it with paraffinic SAF, we end up with a jet fuel that\'s 100% bio-based and has the right composition to work in jet engines without making any modifications. In other words, it\'s a ""drop-in"" equivalent to petroleum fuel.', 'Q: How did Virent become involved in this flight? What other companies were involved?', 'Bob Rozmiarek: We have been engaged in previous 100% drop-in SAF demonstrations with various engine manufacturers. The main interaction for this project started through contacts the team had at Rolls Royce. We started talking directly to Virgin Atlantic about a year ago. They quickly saw that our SAK blended with HEFA (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids) would be the best way to achieve a transatlantic flight on 100% SAF. With the paraffinic fuel made out of waste fats by Air bp, and our bio-based aromatics made from plant sugars, Air bp was able to blend a fuel that Rolls Royce, the engine manufacturer; Boeing, airframe manufacturer; and Virgin, the airline operator, could test and agree on.', 'WATCH: Good Morning America', 'READ: USA TODAY', 'Q: And how did it go?', 'Bob Rozmiarek: It was flawless. On board the flight were lead engineering experts from Rolls-Royce, Boeing, Virgin and others, and they were all tied into the monitoring of the engines and other aircraft systems as the flight progressed. We are still waiting to get all of the data collected on the flight, as well as other pre-test data. We already know that 100% SAF blends of HEFA and our SAK emit up to 70% less particulate matter than jet fuel, which can mean less contrails. But from the point of view of a passenger, there was no difference whatsoever.', 'Q: So representatives of Virgin Atlantic and Virent were on the historic flight... Who else was on board?', 'Dave Kettner: The researchers were from Imperial College London and the University of Sheffield. And there were also project-team members from Boeing, Rolls-Royce, management consulting company ICF, the Rocky Mountain Institute, and the UK Department for Transport, which is analogous to the U.S. Department of Transportation.', 'Q: So what does this mean for the future of aviation?', 'Dave Kettner: The next thing for us to do - and by ""us"" I mean SAF manufacturers, airlines, engine manufacturers, regulators, and everyone else with a stake in SAF\'s future - is to concentrate our efforts on how best to scale up SAF production so that it can become a larger percentage of the global aviation fleet\'s fuel mix. Marathon and Virent have shown multiple times that Virent\'s technology can make SAF drop-in ready, and for us - and the rest of the SAF industry - the focus is regulations and market forces to make SAF feasible in the long term.', ""Learn more about Virent's revolutionary process."", 'Follow Virent on social media.', 'Facebook', 'Instagram', 'Linkedin', 'X (formerly Twitter)', 'View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Marathon Petroleum Corporation on 3blmedia.com.', 'Contact Info:Spokesperson: Marathon Petroleum CorporationWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/marathon-petroleum-corporation Email: info@3blmedia.com', 'SOURCE: Marathon Petroleum Corporation', 'View the original press release on accesswire.com']"

Despite the negative impact of inflation on consumer spending and business sentiment, the price of crude oil experienced positive effects. Moreover, the geopolitical events, particularly Russia's invasion of Ukraine, further contributed to the strong performance of oil stocks, leading to significant gains even amid the S&P 500 index's approximate 20% loss for the year. However, the narrative took a turn in 2023 as crude oil prices saw a substantial decline, nearly halving from their 2022 peak of around $120 per barrel."", 'Following the unexpected attack on Israel on October 7, there has been a recent surge in geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, a region responsible for over a third of the world’s seaborne oil trade. This development has put financial markets on edge. Traders quickly factored in a risk premium of $3-4 per barrel as markets opened. Although oil prices have somewhat stabilized since then, with Brent futures trading at approximately $78.2 per barrel, the ongoing crisis continues to keep markets in a state of anticipation. While there hasn’t been a direct impact on the physical oil supply, observers are closely monitoring the situation as it unfolds. TD Asset Management suggests that if the conflict remains localized, oil prices may stay relatively conservative. However, if other countries become involved, there is a potential for prices to reach $120 per barrel or even spike to $150.', 'At the beginning of 2023, there were concerns among oil and gas experts regarding a potential market slowdown due to recession fears and a decline in economic activity in China. However, as the year advanced, these concerns diminished, and data from China also turned positive. According to a September report by the research firm Wood Mackenzie, 2023 is expected to continue the trend of robust recovery following the impact of COVID-19. The firm forecasts a notable increase of 2.0 million barrels per day in global oil demand for the year, slightly below the figures seen in 2022. Wood Mackenzie emphasized that, despite uncertainties in growth, China is poised to play a significant role in this expansion, recovering from the extensive pandemic-related lockdowns of the previous year. At present, global demand has surged to a new record high, surpassing 102 million barrels per day.', 'On the other hand, over the long term, the International Energy Agency (IEA) envisions a 25% reduction in fossil fuel demand by 2030 and an 80% decrease by 2050.

The impact of, say, the GLP-1 discussion, and there's been talk about it impacting people's appetite for beverage. Is that a headwind that is facing any of these beer makers?"", 'VIVIEN AZER: Potentially, if we assume that the early adopters of GLP-1s are higher income consumers. Higher income consumers tend to over-index to wine. Where we have been very vocal around restraint with alcohol consumption as a combination of intentional abstinence, which we find to be outsized with younger consumers taking a week or month-long breaks, something like a Sober October or Dry January, as well as the interaction with cannabis.', ""The cannabis market is now $26 billion in revenues as of 2022. So that's over 10% of the alcohol market, and it's big enough now where we believe we're seeing dislocation away from alcohol sales into the legal cannabis market. And it's a way for consumers to take a break from alcohol by substituting it with cannabis."", ""We see a particular trend with 18 to 25-year-olds. There's been over a decade long divergence where past month alcohol consumption with 18 to 25-year-olds has been on the decline. But reported past month cannabis incidents has been on the rise."", ""BRAD SMITH: For a lot of these companies too. I mean, it's been a story of acquiring to grow. Are there any major M&A activities that we're anticipating to come about next year as you think about the brands that have done well as stand-alone that some of the larger ones out there, the Constellations, that have a history of making some of these very strategic acquisitions might be eyeing in order to grow out their portfolio?"", ""VIVIEN AZER: 2022 is really interesting. And really over the course of-- since the pandemic, we've actually seen a reversal in M&A activity for beer specifically, where you had seen a lot of acquisitions of craft beer brands. So you'll recall Constellation Brands had acquired ballast point. There were a number of craft beer acquisitions from ABI and Molson Coors as well."", ""And we've actually seen an unwind of those assets. ABI, for instance, sold nine brands to Tilray, which is a Canadian-based cannabis company. But they also own Sweetwater in Atlanta and Montauk, which is a craft beer offering in New York. So you actually have seen portfolio cleanup from the major operators, where we have seen more bolt on M&A is in the distilled spirits.""]"

The gross margin was aided by an improved price/mix, lapping higher costs related to the supply-chain disruptions in the year-ago quarter and lower tariff-related expenses. This was partly negated by higher input costs and adverse currency rates.SG&A expenses of $192 million rose 7% year over year and 6% on an organic basis. The increase stemmed from higher compensation and benefit-related expenses. Advertising expenses increased 16% year over year to $140 million for the fiscal second quarter. On an organic basis, advertising expenses increased 10%. Elevated advertising costs mainly resulted from the launch of Jack Daniel’s and Coca-Cola RTDs, increased investments in Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey, and the acquisition of Gin Mare and Diplomatico.We expected total operating expenses to increase 11.3% year over year to $333.8 million in the fiscal second quarter, driven by a 2.9% rise in advertising expenses, and an 11.6% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.', '\xa0', 'Brown-Forman Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Brown-Forman Corporation Quote', 'The operating income improved 8% year over year to $339 million on a reported basis due to an improved gross margin, offset by operating expense growth.

This was backed by strong growth of New Mix in Mexico, Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey in the United Arab Emirates and Poland, and Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Apple in Brazil and Chile.The developed international market reported sales growth of 3%, with a 2% decline in organic sales. The improvement can be attributed to Gin Mare and Diplomático in Italy, and the launch of Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Apple in South Korea. This was partly offset by lower volumes of Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey in Japan, following a significant inventory build in the second half of fiscal 2023.Net sales in the Travel Retail channel advanced 3% on a reported basis and were flat on an organic basis. The increase was the result of gains in the super-premium American whiskey portfolio, led by growth in Woodford Reserve; the launch of Jack Daniel’s American Single Malta and Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel; and the acquisitions of Gin Mare and Diplomático. This was partly negated by soft volume in Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Honey.The company’s overall sales in the United States declined 4% on a reported and 5% on an organic basis. The decline resulted from lower volumes due to the lapping of last year’s significant inventory build, offset by improved prices across the portfolio, led by Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and the acquisition of Diplomático.', 'In the first half of fiscal 2024, net sales for whiskey products declined 2% year over year and 1% on an organic basis.

Jack Daniel’s RTDs/Ready-to-Pours reported 2% sales growth on a reported and 1% growth on an organic basis, driven by the launch of the Jack Daniel’s & Coca-Cola RTD, partly offset by lower volumes of Jack Daniel’s & Cola due to the transition.Brown-Forman’s tequila portfolio reported year-over-year sales growth of 2%, with a 1% decline on an organic basis. This was driven by sales growth for the el Jimador brand, offset by a decline in the Herradura brand. The el Jimador reported year-over-year sales growth of 8% on a reported basis and 7% on an organic basis, driven by higher pricing, mainly in the United States, as well as higher volumes in Colombia.

Despite being one of the most important industries in the world, the automotive sector had a year to forget in 2022, mainly because of supply chain disruptions. Already reeling from the impact of the pandemic, higher interest rates and fears of a recession led to the industry slowing down as consumer spending fell, and the most valuable car companies by market cap heading into 2024 were significantly impacted too. “There is active demand destruction in the industry, given inflation, interest rates, and energy costs − but so far, this has mostly impacted the backlog,” Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska wrote in an investor note.', 'An aerial view of a busy highway, cars and trucks passing underneath.', 'According to Kroll, auto sales are expected to grow in 2023 as compared to 2022, even though the overall car industry is still well below pre-pandemic levels. Due to supply chain issues, car prices increased significantly over the past couple of years, both in the new car department as well as used car sales, with used car prices being 30% above pre-pandemic levels. Currently improving supply chain levels are expected to drive down prices as U.S. sales, which is home to many of the most valuable car companies in the world heading into 2024, reached over 1.3 million units in August, an increase of more than 15% compared to the previous year.\xa0 Consumers are expected to spend around $48 billion in the same month, a record for August. This is in line with global expectations too, as around 86.8 million units are expected to be sold, exceeding the previous estimates of 86.4 million units. Of course, the U.S. has been dealing with strikes and many of the the most profitable car companies in the world are losing tens of millions of dollars as workers strike for better pay, with the number of people striking continuing to increase by the thousands.', ""While the U.S. is home to many of the richest car companies in the world, which we'll discuss later in our list, the car companies expected to dominate the future of the industry are those which are able to successfully pivot to electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), one of the most valuable car companies in the world heading into 2024, is credited with ushering in the EV revolution and EV sales are continuing to increase as a percentage of total car sales, and 2023 is looking to be the most spectacular year in this respect. Currently, China is the largest manufacturer of EVs in the world by a country mile and is continuing to gain more dominance. More than half of the EVs produced in the world are produced by China, which is home to some of the biggest car manufacturers by revenue in 2023, and in 2022, around 14% of all cars sold globally were EVs. This percentage is expected to increase even more in 2023, as evidenced by Q1 sales, where 2.3 million EVs were sold, an increase of 25% compared to the previous year. In total, around 14 million EVs are expected to be sold in 2023, which will contribute to more than 16% of total cars sold."", 'Another exciting development in the automotive industry pertains to advances made in the self-driving industry. Many companies, including some of the most valuable car companies by market cap heading into 2024, have started to make headway in self-driving cars, and the industry, if all goes to plan, could be worth $400 billion by 2035. The Chief Executive Officer of the electric vehicle company Li Auto Inc.

With market sentiments fluctuating, there's a growing recognition of the significance of having cash readily available. Dividend investments address this need by providing a source of regular income. However, dividend investing is not solely about immediate earnings, it also presents the potential for growth over time. Companies that consistently grow dividends often demonstrate financial strength and stability, reflecting their ability to generate profits consistently. For this reason, analysts advise investors to focus on dividend aristocrats, which are companies that have raised their payouts for 25 consecutive years or more. According to a report by Fortune, despite trailing its benchmark, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index has outperformed almost every US active manager in the last decade. Rupert Watts, head of factors and dividend indices at S&P Dow Jones Indices, spoke with the global media organization about dividend growers. Here is what the analyst said:"", '“Raising your dividend for 25 plus years is no easy feat. These are high-quality companies.”', ""Throughout history, dividends have been a crucial component of investors' overall returns, particularly in times when market returns remained below ten percent for extended durations. In the long run, dividends have substantially contributed to the returns received by investors. Looking back over the last five decades, approximately 72% of the total return of the S&P 500 Index has been credited to reinvested dividends and the remarkable effect of compounding, according to a report by RBC Wealth Management. The report further mentioned that firms that consistently increase their dividends or begin paying dividends altogether have typically offered higher overall returns with lower volatility compared to companies that either kept their dividends steady or reduced them."", ""While dividend stocks might be trailing the overall market performance in 2023, it's essential to note that they have outperformed the broader market during specific periods throughout history, as reported by ProShares. With an upside-downside capture of 91% and 80%, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index has proven its strength in both upward and downward market movements. Its resilience shines through notably during market downturns, evident from its standout performance in 2022 when it surpassed the broader S&P 500 by a substantial 12%. Remarkably, this index has outperformed the S&P 500 in eight out of the ten worst quarterly market downturns since 2005. The report further mentioned by steadily increasing their dividends, dividend aristocrats have shown higher yield-on-cost than companies with initially higher dividend yields, even though their starting yields might be lower."", 'The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

342,acdb080c-3211-310c-8290-47484dd87f8e,BXP,2023-12-08,Boston Properties (BXP) Up 19% in 6 Months: Will the Trend Last?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boston-properties-bxp-19-6-203100377.html,1701981060,STORY,['BXP'],"[""Shares of Boston Properties BXP have rallied 19% in the past six months compared with the industry's growth of 1.8%.Although the overall demand for office real estate seems to be under pressure due to macroeconomic uncertainty and a high interest rate environment, select markets are bucking the negative trend.Net absorption in the United States office market showed signs of improvement in the third quarter of 2023 compared with the first and second quarters. The growing preference by tenants for premier office spaces with class-apart amenities has played a vital role in aiding absorption rates."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'BXP’s ability to offer such properties in a few select high-rent, high-barrier-to-entry geographic markets of Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., is likely to have helped it benefit from this positive demand, driving increased optimism in its stock price.In the nine months ended Sep 30, 2023, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company executed around 2.7 million square feet of leases with a weighted average lease term of 7.2 years. The third quarter of 2023 was the second consecutive quarter where leasing increased, underscoring the demand for premier workplaces despite the challenging market.This is a testament to the fact that new and existing clients continue to commit to the long-term use of space and prefer a premier workplace environment. Therefore, with an encouraging leasing pipeline and modest lease expirations through 2023, BXP is well-placed to navigate the challenging environment.This real estate investment trust (“REIT”) enjoys a diversified, creditworthy tenant base, which includes several industry leaders. The long-term leases with these tenants assure stable revenue generation for the company, driving steady top-line growth. For 2023, we estimate a year-over-year increase of 4.5% in the company’s lease revenues.The life-science industry is booming on the back of the increasing need for drug research and innovation. Against this backdrop, Boston Properties is converting numerous straight office buildings into laboratory/life science spaces in its suburban portfolio, especially its Kendall Center project, which is one of the leading preferred locations for life science clients in the world. Given the robust demand for life-science assets, BXP is expected to witness healthy leasing activity in the life-science portfolio, driving the segment’s growth.Boston Properties is enhancing its portfolio quality through repositioning initiatives via acquisitions and is developing properties in core markets and shedding properties in non-core markets.From the beginning of 2010 through the end of the third quarter of 2023, the company carried out acquisitions worth $7.1 billion and disposed of properties for an aggregate amount of $7.4 billion. Such moves highlight its prudent capital management practices and relieve the pressure on its balance sheet.In addition, BXP’s encouraging development and redevelopment pipeline is likely to fuel net operating income growth in the coming years.On the balance sheet front, Boston Properties had $3.3 billion of liquidity as of Sep 30, 2023. Its net debt to EBITDAre (annualized) was 7.28X, while the fixed charge coverage ratio was 2.53 times as of the period. Also, it enjoys unsecured senior debt ratings of BBB+ from S&P Global Ratings and Baa1 from Moody’s, providing it access to the debt market at favorable rates.Hence, with a solid financial position and prudent capital management, Boston Properties seems well-poised to navigate through industry choppiness and capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.BXP’s current cash flow growth is projected at 30.59%, well ahead of the 8.02% estimated for the industry.For 2023, Boston Properties expects funds from operations (“FFO”) per share in the band of $7.25-$7.27, revised from $7.24-$7.29, guided earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $7.28, which is within expectations.Nonetheless, competition from industry peers may limit Boston Properties’ ability to retain tenants at relatively higher rents, denting its pricing power. Also, the elevated supply of office properties amid a competitive landscape may adversely impact BXP’s ability to backfill near-term tenant move-outs, hurting occupancy. For 2023, management expects in-service portfolio occupancy to range from 88% to 89.5%. We expect the company to maintain an occupancy rate of 88.6% in 2023.Also, persistent macroeconomic uncertainty has led to a slowdown in leasing activity and management expects this trend to continue for the remainder of 2023. The company expects most of its leasing to come from small and medium-sized professional and financial services firms in the upcoming period.Given the prevailing high interest rate environment, Boston Properties may find it difficult to purchase or develop real estate with borrowed funds as the costs are likely to be on the higher side. Our estimate suggests a year-over-year rise of 18.6% in the company’s current-year interest expenses.', 'Some better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are EastGroup Properties EGP, Stag Industrial STAG and Park Hotels & Resorts PK. While PK sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), EGP and STAG each carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EastGroup Properties’ 2023 FFO per share has moved marginally upward in the past month to $7.70.The consensus estimate for Stag Industrial’s ongoing year’s FFO per share has increased by 1.3% over the past two months to $2.28.The consensus estimate for Park Hotels & Resorts’ current-year FFO per share has moved marginally northward over the past week to $1.99.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL)."", 'Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Royal Caribbean Cruises ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Royal Caribbean Cruises is:', '20% = US$925m ÷ US$4.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.20 in profit."", ""Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Royal Caribbean Cruises has a superior ROE than the average (16%) in the Hospitality industry."", ""That's clearly a positive. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Royal Caribbean Cruises by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here."", 'Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.', ""We think Royal Caribbean Cruises uses a significant amount of debt to maximize its returns, as it has a significantly higher debt to equity ratio of 4.27. Its ROE is pretty good, but given the impact of the debt, we're less than enthused, overall."", ""Return on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE."", ""Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company."", 'If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.', 'Have feedback on this article?

As a leading off-price apparel and home fashion retailer, Ross Stores Inc operates over 2,000 stores across the United States. The company's financial performance for the quarter ending October 28, 2023, showed a 7.9% increase in sales compared to the same period in the previous year, driven by a 5% comparable store sales increase and the opening of 93 net new stores. Cost of goods sold increased by $140.2 million, but as a percentage of sales, it decreased by approximately 260 basis points, indicating improved merchandise margins and lower freight costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses rose by $117.1 million, reflecting higher incentive compensation and store wages.

With a focus on value, Ross Stores Inc has successfully positioned itself as a go-to destination for budget-conscious shoppers, a strength that is particularly valuable in times of economic uncertainty.', ""Financial Health and Operational Efficiency: Ross Stores Inc's financial statements reflect a robust balance sheet, with a significant increase in net earnings and a healthy cash flow from operations.

Additionally, the company's ability to leverage its accounts payable to finance inventory purchases further underscores its operational efficiency."", 'Market Sensitivity to Economic Fluctuations: As an off-price retailer, Ross Stores Inc is sensitive to economic downturns that can impact discretionary consumer spending. While the company benefits from bargain-seeking behavior during tough economic times, prolonged recessions can still lead to reduced consumer traffic and spending, potentially affecting sales and profitability.', 'Dependence on Brick-and-Mortar Footprint: Despite the growth in e-commerce, Ross Stores Inc remains heavily reliant on its physical store presence. This dependence exposes the company to risks associated with real estate costs, changing consumer shopping behaviors, and the need for continuous investment in store maintenance and expansion to drive growth.', ""Expansion of Store Network: Ross Stores Inc has the opportunity to expand its store footprint, both in existing markets and new geographic areas. The company's proven ability to open and operate successful new stores can lead to increased market share and revenue growth, capitalizing on the demand for off-price retail options."", 'Enhancement of Digital Capabilities: The retail landscape is increasingly shifting towards digital channels, and Ross Stores Inc has the opportunity to enhance its e-commerce capabilities.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the top 5 most valuable American companies today.', 'When the U.S. sneezes, the world catches a cold. This one saying illustrates the importance of the U.S. economy to the world, the country with the highest GDP in the world not just in 2022 but for at least a century now. Over the past decade, the U.S. economy has seen performance levels that will be impossible for even it to replicate in the future, and its higher government spending and tax cuts have helped cash flow through global markets in addition to domestic markets. One example of U.S. influence on the global economy can be seen in the 2008 recession, which started off in the U.S., but its impact reverberated across the world as the U.S. was driving global growth rates, led by the most valuable American companies today.', 'A financial trader monitoring stock charts and indicators on a high tech computer setup.', 'Currently, the U.S., like most countries, has struggled to contain record inflation, which in turn have led to consistent hikes in interest rates by the Federal Reserve and has seen its economic growth slow down. Towards the end of 2022, fears of a recession in the U.S. were continuing to increase, even as U.S. stock markets saw their worst first half in nearly half a century. Most stocks, with a particular focus on tech, were absolutely devastated and the NASDAQ-100, where most of the top tech stocks including many of the most valuable American companies today are listed, finished with a full-year loss of 32.4% while the S&P 500 recorded a loss of 18.1%.\xa0 However, a more positive than expected landing delayed fears of a recession, and now, expectations of a recession in 2024 are abating further, with an expected growth rate of 1.5% for 2024, after a spectacular landing in Q3 2023.', ""Even as the warnings of a recession continued to ramp up, the U.S. delivered growth of nearly 5% in Q3 2023, with an increase in wages from a tight labor market contributing to increased consumer spending and hence, an uplift in the country's economy. On the other hand, there is still some cause for concern as business investment declined for the first time in two years, and while the performance in Q3 was extraordinary, growth in Q4 is still expected to slow down as student loan payments resume, strikes from the United Auto Workers take place and the delayed impact of rate hikes affects performance. According to a Morgan Stanley report in August 2023, consumer spending declining in 2024 is a major risk for the country as current household savings are estimated to be a mere $350 billion, and student loans and credit-card balances could result in household savings running out in Q1 2024. Additionally, the U.S. Treasury is likely to issue around $1 trillion in debt in 2023 which would make the financial system of the U.S. more illiquid and the Bank of Japan allowing the country's interest rates to increase could also see more investment being diverted to the Asian giant."", ""One of the primary drivers behind the economic dominance of the U.S. is its innovation, which is why it is the most advanced country in the world. This is also why tech stocks are generally among the most valuable American companies today, and further innovations will continue to help in advancing America's economy. One such example is the country's advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is perhaps the hottest industry in the world right now. Some of the most valuable companies in America today have invested heavily in AI, and we'll discuss their investments and approaches to AI in more detail when mentioning which companies make our list."", 'Similarly, tech stocks have dominated U.S. stock performance in 2023, and rebounded strongly from the disastrous performance in 2022. The total return of the Nasdaq composite in 2023 has been 22.51% YTD, and many top tech stocks have seen their share price more than double in these 10 months! However, what goes up, must come down and in the past few days, Nasdaq has taken a beating after some tech stocks underperformed expectations in Q3 2023 and suffered heavy losses. However, towards the end of the week starting 23rd October, Nasdaq did see its performance increase thanks to confidence boosting performances from some of the most valuable American companies today.', 'Methodology', ""To determine the most valuable American companies today, we headed over to Yahoo Finance and first determined the 100 most valuable American companies today, which were then sorted by their market cap. The two most valuable companies in the world are both American companies, and while being the most valuable doesn't directly have an exact co-relation to having the highest revenue, the largest U.S. company by revenue, Walmart Inc.

If you want to skip our overview of the recent happenings in platinum mining, read\xa05 Largest Platinum Producing Countries in the World."", ""Platinum is commonly found alongside other metals and minerals, not in its pure elemental form, as part of the platinum group metals (PGMs). This group includes platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, osmium, and ruthenium. Also, these elements are not typically found in distinct ores, but rather, they are recovered as by-products from the processing of primary minerals such as iron, copper, nickel, and cobalt. Consequently, the average annual production of platinum is less than that of gold, reflecting its rarity in the earth's crust (0.005 parts per million). This scarcity contributes to platinum's high value, with its current price per gram being $28.85."", 'In 2022, the global platinum market saw a consumption of approximately\xa06,518.3 koz. Key mines contributing to the worldwide platinum output include Mogalakwena Mine, Marikana Mine, Impala Mine, and Union Mine. By the end of 2023, there are projections of a shortfall in platinum production, primarily due to ongoing deficits in the palladium supply. This anticipated scarcity is expected to be influenced by factors such as the high cost of palladium and its substitution with platinum, especially in the automotive industry for catalytic converters.', 'Must Read:\xa0Top 20 Diamond Producing Countries in the World', 'Platinum is used in vehicle catalytic converters, often in conjunction with palladium and, at times, rhodium. Within a catalytic converter, platinum expedites chemical reactions without undergoing consumption itself. As exhaust gases from an engine pass through the catalytic converter, platinum enables a series of chemical transformations. These reactions minimize harmful pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and unburned hydrocarbons, transforming them into less detrimental substances, namely nitrogen (N2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and water vapor (H2O). Given its pivotal function in the automotive industry, approximately 61% of platinum group metals (PGMs) are allocated for use in this sector.', 'Additionally, platinum is a favorite in the jewelry industry, constituting roughly 30% of its market utilization. Platinum group metals also find application in various other domains, including computer hard disks, laboratory equipment, thermocouples, and electroluminescent diodes, among others.', ""Furthermore, the increasing preference for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has expanded platinum's presence in the investment sector. Its recyclability further underscores its value, with a prominent quantity being reclaimed from used automotive catalysts, in addition to smaller amounts obtained from old jewelry and electronics."", 'Also Read:\xa020 Countries With the Largest Copper Reserves in the World', 'The\xa0largest platinum-producing mine\xa0is the Bushveld Complex in South Africa, which is a vast mineral-rich area. Within the Bushveld Complex, the highest-yielding mines include Impala, Rustenburg, and Marikana, all contributing to global platinum output.\xa0', ""Another player in the platinum mining sector is Norilsk Nickel's mines in Russia, particularly the Talnakh and Oktyabrsky mines, which are crucial for platinum and palladium production. These Russian mines have a high palladium-to-platinum ratio, unlike South African mines where platinum predominates. Similarly, the Stillwater mine in the United States, located in Montana, is another source known for its high-grade deposits and the production of palladium and platinum. Collectively, these mines shape the global platinum market, influencing prices and the availability of PGMs (Platinum Group Metals)."", 'Speaking of the United States, in the financial year 2022, a company based in Montana produced precious metals known as PGMs, valued at approximately\xa0$880 million.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Best Clothing Stocks to Buy Now.', 'The global clothing industry has had to battle many challenges in 2023. These include high inflation, greater scrutiny over manufacturing processes, the increased budgets on digital marketing, as well as shifting consumer patterns. Even though the post-pandemic bounce for the clothing world lasted for well over a year starting 2021, hyper inflation forced consumer spending to slow down dramatically thereafter. As inflation numbers stabilize and spending resumes, the clothing industry looks set for another comeback.\xa0', 'Some of the top stocks to monitor in this context include The TJX Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TJX), Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE). According to a report by consulting firm McKinsey, in 2021, the fashion industry, a subset of the clothing sector, delivered a 21% increase in revenues in 2021, and earnings before taxes more than doubled from around 6% to over 12%. One of the prime reasons behind these numbers were luxury brands that outperformed the broader industry.', 'Investors eager to pour their money into apparel firms should keep in mind certain industry trends that are likely to shape the clothing market in 2024. These include increased emphasis on sustainable apparel, the desire for customization and personalization, and the increase in demand for clothes as the holiday season approaches, hitting supply channels. The use of the metaverse and artificial intelligence is also an exciting development in the clothing world. Rest assured, the clothing market is set to deliver impressive growth numbers in the coming months.', 'One measure of the success of clothing firms in the past few years is the extraordinary performance of retail ETFs. In the past five years, the SPDR S&P Retail ETF has returned more than 43% to investors. It is up by close to 6% year-to-date. Similarly, the Global X Health and Wellness ETF has returned close to 20% to investors in the past five years. It is up nearly 4% year-to-date. A major factor in this stellar performance has been the shift from brick-and-mortar to online stores. The coronavirus pandemic accelerated this shift.', 'According to a report by market research firm eMarketer, global retail ecommerce sales are expected to surpass $6 trillion this year, accounting for more than a fifth of overall retail sales. Within two more years, this number will jump above $7 trillion, despite slowing growth. Companies like Amazon, which generates a huge chunk of revenue from online sales already, is already preparing for this by shutting down brick-and-mortar apparel stores that were only launched last year.', 'Another interesting trend that apparel investors should take note of is the expansion of the secondhand apparel industry. The global secondhand apparel market is likely to expand three times faster than the global apparel market in the next five years. By 2026, the secondhand apparel market will cross $218 billion in valuation, up from $141 billion in 2023. Online marketplaces are driving this growth. Research by online consignment store ThredUp reveals that 70% of consumers believe that it is now easier to shop for secondhand clothes online than it was five years ago.', 'The perspective of apparel CEOs should also be taken into account before making decisions about investments in the clothing industry. After all, running a business is never easy. Richard Hayne, the CEO of popular apparel brand Urban Outfitters, Inc. (NASDAQ:URBN), recently said during an earnings call that the apparel world was witnessing a watershed moment, much like the start of ecommerce at the turn of the century and of mobile commerce the following decade. Hayne said machine learning technology had the potential to transform retail.', '""Current advances in machine learning technology hold the promise to transform the business of retail once again. Data science and artificial intelligence have the potential to deliver much shorter product lead times, more accurate demand forecasts, better allocations, more personalized marketing, and optimized inventory planning, among many other benefits. These technologies should improve efficiency, reduce waste, and provide cost savings across a wide range of functions.

BOOT is the largest retail chain devoted to western and work-related footwear, apparel, and accessories in the U.S. They believe that they have a $40 billion addressable market, and they focus their marketing and sales effort on four customer segments: work, western, country, and fashion (the smallest segment). The majority of their sales are for work-related products, which we believe will hold up relatively well even through a downturn. With 356 stores in 41 states, they are more than three times the size of their next largest competitor (in terms of store count), and because of their scale, we believe Boot Barn can offer competitive pricing and a very broad selection with good availability for customers – so in terms of niche dominance, BOOT is the biggest player in a fragmented industry with strong and growing margins and significant brand loyalty. A notable part of our investment thesis is confidence in their ability to grow. We see a path from 356 stores (currently) to 900 stores over the next 7-10 years by growing their store count more than 10% annually – a level this team has shown the capacity to achieve over a number of years. As you may remember, we owned Tractor Supply Company (TSCO) for many years and see a lot of similarities in these businesses and their footprint/target customers. TSCO has more than 2000 stores and is one data point that suggests BOOT has a long runway for growth.', 'As you know, a company’s financial flexibility is also very important to us; BOOT has a solid balance sheet and currently has more cash than long-term debt. We believe they can fund the opening of new stores with internally-generated cash flow and project that the investment in each new store should pay back in less than two years. Over the past six months, our team has met with the CEO and the rest of the management team multiple times, and we have learned a lot about their customers, real estate, pricing and retail strategies, competition, and corporate culture. We have gained confidence that their leadership is focused on the right initiatives: 1) expanding their store base; 2) driving same store sales growth; 3) continuing their omni-channel leadership; and 4) building out their higher margin exclusive brands. They have taken their exclusive brands from 16% in 2019 to 34% of overall sales in the most recent trailing twelve months with more room for growth over time. In short, we are confident that Boot Barn is a good fit for our portfolio and has a long runway for growing shareholder value.”', '\xa0', 'Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Clothing Stocks to Buy Now.', '\xa0', 'Suggested Articles:', '11 Best Low Risk Dividend Stocks To Invest In', '15 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the World', '11 Best Pet Stocks To Buy', 'Disclose.

Despite challenges, the Zacks Property and Casualty (P&C) Insurance industry has gained 11.8% year to date compared with the S&P 500 Composite’s gain of 19.6% and the Finance sector’s increase of 10.1%, banking on its operational strength.Investors always look for a safe portfolio of stocks that would give them solid returns amid market turmoil.

Per Deloitte Insights, gross premiums are estimated to increase about six-fold to $722 billion by 2030. China and North America should account for more than two-thirds of the global market, per the report.However, the performance of insurers is measured by underwriting profitability. AM Best reports a total net underwriting loss of $24.5 billion in the first half of 2023, much higher than the $6.6 billion incurred in the year-ago period, mainly attributable to rising loss costs, above-average catastrophe activity, and adverse trends in personal auto. In fact, AM Best maintains a negative outlook on U.S. personal lines with no expectation to reverse the same soon.The insurance industry is a beneficiary of the rising rate environment. The Fed has raised rates 11 times since March 2022. Though the Fed paused the rate hike, there are chances of a rate cut next year. Nonetheless, companies that have locked in high-interest rates are bound to generate higher yields at this point.Industry players remain focused on digitalization to improve scale and efficiencies.

If you want to skip our discussion on the hydrogen and fuel cell market, head directly to 5 Best Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Stocks To Buy For 2024.\xa0', 'Hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels can play a crucial role in lowering emissions in sectors where emission reduction is challenging, and feasible alternative solutions are either unavailable or difficult to implement. According to Mordor Intelligence, the fuel cell market was valued at approximately $5.40 billion in 2023, and it is expected to reach $22.12 billion by 2028. This represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 32.59% over the forecast period from 2023 to 2028. The expected drivers for this market expansion include decreasing costs associated with the production of green and blue hydrogen, along with an increasing demand from the automotive sector.', 'The impact of substantial investments in renewable infrastructure is likely to become more evident in 2024, with regulatory support enhancing renewable energy and transmission expansion to address grid constraints, as per Deloitte’s ‘2024 renewable energy industry outlook’. This may contribute to the establishment of a strong domestic clean energy industry with robust supply chains supporting the deployment of solar, wind, storage, and green hydrogen technologies. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) have played a significant role in boosting renewables through historic investments in different programs, grants, and tax credits, resulting in over $227 billion in announced public and private investments in utility-scale solar, storage, wind, and hydrogen in the last two years. ', 'According to the Deloitte report, the IIJA and the IRA have set the stage for the emergence of a new green hydrogen economy, which currently faces a substantial gap between announced and actual investments, with more than $50 billion announced and less than US$1 billion realized. This gap reflects uncertainties surrounding pending Treasury guidance on tax credits, which are expected to enhance the competitiveness of green hydrogen.', 'While there is a growing number of announcements for new projects aiming to produce low-emission hydrogen, only 5% of these projects have made firm investment decisions, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). This hesitation is mainly due to uncertainties surrounding the future demand outlook, lack of clarity regarding certification and regulation, and insufficient infrastructure for delivering hydrogen to end users. Despite the continuous growth in hydrogen demand, it remains largely concentrated in traditional applications. Novel applications in heavy industry and long-distance transport currently make up less than 0.1% of hydrogen demand, but they are expected to account for one-third of global hydrogen demand by 2030 in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario. While an increasing number of countries are unveiling national strategies and implementing concrete policies to support early adopters, delays in policy implementation and a lack of strategies for creating demand are hindering the widespread adoption of low-emission hydrogen production and utilization.', ""In an unfortunate turn of events, a preliminary version of the Treasury Department's guidelines for claiming tax credits related to hydrogen production under President Joe Biden's climate law was leaked on December 5. Advocates are concerned that the proposed requirements could potentially hinder the growth of the emerging hydrogen industry. The draft suggests incorporating conditions put forward by some environmentalists, restricting the $3-per-kilogram credit to hydrogen production facilities powered by recent clean energy projects such as wind or solar, within the past three years. The Treasury Department's draft guidance also stipulates that hydrogen projects must receive their power from newly established clean energy sources sharing the same grid on an annual basis until 2027, after which this requirement shifts to an hourly basis from 2028 onward, according to insiders. This matter has triggered a heated lobbying conflict and extensive discussions within the Biden administration, leading to a delay in the release of guidance. Bloomberg quoted Jason Grumet, chief executive officer of the Washington-based American Clean Power Association, on this matter:"", '“If true, the Biden administration’s proposed strategy for implementing these provisions will fail to get this new industry off the ground. It is surprising and disappointing that the administration would propose such a rigid approach that is at odds with decades of learning about new technology deployment.”', 'On a positive note, workforce challenges, especially in new industries like clean hydrogen, are being addressed through multiyear workforce plans associated with the seven hydrogen hubs, expected to generate 324,280 direct jobs across 16 American states. There is significant growth potential in the hydrogen and fuel cell market.

Recently, an insider sell event has caught the attention of investors and analysts alike. Chad Whalen, the Executive Vice President of Worldwide Sales at F5 Inc (NASDAQ:FFIV), has sold 1,398 shares of the company on December 4, 2023. This transaction has sparked interest in understanding the implications behind such a move and its potential impact on the stock's performance.Who is Chad Whalen of F5 Inc?Chad Whalen is a seasoned executive with a significant role at F5 Inc. As the EVP of Worldwide Sales, Whalen is responsible for leading the company's global sales strategy and execution, ensuring that F5's innovative solutions reach a broad customer base. His position gives him a deep understanding of the company's market position, competitive landscape, and growth opportunities. Whalen's actions, particularly in the realm of stock transactions, are closely monitored as they may reflect his confidence in the company's future.F5 Inc's Business DescriptionF5 Inc is a multinational company specializing in application services and application delivery networking (ADN). The company's products and services are designed to ensure the security, performance, and availability of network applications, as well as the delivery of content and applications to end-users. F5's offerings are critical in today's digital age, where businesses rely heavily on applications for their operations and customer interactions. The company's solutions cater to a wide range of industries, including finance, technology, and healthcare, among others.Analysis of Insider Buy/Sell and Relationship with Stock PriceChad Whalen's recent sale of 1,398 shares is part of a broader pattern observed over the past year. During this period, Whalen has sold a total of 3,356 shares and has not made any purchases. This one-sided transaction history could be interpreted in various ways. On one hand, it might suggest that the insider is taking profits or diversifying his investment portfolio. On the other hand, it could raise questions about the insider's long-term confidence in the company's stock performance.The insider transaction history for F5 Inc shows a notable absence of insider buys over the past year, with 31 insider sells recorded during the same timeframe. This trend could indicate that insiders, as a collective group, believe the stock may be fully valued or that they see better investment opportunities elsewhere."", ""When analyzing the relationship between insider transactions and stock price, it's important to consider the timing and context of the sales. Insider sells after a significant stock price increase could be a sign of insiders locking in gains. Conversely, consistent selling, regardless of price movements, might suggest a lack of confidence in the company's future growth prospects.Valuation and Market ResponseOn the day of Chad Whalen's recent sale, shares of F5 Inc were trading at $171.05, giving the company a market cap of $10.054 billion. The price-earnings ratio stood at 25.63, slightly lower than the industry median of 26.85 but higher than the company's historical median price-earnings ratio. This indicates that the stock is trading at a reasonable valuation compared to its peers and its own historical standards.The price-to-GF-Value ratio of 0.92 suggests that F5 Inc is modestly undervalued based on its GF Value of $186.53. The GF Value is a proprietary intrinsic value estimate developed by GuruFocus, which factors in historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates from analysts."", ""The modest undervaluation could be an attractive entry point for investors who believe in the company's long-term growth potential. However, the insider selling trend may temper some of the enthusiasm, as it could be perceived as a lack of insider conviction in the stock's upside potential.ConclusionThe recent insider sell by EVP Chad Whalen at F5 Inc has provided the market with a data point to consider in the overall analysis of the company's stock. While the insider's actions alone should not dictate investment decisions, they do offer a piece of the puzzle when evaluating F5 Inc's valuation and future prospects. Investors should weigh this insider activity alongside other financial metrics, industry trends, and broader market conditions before making any investment decisions."", 'Warning!

These are high-quality companies.”', ""Throughout history, dividends have been a crucial component of investors' overall returns, particularly in times when market returns remained below ten percent for extended durations. In the long run, dividends have substantially contributed to the returns received by investors. Looking back over the last five decades, approximately 72% of the total return of the S&P 500 Index has been credited to reinvested dividends and the remarkable effect of compounding, according to a report by RBC Wealth Management. The report further mentioned that firms that consistently increase their dividends or begin paying dividends altogether have typically offered higher overall returns with lower volatility compared to companies that either kept their dividends steady or reduced them."", ""While dividend stocks might be trailing the overall market performance in 2023, it's essential to note that they have outperformed the broader market during specific periods throughout history, as reported by ProShares. With an upside-downside capture of 91% and 80%, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index has proven its strength in both upward and downward market movements. Its resilience shines through notably during market downturns, evident from its standout performance in 2022 when it surpassed the broader S&P 500 by a substantial 12%. Remarkably, this index has outperformed the S&P 500 in eight out of the ten worst quarterly market downturns since 2005. The report further mentioned by steadily increasing their dividends, dividend aristocrats have shown higher yield-on-cost than companies with initially higher dividend yields, even though their starting yields might be lower."", 'The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the top 5 most valuable American companies today.', 'When the U.S. sneezes, the world catches a cold. This one saying illustrates the importance of the U.S. economy to the world, the country with the highest GDP in the world not just in 2022 but for at least a century now. Over the past decade, the U.S. economy has seen performance levels that will be impossible for even it to replicate in the future, and its higher government spending and tax cuts have helped cash flow through global markets in addition to domestic markets. One example of U.S. influence on the global economy can be seen in the 2008 recession, which started off in the U.S., but its impact reverberated across the world as the U.S. was driving global growth rates, led by the most valuable American companies today.', 'A financial trader monitoring stock charts and indicators on a high tech computer setup.', 'Currently, the U.S., like most countries, has struggled to contain record inflation, which in turn have led to consistent hikes in interest rates by the Federal Reserve and has seen its economic growth slow down. Towards the end of 2022, fears of a recession in the U.S. were continuing to increase, even as U.S. stock markets saw their worst first half in nearly half a century. Most stocks, with a particular focus on tech, were absolutely devastated and the NASDAQ-100, where most of the top tech stocks including many of the most valuable American companies today are listed, finished with a full-year loss of 32.4% while the S&P 500 recorded a loss of 18.1%.\xa0 However, a more positive than expected landing delayed fears of a recession, and now, expectations of a recession in 2024 are abating further, with an expected growth rate of 1.5% for 2024, after a spectacular landing in Q3 2023.', ""Even as the warnings of a recession continued to ramp up, the U.S. delivered growth of nearly 5% in Q3 2023, with an increase in wages from a tight labor market contributing to increased consumer spending and hence, an uplift in the country's economy. On the other hand, there is still some cause for concern as business investment declined for the first time in two years, and while the performance in Q3 was extraordinary, growth in Q4 is still expected to slow down as student loan payments resume, strikes from the United Auto Workers take place and the delayed impact of rate hikes affects performance. According to a Morgan Stanley report in August 2023, consumer spending declining in 2024 is a major risk for the country as current household savings are estimated to be a mere $350 billion, and student loans and credit-card balances could result in household savings running out in Q1 2024. Additionally, the U.S. Treasury is likely to issue around $1 trillion in debt in 2023 which would make the financial system of the U.S. more illiquid and the Bank of Japan allowing the country's interest rates to increase could also see more investment being diverted to the Asian giant."", ""One of the primary drivers behind the economic dominance of the U.S. is its innovation, which is why it is the most advanced country in the world. This is also why tech stocks are generally among the most valuable American companies today, and further innovations will continue to help in advancing America's economy. One such example is the country's advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is perhaps the hottest industry in the world right now. Some of the most valuable companies in America today have invested heavily in AI, and we'll discuss their investments and approaches to AI in more detail when mentioning which companies make our list."", 'Similarly, tech stocks have dominated U.S. stock performance in 2023, and rebounded strongly from the disastrous performance in 2022. The total return of the Nasdaq composite in 2023 has been 22.51% YTD, and many top tech stocks have seen their share price more than double in these 10 months! However, what goes up, must come down and in the past few days, Nasdaq has taken a beating after some tech stocks underperformed expectations in Q3 2023 and suffered heavy losses.

Additionally, Friday, November 25, is Native American Heritage Day. This celebration started as a day introduced in 1900 by Dr. Arthur C. Parker, a Seneca Native American and director of the Museum of Arts and Sciences. This month elevates awareness and provides an opportunity to express community, culture, and traditions for the over five million people that identify as Native American, American Indian, and Alaska Native. Take a look at our spotlight below:', 'Domino P. - Team Member, Franchise Org. C&R Restaurant Group, L.P.', ""Domino was born in Palm Springs, CA where he spent the first couple years of his life before moving to Banning-Beaumont to be closer to his tribe. He descends from two bands of Cahuilla Tribes from his mother's side, the Agua Caliente and Cahuilla (Ivtam) Band of Indians."", 'Domino grew up a proud Native, deeply connected to his roots. However, navigating the American and Native culture was difficult.', '""I can say my upbringing was like every Native kid. It was very different [from the ‘norm\']. Especially in high school, I had to always explain myself and certain things. Fortunately, I had tutoring twice a week with Native teachers and students which became my safe space,"" he said.', ""Although Domino was surrounded by Native kids, his greatest connection to his heritage came from his grandma who showed him the Cahuilla culture and traditions. From speaking their language, Cahuilla (ívillu), to Bird Singing, songs that describe the story of Cahuilla's migration, she taught him everything he knows today."", '""My grandma taught me so much, including Bird Singing, which has to be my favorite tradition. Singing of the Birds is where 11 Bands of Cahuilla come together to Bird Sing during Powwow season. Bird Singing is only taught so not everyone from the Indian Country (Native Americans in Mexico, Canada and America) can pick it up, which is cool.""', 'Currently, Domino is a student at the California Indian Nations College studying political science to become a Tribal Lawyer. This college was created to empower Native students pursuing higher education, but to also educate non-natives on their culture and history. Luckily, Domino has a fully online schedule that allows him to work the night shift at Taco Bell.', ""But how'd he end up at Taco Bell? Funny enough, he stumbled upon The Bell while hungry."", '""I was really hungry one day, so I decided to eat some Taco Bell, specifically the steak quesadilla with extra steak. As I approached the restaurant, I saw a hiring sign, so I decided to apply. Quickly after, I got hired!""', 'Since joining Taco Bell, Domino has been able to immerse himself in a newfound community of people that go the extra mile for him.', '""There\'s a lot of people at Taco Bell who help each other out. I\'ve never had a job where I\'ve felt more included or been around a group of people that care. What\'s even crazier is that some of my co-workers are even learning Cahuilla to talk to me.""', ""In addition, Domino appreciates how he's able to express himself during work."", '""No matter what culture you come from, you\'re allowed to express yourself. For example, I\'m encouraged to braid my hair and put it in a bun because braiding hair is something we do in my culture. It symbolizes my spirit, and at Taco Bell, I don\'t have to change who I am.""', ""In the future, Domino hopes to educate others about his culture to play a role in bringing back the Native voice. Native American Heritage Month can be honored even more by supporting Native-owned businesses, donating to Native-led nonprofits, listening to podcasts, watching related movies, attending locally hosted events and more!

Enterprises are pursuing high-quality and sustainable growth through driving organizational optimization and agile operation models, as well as focusing on technological innovation with a view to expanding globally.', 'In assessing the China Best ESG Employers Award recipients, Aon implemented a rigorous review of the 225 participating companies over a six-month period through a questionnaire, employee survey and leadership interviews across four areas: responsibility, maturity, resilience and agility.', 'Responsibility', ""How a company integrates and upholds its ESG commitments and how it influences its respective industry, clients and employees is an essential component in assessing the China Best ESG Employer Awardees. This year's survey revealed more than half of the participants noted clear requirements concerning ESG or sustainability initiatives, such as using recyclable materials or meeting certain labor force criteria. Among the Best ESG Employer awardees, 82 percent revealed that employees are important partners of ESG practices. It is clear that embedding ESG into corporate culture is essential to help employees understand and implement their purpose."", ""In conducting this year's survey, Aon also employed the use of an advanced neurological survey tool to more accurately capture the reliability of participants' responses. Interestingly, the tool found there was a disparity between some participants' responses versus what they actually believe to be true. For example, in one question company employees were asked whether 'sustainable development is one of the key strategies of my company' with 85 percent answering that it was. However, in tracking how long it took the respondent to answer the question it was determined only 73 percent actually strongly believed this. The gap widens further on questions regarding the consideration of the environment in business decisions, as well as managing ESG effectively. It is clear that there is still a way to go to help employees recognize and support their company's ESG practices and sustainable growth strategy."", 'Maturity', ""Many companies have recognized the importance of ESG since last year's awards and have already initiated discussions or created plans around ESG issues. Aon found that multinational corporations tend to develop their ESG purpose at their headquarters and optimize it to better fit local markets. For example, in China the inclusion and diversity focus might be more on age diversity rather than gender."", ""For companies in China, ESG concerns may instead be focused on establishing China's ESG evaluation system, which is a challenge for all companies while also considering the need for high-quality and balanced development. However, Aon's survey results showed that the daily management of ESG targets is not widely recognized by employees. For example, only 63 percent of employees agreed that 'management is responsible for implementing ESG targets' while 56 percent agreed that the 'leadership team has necessary skills to achieve ESG targets.' The ratio is slightly higher for Best ESG Award winners, reaching 71 percent and 65 percent respectively, demonstrating that companies still have a long way to go in terms of their maturity around ESG."", 'Resilience and Agility', ""Both resilience and agility are a focus for organizations today: resilience can help companies to face risks while agility can help seize opportunities. In this year's survey, more than 60 percent of participants claimed to adjust their organizational structure once a year, and 35 percent adjust it every six months. These changes are driven by the pursuit of faster responses, better products and smoother communications."", ""When evaluating resilience and agility, Aon focuses not only on the organization's performance, but also the health and wellbeing of employees, such as engagement and dedication to their work, understanding of strategy, ownership of performance and willingness to engage in long-term development. This year's awardees demonstrated a commitment to employee wellbeing, offering practical benefits for housing and retirement, incentive measures to unite and inspire employees, and the willingness to structure and reshape their workforce by reskilling or retraining staff."", 'Peter Zhang, head of Aon\'s Talent Solutions for Asia Pacific and chairman of the judge committee of China Best ESG Employers Award,\xa0said: ""Many companies focus on the short-term and consider ESG a \'nice to have\'.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend aristocrats and the performance of dividend growers in the past, and go directly to read Dividend Aristocrats List: Top 10 Among Billionaires.\xa0', ""Investing in dividend stocks offers a distinct opportunity for investors seeking consistent income. With market sentiments fluctuating, there's a growing recognition of the significance of having cash readily available. Dividend investments address this need by providing a source of regular income. However, dividend investing is not solely about immediate earnings, it also presents the potential for growth over time. Companies that consistently grow dividends often demonstrate financial strength and stability, reflecting their ability to generate profits consistently. For this reason, analysts advise investors to focus on dividend aristocrats, which are companies that have raised their payouts for 25 consecutive years or more. According to a report by Fortune, despite trailing its benchmark, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index has outperformed almost every US active manager in the last decade. Rupert Watts, head of factors and dividend indices at S&P Dow Jones Indices, spoke with the global media organization about dividend growers. Here is what the analyst said:"", '“Raising your dividend for 25 plus years is no easy feat. These are high-quality companies.”', ""Throughout history, dividends have been a crucial component of investors' overall returns, particularly in times when market returns remained below ten percent for extended durations. In the long run, dividends have substantially contributed to the returns received by investors. Looking back over the last five decades, approximately 72% of the total return of the S&P 500 Index has been credited to reinvested dividends and the remarkable effect of compounding, according to a report by RBC Wealth Management. The report further mentioned that firms that consistently increase their dividends or begin paying dividends altogether have typically offered higher overall returns with lower volatility compared to companies that either kept their dividends steady or reduced them."", ""While dividend stocks might be trailing the overall market performance in 2023, it's essential to note that they have outperformed the broader market during specific periods throughout history, as reported by ProShares. With an upside-downside capture of 91% and 80%, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index has proven its strength in both upward and downward market movements. Its resilience shines through notably during market downturns, evident from its standout performance in 2022 when it surpassed the broader S&P 500 by a substantial 12%. Remarkably, this index has outperformed the S&P 500 in eight out of the ten worst quarterly market downturns since 2005. The report further mentioned by steadily increasing their dividends, dividend aristocrats have shown higher yield-on-cost than companies with initially higher dividend yields, even though their starting yields might be lower."", 'The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

The global leader in logistics real estate, which has been installing solar in its buildings since 2005, achieved this important milestone, when its one MW facility in Ontario, California was activated. 500 MW of solar capacity can support the energy needs of some 86,500 U.S. homes, according to the\xa0Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA)."", '""With 1.2 billion square feet of premier real estate around the world, we have a significant opportunity to help our customers and the communities where we do business with rooftop solar and energy storage,"" said Hamid R.

Dr. Mark Beasley, professor of Enterprise Risk Management, director of NC State\'s ERM Initiative and co-author of the report, said, ""While the economy is the top-ranked risk for the coming year, cyber threats jumped to the top of the list when leaders assessed both near- and long-term outlooks, after not being a top-five risk at all last year. This jump reflects the growing recognition of the complex cyber risk landscape that is impacted by the exponential curve of technological advances and how seriously leaders are taking these threats.""', '""Over the next decade, technologies such as artificial intelligence, cloud, and the anticipated emergence of quantum computing will change how organizations secure their data, raising significant security-related questions,"" said Sameer Ansari, Protiviti global Security & Privacy lead. ""To adapt quickly to new technologies, many organizations are increasing reliance on outsourcing and co-sourcing arrangements to achieve operational and go-to-market objectives. \xa0Additional risks arise as organizations must ensure their third-party partners, are complying with current laws and regulations to ensure their data and their customers\' data is secure.""', ""How Companies Can Take ActionNo matter the time horizon, this year's survey results highlight important steps executives should take to protect their companies against risk and maximize their chances of future success.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of Baby Boomers' wealth and retirement, you may go to the 5 Brilliant Money Moves Baby Boomers Are Making in Retirement. "", 'Baby Boomers are the wealthiest generation on this planet, period. According to Fortune, their net worth falls between $970,000 to $1.2 million. As of 2022, this generation held a total of $78.1 trillion in assets, constituting a significant 50% share of all assets in the United States. The substantial wealth amassed by this generational cohort is poised for a significant transfer in the coming years. Reportedly, an estimated $53 trillion of wealth will be transferred from baby boomers, representing 63% of the total generational wealth transition.', 'As the transfer of wealth awaits, this generational cohort is embracing and making the most of their golden years. Back in May 2023, internal data from the Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) showed a widening gap in the spending habits of working-age adults and retirees. The data showed that baby boomers have been outspending the younger generations, with a notable focus on expenditures like hotels and travel.', '“Some of these rebounds in travel or broader leisure services may be a kind of unwinding — they’re splurging or making good on something they couldn’t do during the pandemic.”', '- David Tinsley, senior economist at the Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) Institute.', 'Besides making up for lost time in the pandemic, seniors have also been making the most of their COLA, the highest they’ve received since 1981. Fortune\xa0notes that many of the seniors today are currently enjoying financial prosperity, with high interest rates contributing to the growth of their accounts. Consequently, now is the right time to go all-in on old-people stocks.', '“Millennials are really feeling the impact of the hiking cycle. Boomers, not so much.”', '- BofA quantitative strategist Ohsung Kwon.', 'The Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) notes that stocks like American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL), Welltower Inc. (NYSE:WELL), and Service Corporation International (NYSE:SCI) are going to be hot as Boomers continue to spend on healthcare, entertainment, and home improvement. This generation accounts for 33% of total card billings at American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), which is why their stock can be a good opportunity to seize. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is also known to specialize in entertainment and travel, the two important spending categories for seniors.', 'Moreover, Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) is a building company that specializes in luxury homes, another boomer stock to buy amidst thriving seniors. Baby Boomers often help their children in getting their first homes and also dominate the housing market, which is why Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE:TOL) are also a good buy.', ""According to Scott Barlow, a market strategist at Globe and Mail, demographic trends like these move slowly so there's no need for investors to rush. If stocks do begin to pick up pace, or market volatility renders them at steep discounts, they can consider it as a good chance to add it to their portfolio."", ""Meanwhile, the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies notes that the median retirement savings for Baby Boomers is $202,000. Based on this figure, the average retirement income for them is $8,000 annually. These figures imply that even though baby boomers have the most wealth amassed, there are yet many others who don't have ample money saved and need to figure out some wise moves to help supplement their retirement income."", 'All in all, Baby Boomers are making some brilliant money moves in retirement\xa0which is augmenting their game. Let’s check out these moves.', 'An elderly couple consulting with a financial advisor on their retirement investments.', 'To compile the list of 12 brilliant money moves baby boomers are making in retirement, we have used forums such as Reddit and Quora to analyze what this generation is doing to make more money or save it during their retirement years. A consensus approach was used to rank the moves suggested, with 1 point awarded to a place each time it was recommended by a Boomer.', 'Scores were summed up and places were ranked in an ascending order from the lowest to the highest scores.', 'Here are 12 Brilliant Money Moves Baby Boomers Are Making in Retirement:', 'Insider Monkey Score: 10', 'This one’s a no-brainer. Delaying social security until the full retirement age allows retirees to claim full benefits. According to the Social Security Administration, Social Security retirement benefits are increased by a certain percentage for each month an individual delays starting their benefits beyond full retirement age. This benefit increase stops once they reach the age of 70. Individuals who decide to claim their benefits early, such as at the age of 62, can only claim 70% of their scheduled benefits. Those who decide to wait until 67 receive the official amount they are entitled to, and those who wait until 70 get 124% of the primary insurance amount.', ""“…People are living longer today, and for couples, the high-earner's benefit lasts for the lifetime of two individuals. The odds of benefiting from the insurance value of delaying Social Security are much greater than 50% for reasonably healthy individuals.”"", '-Wade Pfau, a respected retirement researcher and the author of The Retirement Planning Guidebook.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 12', ""Asking for a senior discount can help individuals save hundreds of dollars. Many companies offer senior discounts for people aged 55 or older. Kohl's offers an elder discount every Wednesday where they can avail 15% off on in-store purchases. For clothing and home décor, seniors aged 55 and over can get a 10% discount every Tuesday at Ross."", ""Other companies offering senior discounts include restaurants such as Denny's and IHOP, grocery stores such as Kroger, and hotels such as Marriott and Hilton, to name a few. It’s always best to check the official pages or directly contact companies to ask whether they are offering a senior discount or not."", 'Insider Monkey Score: 13', 'One brilliant money move baby boomers are making in retirement is executing Roth conversions. Roth conversions are a tax-planning technique that allows seniors to have greater control over their taxable income. A Roth IRA is funded with after-tax dollars, such that withdrawals become tax-free. The annual limit of contributions to Roth IRAs is $6,500 for 2023. According to The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), there are four cases in which it makes sense to convert to a Roth account.', ""First, if an individual believes their tax bracket is going to be higher in retirement. In this case, paying taxes at the current rate would make more sense than later. Second, if a senior wants to maximize their estate for their heirs and don't need to use the IRA funds during their lifetime. Third, most of their assets are in tax-deferred accounts. Converting to a Roth will allow them to better manage their tax brackets. Lastly, they have low-income and irregular income streams."", 'Insider Monkey Score: 15', ""According to a study by Northwestern Mutual's 2022 Planning and Progress, only 35% of Americans seek help from a financial advisor. However, the study also found that 62% of them believe they need financial improvement, and more people are now realizing the value of financial help."", '""Despite the fact that too many Americans are still not getting financial help, we saw a spike last year in the number of people seeking professional advice and those numbers have held stable in 2022 rather than sliding back to pre-pandemic levels.""', '- Tim Gerend, executive vice president and chief distribution officer at Northwestern Mutual', 'With the help of a financial advisor, seniors can maximize their tax efficiency, make better asset allocation, optimize social security, handle withdrawals, and even help with portfolio re-balancing.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 16', 'More and more individuals are struggling to pay healthcare expenses in the USA. According to a Gallup poll, 38% of Americans stated that they or a family member delayed treatment because of financial reasons. However, one brilliant money move baby boomers have made over the years is creating tax-advantaged healthcare accounts with their employers.', 'Flexible Savings Accounts (FSAs) and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) are being used by Boomers to pay medical expenses and even Medicare premiums. These accounts help protect retirement savings by allowing individuals to pay for healthcare instead of withdrawing from retirement accounts. In particular, an HSA account can be used to withdraw funds for any reason after the age of 65, and that too, without any penalty.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 19', 'Baby Boomers aren’t just crazy wealthy, but are also the largest generation of home buyers today. According to the National Association of Realtors (NAR), this demographic makes up 39% of all home buyers, the most of any generation. Investments in real estate allow baby boomers to have an additional source of income in retirement. Rental properties, in particular, offer several tax benefits for seniors such as property taxes, mortgage interest, and even depreciation.', 'Another recent report by NAR states that older buyers today are in a better position to buy homes in the current market. Spectators are signaling toward an easing housing market, something baby boomers can capitalize on. Buying real estate now will allow them to build more wealth the next time prices rise. Of the $82 trillion nest egg that boomers have built over the years, nearly one-fourth has been built this way.', 'Insider Monkey Score: 21', 'Working part-time is another wise money move that baby boomers are making in retirement. Owing to increased longevity spans and high costs of living, T. Rowe Price asserts that 20% of retirees are continuing to work part-time. 7% are also searching for jobs, either for money or other reasons. However, there is still a surplus of 1.98 million retirees, a potential problem for the economy.', 'Provided that those who can return to work or work part-time do so, seniors will not only be able to help themselves but also the economy.', 'Click to continue reading and see the 5 Brilliant Money Moves Baby Boomers Are Making in Retirement.', 'Suggested Articles:', '20 Countries with Free Health Care', '15 Most Expensive Medical Treatments/Procedures in the US', '25 States with Highest Inflation Rates in the US', 'Disclosure: none. 12 Brilliant Money Moves Baby Boomers Are Making in Retirement is originally published on Insider Monkey.']"

However, with the increased tech solutions, the risk of cyber threats also increases.', 'Segment-wise, the market is dominated by the domestic segment which accounted for over 70% of the market share in 2022.

This segment provides advantages such as lower fees and flexible advance rates to businesses with creditworthy clients. Within the financial institutes segment, banks held the largest share, accounting for over 80% in 2022.', 'The manufacturing segment is the biggest client of factoring services with a market share of over 30%. The growth is characterized by early-pay discounts, bulk order incentives, and improved cash flow during seasonal fluctuations.

Apple Card The dance pairing Goldman Sachs with Apple for Apple Card started well, but as 2023 has progressed, has turned increasingly hostile. After months of reports about a disgruntled Goldman Sachs, the companies are expected to part ways in about a year. Apple chimed in on the reports, and said that the pair are still ""are focused on providing an incredible experience for our customers to help them lead healthier financial lives. The award-winning Apple Card has seen a great reception from consumers, and we will continue to innovate and deliver the best tools and services for them."" However, the breakup seems imminent. And, analysts suggested that Goldman Sachs could be replaced by American Express or Chase. But, when asked about it indirectly at the Goldman Sachs US Financial Services Conference, American Express CEO Steve Squeri seemed to throw cold water on the idea. ""When we look at co-brand partnerships - and we have over 50 co-brand partnerships - you\'re really looking for one plus one equals three,"" Squeri said without naming Apple Card specifically, as reported by Payments Dive on Thursday. Squeri went on to say that there need to be ""great value propositions"" for American Express when there\'s a partnership like there would have to be for Apple Card. Reportedly, a big consideration for Amex is premium customer targeting. ""Because that\'s what you want a co-brand partnership for, is the distribution, as well,"" Squeri said. ""And does it add value to both brands? And do you create premium economics? So, as we evaluate partnerships, that\'s the lens that we use."" It\'s not clear if Amex considers Apple Card holders ""premium."" Reportedly, one of the sticking points between Apple and Goldman Sachs was that Apple required very wide acceptance, which has reportedly lead to large losses for the lender. ""Sometimes the partner wants to reach into everybody, and that\'s just not who we are,"" Squeri added.']"

It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend.

To skip the detailed analysis of the energy industry and its outlook, go directly to Billionaires Are Betting On These 5 Energy Stocks.', 'The energy sector has been going through significant volatility over the past few years. While governments around the globe are enacting policies and regulations to promote the transition toward renewable energy, fossil fuels still play a crucial role in the global economy, and it is a formidable challenge to replace them quickly.', 'One of the biggest issues the markets faced last year was the economic disasters caused by disruptions in energy supply chains due to geopolitical tensions. The global economy suffered heavily due to the rising prices of oil and gas after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The US was hit by a 40-year high inflation and subsequent drastic rate hikes by the Federal Reserve to tackle it.', 'Moving on to 2023, oil and gas prices remained relatively low throughout the year. However, recent events such as the Hamas-Israel conflict coupled with production cuts from OPEC and Russia led to an increase in oil prices in the third quarter. The Middle East conflict created fears that the per-barrel oil prices might even touch as high as $150, and with interest rates already high, it could lead to an even more devastating impact on the global economy. Even though the conflict is still ongoing, the oil and gas prices have not gone much higher.', 'While the world is moving to transition completely to renewable energy, some challenges remain to consider. One of the biggest problems is the high cost of renewable energy infrastructure. The high-interest rate environment is one of the factors that is slowing down renewable investments. Furthermore, technological challenges coupled with the deep integration of fossil fuels in several economies around the globe are some hurdles that need to be taken care of.', 'Renewable energy investments hit a record high in 2023. In the first half of the current year, renewable energy investments went up 22% to $358 billion. Despite that, the energy sector as a whole did not perform well throughout the year. The third quarter gave the fossil fuels industry a little breather, but the segment still seems to be struggling.\xa0', 'Two-thirds of all renewable investments in the H1 were directed toward solar energy, yet it was the worst-performing industry, according to our November 1 report. Global X Solar ETF (NASDAQ:RAYS) performed somewhat better in the first quarter as it was up around 2%, but it kept going down the rest of the year. In the second quarter, the ETF was down by over 11% and declined by over 27% in the third quarter. Global X Solar ETF (NASDAQ:RAYS) is down nearly 44% year-to-date (at the time of writing on December 7).', 'Compared to that, Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLE)’s YTD declines are a mere 3.36%.\xa0 The fund declined nearly 1.9% in the first quarter and 2% in the second. However, in the third quarter, conventional energy proved to be the best-performing industry on the back of production cuts and the Middle-East conflict, gaining nearly 11.4%. Oil and gas stocks such as Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) were up 30% and 26%, respectively. On the other hand, some of the biggest renewable energy stocks, such as First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), declined by nearly 15% and 23% in Q3, respectively.', 'First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) are down 1.79% and 28.3% YTD at the time of writing, respectively.', 'After oil prices experienced volatility in the third quarter, the Brent crude oil spot price declined by $3 from September’s $94 average. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects the fourth quarter 2023 average per barrel price to be around $90 and remain around $94 per barrel in the first half of 2024 due to a modest decline in global inventories.', 'The EIA predicts that natural gas prices will average around $3.25 per Metric Million British Thermal Units (MMBtu) in 2024, which is slightly better than the current year’s $2.67. In addition, the agency believes that the prices will average around $3.40 this winter and will reach their peak in January 2024 at $3.60 per MMBtu.', 'According to a Deloitte report, the utility-scale solar capacity increased more than any other generation source between January and August 2023, and the additions were up 9% year-over-year (YoY). In 2022, renewables accounted for two-thirds of utility-scale power generation additions but accounted for half of the total new capacity additions in 2023, as wind additions were down 57% YoY. In 2024, the total renewable deployment is expected to increase by 17% YoY to 42 gigawatts.', 'Despite the current year not showing much favor toward renewable energy, some of the big names in the energy industry, like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) are making investments to capture a market share in the growing industry. On top of that, even the tech giant Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is making moves in the industry and announced adding 39 new renewable energy projects in Europe in 2023 alone.', 'While the energy industry has shown a lot of volatility in recent years, the sector has also proven to be a money-maker for its investors. In 2022, the oil Supermajors racked up over $200 billion in profits while the rest of the market was in shambles.

The donation from Simons was the largest unrestricted donation to an institution of higher education in US history, per news publication Forbes. Simons, who oversees one of the largest hedge funds in the world, called it a gift for a wonderful institution.\xa0', 'Simons can afford to donate this much money to his alma mater because of his incredible success in the finance world. Before becoming a hedge fund titan worth more than $30 billion, Simons used to study and teach at Stony Brook. This was in the early 1950s and 1960s, before he left the school to start his hedge fund. In the years since, his fund has grown exponentially, becoming the envy of everyone on Wall Street. At the end of September, the value of the equity portfolio at Renaissance Technologies was over $58 billion.\xa0', ""There aren't any hedge fund managers on Wall Street with the mathematics prowess of Simons. To put this into additional context, Simons, in addition to being one of the richest men in the world, helped the development of string theory in physics through his work in pattern recognition. He has several degrees in mathematics, including a doctorate from the University of California. Simons even worked at the National Security Agency in the 1960s to break codes owning to his mathematical genius. He was also employed at famous colleges like Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University for teaching his favorite subject."", 'Simons employs mathematics in his trades as well. Renaissance Technologies uses computerized models to isolate non-random movements in equities, bonds, currencies, and other securities. Simons then makes calculated bets on the upward or downward trajectory of these cases. Gregory Zuckerman, a veteran Wall Street reporter, claims in his book The Man Who Solved the\xa0Market that Medallion, the flagship fund for the Simon hedge fund, closed to outside investors, has earned more than $100 billion for investors since it was founded. Averaging this number to 2018, when the book was released, this translates to average gross annual return of more than 66% and average net annual return of close to 40%.', 'Simons employs quant investing strategies at the stock market. Latest filings reveal that between June and September this year, the value of the equity portfolio of his fund decreased by about $10 billion. During this period, Simons made new purchases in 465 stocks, additional purchases in 1,329, sold out of 713, and reduced holdings in 1,801 stocks. Some of the top stocks in the Renaissance Technologies portfolio include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc.

NFLX reiterated expectations for full year 2023 operating margins of 18-20%, and guided free cash flow to at least $5 billion, up from prior guidance of $3.5 billion.

Weighted average 2023 revenue growth expectations for the portfolio were up 3.8% during the third quarter or up 0.8% if we exclude NVIDIA. We wrote at length about NVIDIA earlier this year, but it is worth mentioning that the company has continued to exceed its own projections and the Street’s most optimistic expectations. After raising its revenue and EPS guidance for 2023 by 40% and 69%, respectively, following its last quarter, NVIDIA increased it further by 26% and 35%, respectively, after reporting the most recent one. Consensus expectations now call for revenues to grow 94% this year, while earnings per share are expected to increase by 192%. You may have seen these kinds of growth rates before, but we doubt you saw them from a company generating $50 billion in revenues. The skeptics who continue to question and doubt the accelerating demand for Generative artificial intelligence forgot to tell NVIDIA about it. But we digress…back to the portfolio…profit expectations have risen even faster than revenues and were up 11% during the third quarter (or up 7.8% ex-NVIDIA) with margin expectations up 149bps (107bps ex-NVIDIA). So, broadly speaking, our companies are seeing improvement in overall business trends, which flow through to their bottom lines, driving higher margins.

However, the drug is enabling patients to live longer, and the drug’s patient base is growing. Also, the company is developing a more potent formulation that we believe could increase efficacy while giving Vertex an opportunity to reprice and improve margins. Finally, its cystic fibrosis franchise is very cash generative, and the company has been using the capital to invest in a pipeline that we believe includes some interesting longer term opportunities.

First, its competitive position strengthened when a competitor, AbbVie, announced it will discontinue all work in cystic fibrosis.

The figure marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.49 billion. However, total revenues rose 6.4% year over year, primarily driven by higher sales of Trikafta/Kaftrio (marketed as Kaftrio in Europe) in the U.S. and ex-U.S. markets.CF product sales rose 7% year over year in the United States to $1.55 billion. Outside the United States, sales increased 6% to $929 million, driven by the continued strong uptake of Trikafta/Kaftrio in markets with recently achieved reimbursement as well expanded use in younger age groups.Trikafta generated sales worth $2.27 billion, up 13.1% year over year. Trikafta sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate of $2.26 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively.The upside was driven by the continued robust performance of Trikafta in the United States, fueled by label expansions to younger age groups (two to five years old). In the ex-U.S. markets, the drug continues to witness strong uptake with recently achieved reimbursements and expanded use in young age groups.Sales from other CF products, namely Symdeko/Symkevi, Kalydeco and Orkambi, were down 35.4% year over year to $209.2 million. Sales of these drugs were hurt by patients switching to Trikafta.Symdeko/Symkevi registered sales of $33.4 million in the quarter, down 12.6% year over year.Kalydeco recorded sales of $112.8 million in the quarter, down 19% year over year. Orkambi generated sales of $63.0 million in the reported quarter, down 56.9% from the prior-year quarter.', 'Adjusted operating expense was $993.0 million in the quarter, up 31% year over year, driven by higher R&D costs.Adjusted R&D expenses rose 32.4% from the year-ago quarter’s levels to $726 million due to the expansion of the company’s mid- and late-stage pipeline.Adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 19.6% to $215.7 million in the reported quarter due to expenses for CF launches and pre-commercial activities for exa-cel.During the reported quarter, Vertex recorded Acquired IPR&D costs of $51.7 million compared with $29 million in the year-ago quarter.Adjusted operating income was $1.17 billion in the quarter, down 9% from the prior-year period.', 'Based on the solid uptake of Trikafta/Kaftrio worldwide, Vertex raised its 2023 CF product revenue guidance.

We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Stryker's  ROE in this article."", ""ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits."", ' See our latest analysis for Stryker ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Stryker is:', '14% = US$2.6b ÷ US$18b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.14 in profit."", 'We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company\'s future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.', ""To begin with, Stryker seems to have a respectable ROE. Especially when compared to the industry average of 9.5% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. For this reason, Stryker's five year net income decline of 3.2% raises the question as to why the high ROE didn't translate into earnings growth. Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital."", ""However, when we compared Stryker's growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 9.7% in the same period. This is quite worrisome."", 'Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is Stryker fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.', ""Looking at its three-year median payout ratio of 49% (or a retention ratio of 51%) which is pretty normal, Stryker's declining earnings is rather baffling as one would expect to see a fair bit of growth when a company is retaining a good portion of its profits. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating."", ""In addition, Stryker has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 29% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 22%, over the same period."", ""Overall, we feel that Stryker certainly does have some positive factors to consider.

Recently, Thomas Indelicarto, the Executive Vice President, General Counsel, and Secretary of VeriSign Inc (NASDAQ:VRSN), sold 613 shares of the company on December 5, 2023. This transaction has caught the attention of market watchers and raises questions about the potential implications for VeriSign's stock performance."", ""Thomas Indelicarto serves as the Executive Vice President, General Counsel, and Secretary of VeriSign Inc. In his role, Indelicarto is responsible for overseeing the legal aspects of the company's operations, including compliance with regulatory requirements and the management of legal risks.

VeriSign's services are critical for the operation of the internet, enabling billions of people and devices to connect online with reliability and confidence."", 'The recent sale by Thomas Indelicarto is part of a broader pattern of insider selling at VeriSign Inc. Over the past year, Indelicarto has sold a total of 11,048 shares and has not made any purchases. This trend is consistent with the overall insider transaction history for the company, which shows 0 insider buys and 62 insider sells over the same timeframe.', ""The relationship between insider selling and stock price can be complex. While insider sales can sometimes signal a lack of confidence in the company's future prospects, they can also be motivated by personal financial planning or diversification needs. In the case of VeriSign, the insider selling has not necessarily been a bearish signal for the stock price. It's important to consider the context of these transactions and the company's overall financial health."", ""On the day of Indelicarto's recent sale, shares of VeriSign Inc were trading at $218.54, giving the company a market cap of $22.05 billion. The price-earnings ratio of 30.77 is higher than both the industry median of 26.84 and VeriSign's historical median, suggesting a premium valuation compared to its peers and its own past trading multiples.However, when considering the GuruFocus Value (GF Value) of $242.67, VeriSign Inc appears to be modestly undervalued with a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 0.9."", 'The GF Value is calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates. This intrinsic value estimate indicates that, despite the insider selling activity, the stock may still hold value for potential investors.', 'The insider selling by Thomas Indelicarto at VeriSign Inc is a noteworthy event for investors and analysts. While the pattern of insider sales over the past year could be interpreted in various ways, the current valuation metrics suggest that the stock may still be an attractive investment opportunity.

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward."", 'We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.', ' See our latest analysis for Sempra ', ""We have to calculate the value of Sempra slightly differently to other stocks because it is a integrated utilities company. Instead of using free cash flows, which are hard to estimate and often not reported by analysts in this industry, dividends per share (DPS) payments are used. Unless a company pays out the majority of its FCF as a dividend, this method will typically underestimate the value of the stock. We use the Gordon Growth Model, which assumes dividend will grow into perpetuity at a rate that can be sustained. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a company's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In this case we used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%). The expected dividend per share is then discounted to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.2%. Compared to the current share price of US$73.0, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind."", 'Value Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)', '= US$2.5 / (6.2% – 2.2%)', '= US$63.6', ""Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Sempra as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business."", 'Strength', 'Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.', 'Weakness', 'Interest payments on debt are not well covered.', 'Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Integrated Utilities market.', 'Opportunity', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.', 'Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.', 'Threat', 'Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow.', 'Paying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.', 'Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.', ""Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company.

While governments around the globe are enacting policies and regulations to promote the transition toward renewable energy, fossil fuels still play a crucial role in the global economy, and it is a formidable challenge to replace them quickly.', 'One of the biggest issues the markets faced last year was the economic disasters caused by disruptions in energy supply chains due to geopolitical tensions. The global economy suffered heavily due to the rising prices of oil and gas after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The US was hit by a 40-year high inflation and subsequent drastic rate hikes by the Federal Reserve to tackle it.', 'Moving on to 2023, oil and gas prices remained relatively low throughout the year. However, recent events such as the Hamas-Israel conflict coupled with production cuts from OPEC and Russia led to an increase in oil prices in the third quarter. The Middle East conflict created fears that the per-barrel oil prices might even touch as high as $150, and with interest rates already high, it could lead to an even more devastating impact on the global economy. Even though the conflict is still ongoing, the oil and gas prices have not gone much higher.', 'While the world is moving to transition completely to renewable energy, some challenges remain to consider. One of the biggest problems is the high cost of renewable energy infrastructure. The high-interest rate environment is one of the factors that is slowing down renewable investments. Furthermore, technological challenges coupled with the deep integration of fossil fuels in several economies around the globe are some hurdles that need to be taken care of.', 'Renewable energy investments hit a record high in 2023.

This one saying illustrates the importance of the U.S. economy to the world, the country with the highest GDP in the world not just in 2022 but for at least a century now. Over the past decade, the U.S. economy has seen performance levels that will be impossible for even it to replicate in the future, and its higher government spending and tax cuts have helped cash flow through global markets in addition to domestic markets. One example of U.S. influence on the global economy can be seen in the 2008 recession, which started off in the U.S., but its impact reverberated across the world as the U.S. was driving global growth rates, led by the most valuable American companies today.', 'A financial trader monitoring stock charts and indicators on a high tech computer setup.', 'Currently, the U.S., like most countries, has struggled to contain record inflation, which in turn have led to consistent hikes in interest rates by the Federal Reserve and has seen its economic growth slow down. Towards the end of 2022, fears of a recession in the U.S. were continuing to increase, even as U.S. stock markets saw their worst first half in nearly half a century. Most stocks, with a particular focus on tech, were absolutely devastated and the NASDAQ-100, where most of the top tech stocks including many of the most valuable American companies today are listed, finished with a full-year loss of 32.4% while the S&P 500 recorded a loss of 18.1%.\xa0 However, a more positive than expected landing delayed fears of a recession, and now, expectations of a recession in 2024 are abating further, with an expected growth rate of 1.5% for 2024, after a spectacular landing in Q3 2023.', ""Even as the warnings of a recession continued to ramp up, the U.S. delivered growth of nearly 5% in Q3 2023, with an increase in wages from a tight labor market contributing to increased consumer spending and hence, an uplift in the country's economy. On the other hand, there is still some cause for concern as business investment declined for the first time in two years, and while the performance in Q3 was extraordinary, growth in Q4 is still expected to slow down as student loan payments resume, strikes from the United Auto Workers take place and the delayed impact of rate hikes affects performance. According to a Morgan Stanley report in August 2023, consumer spending declining in 2024 is a major risk for the country as current household savings are estimated to be a mere $350 billion, and student loans and credit-card balances could result in household savings running out in Q1 2024. Additionally, the U.S. Treasury is likely to issue around $1 trillion in debt in 2023 which would make the financial system of the U.S. more illiquid and the Bank of Japan allowing the country's interest rates to increase could also see more investment being diverted to the Asian giant."", ""One of the primary drivers behind the economic dominance of the U.S. is its innovation, which is why it is the most advanced country in the world. This is also why tech stocks are generally among the most valuable American companies today, and further innovations will continue to help in advancing America's economy. One such example is the country's advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is perhaps the hottest industry in the world right now. Some of the most valuable companies in America today have invested heavily in AI, and we'll discuss their investments and approaches to AI in more detail when mentioning which companies make our list."", 'Similarly, tech stocks have dominated U.S. stock performance in 2023, and rebounded strongly from the disastrous performance in 2022.

In many ways, 2024 could be a good year, but investors ought to always be prepared for a broader range of scenarios (including a hard landing) with more defensively-focused firms like healthcare stocks (UNH, BIIB, and HUM will be covered in this piece).', 'Therefore, let’s use TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to see how a trio of highly-rated healthcare stocks stack up if that “Goldilocks” market environment (falling rates, soaring earnings) just isn’t in the cards for 2024.', 'UnitedHealth Group is a stellar long-term performer that’s seen momentum stall in recent years. Over the past year and three quarters, UNH stock has stayed well below its long-term ceiling of resistance of around $555. Even after the latest surge on the back of an upbeat annual Investor Day and quarterly earnings beat (Q3 adjusted earnings per share of $6.56 vs. $6.33 estimate on $92.4 billion revenue), that resistance level still seems like a high hurdle that’ll be tough to pass. In any case, I’m a fan of the firm’s continued focus on value-based care and am inclined to stay bullish alongside the analyst community.', 'The stock goes for 23.9 times trailing price-to-earnings, a premium to the healthcare plan industry average of 19.4 times. That’s a well-deserved premium, given that its medical loss ratio (MLR) — a performance metric (lower is better) used to gauge managed health providers — has been on the right track of late, hitting 82.3% in the latest quarter, topping estimates by an impressive 50 bps.', 'Additionally, the firm has a habit of raising the bar, recently hiking the low end of full-year adjusted net earnings by a slight margin.', 'Further, as weight-loss (GLP-1) drugs become more widespread, I’d look for UnitedHealth’s MLR to fall even further from here. Pending negative, unforeseen health consequences of such drugs, I do view their rise to glory as a potential long-term positive for the firm. Lower obesity rates could spell a lower chance of health consequences, and coverage for GLP-1 drugs is sure to be viewed in a positive light by customers.', 'UnitedHealth is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 16 Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The average UNH stock price target of $596.00 implies 8.46% upside potential.', 'Humana is another health insurance play that’s seen longer-term momentum stall out in recent years. The company has been in rally mode since mid-summer, led higher by promising quarterly earnings reports. At a slight discount to UnitedHealth, Humana certainly seems like a more value-rich way to play the managed care space and the potential tailwind sparked by GLP-1 drugs.', 'Of late, the big headline has revolved around a potential merger with fellow health insurer Cigna (NYSE:CI) in what would be a sure blockbuster. Reportedly, there are talks of a stock-and-cash deal that could be inked by year’s end. Specifics to the deal are hazy right now, but the chatter has managed to pummel shares of Humana and Cigna just over a week ago. Further, any such merger could be struck down by anti-trust regulators.', 'I view the negative reaction as overblown and a potential opportunity for value-conscious contrarians. Deal or no deal, I can’t help but be bullish on Humana as it continues to navigate through profound macro uncertainties.', 'At 20.7 times trailing price-to-earnings, HUM is still trading at a premium to the healthcare plan industry average of 19.4 times. That said, I view the narrow premium as justified, given the potential synergies to be had if Humana were to tie up with Cigna.', 'Humana stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, based on 11 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. The average HUM stock price target of $585.57 entails 21.04% upside potential.', 'Biogen is a biotech company that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) briefly invested in several years ago. Recently, Biogen stock has been a major dud, sinking over 28% in the past five years. Biogen may be perceived as a value trap to some, but I think there’s real value to be had for patient investors. As such, I’m staying bullish on the stock as it looks to gain some sort of meaningful traction on the back of its latest acquisition.', 'The company has a solid portfolio of treatments for neurological conditions like Alzheimer’s. The purchase of Reata Pharmaceuticals, which bolstered Biogen’s rare disease portfolio, helped propel the firm to its first quarter of sales growth in three years.', 'Biogen’s managers believe they’re in a spot to sustain long-term growth. However, it doesn’t seem like investors are buying what they’re selling. The stock is in a major funk right now, and that alone is enough to stay in more of a “wait-and-see” mode. At 2.33 times price-to-book (P/B), below the 4.89 times of the biotech industry average, Biogen stock sure does look deeply discounted. However, until the firm can prove it can keep the growth going strong, don’t expect shares to reverse course in the near term.', 'Nonetheless, the analyst community continues to praise the name. And it’s hard not to, given the potential upside as the firm aims to turn the growth tides. Though untimely, I think there’s a lot of gain by giving management the benefit of the doubt in its much-awaited return to growth.', 'Biogen sits at a Strong Buy on TipRanks based on 19 Buys and six Holds assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average BIIB stock price target of $313.17 implies 33.9% upside potential.', 'Healthcare stocks can be a great place to profit from defensive growth. Should 2024 not live up to the hopeful expectations of investors, the following trio of stocks may be worth a look. Of the trio, analysts see the most upside from BIIB (a whopping ~34%).', 'Disclosure']"

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So when we looked at LKQ (NASDAQ:LKQ) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.', ""For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for LKQ, this is the formula:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.12 = US$1.4b ÷ (US$15b - US$3.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""Thus, LKQ has an ROCE of 12%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty standard return but compared to the Retail Distributors industry average it falls behind."", ' See our latest analysis for LKQ ', ""In the above chart we have measured LKQ's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for LKQ."", ""LKQ's ROCE growth is quite impressive. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 32% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward."", ""To bring it all together, LKQ has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. Since the stock has returned a solid 88% to shareholders over the last five years, it's fair to say investors are beginning to recognize these changes. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue."", ""One more thing, we've spotted   2 warning signs  facing LKQ that you might find interesting."", ""While LKQ may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

We had expected LFL revenues to increase by 8.9%.Adjusted gross margin came in at 63.5%, contracting 60 basis points (bps) from 64.1% reported in the year-ago quarter.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Abercrombie & Fitch ANF and Adidas’ ADDYY.', 'Here is a synopsis of all four stocks.', 'Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock Zoom Video Communications is a video conferencing platform company that enables people to connect and communicate virtually. Zoom is the most popular conferencing platform and allows users to conduct online meetings, webinars, and virtual conferences through audio and video. Users can join Zoom meetings from various devices, making it a versatile and widely accessible communication solution. With features like screen sharing, chat, and collaboration tools, Zoom has become popular for remote work, online education and social interactions. The platform gained significant traction, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, and continues to be a go-to choice for virtual meetings and remote collaboration.', 'The work-from-home trend is likely here to stay due to several factors. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of remote work, prompting companies to invest in technologies that support virtual collaboration. Many employees reported experiencing increased flexibility and improved work-life balance during this period, leading to a desire for continued remote work options. Additionally, many employers saw cost savings associated with reduced office space, operational expenses, and actually experienced increased productivity in many instances. While many industries require employees to show up in person, the success of remote work during the pandemic demonstrated that it is a viable and productive model for many industries.', 'As the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, Zoom was in the right place, at the right time. However, Zoom’s earnings were brought forward, and as they normalized, investors jumped ship. Nonetheless, Zoom’s expanding international footprint, security and privacy improvement efforts, and the hybrid/remote working wave, are helping the company to re-accelerate earnings.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Most impressively, since its debut in April 2019, Zoom has beat Zacks Consensus Estimates in each quarter.', 'In the heat of the pandemic, ZM shares clearly got ahead of themselves when the price-to-earnings (p/e) ratio reached 500x. However, now that the stock has corrected from over $500 to under $70, shares once again look attractive from a valuation perspective. In fact, Zoom’s p/e ratio of 14.03x means that it is now cheaper than the S&P 500 Index.', 'Zoom has a strong balance sheet and generates significant cash flow, making it an attractive stock for investors. The company had cash and cash equivalents worth $6.49 billion as of October 31st. The company’s ability to generate strong cash flows will enable it to make major investments in product development and acquisitions in the future.', 'Zoom Video Communications stands out as a leader in the video conference space. With its versatile platform, the work-from-home trend, and the favorable valuation, shares should be higher in six to twelve months.', 'Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) Estee Lauder is a renowned beauty and cosmetics company specializing in the manufacturing and marketing of skincare, makeup, fragrance, and hair care products. Founded by Estee Lauder herself, the company has become a global leader in the beauty industry. Estee Lauder offers a wide range of high-quality beauty products under various brands, including Estee Lauder, Clinique, MAC, Bobbi Brown, and others. Most of Estee Lauder’s products are available at department stores, specialty retailers, and online, catering to a diverse customer base.', 'Weakness in Asia, particularly in China, is weighing on EL shares. Unfortunately, China’s economic woes have dragged on for years with no end in sight. For example, the iShares China ETF, a proxy for large-cap Chinese equities, is working on its fifth consecutive monthly loss and is down ~18% year-to-date. Meanwhile, the earnings picture looks bleak. For the December quarter, Zacks Consensus Analyst Estimates anticipate EPS growth to slow by a whopping 64.29%.', 'Though shares of Estee Lauder have plummeted 46% year-to-date, they remain unattractive from a valuation perspective. Estee Lauder’s p/e ratio of 57x is much higher than that of the S&P 500 Index and its peers. Slowing growth coupled with a rich valuation is not a good sign for EL investors.', 'A slew of new, innovative, and flexible competitors has entered the market and is stealing market share from old, legacy, and less “cool” brands like EL. For example, over the past five years, e.l.f.Beautyhave increased by over 1,000%, while Estee Lauder shares are lower. Unfavorable global currency trends and geopolitical disruptions in critical areas like the Middle East are making it more challenging for more prominent players like EL.', 'Estee Lauder faces significant challenges as it navigates a landscape market by international economic uncertainties, a stretched valuation, and fierce competition. Once a global leader, the company is grappling with the impact of China’s economic struggles, a concerning earnings outlook, and increased competition from innovative rivals.', 'The holiday shopping season is a focal point for retailers and apparel companies with the last few months being very kind to Abercrombie & Fitch and Adidas’ stock.', 'With Christmas approaching, Abercrombie and Adidas shares may be early to what is hopefully an end-of-the-year and infamous Santa Claus rally. Hitting their 52-week highs this week both remain top-rated Zacks stocks at the moment.', 'Adidas shares have now rebounded and soared +57% in 2023 as the footwear and sporting apparel leader has been able to put inventory issues from the fallout with fashion collaborator Kanye West behind it. As for Abercrombie, its resurgence as a high-quality casual apparel retailer has been underestimated upon easing inflation with its stock catapulting over +240% YTD.', 'Continuing the ascension of Abercrombie and Adidas shares were their favorable third quarter results in November after widely surpassing Q2 bottom line expectations during the summer.', 'Abercrombie’s Q3 earnings of $1.83 per share blasted the Zacks Consensus of $1.14 a share by 60% and skyrocketed from $0.01 a share in the prior year quarter. On the top line, Q3 sales of $1.05 billion came in 8% above estimates and soared 19% from $880.08 million a year ago.', 'Similarly, Adidas easily surpassed Q3 earnings expectations with EPS at $0.76 per share and 46% above estimates of $0.52 a share. Third quarter earnings also leaped 347% year over year from $0.17 a share in Q3 2022. Quarterly sales of $6.52 billion topped estimates by 3% and was up a percentage point from the comparative quarter.', ""Since reporting strong Q3 results, Abercrombie's current fiscal 2024 EPS estimates have soared 30% over the last 30 days from $4.44 a share to $5.76 per share. Even better, FY25 EPS estimates have climbed 24% in the last month from $4.42 a share to $5.50 per share."", 'Meanwhile, Adidas’ fiscal 2023 earnings estimates now call for an adjusted loss of -$0.16 a share compared to -$0.13 a share 30 days ago but FY24 EPS estimates have risen 2% and are expected to be further in the black next year at $2.18 a share versus $2.08 per share a month ago.', 'After reaching 52-weeks highs in December, Abercrombie’s stock currently boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while Adidas stock sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). As we move closer to rounding out 2023, the strengthening outlook for both companies next year is still compelling and may lead to more short-term upside.', ""Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

More and more young investors are gravitating towards the idea of investing their money into broader market index funds instead of individual stocks. Jeremy Siegel in his book “Stocks for the Long Run” wrote a chapter titled “Building Wealth Through Stocks.” In this chapter the Professor of Finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia shares some data showing how difficult it is to say with confidence that the money manager you are trusting with your savings actually knows their job.', '“Even if money managers choose stocks that have an expected return of 1 percent per year better than the market, there is only a 62.7 percent probability that they will exceed the average market return after 10 years and only a 71.2 percent probability that they will exceed the average market return after 30 years. If managers pick stocks that will outperform the market by 2 percent per year, there is still only a 74.0 percent chance that they will outperform the market after 10 years. This means there is a 1-in-4 chance that they will still fall short of the average market performance.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the top 5 most valuable American companies today.', 'When the U.S. sneezes, the world catches a cold. This one saying illustrates the importance of the U.S. economy to the world, the country with the highest GDP in the world not just in 2022 but for at least a century now. Over the past decade, the U.S. economy has seen performance levels that will be impossible for even it to replicate in the future, and its higher government spending and tax cuts have helped cash flow through global markets in addition to domestic markets. One example of U.S. influence on the global economy can be seen in the 2008 recession, which started off in the U.S., but its impact reverberated across the world as the U.S. was driving global growth rates, led by the most valuable American companies today.', 'A financial trader monitoring stock charts and indicators on a high tech computer setup.', 'Currently, the U.S., like most countries, has struggled to contain record inflation, which in turn have led to consistent hikes in interest rates by the Federal Reserve and has seen its economic growth slow down. Towards the end of 2022, fears of a recession in the U.S. were continuing to increase, even as U.S. stock markets saw their worst first half in nearly half a century. Most stocks, with a particular focus on tech, were absolutely devastated and the NASDAQ-100, where most of the top tech stocks including many of the most valuable American companies today are listed, finished with a full-year loss of 32.4% while the S&P 500 recorded a loss of 18.1%.\xa0 However, a more positive than expected landing delayed fears of a recession, and now, expectations of a recession in 2024 are abating further, with an expected growth rate of 1.5% for 2024, after a spectacular landing in Q3 2023.', ""Even as the warnings of a recession continued to ramp up, the U.S. delivered growth of nearly 5% in Q3 2023, with an increase in wages from a tight labor market contributing to increased consumer spending and hence, an uplift in the country's economy. On the other hand, there is still some cause for concern as business investment declined for the first time in two years, and while the performance in Q3 was extraordinary, growth in Q4 is still expected to slow down as student loan payments resume, strikes from the United Auto Workers take place and the delayed impact of rate hikes affects performance. According to a Morgan Stanley report in August 2023, consumer spending declining in 2024 is a major risk for the country as current household savings are estimated to be a mere $350 billion, and student loans and credit-card balances could result in household savings running out in Q1 2024. Additionally, the U.S. Treasury is likely to issue around $1 trillion in debt in 2023 which would make the financial system of the U.S. more illiquid and the Bank of Japan allowing the country's interest rates to increase could also see more investment being diverted to the Asian giant."", ""One of the primary drivers behind the economic dominance of the U.S. is its innovation, which is why it is the most advanced country in the world. This is also why tech stocks are generally among the most valuable American companies today, and further innovations will continue to help in advancing America's economy. One such example is the country's advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is perhaps the hottest industry in the world right now. Some of the most valuable companies in America today have invested heavily in AI, and we'll discuss their investments and approaches to AI in more detail when mentioning which companies make our list."", 'Similarly, tech stocks have dominated U.S. stock performance in 2023, and rebounded strongly from the disastrous performance in 2022. The total return of the Nasdaq composite in 2023 has been 22.51% YTD, and many top tech stocks have seen their share price more than double in these 10 months! However, what goes up, must come down and in the past few days, Nasdaq has taken a beating after some tech stocks underperformed expectations in Q3 2023 and suffered heavy losses. However, towards the end of the week starting 23rd October, Nasdaq did see its performance increase thanks to confidence boosting performances from some of the most valuable American companies today.', 'Methodology', ""To determine the most valuable American companies today, we headed over to Yahoo Finance and first determined the 100 most valuable American companies today, which were then sorted by their market cap.

For instance, among the stocks in the S&P 500, those paying dividends in 2022 decreased by 11.1%, whereas the ones that didn't pay dividends experienced a larger loss of 38.7%.

Looking back to 1960, approximately 69% of the overall return of the S&P 500 Index can be traced back to dividends that were reinvested, harnessing the strength of compounding. As mentioned above, dividend growers are more popular among investors because of their ability to provide regular and growing cash. According to a report by Hartford Funds, companies that either started paying dividends or increased their dividends have seen the most substantial returns compared to other stocks since 1973. Importantly, these stocks have shown considerably less fluctuation and volatility in their performance.

Fortunately, dividend stocks have demonstrated robust performance in past periods marked by inflation. The S&P U.S. Dividend Growers Index and S&P Global ex-U.S. Dividend Growers Index include companies that have raised dividends for 10 and 7 years respectively.

555,8af40e24-75db-33ae-8c08-7be1b25cc478,PG,2023-12-08,4 Stocks With Impressive Interest Coverage Ratio to Snap Up,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-impressive-interest-coverage-160200319.html,1701878520,STORY,"['PG', 'MOD']","['Given the current economic scenario, investors should gauge the changing market dynamics and accordingly chalk out a sturdy investment strategy. Well, you can decide to buy or sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers. However, such a strategy does not always warrant superior returns when the market faces a myriad of issues. A critical analysis of the company’s financial background is always required for a better investment decision.Well, a company should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations. This can be judged with coverage ratios — the higher these are, the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations. Here, we have discussed one such ratio called the interest coverage ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Everest Group, Ltd. EG, Modine Manufacturing Company MOD, Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. STRL and The Procter & Gamble Company PG are four stocks with an impressive interest coverage ratio.', ""The interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on a company's profits. The company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, the interest coverage ratio is one of the essential criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.The interest coverage ratio suggests the number of times interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship. One should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time."", ""Apart from having an interest coverage ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest coverage ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the 15 stocks that qualified for the screening:Everest Group, a global underwriting leader providing best-in-class property, casualty and specialty reinsurance and insurance solutions, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a VGM Score of A.

The aggregate dividend for 2023 is 67.50 cents per share.Solid dividend payouts remain the biggest attraction for REIT investors. However, in April 2023, the company postponed the dividend payment until the end of 2023, projecting reduced taxable income for this year, mainly due to higher interest expenses.Before this, in January 2023, VNO had announced a 29.2% cut in its quarterly cash dividend from 53 cents per share to 37.50 cents per share. \xa0For 2024, Vornado anticipates paying a single common share dividend in the fourth quarter of the following year as part of its common share dividend policy for the year.The United States office real estate market has remained choppy for almost the entirety of 2023, with negative absorption and increasing vacancy levels. The lackluster environment can be attributed to the continuation of work-from-home, flexible or hybrid work setups, which have diminished office space utilization.Although the demand for premier office spaces remains healthy and continues to aid leasing activity at the company’s properties, which have a significant presence in New York City, persistent macroeconomic uncertainty has led to an overall slowdown in leasing activity.This has most likely curbed the company’s potential to reach its full leasing capacity over the past few quarters, stalling its growth temp to a certain extent. In the third quarter of 2023, occupancy in the New York portfolio was 89.9%, down 40 basis points year over year.In addition, with prevailing high-interest rates, Vornado’s interest expenses have gone up significantly. In the third quarter of 2023, interest and debt expense rose 14.8% year over year, hurting the company’s funds from operations (FFO) per share growth. The company may also find it difficult to purchase or develop real estate with borrowed funds in a high-interest rate environment as the costs are likely to be on the higher side.Therefore, it becomes imperative for Vornado to focus on maintaining its retained cash flow at desirable levels and preserve balance sheet strength.As of Sep 30, 2023, the company had $3.2 billion of liquidity, consisting of $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and $ 1.9 billion available under its $2.5-billion revolving credit facilities. \xa0Analysts seem bearish on this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Vornado’s 2023 FFO does not indicate a favorable outlook as it has been revised 1.1% downward over the past month.Its shares have gained 24.6% in the quarter-to-date period compared with its industry’s 11.9% growth.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Some better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are EastGroup Properties EGP, Stag Industrial STAG and Park Hotels & Resorts PK.

The move is likely to enhance the company’s financial flexibility, poising it well to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Shares of MAC gained 2.16% on the Dec 6 normal trading session on the NYSE following the announcement.The new CMBS loan, which is interest only throughout the entire loan term, bears a fixed interest rate of 6.60% and matures on Dec 6, 2028. It replaces the existing $666 million loan that was set to mature on Jan 1, 2024.Notably, the retail real estate investment trust has collectively, along with multiple other deals, completed loan transactions worth $2.7 billion ($1.9 billion at the company’s share). This was inclusive of the renewal of the company’s corporate credit facility in September 2023, whereby it amended and restated a new $650 million revolving credit facility, enhancing its liquidity position by $125 million.With the pandemic’s impact waning, the demand for retail real estate has remained robust over the past few quarters. As a result, Macerich’s shopping centers, located in densely populated areas with an affluent customer base having significant disposable income, are witnessing healthy demand from retailers as they continue to rent out more physical store spaces. This has led to robust leasing activity and occupancy gains.Tysons Corner Center is one such super-regional retail powerhouse that is experiencing healthy retail demand. The shopping center is among MAC’s top 10 regional town centers and gets around 16 million annual visits. The property, anchored by Nordstrom, Bloomingdale’s and Macy’s, generates around $1,200 sales per square foot. At the end of the third quarter of 2023, the center’s leased occupancy was 96%.It is noteworthy that from the beginning of 2023 through Sep 30, MAC signed leases for 3.14 million square feet. This indicates a 10% increase in square footage signed from the year-ago period.Additionally, Macerich’s redevelopment efforts augur well for long-term growth. The recent leasing changes and targeted renovations made at Kings Plaza in Brooklyn have not only revitalized the shopping center but also positioned Macerich as a dominant player in the New York City metro area.The highlight of this transformation is the fully remerchandised former Sears space at Kings Plaza, Brooklyn's only enclosed mall. Macerich's strategic leasing decisions have attracted prominent brands and the stores now open in the former Sears box include a three-level Target, Primark, Zara and Burlington. These new stores are poised to deliver a combined annual sales figure nearly eight times higher than the previous Sears store.Macerich is also redeveloping a three-level space (formerly occupied by Bloomingdale’s and Arclight Theatre) spanning around 150,000 square feet at its Santa Monica Place regional town center in California with an estimated total project cost of $35-$40 million.The redeveloped area will include an entertainment destination use, high-end fitness and co-working space, and will open in phases beginning in 2024 through 2025. As of Sep 30, 2023, Macerich had incurred around $2.2 million of the cost.Hence, with added financial flexibility and a well-laddered debt maturity profile, MAC seems well-positioned to carry out its development/redevelopment activities and bank on growth opportunities. As of Oct 31, 2023, the company had around $665 million of liquidity, including $515 million of available capacity on its newly expanded credit facility.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 25.0% over the past month compared with the industry’s 8.8% growth."", '\xa0', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', '\xa0', 'Nonetheless, growing e-commerce adoption may weigh on Macerich’s prospects. Online retailing will likely remain a popular choice among customers, thus adversely impacting the market share for brick-and-mortar stores.A slowdown in the economy amid persistent macroeconomic uncertainty and a high-interest rate environment could limit consumers’ willingness to spend, thus stalling the company’s growth tempo to some extent.Also, with prevailing high-interest rates, Macerich may find it difficult to purchase or develop real estate with borrowed funds as the costs are likely to be on the higher side.', 'Some better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are EastGroup Properties EGP, Stag Industrial STAG and Park Hotels & Resorts PK.

Furthermore, in our trial, the regimen had a short monitoring time and a convenient, response-adapted administration schedule that enabled deep responders to go from every two-week to every four-week dosing.

Additionally, 17% were Black or African American, mirroring rates that are representative of MM in the U.S.', 'Based on the latest data cut, all patients treated with 200 mg experienced an adverse event (AE), including 85% who experienced Grade ≥3 adverse events (AE). The most commonly occurring AE was cytokine release syndrome (CRS; 46%). Of the CRS cases, the majority (35%) were Grade 1, 10% were Grade 2 and there was one case (1%) of Grade 3 CRS. Adjudicated immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) events occurred in 9 patients (8% all Grades); Grade 3 ICANS occurred in 3 patients, and no cases of ≥Grade 4 cases.

Patients were administered linvoseltamab utilizing a step-up dosing regimen that was designed to help mitigate CRS.', 'The Phase 1 intravenous dose-escalation portion of the trial, which is now complete, primarily assessed safety, tolerability and dose-limiting toxicities across nine dose levels of linvoseltamab exploring different administration regimens. The Phase 2 dose expansion portion of the trial (LINKER-MM1) is further assessing the safety and anti-tumor activity of linvoseltamab, with a primary objective of ORR.

Additionally, a late-breaking oral presentation will detail the first results from a Phase 2 trial investigating neoadjuvant Libtayo in combination with low-dose stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).', '“Our ESMO IO presentations highlight the continued progress of Regeneron’s oncology pipeline, which was strategically curated to have the potential to offer novel and differentiated combinations targeting several types of difficult-to-treat cancers. We look forward to sharing first clinical data from our costimulatory bispecific program in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, which is investigating a MUC16xCD28 bispecific antibody in combination with our PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo,” said Israel Lowy, Senior Vice President, Translational and Clinical Oncology at Regeneron. “This is our second costimulatory bispecific program to report clinical data, with a total of four such agents currently in the clinic, and adds to the evidence showing that our novel CD28 costimulatory bispecifics can potentially enhance the anti-tumor activity of anti-PD-1 therapies in a synergistic fashion. Studies are also underway exploring the combination of CD28 costimulatory bispecifics with CD3 bispecifics, including REGN5668 with ubamatamab, our MUC16xCD3 bispecific.”', 'Per initial results to be shared at ESMO IO, a combination of REGN5668 with Libtayo showed early clinical activity in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. The trial enrolled 28 platinum-experienced patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, who received infusions of REGN5668 once-weekly at a dose range of 0.3-300 mg, with the addition of Libtayo infusions every three weeks beginning between day 21 and 28. At the time of initial data cut off (July 14, 2023), 6 patients (21%) had stable disease, while 1 patient (in the 300 mg REGN5668 cohort) had an ongoing confirmed partial response with a 59% target lesion reduction from baseline. Dose escalation is ongoing and has included administration of REGN5668 doses beyond 300 mg in combination with Libtayo.', 'The combination of REGN5668 and Libtayo demonstrated an acceptable safety profile in 28 patients with fatigue (32%), nausea (29%) and pain (18%) as the most common treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). Infusion-related reactions occurred in 7% of patients and cytokine release syndrome occurred in 11% of patients and were all grade 1 or 2. There was one instance of a TRAE that was grade 3, which was fatigue. As of data cut off, there were no dose-limiting toxicities or adverse events resulting in death or treatment discontinuation. Dose escalation is continuing in order to define an optimal dose for expansion cohorts.', 'Regeneron presentations at ESMO IO:', 'Medicine(s)', 'Abstract Title', 'Abstract', 'Lead Author', 'Presentation date/time (all CET)', '\xa0', 'Libtayo, REGN5668', 'REGN5668 (MUC16xCD28 bispecific antibody) with cemiplimab (anti-PD-1 antibody) in recurrent ovarian cancer: Phase 1 dose-escalation study', '#127P', 'John L.

If managers pick stocks that will outperform the market by 2 percent per year, there is still only a 74.0 percent chance that they will outperform the market after 10 years.

This EPS growth is lower than the 25% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth."", 'You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).', ""This free interactive report on Ameriprise Financial's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further."", ""When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Ameriprise Financial's TSR for the last 5 years was 245%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""Ameriprise Financial provided a TSR of 11% over the last twelve months.

Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy.

Sustainability 101 is a blog series that you can turn to for information about different environmental terms that may come up at work, during discussions with friends, and even at your annual holiday gathering."", 'Products have a lifecycle that starts before they\'re made and goes beyond their use - including what they\'re made of and how they\'re manufactured, shipped and eventually disposed of. Many companies talk about how the ""circular economy"" can reduce environmental impact - but what does that mean, in general and in practice?', 'The circular economy: where design thinking saves both cost and the environment', 'The concept of a circular economy is not new. In the 1970s, architect and economist Walter Stahl shared a vision of an economy in loops (now known as the circular economy) in a research report to the European Commission. In a circular economy, companies tune their processes to enable the reuse and regeneration of materials or products, as a pathway to making products with the smallest environmental impact and resource use possible.', ""In practice, this involves applying circular design principles across a product's lifecycle. Take for example a wireless access point."", 'To engineer an access point for circularity, a company would start with two key areas:', 'first, selecting what materials are used in making that new access point, such as incorporating recycled (versus virgin) content, reducing the use of nonrenewable materials, and considering resource scarcity risks as part of material selection;', 'second, designing the access point for repurpose, remanufacture, or recycle at its end of life, for example not requiring shredding or radical disassembly for recycling, or enabling streamlined disassembly to support harvesting individual parts from the end-of-use product.', ""Companies should aim to design products for circularity and sustainability the same way they design products for user experience - by making it an inherent part of the process. This circular thinking extends to other areas of a product's life as well. This includes waste reduction and the environmental impact of packaging, such as using recycled paper and cardboard. Manufacturing processes should reclaim material left over from each access point (e.g., cut metal, etc.) and recycle that material for other products."", 'In addition, when we use less material to make products, we also reduce the amount of energy used for mining and production of materials, not to mention reducing the additional environmental impacts of mining. And when we reduce how much of them end up in landfills, we protect groundwater supplies, avoid emissions from landfill gas from biodegradable items, and avoid filling valuable landfill space.', 'An increasing circularity gap', 'When old electronics are simply discarded, they often contain hazardous materials like lead or mercury that may travel through a landfill and back out into water supplies or soil. The more electronics can be recycled, reused or otherwise repurposed instead, the less our environment is impacted by those products breaking down and by the virgin materials we must mine or create to make new products.', 'But research shows our society is not taking enough of these steps. The 2023 edition of the Circularity Gap Report, an annual study of circularity adoption worldwide by Circle Economy, states that the global economy increasingly relies on materials from virgin sources. This is due to growing demand for materials needed for buildings, infrastructure, and other durable goods - like electronics. The authors estimate that the global economy is only about 7.2% circular, down from 9.1% in 2018.', 'This increasing gap is also evident in the European Environmental Bureau findings that more than 13 million tonnes of electrical and electronic equipment were sold in the EU in 2021 - an increase of over 85% since 2013. In that same year, 4.9 million tonnes of e-waste were registered - just over 37% of the volume sold.', 'And other parts of the world fare worse on e-waste-a report published by the United Nations in 2020 estimated that, based on 2019 data, the global collection rate for e-waste is only 17 percent, leaving a tremendous amount of valuable materials that could be recovered and reused.', ""The missed opportunity for recycling and reuse isn't simply an environmental issue, it's also an economic one. Global e-waste means billions of U.S. dollars' worth of raw materials, including copper, iron and tin, and more valuable metals like gold, silver, and palladium are being discarded and are no longer available for use. Not recovering those materials means that manufacturers must source fresh supplies of them."", 'If companies can close this gap, they can deliver benefits to the bottom line while also protecting the planet.', 'Evolving from linear to circular models at Cisco', ""Circular economy principles have been around for decades, but in order to fully realize the benefits, companies must transform many of their practices. This includes engineering principles, supplier engagement, manufacturing and logistics processes, and even their business models. As a part of Cisco's transformation, we aim to transition more of our business from one-time transactions to ongoing services. This includes adopting business models that serve to extend the value of our products and reduce their environmental impacts."", ""And we've already started to evolve our practices and programs. For example, we set a goal to incorporate Circular Design Principles into 100% percent of our products and packaging by 2025, and in 2021, we launched a circular design evaluation methodology and tool to help us track progress toward that goal."", 'In addition, we offer a range of programs to help close the loop on our products:', 'Through the Cisco Takeback and Reuse Program, Cisco facilitates product returns for end-of-use gear at no cost so that it can go to its next best use. Cisco reuses or recycles nearly 100% of the equipment that is returned to us.', ""The Cisco Refresh program offers Cisco certified remanufactured equipment, available for most of the portfolio, providing a second life to products and reducing waste. Cisco Refresh has been part of Cisco's offerings for more than 20 years."", 'Cisco offers IT payment solutions that support circularity and make it easier for customers to build a technology strategy to support their sustainability goals. For example, through the Cisco Lifecycle Pay with Trade-In Incentive, customers can realize up to 10% off their monthly payments by trading in legacy Cisco or third-party equipment.', 'And lastly, Cisco offers as-a-service and subscription models across many products and solutions, allowing customers to move to recurring revenue models that support circular consumption and responsible takeback, recycle and reuse of hardware.', ""Circular transformation is a foundational requirement for a regenerative future, and it is therefore one of three key priorities in Cisco's environmental strategy."", ""Learn more about these initiatives and other Cisco's environmental, social and governance efforts:"", 'ESG Reporting Hub', 'View original content here.', 'View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.', 'Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.com', 'SOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.', 'View the original press release on accesswire.com']"
