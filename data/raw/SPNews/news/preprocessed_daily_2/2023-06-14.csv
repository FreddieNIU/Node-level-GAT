If you want to skip the detailed analysis of exhausting social security funds and expat movement, head over to 5 Best Places to Retire in The World On Social Security. Social Security’s Insolvent FutureSocial Security funds may be able to pay full benefits only until 2033. As reported by CNBC, insolvency may be on the near horizon for two major trust funds: Social Security and Medicare. Due to the ambiguous future that social security holds, a survey by Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America highlights that 74% of people don’t think they will be able to count on Social Security benefits by the time they retire. Likewise, the uncertainty revolving around retirement planning has become even more complex for retirees.As such, many retirees are planning to claim early retirement benefits before the trust fund goes broke. However, experts at CNBC claim it’s still beneficial to wait until the full retirement age. In fact, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) recommends retiring anywhere between the full retirement age and the age of 70. This way, retirees are entitled to what is known as the ""Delayed Retirement Credit."" Delayed Retirement Credits are the benefits that are increased by a certain percentage for each month they are delayed beyond the full retirement age.Another reason retirees are jumping on the early retirement bandwagon is to claim the 8.7% Cost of Living Adjustments (COLA) in effect since 2023. The highest jump in 40 years made in order to offset inflation has been tempting retirees to get their benefits early. However, the real concern for all prospective retirees should be how to minimize their tax bills and combat inflation during the retirement years.The most stunning revelation regarding retirees has been the lack of knowledge of social security on part of many of them. In a research by Mass Mutual, retirees aged 55-65 were surveyed to assess their knowledge regarding social security. The survey findings reveal that 43% do not know much at all, a peculiar finding considering this cohort is so close to their golden years.Story continuesBest Expat Retirement CountriesThe ideal retirement income for any retiree comes from three sources: social security, pension, and savings. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) states that a lesser number of retirees are delving into their retirement funds, regardless of the high inflation. However, the National Institute on Retirement Security notes that more than 40% of retirees are still dependent on social security only and don’t have any funds to rely on, an alarming fact considering the uncertain future of the funds.The Social Security Administration notes that as of February 2023, the average social security check is $1,693.88. Considering these figures, many retirees wonder if there are any places to retire for $1,000 or so a month.As such, the U.S. News &amp; World has determined an entire list, highlighting places like Chiang Rai in Thailand, Corozal in Belize, Cuenca in Ecuador, and Granada in Nicaragua. Other cheapest countries for retirement include Turkiye, Morocco, Malaysia, and Romania.For retirees who can spare a few extra bucks, best expat countries for Americans include Portugal, Panama, and Ecuador. These places are also in the list of tax-free retirement countries. There are also some countries offering relaxed citizenship for retirement. In that respect, some of the easiest countries to retire to include Carribbean countries like Paraguay.How to Save for RetirementWith payment cuts arriving sooner than expected, potential retirees should have retirement plans in place to prepare them for their golden years. Retirement funds can help retirees save up for their golden years. Corporations such as Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) and The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) help individuals save for their retirement years. Savings and similar IRAs are offered by Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), while different types of retirement accounts are offered by Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) and Interactive Brokers Group, Inc., to name a few. With enough retirement funds, retirees can retire in the best places to retire in the world, such as Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, and also Spain.15 Places to Retire in the World on Social SecurityImage by coombesy from PixabayMethodologyTo compile the list of Best Places to Retire in The World On Social Security, we have rounded up places from around the world based on their cost of living, healthcare index, and safety index.

3,5e384e13-75d2-307a-a118-dfc27eded5d6,SCHW,2023-06-14,Schwab’s Modern Wealth Survey Reveals Nearly Half of Americans Feel Wealthy…But With a Twist: They Don’t Measure It in Dollars & Cents,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-modern-wealth-survey-reveals-130000719.html,1686661200,STORY,['SCHW'],"[WESTLAKE, Texas, June 13, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--There’s a wealth paradox in America, driven by the contrast between how people define wealth for themselves compared to how they define it for others, according to Schwab’s seventh annual Modern Wealth Survey, an examination of how Americans think about saving, spending, investing and wealth.When asked to express how much money it takes to be considered ""wealthy"" in America, 1,000 survey respondents across the country say it’s an average of $2.2 million. But among the 48% of Americans who say they already feel wealthy today, the average net worth is $560,000—about a quarter of that loftier target. What’s more, non-financial assets like health and family resonate far more when defining wealth than having large sums of money, according to Schwab’s survey.Nearly two-thirds of Americans (62%) say being able to enjoy healthy relationships with their loved ones better describes wealth than having a lot of money and seven in 10 say wealth is more about not having to stress over money than having more of it. In fact, when asked to characterize what it means to be wealthy in their own words, Americans mention their well-being (40%) more often than money (32%) and assets (26%).What wealth means to me…this or that:Enjoying experiences 70%30% Owning nice thingsNot having to stress over money 70%30% Having more money than most people I knowHaving a healthy work life balance 69%31% Maximizing my earningsBeing generous with loves ones now 67%33% Leaving an inheritanceBeing in good health 63%37% Being successfulEnjoying healthy relationships with loved ones 62%38% Having a lot of moneyHaving the flexibility of working where and how I want 60%40% Having a higher salaryThese leanings are even stronger among older generations, with eight in 10 Boomers saying wealth is more about enjoying experiences (79%) and not having financial stress (83%) than having nice things or accumulating more dollars.Story continues""Americans today aren’t as worried about keeping up with the Joneses, and more importantly, they understand that they can be happier with fulfilling experiences and relationships, even if they have less money than them,"" said Jonathan Craig, Managing Director and Head of Investor Services at Charles Schwab. ""We’re seeing these trends at Schwab as well. First, when people think about managing their finances and building wealth, it’s so much more personal than just money and investments. How they invest and what they invest in reflects their unique goals and passions. Second, Americans want the ability to manage their money and investments without traditional barriers such as high minimums and fees to access financial services and help.""According to Schwab’s survey, only about one-third (35%) of Americans have plotted their goals and documented a financial plan. Among those who do, seven in 10 say it makes them feel more in control of their finances and nine in 10 say they feel confident that they will reach their financial goals.And while people feel wealthy, they don’t think their wealth merits a plan: among those who don’t have a plan, most say it’s because they don’t have enough money (44%), it’s too complicated (21%) or they don’t have enough time (20%).""It’s easier and more affordable to get a financial plan today than it’s ever been before, whether people want to just get started with a do-it-yourself digital financial plan or have an in-depth conversation with a professional,"" said Rob Williams, CFP®, Managing Director of Financial Planning and Wealth Management at Charles Schwab. ""And once clients start the process, they realize it’s not a conversation about how to get to a certain dollar amount. We talk to people about their personal goals and values to understand how they want to live their lives and to create a roadmap that makes some of life’s biggest aspirations much more accessible. Investors can also go a step further, and personalize their investments not only based on their circumstances and goals, but also align them with their personal passions, values, and interests.""Toxic scrolling: Social media influences and distractionsWhile having good relationships with family and friends is an important part of how Americans view wealth, Schwab’s survey also shows that social media can create new uncertainty and doubts for Americans when it comes to how wealthy they feel and resurface the tendency to compare themselves to their social circles.Nearly half (47%) say being able to afford a lifestyle comparable to their friends makes them feel wealthy, and among those who use social media, more than one-third (37%) say they compare their lifestyles to what family and friends share on social media. About one-third also say they make purchases (34%) based on what they see on social media from friends and influencers, as well as financial decisions (33%) and investment decisions (33%).The impact of social media is far greater among younger Americans:AllGen ZMillennialsGen XBoomersBeing able to afford a similar lifestyle as my friends makes me feel wealthy47%61%61%39%31%I compare my lifestyle to my family’s and friends’ lifestyle shared on social media37%54%47%31%13%I make purchases based on what I see my friends and other influencers share on social media34%55%46%27%10%I make financial decisions based on what I see my friends and other influencers share on social media33%46%45%29%9%I make investment decisions based on what I see my friends and other influencers share on social media33%50%44%27%8%""Whether it’s the fear of missing out or the desire to keep up, there are many factors that can make you feel pressured to spend money on things that may not have long-term value,"" said Williams. ""Thoughtful planning can help you be clear-eyed about your own goals, invest in a way that enhances your life and take control of your financial future.""Planning tools and resourcesSchwab has an online Financial Planning Hub that features an array of goals-based calculators, tools, and educational planning content to help investors get quick answers on topics such as retirement, saving for college, and buying a home. Investors can find out if they are saving enough for retirement, determine how much they can afford to withdraw in retirement, get an estimated monthly college savings goal, and plan for a home purchase using a mortgage calculator. The Financial Planning Hub is available to both Schwab clients and non-clients.Schwab also offers a range of options for clients to create a financial plan, including a free, self-guided digital financial plan with no minimum asset requirement to help investors establish and stay on track toward their retirement goals.

Even though the Fund has a similar weight to Financials as the index, our bank stocks—U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Charles Schwab (SCHW)—fell more than the Financials sector and hurt relative performance. We have performed a thorough analysis of our banking stocks and believe that they will exit this banking event intact, and a few may even benefit from the sector turmoil.The largest detractors from relative performance in the quarter were US Bank, Charles Schwab, UnitedHealth Group (UNH), and Hormel (HRL). The first two got caught up in the previously mentioned bank scare.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Ergo, when we looked at the ROCE trends at Edwards Lifesciences (NYSE:EW), we liked what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Edwards Lifesciences is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.24 = US$1.8b ÷ (US$8.7b - US$1.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).So, Edwards Lifesciences has an ROCE of 24%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Medical Equipment industry average of 9.1%. See our latest analysis for Edwards Lifesciences roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Edwards Lifesciences compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Edwards Lifesciences.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsIn terms of Edwards Lifesciences' history of ROCE, it's quite impressive. The company has consistently earned 24% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 68% in that time. With returns that high, it's great that the business can continually reinvest its money at such appealing rates of return. You'll see this when looking at well operated businesses or favorable business models.One more thing to note, even though ROCE has remained relatively flat over the last five years, the reduction in current liabilities to 13% of total assets, is good to see from a business owner's perspective. This can eliminate some of the risks inherent in the operations because the business has less outstanding obligations to their suppliers and or short-term creditors than they did previously.Story continuesThe Bottom LineEdwards Lifesciences has demonstrated its proficiency by generating high returns on increasing amounts of capital employed, which we're thrilled about. And since the stock has risen strongly over the last five years, it appears the market might expect this trend to continue. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.While Edwards Lifesciences looks impressive, no company is worth an infinite price.

Step, a fintech app catering to younger customers, offered 5% in May.To qualify, ONE accounts must receive a direct deposit of at least $500 the previous month, or have a total daily balance of $5,000, or automatically save part of the customer's paycheck.All other savings balances will continue to receive a 1.00% annual percentage yield.U.S. banks are trying to attract customers by offering bonuses for new accounts or regular deposits after Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed in March from an exodus of depositors seeking higher yields.Coastal Community Bank holds the charter for ONE's banking services, which include physical and virtual debit cards.

Favorable responses to deals, with product offerings appealing to a broader customer base, have been contributing to Ollie's Bargain’s performance. No wonder, the company’s favorable vendor relationships are also its strength.Business Model Resonates Well With CustomersOllie's Bargain’s focus on value-driven merchandise assortments positioned it well to capitalize on opportunities in the marketplace and effectively meet consumer demand. Ollie's Army continued to be a major sales driver, with membership increasing continuously. The company ended the first quarter of fiscal 2023 with more than 13.3 million active Ollie's Army members, which accounted for slightly more than 80% of sales.The company’s results depend on the availability of the brand name and closeout merchandise at compelling prices. Brand name and closeout merchandise represented about 65%, and non-closeout goods and private-label products collectively accounted for roughly 35% of fiscal 2022 merchandise purchases.Undoubtedly, Ollie's Bargain remains committed to offering better deals, improving operating margins and increasing the store count. The company should benefit from a favorable closeout environment and trade-down activity.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStore Growth StrategyAs far as Ollie's Bargain’s store growth strategy is concerned, management aims for more than 1,050 stores in the long run, with a goal to open 50 to 55 stores annually. Ollie's Bargain increased its store base at a CAGR of 11.5% from 303 stores in fiscal 2018 to 468 stores in fiscal 2022.We note that the company opened 46 and 40 stores in fiscal 2021 and 2022, respectively. It now intends to open 45 new stores, less one closure in fiscal 2023. In addition to opening new outlets, Ollie's Bargain is also remodeling stores. The company plans to remodel 30 to 40 stores and has so far completed 11 remodels. Ollie's Bargain also continues to invest in the distribution network to support store growth.Taking a cue from the past, we noticed that net sales surged at a CAGR of 10.2% from $1.241 billion in fiscal 2018 to $1.827 billion in fiscal 2022.Story continuesSolid Q1 Highlights PotentialOllie's Bargain registered a stellar first-quarter fiscal 2023 performance, wherein the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while the bottom line met the same. Markedly, both metrics grew year over year.The company posted adjusted earnings of 49 cents a share, which came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased meaningfully from 20 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. Net sales of $459.2 million jumped 12.9% year over year due to a comparable store sales increase and new store unit growth. The top line came ahead of the consensus mark of $451 million and marked the second straight beat.Robust first-quarter results and continued momentum in the business prompted management to lift the fiscal 2023 view.Management now envisions fiscal 2023 net sales between $2.052 billion and $2.067 billion, suggesting an increase from $1.827 billion reported in fiscal 2022. Ollie’s Bargain now anticipates comparable store sales to rise in the band of 2-2.8% against the comparable store sales decline of 3% reported last fiscal year.Management now foresees fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings in the range of $2.56-$2.65 per share, up from the adjusted earnings of $1.62 reported last fiscal. The company had earlier projected adjusted earnings between $2.49 and $2.58 per share.ConclusionOllie's Bargain’s strategic endeavors position the stock firmly for growth. We believe that improved closeout opportunities, increased trade down from consumers and significant room for increasing the store count should support this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Shares of this Harrisburg, PA-based company have rallied 36.6% so far in the year against the industry’s decline of 7.1%.Stocks Looking Red HotHere we have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely Kroger KR, The TJX Companies TJX and Walmart WMT.Kroger, a supermarket operator, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

However, Assurant Inc. AIZ, Radian Group Inc. RDN, Old Republic International Corporation ORI, MetLife Inc. MET and Prudential Financial Inc. PRU, with their impressive dividend history, offer investors a breather.Insurers, backed by strong fundamentals, enjoy a solid capital position that in turn supports effective capital deployment.  Multiline insurers benefit from a diversified portfolio that lowers concentration risk. Increased awareness drives demand for protection products, which benefits sales and premiums of life insurance operations. Continued improvement in pricing is expected to support premium growth of non-life insurance operations. Also, an increase in exposure of intangibles and cyber threats offers room for growth for non-life insurers. Per Deloitte Insights, life insurance premiums are estimated to increase 1.9% in 2023 while non-life premiums are expected to increase 2.2%. The report also stated that trends like commercial lines witnessing growth at a faster pace than personal lines and homeowners’ premiums improving at a better rate than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023.Insurers invest a portion of their premium income. Therefore, higher the rates. better the investment results. Also, the interest rate environment is improving. The Fed has already made three hikes in 2023, taking the tally to 10 since March 2022. Also, investment income is an important component of insurers’ top line. However, concerns related to whether Fed will pause further hikes remain. Thus, all eyes are on the outcome of the two-day Fed meeting concluding this Thursday. These solid fundamentals should help companies to maintain dividend streakPlayers are investing heavily in technology to improve scale and efficiencies. While a solid policyholders’ surplus helps the industry absorb losses, a sturdy capital level aids insurers in pursuing strategic mergers and acquisitions, investing in growth initiatives, engaging in share buybacks, and increasing dividends or paying out special dividends.Story continuesDividend Stocks for Your PortfolioIn this volatile market, stocks that give regular dividends offer an attractive investment opportunity.

Shell has, for example, offloaded a little under 200,000 barrels of daily production when it sold its sites in the U.S. Permian basin to ConocoPhillips two years ago.“Our target of a reduction in oil production by 2030 has not changed,"" the company said. “We’ve just met it eight years early.”New chief executive Wael Sawan insisted that the company was still committed to decarbonizing its operations, reiterating the goal that Shell will become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.“We are investing to provide the secure energy customers need today and for a long time to come, while transforming Shell to win in a low-carbon future,” he said in a statement.The oil strategy comes as Shell and other oil giants have faced increasing pressure to do more to fight emissions from climate activists, including protesters who were dragged away at Shell's London shareholder meeting last month and others who faced tear gas outside TotalEnergies' gathering days later.Last week, the U.K.’s advertising watchdog banned a Shell marketing campaign for implying a big proportion of its business was in low carbon energy even though fossil fuels make up the “vast majority” of its operations.Oil and gas companies like Shell, London rival BP and others also have spurred anger for posting bumper profits after Russia's war in Ukraine drove up the price of energy, surging inflation and helping fuel a cost-of-living crisis.Story continuesWhen it comes to Shell oil production, maintaining it at current levels will require investment because output from existing reservoirs naturally declines by around 5% every year.“It (Shell) has made some meaningful nearer term pledges including the elimination of gas flaring at its wells by 2025, but there will be some disappointment that oil production is set to remain at current levels out to at least 2030,” said Derren Nathan, head of equity research at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown.Shell also said it would buy back at least $5 billion of its shares from investors in the second half of the year, a move aimed at bolstering investor confidence amid a relative underperformance in the company's share price. Shell also said its dividend payment to shareholders would rise by 15%.It also set out a target to reduce underlying operating costs between $2 and $3 billion by 2025 and reduce capital spending from $22 to $25 billion in 2024 and 2025.]"

It produced around 1.5 million barrels per day of oil in the first quarter of 2023.It said it will now keep its oil production steady to 2030 and will grow its natural gas business to defend its position as the world's biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) player.Story continuesCapital spending will be in a range of $22 billion to $25 billion per year for 2024 and 2025, after a planned $23 billion to $27 billion range for 2023.Shell plans to spend around $40 billion on oil and gas production and trading between 2023-2025, compared with $35 billion on its downstream, renewables and low-energy solutions businesses. Shell's shift follows a similar move by rival BP earlier this year when CEO Bernard Looney rowed back from plans to cut its oil and gas output by 40% by 2030.Sawan, a 48-year-old Canadian-Lebanese national who previously headed Shell's oil, gas and renewables divisions, has in recent months scrapped several projects, including offshore wind, hydrogen and biofuels, due to weak return forecasts.On Wednesday it said it is also conducting a strategic review of energy and chemicals assets on Bukom and Jurong Island in Singapore and is seeking to sell its stake in the Miro refinery in Germany.NET ZERO Speculation that Sawan was set to slow Shell's plans to reduce greenhouse gas emission and shift to renewables have angered climate-focused investors.Shell has said it remains committed to slashing emissions to net zero by 2050.Shell's climate pledges are based on emissions intensity reductions per unit of energy produced, which means absolute emissions can rise even if the headline intensity metric falls.It currently has a target to cut its 2030 emissions intensity, including from the combustion of the fuels it sells, by 20%.Scientists say the world needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions by around 43% by 2030 from 2019 levels to stand any chance of realising the 2015 Paris Agreement.Shell also faces a Dutch court ruling ordering the company to drastically cut emissions. It has appealed against the decision.(Reporting by Ron Bousso and Shadia Nasralla; Editing by Jan Harvey, Alexander Smith, Elaine Hardcastle)]"

(NYSE: FE) is reminding the public to be cautious of potential electrical hazards associated with popular outdoor activities. Celebrating responsibly will help keep customers safe and the electricity flowing reliably this season.FirstEnergy Corp. Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)""As we prepare for parades, barbeques and outdoor fun, we encourage everyone to keep electrical safety top of mind to ensure a safe holiday and summer season,"" said Chad Stoneking, director of safety operations at FirstEnergy. ""Enjoying the season responsibly can also help prevent unnecessary disruptions to your electric service during a time when many people rely on their air conditioning to stay cool and comfortable.""Foil balloons and fireworks are two of the most common and festive ways to celebrate summer events, including graduation parties, weddings and Independence Day. However, they can create safety issues and cause major damage to the electric system when they are used near power lines and electrical equipment.While foil balloons have increased in popularity as holiday and party decorations, they continue to cause many power outages because their metallic coating conducts electricity when they drift into power lines or electrical equipment. February typically marks the onset of a dramatic increase in outages caused by adrift metallic balloons that peaks in June or July, when warm weather takes celebrations and picnics outdoors. Over recent months, foil balloons were to blame for more than 50 power outages across FirstEnergy's six-state service area.Customers should securely tie helium-filled foil balloons to a weight that is heavy enough to prevent them from floating away, and then puncture and deflate them once they are no longer in use because they can stay inflated for several weeks. Never release them into the sky.Story continuesFirstEnergy also encourages customers to leave the large, colorful fireworks displays to the professionals. Extra caution should be used when handling fireworks, firecrackers and rockets at home, and they should only be lit in open areas where no power lines are in sight. Should a firework accidentally come in contact with a power line or equipment, leave it alone and immediately call 911 to report the problem.To help ensure holidays and celebrations are enjoyed responsibly, customers should keep the following outdoor safety tips in mind:Never fly kites, motorized airplanes or drones near power lines. While kites almost always use cotton string, wet cotton string can conduct electricity as well as metal string.Never attempt to retrieve any type of object that gets caught in a power line or drifts or crashes into a substation. Leave it alone and immediately call FirstEnergy at 888-544-4877 to report the problem.Keep electrical devices and cords at least 10-feet away from water sources such as pools and spas. When possible, use battery-operated electrical devices outside.All outdoor receptacles should be covered to keep them dry. This is especially important around pools, spas and other summer water activities.When hauling a boat, make sure it clears overhead power lines and stay away from power lines when sailing.Never climb a tree that is growing near or into overhead lines or near a utility pole. Also, never climb utility poles or other infrastructure, in particular transmission towers or substation fences. These activities are extremely hazardous and can result in very severe injuries.Stay far away from a downed or low-hanging power line. Always assume any downed wires are energized and dangerous. Report them ASAP by calling 911.To get familiarized with drone safety, the public can visit FirstEnergy's Drone Safety Zone, the first video game of its kind in the utility industry that allows players to learn current rules and best practices for drone operators while racing against others.Visit www.firstenergycorp.com/publicsafety to learn about FirstEnergy's ""Stop. Look. Live."" safety campaign to educate the public about staying safe around electricity and near power lines and equipment.FirstEnergy is dedicated to integrity, safety, reliability and operational excellence.

The significant memory capabilities mean AMD's new chip could be applied in AI large language models, commonly known as ""LLMs.""Winning business from Amazon Web Services would be a huge vote of confidence in AMD's fresh offerings, suggesting it has a shot at wrestling away chunks of market share from rival Nvidia.In an exclusive interview on Yahoo Finance Live on Tuesday (video above), AMD's Chair and CEO Dr. Lisa Su struck an upbeat tone on the demand outlook for its AI chips once they begin to ship later this year.""We're excited,"" Su said.""We look at the data center. I mean, this is an incredible market. So if you think about just AI chips in the data center, we think this year it's about $30 billion market,"" Su added. ""We think over the next three or four years it's going to grow over 50% every year.

Benioff sat down with Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi to discuss Salesforce's vision for AI.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]RACHELLE AKUFFO: The talk of the town is AI, and Salesforce is going all in. The cloud company announcing a big new generative AI enterprise at its AI day on Monday in New York City. Yahoo Finance's very own Brian Sozzi attended the conference and got to check out some of the new technologies firsthand. He also spoke to Salesforce chairman and CEO Marc Benioff about this moment in AI for businesses. Take a listen.MARC BENIOFF: We've seen a lot of exciting waves of technology in our industry-- the cloud, social, and mobile, but this AI wave is going to be the biggest that anyone has ever seen. I think that the success of OpenAI is the point of evidence that this is going to be one of the fastest growing moves, not just in the consumer market but in the enterprise market.And we had some of the largest, most important enterprises in the room today. And every customer is excited to get their hands on our new generative AI products, which are shipping this month.BRIAN SOZZI: You said something in your presentation really early on, you said, this is the new Salesforce. What did you mean by that?MARC BENIOFF: What I mean is, you know, we've been very focused over the last five months of transforming our financials. We just delivered our highest margin ever. We are extremely excited about our new management team that we've introduced last week and now a whole new product strategy as well.And I think the right combination of financials, people, and technology is the right capability for this software company, which has become the third largest software company in the world and is really just getting its, I think, sea legs when it gets to the next generation of artificial intelligence.BRIAN SOZZI: I saw a lot of presentations or a lot of screens up there on GPT, GPT this, GPT that. How will that change Salesforce and what is the order flow look like for those products?Story continuesMARC BENIOFF: Well, about 10 years ago, I had my first existential freak out about AI. And I ended up buying a lot of companies and assembling teams and making things happen. And that was very exciting to me. And this is bigger because this is now the next wave. Of course, Salesforce is already a leader in AI CRM. Because of that, we introduced Einstein in 2016. We're doing a trillion transactions a week of Einstein.Now, we're going to enter generative AI as well. I think it's going to be another wave. The amount of data that we already see being entered into the system through our data cloud is at record levels. So I think it's an indication of how well these generative AI systems will do.BRIAN SOZZI: I think a lot of folks on Wall Street, they're interested in how does Salesforce monetize all this amazing new technology. How do you see that?MARC BENIOFF: Well, today we introduced all kinds of new monetization models around generative AI, including our AI cloud, which is our starter package to help customers move forward. It's $360,000. It gives you all the licenses and capabilities and services to get going. I think for a lot of customers, trust will be the most important thing.They're going to want to make sure they don't have any data leakage, that their companies and their employees are properly trained to work in this area. And that all of the corporate playbooks and customer data sets aren't going out the left window. So that's our job, to make sure that, you know, the company is architected correctly and ready to go for this new generative AI era.BRIAN SOZZI: You seem very passionate about trust and doing AI from an ethical standpoint. Do you anticipate some form of global regulation here at some point?MARC BENIOFF: I think trust and generative AI are going to go hand in hand and then responsibility and generative AI. I think this idea that AI is kind of in a next level is true. And I think every business and every government and every individual is going to have to come up with their own way of looking at this technology and what is the right way to manage it.BRIAN SOZZI: Do you view AI as job creating?MARC BENIOFF: There's no question that AI is going to create more jobs. It could also take jobs. It can be a balance. In the work that we showed today, which is something that's been going on for 18 months with Gucci, we've actually seen the Gucci call center expand because what it did was it made their employees more capable-- their own words, to augment their call center.Now, the call center, which only did service also can do sales and marketing and commerce as well. That's a big step forward. They call it Gucci 9. It's like a next generation capability. And I'm excited to go to Milan and see what's going on there.BRIAN SOZZI: It sounds high-end.MARC BENIOFF: It sounds expensive.BRIAN SOZZI: It sounds expensive. How important is it-- you know, I'm not-- it wasn't lost on me that you're in this room. You're a co-founder. Parker was in this room, co-founder. That Salesforce is founder-led at a moment like this. How important is that from [INAUDIBLE]--MARC BENIOFF: Founders can go faster. You're 100% right. And I think that we've transformed the company a lot in the last five months. We go back and look at the interview we did four or five months ago. The interview we're doing now, the questions are different.BRIAN SOZZI: Yes.MARC BENIOFF: The questions are different.BRIAN SOZZI: Yes.MARC BENIOFF: The position is different. Everything is different because we've transformed the company in a relatively short amount of time. And we're excited about where we are and where we're going.BRIAN SOZZI: How is that the past five months changed you as a leader? Because you seem-- you've always said, you're always very passionate about this. But you just-- there was a different level of focus here today. And I don't know. It's just it was really cool to see you in that zone.MARC BENIOFF: Well, I think number one is we've really focused on changing the financials. And you saw we just hit our highest margin levels. We've increased margins by 1,000 points. That's tremendous for our investors. We just hit some record cash flow numbers. You reported that as well. And very excited about the quarter we just delivered.Number two is we've brought back some great leaders. We had our new Chief Marketing Officer here today. Ariel Kelman, of course, Ariel has worked at for Salesforce for six years, running product marketing that he went to AWS, where he was the CMO for eight years. And then he went to Oracle as the CMO for three years. So we're very excited to have him back at Salesforce.But also we have a number of new executives that we're very excited about. And augmenting also our Chief Operating Officer Brian Millham, giving him some great new capabilities, including leading our business technology team and our HR team, as well as our marketing team.BRIAN SOZZI: Does it take time for these new or this next generation of leaders to settle in? How do you think about it?MARC BENIOFF: Well, I just brought back my former Chief Marketing Officer Kendall Collins as my new Chief of Staff. And it's been great for me because he already hit the ground running. He had been with Salesforce for, you know, a dozen years. Left for a few years. Bringing him back, he was able to hit the ground as if he never left. And that's the kind of executive I like right now.BRIAN SOZZI: You also talked a lot about a dinner you had with OpenAI Sam Altman. And one thing that blew me away was your voice was replicated, I guess, at that dinner. Tell us about that. And as a tech leader, that had to blow you away.MARC BENIOFF: Well, we're seeing generative AI do a lot of amazing new things. And you're going to see this concept being able to create deepfakes, audio, video, the ability to do things rapidly. But as I mentioned, where is this data stored? You know, it's not stored in a file. We all have seen like an MP4 file or an MP3 file on our phones. But that's not how this data is stored.Its data, you know what, in these weights inside these neural networks. And it's not the traditional enterprise storage mechanisms. So we're going to have to find these new ways like we introduced here with our Einstein GPT Trust Layer to store these things safely and correctly with the highest levels of trust and protection.BRIAN SOZZI: Is there a societal risk to that if my voice is replicated and goes out there in social media? What does that do?MARC BENIOFF: Well, I think we realize that we're in a world now where AI is able to do things that we've only seen in movies. ""The Minority Report"" was partly written by a Salesforce employee Peter Schwartz. And I think we all remember that from our childhood. We didn't think it was going to be our present moment reality, but it's turning out to be more like ""The Minority Report"" than not.BRIAN SOZZI: Marc Benioff.MARC BENIOFF: Thank you.BRIAN SOZZI: Salesforce CEO. It's always a pleasure to getMARC BENIOFF: Brian, thank you very much.BRIAN SOZZI: Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Thank you so much.MARC BENIOFF: All the best. Thank you so much.BRIAN SOZZI: Thank you.]"

If you're looking at the returns, the one-month rolling returns near the peak of the dot com bubble, 113% for tech in the S&amp;P 500. Right now, it's about 27%.So in other words, we have not run as far. He also found that if you're looking at big tech right now, around 26 times forward earnings for the S&amp;P tech index, it was more than double that during the top of the dot com bubble. So that's the question about whether that's going to help lift us things. And so let's continue that discussion and bring back in Chris Harvey.Chris, so what do you think here?CHRIS HARVEY: It's true. So let's look at what's similar, what's different. What's different? Back in the late '90s, it was the wild west. You didn't know who the winners were. Today, you really do know, at least, the initial round of the winners. Because AI is a scale and size business. Because it's a lot of your cloud players. It's a select number of semis. And it's your data centers.The second thing, let's just talk about valuation. Valuations are very, very different between today, and then. And also, the way that stocks are moving. Back then, as you recall or you may recall, people were trading on eyeballs and clicks. Things that just didn't make any economic sense. Here, we're actually seeing real earnings and real earnings growth.Story continuesBut what's similar or what could be similar is what really was the beginning of the end in the dot com era. And what that was is we did have in '99, 2000, we did have the Fed tightening monetary policy. And what that did is it weighed on the economy. It weighed on the old economy stocks. And, ultimately, that was the beginning for the new economy stocks.And what are we seeing today? We're seeing a Fed that's tightening and tightening pretty aggressively. What's happening is the economy, it is in an economic malaise. Some people are talking about recession. But I think economic malaise is the right word. The older economy stocks are the ones that are lagging. And the newer economy stocks are taking off. So I think the similarity is the theme with the Fed. But if you look at valuations, valuations are nowhere near where they were back then.The underlying fundamentals are much better today than they were back then. And the application of AI is in the here and now. It's not 12, 26, 36 months down the road. And so it makes it a very different type of situation. And so if you want to talk the bull case, you really can't talk the bull case. It's just how do you get there. And, again, our issue is that you've put a lot of the good news there. The top five names in the S&amp;P 500 on average are almost up 50% year-to-date. That's a heck of a move.Valuations for the uber caps, it's still pretty reasonable. Can you see some upside? Are there growth opportunities? Absolutely. But we just think you need to pause right here, right now.BRAD SMITH: Chris, usually, after the show, I go back up to my desk. I'll listen to Beyonce's Renaissance for the umpteenth time while I do some other work. Yesterday, instead, I listened to Salesforce's AI day. And actually ""Yahoo Finance's"" Brian Sozzi spoke to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff about the AI boom. Let's hear what he had to say.MARC BEIOFF: Well, we've seen a lot of exciting waves of technology in our industry, the cloud, social, mobile. But this AI wave is going to be the biggest that anyone has ever seen. I think that the success of OpenAI is the point of evidence that this is going to be one of the fastest growing moves, not just in the consumer market, but in the enterprise market.BRAD SMITH: So what does that look like in terms of stock performance perspective, if it is the fastest growing part of this holistic sector?CHRIS HARVEY: I think you've seen a lot of it. So most of the stocks that are doing well are AI-related gross stocks. And I think that's going to continue. But what we're also looking at is, who are the companies that are instituting AI and benefiting from that? And we're seeing a host of companies. Companies who never would have thought of. So we looked at Kraft Heinz. Kraft Heinz is saying we're using AI to optimize our supply chain, to get things on time.You're looking at a Best Buy. They're talking about how they're using it in customer service. Some of the hotels are talking about how they're using it to predict RevPAR, and how it does a better job in predicting RevPAR than many other aspects. So we can talk a lot about how the growth opportunity is on the tech side. But there are also a lot of opportunities, just in more mundane type operations. And so I do agree. This is one of the most innovative technologies we've seen in the last two years. And we're only just scratching the surface, I believe.JULIE HYMAN: To your point earlier, though, how much is it worth? I guess is part of that. So related to what you were just saying about all these other companies, I am curious, if you're looking at some of these mega caps or uber caps is too expensive right now, where in the market is attractive to you?CHRIS HARVEY: So [INAUDIBLE] we still like growth. We like cap growth. It's underperformed on a multi-year basis. It is underperformed year-to-date. It's beginning to bounce back. And we think growth is the place to be because we do think you're going to be in this economic malaise for some time.So we want companies that can have self-help. But if you look at the multiple on mid cap growth, it's 16 times. And so you could see multiple expansion as well. We think it's one of your better risk-rewards in the marketplace. And it's beginning to work right here, right now.It's not that we hate the uber caps. We just think they're overbought. They need to take a pause or some type of pullback to uncover a little bit of value. But if you're asking, what we like in the here and the now, best risk-reward, it's mid-cap growth because of valuation and the growth opportunities.BRAD SMITH: What's the benchmark by which you would market and say, it needs to be real by this timeline? For some of the AI discussion, even what I was watching yesterday with how Salesforce was educating me on the prompts that you'll give an generative AI tool and the result that you get out of it, how it makes things quicker, is this not real until the end consumer and like a grandmother is out there being able to engage with AI and essentially have real time results and feel like, they're more productive?CHRIS HARVEY: So my mom is a grandmom. And she is talking about AI. The other thing I would say is you are seeing-- so I have a little guy. I have a 10-year-old and playing lacrosse. One of the dads has a camera. Brings the camera. And it's attached. There is a bunch of AI packages surrounding this camera. It follows the kids.And then after the game, it creates clips and statistics and everything else. You are seeing it real time. So when you ask, hey, do we know it's real? It is real. We're seeing it show up in a lot of the tech company earnings. The issue that we have is when we talk to more of the old economy stocks or the old economy CEOs, they're not giving us a lot of information of what the costs are, what the benefits, or giving examples. RevPAR examples, supply chain examples. They're talking about how we're optimizing our access to, if you're an energy company, to different sources of power.But we can't get the hard numbers just yet. So we'll get that. And I think 2Q numbers will reveal a lot of that, or will give us a lot more information at this point in time. But we are seeing it in the here and now. And, again, this is one of the things that makes it different than the late '90s, is the commercial application is in the here and now. And the adaptation is very quick. And the acceleration is going to be like something we haven't seen before.JULIE HYMAN: I got to get that camera that you're talking about.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, I know.]"

With this, the company claims to offer one-stop AI-powered solutions for enterprises looking to enhance productivity.Generative AI is a type of AI technology that can produce various types of content, including text, imagery, audio and synthetic data. It is driven by a large language model, which means it uses a lot of data to understand and generate conversations.Salesforce stated that its AI Cloud is a suite of services that delivers enterprise-ready real-time, open and secure generative experiences across all applications and workflows. The suite will power new capabilities across Salesforce’s products, including Einstein service, data analysis software Tableau and workplace-messaging app, Slack.The inclusion of AI Cloud across CRM’s product suites will enable sales representatives to quickly auto-craft personalized emails, while marketers can auto-create personalized contents. An organization’s service team can auto-generate personalized agent chat replies and case summaries, while the commerce team can auto-create insights and recommendations. Moreover, software developers can auto-generate codes and predict potential bugs and provide suggestions to fix them.Salesforce Inc. Price and ConsensusSalesforce Inc. price-consensus-chart | Salesforce Inc.

That is because the Jan 19, 2024 $2.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Marathon Oil shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Marathon Oil is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry that ranks in the Bottom 32% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while seven have revised the estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 68 cents per share to 58 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Marathon Oil right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

In April of that year, two Black men, Donte Robinson and Rashon Nelson, went to a Starbucks in Rittenhouse Square, Philadelphia for a business meeting. While waiting for a third person to arrive, Nelson asked to use the restroom. He was denied. After sitting in the store for a while, without purchasing anything, a manager called the police. Both were arrested on trespassing charges and removed from the store in handcuffs.A video of the incident circulated online, gathering millions of views, and sparked widespread outrage, protests, and media coverage. In response, Starbucks closed 8,000 stores for one day to teach staff about racial bias, and changed its bathroom policy to be open to all who enter the store, regardless of whether one makes a purchase.Quartz contacted Starbucks for comment on the jury decision.Phillips alleged she was fired because she is whiteIn her initial complaint (pdf), Phillips claimed Starbucks “took steps to punish white employees who had not been involved in the arrests, but who worked in and around the city of Philadelphia, in an effort to convince the community that it had properly responded to the incident.”Story continuesShe also claimed that Starbucks did not take action against the Black manager for the Rittenhouse Square store, Paul Sykes. Phillips had been an employee of Starbucks for almost 13 years, managing about 100 retail stores across Philadelphia, Delaware, and parts of New Jersey and Maryland.Starbucks said it fired Phillips because of her “leadership failures”Phillips was fired in May 2018 after Starbucks said she “was not able to lead the Philadelphia market and its partners through this moment of crisis,” according to one court filing (pdf). The filing also mentioned she “appeared overwhelmed and lacked awareness of how critical the situation had become.” Starbucks denied Phillips was fired because she is white.Quotable: Words from Donte Robinson and Rashon NelsonIn an interview with “Good Morning America” in 2018, several days after the incident, both Robinson and Nelson shared their thoughts.“I want to make sure that this situation doesn’t happen again. So what I want is for a young man, young men, to not be traumatized by this, and instead motivated, inspired,” said Robinson.Nelson said he wanted to “take this opportunity as a stepping stone to really stand up and show your greatness.” He added, “and that you are not judged by the color of your skin.”Robinson and Nelson reached a financial settlement with Starbucks in May 2018. The sum was not disclosed. They also settled with Philadelphia, with each receiving a symbolic $1, and city officials pledging to spend $200,000 to establish a program for young entrepreneurs.Related stories🚓 Proactive policing begins harming Black people before they are even born👀 What workplaces underestimate about their antiracism commitments🤔 What actually happens in bias training seminars?This story was updated with details on Robinson and Nelson’s settlements.

In some cases, the union said, managers told workers that Pride displays were a safety concern, citing recent incidents at Target where some angry customers tipped over merchandise and confronted workers.“There has been no change to any policy on this matter and we continue to encourage our store leaders to celebrate with their communities, including for U.S. Pride month in June,” the Seattle coffee giant said Tuesday in a statement.Starbucks has been outspoken in its support for LGBTQ+ employees for decades and said Tuesday that support is ""unwavering."" It extended full health benefits to same-sex partners in 1988 and added health coverage for gender reassignment surgery in 2013.The company is also currently selling Pride-themed tumblers in its stores designed by Toronto artist Tim Singleton, who is gay.But Ian Miller, a union organizer and Starbucks supervisor in Olney, Maryland, said the company’s tone has changed this year, citing his own store manager informing him that he needed prior approval to put up Pride decorations and that the company was seeking more “uniformity” in its stores.The manager also allegedly cited the backlash against Bud Light when it partnered with a transgender influencer and then tried to walk back its support. Its U.S. sales subsequently plummeted.Miller said the manager ultimately let an employee put up small rainbow flags in the store, but the company credit card wasn’t used to buy them, as had been allowed in the past.“It’s disrespectful and counterintuitive,"" Miller said.Miller's manager declined to comment Tuesday when contacted by The Associated Press. Starbucks didn't respond to questions about the policies at Miller's store.Miller's store is one of more than 300 Starbucks stores that has voted to unionize since 2021. Starbucks opposes the unionization effort.]"

74,99f8e7fd-d43e-3475-b7d2-727f3c512ef7,SYY,2023-06-14,Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 85% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sysco-corporation-nyse-syy-favoured-110024631.html,1686740424,STORY,['SYY'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Sysco's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsA total of 20 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownershipOwnership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stockTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 85% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Sysco. View our latest analysis for Sysco ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Sysco?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Sysco does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Sysco's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Sysco. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.4% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are Wellington Management Group LLP and BlackRock, Inc., with an equal amount of shares to their name at 6.4%.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 20 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of SyscoThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Sysco Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$63m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipWith a 15% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Sysco. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with Sysco , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

The stock has climbed more than 23% in the past month, according to Yahoo Finance data. United Airlines (UAL) is the second top performer in the last month, up 17%.JetBlue (JBLU) and American Airlines (AAL) are up roughly 15% in the past month. Southwest (LUV) is tailing behind in the airline rally with a still respectable one-month gain of 12%.There are likely two factors behind the airline stock propulsion.First, is the raw demand to travel at the moment — which appears to have been strong for Memorial Day weekend and now into July 4.MADRID, SPAIN - 2023/06/10: An Airbus A319 of Iberia comercial flight flies over the skyscrapers of Madrid's skyline, known as the ""Four Towers Business Area"", after departing from Adolfo Suarez Madrid Barajas Airport.

""Revenue per available room is up about 10%. Forward bookings through the end of the year look particularly strong.""The bullish outlook was echoed by Marriott's long-time rival, Hilton (HLT).""Demand is strong across the board, I don't care where you are in the world,"" Hilton CFO Kevin Jacobs said on Yahoo Finance Live. ""We don't have months and months of visibility in our business, but from what we can see it's going to be another strong summer.""Flight searches are up 25% overall for June through August compared to the same time last year, per data from travel booking portal Expedia (EXPE). Interest is up by triple digits for more expensive trips to international destinations across Europe and Asia.The aforementioned American Airlines recently lifted its second quarter outlook, citing continued strong demand and lower fuel costs.""We're seeing a ton of demand,"" Expedia CEO Peter Kern told Yahoo Finance.Story continuesA business jet is refuelled using Jet A fuel at the Henderson Executive Airport during the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) exhibition in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. October 21, 2019. REUTERS/David Becker (David Becker / reuters)The second factor at play is the plunge in jet fuel prices.Jet fuel prices have dropped about 38% since mid-January, according to IATA data.""Airline financial performance in 2023 is beating expectations,"" Willie Walsh, IATA’s director general, said in a statement. ""Stronger profitability is supported by several positive developments. China lifted COVID-19 restrictions earlier in the year than anticipated. Cargo revenues remain above pre-pandemic levels even though volumes have not. And, on the cost side, there is some relief. Jet fuel prices, although still high, have moderated over the first half of the year.""To that end, the IATA updated its 2023 industry-wide net profit outlook this month to $9.8 billion versus its $4.7 billion forecast in December.Coupled with strong demand signals, Wall Street seems to be betting on strong profits for the airlines in the third quarter. And potentially, strong holiday travel outlooks.As for Apple and Tesla...shares are up 7% and 53%, respectively in the last month.Not too shabby, either.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

In the first quarter of 2023, air traffic, measured in revenue passenger miles, increased 11.6% year over year to 29.54 billion. Capacity or available seat miles (ASMs) climbed 10.7% year over year to 38.06 billion in the first quarter of 2023. Anticipating the trend to continue, Southwest Airlines’ management expects second-quarter 2023 ASMs to improve 14% from the year-ago reported figure. For 2023, LUV now expects capacity to improve 14-15% (prior view: up 15-16%) from the 2022 level.LUV’s liquidity position raises optimism in the stock. At the end of first-quarter 2023, the carrier’s cash and cash equivalents were $$8,359 million, higher than the long-term debt (less current maturities) of $7,999 million, implying the company has enough cash to meet its debt obligations.Despite the aforementioned tailwinds, escalating fuel prices continue to remain a concern. In first-quarter 2023, fuel cost per gallon (inclusive of fuel tax: economic) rose 38.7% to $3.19. For second-quarter 2023, economic fuel costs per gallon are expected between $2.45 and $2.55.For 2023, economic fuel costs per gallon are now estimated between $2.60 and $2.70 (prior view: $2.65 and $2.75). Although full-year guidance for fuel prices has been lowered, fuel expenses continue to act as a major concern for the company's bottom line.Apart from the increase in fuel costs, a rise in labor and airport costs is also likely to dent bottom-line growth, resulting in a spike in operating expenses. In first-quarter 2023, consolidated unit cost or cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding fuel, oil and profit-sharing expenses, and special items increased 5.9% year over year. Due to an increase in labor and airport costs, as well as lower productivity levels, LUV expects CASM, excluding fuel, oil and profit-sharing expenses, and special items, to increase 5-8% in the second quarter of 2023 from the comparable period in 2022.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderSouthwest Airlines currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the Zacks Transportation sector are Copa Holdings, S.A.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the top 5 most profitable airlines in the world.Even though the airline industry has arguably been the most integral in improving globalization across the last several decades, and even though it has a reputation of being too expensive, it is actually the industry with the lowest profit margins. Because of this, the airline industry is unable to adapt to downward pricing pressure or economic instability, as witnessed during the pandemic.When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, most countries forbade travel and went into lockdowns, severely impacting the hospitality industry, with airlines being particularly hard hit. In fact, from 2020 to 2022, when the worst of the pandemic passed over, the airline industry is estimated to have lost more than $200 billion, resulting in tens of thousands of job cuts even among the most profitable airlines in the world.Top 20 most profitable airlines in the worldPhoto by emiel molenaar on UnsplashHowever, 2022 saw the resumption of global travel as most countries removed restrictions which resulted in pent-up demand being released across summer and airlines recording one of the most profitable quarters in airline history in Q2 2022. Even though the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing year-plus war result in airspace issues, airlines have managed to persevere and the outlook is quite bright.Of course, you can't discuss 2022 without discussing the economic uncertainty that dominated the year, resulting in a horrendous year for the stock markets, with rising inflation and aggressive interest rate hikes combined with an impending recession resulting in a negative mindset for investors. Despite this, airlines recorded the highest price per mile in history, and even though volume hasn't reverted to pre-pandemic levels, the rise in prices has resulted in higher revenues for airlines with many returning to profitability after a couple of years of losses, which is great news for the most profitable airlines in the world.Story continuesAccording to CNN, Europe, one of the premier destinations for tourists, is already seeing high levels of tourism, even though summer has barely started. This is only going to get worse as schools start breaking for summer and more and more tourists start traveling, with tour operators selling out months in advance. According to Allianz Partners, Americans traveling to Europe will increase by 55% as compared to 2022, with Italian cities dominating the most popular destination lists. Even though volumes are increasing significantly, prices don't seem to be coming down, which might lead to the richest airlines in the world simply getting richer.Many of the most profitable airlines in the world are also well-known for the level of service provided, and are often counted among the best airlines in the world based on assessments by various magazines and websites, with the World Airline Awards being considered the most prestigious. Some of the best airlines based on various categories include Singapore Airlines and Qatar Airways.A large part of an airline's profitability depends on the routes it flies. Even at a time when profits have been under pressure, some routes will still earn airlines hundreds of millions of dollars, with the most lucrative route in the world being worth over $1 billion, according to Forbes. The top 10 most lucrative routes earn revenues of over $6 billion between 2018 and 2019, with British Airways earning $1.16 billion on its route between London and New York. In fact, half of the most profitable routes are based from London's Heathrow Airport, one of the most popular airports in the world in terms of number of passengers. Recently, the airport saw its busiest month since the pandemic started, and this is only bound to increase in the next few months as summer truly grips Europe.However, one thing that investors in airline stocks are concerned about is the industry's contribution to climate change, with many governments emphasizing and preferring travel by train. In fact, France recently banned short-haul flights where a train journey of 2.5 hours would suffice. While many believe this is just lip service and doesn't impact climate change significantly, other similar bans could follow, which will be disastrous for European airlines.While short-haul flights being banned in the future is a possible negative outcome in the future, the rest does seem quite positive. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), net profits of the airline industry are expected to double to nearly $10 billion in 2023, at a net margin of just over 1.2% while operating profits are expected to exceed $22.4 billion in the same time period. The current expectation is that over 4.35 billion people will fly in 2023, much closer to 4.54 billion people who flew in 2019. Further, revenues are expected to cross $800 billion in 2023 for the first time since the pandemic hit, all of which shows that the airline industry is well on its way to recovery. IATA's Director General stated ""“Airline financial performance in 2023 is beating expectations. Stronger profitability is supported by several positive developments. China lifted COVID-19 restrictions earlier in the year than anticipated. Cargo revenues remain above pre-pandemic levels even though volumes have not. And, on the cost side, there is some relief. Jet fuel prices, although still high, have moderated over the first half of the year.” This has also resulted in a much more positive outlook by Delta's CEO Ed Bastian who said in the company's Q1 2023 earnings call ""With solid first quarter performance and visibility into the strength of summer travel demand, we are confident in our full year guidance for revenue growth of 15% to 20% year-over-year, earnings of $5 to $6 per share and free cash flow of over $2 billion, the three main guideposts we shared with you last December. For the June quarter, we expect to deliver the highest quarterly revenue in our history, a 15% operating margin and EPS of $2 to $2.25 a share. Our forecast operating profit of $2 billion matches Q2 of 2019, demonstrating that the earnings power of this franchise is intact.""However, despite the recovery posted by airlines, it is important to note that even some of the biggest airlines in the world have still not returned to profitability. This is why, some of the most profitable airlines in the world are still currently making losses, though if trends continue, that will not be the case for much longer. To determine our listing, we ascertained the 25 biggest airlines in the world through Fortune 500 and annual reports of each airline, and ranked them based on either their TTM net profit from continuing operations, or net profit as determined through their annual report, especially for airlines that aren't listed.

82,d0e102d1-bf28-3a33-83dd-a7a741ee1e27,PM,2023-06-14,2 “Strong Buy” Dividend Stocks With Up to 11% Dividend Yield,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-strong-buy-dividend-stocks-141810858.html,1686665890,STORY,"['PM', 'DHT']","[How do you manage risk when no one agrees on what the risks will be? Markets are rising right now, but today’s higher interest rates threaten a credit crunch, among other things, which could dampen the positive sentiment. The inflation numbers from May, just 4% annualized, were better than expected, which could justify the Fed dialing back its monetary tightening – but we don’t know if that will happen in time. In short, optimistic sentiment collides with unpredictable conditions.The uncertain environment is aptly summed up by Stifel strategist Barry Bannister who writes: “Since Oct-2022, economic resilience and policy prudence indicated to us no immediate ‘textbook’ recession. In turn, that led to a slightly easier Financial Conditions Index which lifted (reflexively) the S&amp;P 500 P/E ratio. We also believe recessions and bear markets are surprises and not so widely (perhaps universally?) anticipated, leaving consensus sentiment since Oct-2022 off-sides, but risk may indeed rise in 4Q23 and beyond.”“As the 2023 slowdown proves mild the economy encounters resource constraints late-2023 or 1H24, and because there is no economic reset as sought by the Fed, then between 4Q23 and 2Q24 there may be policy or economic risk,” Bannister added.In this environment, it’s only natural to move toward defensive stocks, as a proactive step to provide a level of protection against an adverse market. That will turn our attention to the high-yield dividend stocks, the classic defensive move. With their steady income streams and inflation-beating yields, these stocks can bring investors some peace of mind at a difficult time.Using the TipRanks platform, we’ve pulled up details on two div payers, with one offering a yield up to 11%. Here they are, with comments from the stock analysts at Stifel.DHT Holdings, Inc. (DHT)We’ll start in the energy sector, where DHT Holdings operates in a vital part of the world’s energy transport network. DHT, based in Bermuda, is an owner-operator of some of the world’s largest cargo vessels, very large crude carriers, or VLCCs. These are the largest class of crude oil tanker vessels, which mass approximately 300,000 tons, and DHT’s fleet totals 23 vessels. Moreover, these ships are typically operated on a charter basis, and in Q1, they brought the company time charter equivalent earnings of $49,100 per day.Story continuesDHT has seen benefits from higher tanker rates over the past year, which are visible in the company’s annual revenues. These totaled $295.8 million in 2021, and rose almost 22% to $360.4 million in 2022. The company has been working to actively expand its fleet, and in May of this year announced an agreement with Hyundai Heavy Industries to acquire a VLCC for $94.5 million. The vessel, built in 2018, is expected to be delivered during 3Q23.While the new acquisition is expensive, DHT has the resources to handle it. The company had $117.5 million in cash assets at the end of Q1, which is an increase from $58.6 million in 1Q22. Revenues in 1Q23 reached $93.9 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 142%. However, the Q1 top line fell short of expectations by $3.46 million. On the bottom line, DHT reported a GAAP EPS of 23 cents, missing the forecast by 1 cent per share. Nevertheless, this result represents a significant improvement from the 15-cent per share EPS loss in the year-ago quarter.Despite missing expectations in the Q1 financial results, DHT was able to use its strong cash growth to fund its dividend. The company declared a Q1 dividend payment of 23 cents per share, which was paid on May 25. That Q1 dividend marked 53 consecutive quarters of dividend payments, a solid record for investors to consider. And, at 92 cents per share annualized, the dividend yields 11.1%.Among the bulls is Stifel’s 5-star analyst Benjamin Nolan who writes: “Given the orderbook nears record lows, the company is well positioned to ride the momentum to deliver solid results, which should flow through to continued strong dividends. Given the stock trades at only 5x our EBITDA estimate, we see valuation expanding as strong rates materialize… DHT has a good, modern fleet, a strong balance sheet, and excellent strategy and discipline.”These comments back up Nolan’s Buy rating on DHT shares, and his $12 price target implies a one-year gain of 38% for the stock. Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has ~49% potential total return profile. (To watch Nolan’s track record, click here)Overall, DHT gets a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street’s analysts, based on 6 recent reviews that favor Buys over Holds by 5 to 1. The stock’s $8.69 trading price and $12.72 average price target suggests an upside of ~47% for the next 12 months. (See DHT stock forecast)Philip Morris International (PM)Changing focus, we’ll turn from crude oil tankers to a classic ‘sin’ stock, Philip Morris. This cigarette maker has long been known for its strong dividends, as well as its leading position in the global tobacco industry. Philip Morris owns the right to produce and market the iconic Marlboro brand cigarettes outside of the United States; among its other brand names are Next, Chesterfield, L&amp;M, and, of course, Philip Morris. The company can boast a first- or second-place market share position in most the 175 markets where its products are sold.The global tobacco industry is huge, valued at $867.6 billion last year and expected to reach $1.05 trillion by 2030, but the social and political trends are set against Big Tobacco. Philip Morris, like many of its peers, has been planning for a future of reduced tobacco consumption, and in recent years has invested more than $10.5 billion into a line of smokeless tobacco products. The company generated 29.1% of its total revenue from such products in 2021, and in 2022 it expanded that share to 32.1%. Philip Morris’ smokeless product line includes heated tobacco and e-vapor smoking substitutes, as well as oral smokeless tobaccos that provide nicotine with out the side effects of smoke.In the first quarter of 2023, Philip Morris reported net revenues of $8.02 billion, for a 3.5% increase year-over-year – but missed the estimates by $10 million. At the bottom line, the pattern was the opposite; the non-GAAP EPS of $1.38 per share was down from $1.56 in the prior-year quarter, but beat the forecast by 4 cents per share. The company had an operating cash flow reported at $10 billion to $11 billion, ‘at prevailing exchange rates, subject to year-end working capital requirements.’Philip Morris has an active capital return policy for shareholders, which in 1Q23 was conducted entirely through the dividend. The company’s most recent declaration, for $1.27 per share, was made on June 9 for a July 11 payout. At the annualized rate of $5.08 per common share, the dividend yields a solid 5.5%.Covering the stock for Stifel, analyst Matthew Smith writes that he remains bullish on PM, including among his reasons: “PMI maintains one of the strongest growth profiles amongst its Consumer Staples peers. Also, the acceleration on both a sales and EPS basis, driven by the development of its reduced risk products (RRPs), provides upside potential to its growth outlook. We believe there is a solid case for ownership of PM, given the strong and accelerating growth profile of IQOS [heated tobacco product], supporting robust long-term growth for the business alongside a discount valuation. We believe the strong free cash flow generation, which the company returns to shareholders in the form of a top-tier dividend (pushing up to over 5% yield), provides solid downside support for the shares.”Looking ahead, Smith rates PM shares as a Buy. His price target, set at $114, indicates his belief in a 23% upside on the one-year time frame. (To watch Smith’s track record, click here)Of the 10 recent analyst reviews on record for PM, 9 are to Buy against a single Hold – giving the stock its Strong Buy consensus rating. The average price target of $115.11 suggests a 24% one-year increase from the current trading price of $92.63.

The company’s vast platform capabilities include both digital and physical money movement networks.WU and the executive department are likely to work together to improve workers’ awareness of financial services through different campaigns.

In 2022, Filipino workers sent $38 million back home in remittances.The latest move strengthens Western Union’s relationship with the Department of Migrant Workers of more than two decades. The company is operating in the country for more than three decades.

84,f7c96b18-dba4-3404-8e52-10510ff9469c,TDG,2023-06-14,What Makes TransDigm (TDG) a New Strong Buy Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-transdigm-tdg-strong-buy-160006809.html,1686672006,STORY,['TDG'],"[TransDigm Group (TDG) could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for TransDigm basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock.For TransDigm, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for TransDigmThis aircraft components maker is expected to earn $24.01 per share for the fiscal year ending September 2023, which represents a year-over-year change of 40.1%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for TransDigm. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 3.4%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of TransDigm to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. Just take a look at American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG), which is up 70%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 35% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 11% , including dividends .So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for American International Group While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, American International Group achieved compound earnings per share growth of 19% per year. Notably, the 19% average annual share price gain matches up nicely with the EPS growth rate. This suggests that sentiment and expectations have not changed drastically. Au contraire, the share price change has arguably mimicked the EPS growth.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on American International Group's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for American International Group the TSR over the last 3 years was 83%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAmerican International Group shareholders are up 11% for the year (even including dividends). But that was short of the market average. The silver lining is that the gain was actually better than the average annual return of 3% per year over five year. This could indicate that the company is winning over new investors, as it pursues its strategy. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for American International Group   (of which 1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) you should know about.Of course American International Group may not be the best stock to buy.

MMSI completed the acquisition of a portfolio of dialysis catheter products and the BioSentry Biopsy Tract Sealant System from AngioDynamics, Inc. ANGO. This follows Merit Medical’s recent acquisition of the Surfacer Inside-Out Access Catheter System from Bluegrass Vascular Technologies, Inc.Management believes that these acquisitions will likely strengthen its position in the dialysis and biopsy markets, besides expanding its growing specialty dialysis device offering (which includes WRAPSODY Cell-Impermeable Endoprosthesis, HeRO Graft and the Surfacer System devices).These latest buyouts are a significant stepping stone for Merit Medical toward solidifying its foothold in the global dialysis space.Rationale Behind the AcquisitionsMerit Medical’s acquired dialysis catheter portfolio includes the BioFlo DuraMax Dialysis Catheter with Endexo Technology, a proprietary material more resistant to thrombus (blood clot) accumulation, in vitro, unlike conventional non-coated dialysis catheters. Per the company, thrombus formation can block blood flow through a catheter, thus preventing adequate dialysis treatment.AngioDynamics’ BioSentry Biopsy Tract Sealant System, designed specifically to reduce the incidence of biopsy-related pneumothorax (collapsed lung), is expected to complement Merit Medical’s comprehensive biopsy portfolio. Per Merit Medical’s estimates, pneumothorax, a potentially life-threatening complication that can extend hospitalization, occurs in approximately one-quarter of patients undergoing lung biopsy.The Surfacer, a device designed to obtain right-sided central venous access in patients with venous obstructions, is expected to provide this population with access to life saving therapies, including hemodialysis and chemotherapy.Per Merit Medical’s management, these selective investments are expected to expand its product portfolio in key strategic markets that leverage the company’s existing commercial footprint. Management also feels that since many dialysis patients rely on these solutions to receive vital therapies, thus combining this broad portfolio of interventional solutions within Merit Medical will allow it to leverage its physician relationships and commercial infrastructure to serve more patients.Story continuesFinancial ImplicationsThe acquired assets are expected to contribute revenues from the closing date through Dec 31, 2023, and dilute Merit Medical’s previously-guided GAAP gross and operating margin forecasts. The acquisitions are expected to be slightly dilutive to its full-year 2023 non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS).The acquisitions are expected to be accretive to non-GAAP net income and EPS in the first full-year post-close but dilutive to GAAP net income and EPS for that period. The acquisitions are expected to be accretive to non-GAAP gross and operating margins, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS in the second full-year post-close but dilutive to GAAP gross and operating margins, net income and EPS for that period.GuidanceMerit Medical has revised its outlook for 2023, including the impacts of acquisitions of AngioDynamics’ dialysis catheter portfolio and BioSentry Biopsy Tract Sealant System, and the Surfacer Inside-Out Access Catheter System.Net revenues for 2023 are now projected to be between $1.230 billion and $1.244 billion, reflecting an increase of approximately 7-8% over the comparable reported figures of 2022. This is up from the earlier guidance of $1.217 billion-$1.229 billion, reflecting an increase of approximately 6-7% over the comparable reported figures of 2022. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same stands at $1.24 billion.Net revenues from the cardiovascular segment are now expected to be in the range of $1.192 billion-$1.206 billion, representing an increase of approximately 7-8% over the comparable reported figures of 2022. This is up from the prior outlook of $1.179 billion-$1.191 billion, representing an increase of approximately 5-6% over the comparable reported figures of 2022.The endoscopy segment’s net revenues are continued to be projected between $37.8 million and $38.1 million, representing an increase of approximately 15-16% over the comparable reported figures of 2022. This is up from the prior outlook of $37.5 million-$37.8 million, representing an increase of approximately 14-16% over the comparable reported figures of 2022.Adjusted EPS for 2023 is now projected to be within $2.81-$2.92, down from the earlier projection of $2.83-$2.93. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same stands at $2.89.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Allied Market Research, the global dialysis market was valued at $91,205.0 million in 2020 and is projected to reach $129,756.8 million by 2028 at a CAGR of 4.7%. Factors like the increase in number of diabetic and hypertension patients, a rise in the number of end stage renal disease patients and a preference over kidney transplantation are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest buyouts are expected to provide a significant boost to Merit Medical’s business in the niche space.Notable DevelopmentsIn April, Merit Medical announced its first-quarter 2023 results, wherein it registered a solid year-over-year uptick in the top and bottom lines. The company saw revenue growth in both its segments and across all the product categories within its Cardiovascular unit. Robust performances in the United States and outside were also recorded.In March, Merit Medical announced the expansion of its SwiftNINJA Steerable Microcatheter product line, which belongs to its delivery systems portfolio.

The optimism led by a solid second-quarter fiscal 2023 performance, along with a few regulatory approvals, is expected to contribute further. Forex woes and significant consolidation persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 6.1% compared with the 18.6% rise of the industry and 16.4% growth of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned medical technology company has a market capitalization of $71.21 billion. It projects 10.1% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. BD has delivered an earnings surprise of 5.8% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Regulatory Approvals: BD has been progressing impressively on the regulatory front, raising our optimism. In May, BD received the FDA’s 510(k) clearance for the new BD Kiestra Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus imaging application.At the time of its second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings release in May, BD confirmed that its BD Life Sciences segment’s Integrated Diagnostic Solutions business unit filed for US regulatory clearance of BD MiniDraw.Product Launches: We are upbeat about BD’s slew of product launches in recent times. In May, the company announced expanded customer availability of an all-in-one prefilled flush syringe with an integrated disinfection unit designed to reinforce compliance with infection prevention guidelines and simplify nursing workflow.The same month, BD announced the worldwide commercial launch of a new-to-world cell sorting instrument, BD FACSDiscover S8 Cell Sorter, featuring two breakthrough technologies (BD SpectralFX Technology and BD CellView Image Technology).Strong Q2 Results: BD’s solid second-quarter fiscal 2023 results buoy our optimism. The company registered solid top-line and bottom-line results, along with improvements in the overall base revenues. Robust performances by the majority of its segments and both geographic regions were seen. Strength in BD’s segment’s business units during the reported quarter was also witnessed. The expansion of both margins bodes well.Story continuesDownsidesSignificant Consolidation: The medical technology industry has been experiencing a significant amount of consolidation, resulting in companies with greater scale and market presence than BD. As a result, competition among medical device suppliers to provide goods and services has increased. Further consolidation in the industry could intensify competition among medical device suppliers and exert additional pressure on the demand for and prices of BD’s products.Forex Woes: BD generates a substantial amount of its revenues from international operations. The revenues BD report with respect to its operations outside the United States may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. BD cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which it can mitigate such risks.Estimate TrendBD is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for fiscal 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 0.4% north to $12.19.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $4.83 billion, suggesting a 3.9% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Netflix has landed a partnership to stream live celebrity golf tournaments. Gen Z comprises the largest group of Americans who watch or stream shows with closed captioning turned on. Yahoo Finance Live breaks down several trending stories this afternoon.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: Let's take a look at some of the top trending stories of the day. We've got Josh Schafer, Alexandra Canal back at the table here to help us break it all down.We got to start off, one of the trending stocks of the year, and it's a trending story today, with Apple. Apple getting a downgrade here from UBS. Some of the fear here just about the fact that iPhone sales are going to slow. Some of that growth is going to slow in the second half of the year. From this note, the analysts there saying that we do not believe Apple shares offer a compelling risk reward right now, especially in light of that soft iPhone PC and also the App Store fundamentals over the next 6 to 12 months.So it really speaks to a few things here. One, just the demand right now, the appetite among people who are already Apple users to get a new phone. But then two, the fact that people are pulling back some on their consumer discretionary spending.- But what's interesting, although it dinged the stock a bit, it didn't, I wouldn't say it took a bite out of Apple. Sorry, I had to throw that pun in there. Maybe more like a nibble. I mean, look it's down 3/10 of a percent there, so not much. It's really hard to stop the run that we're seeing in Apple, especially like even when you go back to its last split, it was at $100 a share for that split. And look at how much it's run up since then. So it's hard, although it does trade at a significant premium, so I see their point. But look, you have more than 2/3 of analysts still bullish on Apple.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, overall, I mean, it's kind of a valuation call, right, what you're going to see in names like this as they do run up, Apple up over 40% to start the year. So this analyst actually has $190 price target on the stock too, to actually moved the price target up today, from $180 to $190, which in theory is still showing some upside on Apple over the next couple months.Story continuesBut one chart that I did find interesting here, which is taking a look at when you think about Apple's growth, you think beyond the US, right. And you take a look at that chart on your screen now, you can see how greater China revenue has really fallen off, also Japan significantly lower there. And then the point that they really made in the note is if India is supposed to be a growth part for Apple, a growth country for Apple, they're just not a big enough part of the market yet. So where do you grow? Maybe it's that iPhone 15, Ali. Maybe that's somewhere where people buy. But right now, when you're talking about just the next quarter or two, it doesn't look overly bullish for iPhone sales.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Right. And I think over the long term, we're going to see that pick up. Because Dan Ives from Wedbush, he made a good point. He said in his current analysis, roughly 250 million iPhones have not been upgraded in over four years. And that sets Apple up for some major upgrade cycles down the line. I actually just upgraded my phone a couple months ago. I only had one--- Ooh, what do we have?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Well, now I have the 14XR. I got the big guy. I also do like my cheetah--- We love a little cheetah print.ALEXANDRA CANAL: --phone case. But the main reason I upgraded was because my battery life was running. It was so hard to charge it. So that's how Apple gets you. And they just find a way to keep people in their ecosystem.- Some of that may have been apps. And they had a problem with that years ago in terms of that's why they had the payout that they had to do with consumers because it was found that they were throttling. So I don't know if that's happening as much now. But to your point about, do I need a new iPhone? No. But I literally started thinking about, oh, pay attention to the next cycle that's coming out and seeing what's new, what's better. And they kind of capture you in their ecosystem.And one more quick note I wanted to say, just about the India call and their point in the note about India. Look, on their last earnings call, Tim Cook was bullish on India. So it's interesting that you see the analysts saying, eh, maybe not so fast.JOSH SCHAFER: I just think it's going to take a long time to develop, right. They just put their first store in India. So we need-- like there's a lot of work to be done there for it to become their next true emerging market.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. And also, just going back to your valuation point, where we started here, just to put all of that in context, it's trading at 29 times estimated earnings, which is a 50% premium to where many of its peers are. So just in that short-term view, I think that's a big issue with UBS right now.JOSH SCHAFER: And that's at a 10-year high compared to the S&amp;P 500 too. That was also in that note. Impressive. Like even high for Apple too, right.But Apple has been trying to get into sports streaming. And we're taking a look at a different potential sports streamer, I guess today, with Netflix. Netflix saying that they want to get into live sports streaming, at least this is per a report from the ""Wall Street Journal."" So the Journal coming out and saying that Netflix is going to combine two of its already sports products that it offers, when you think about what it's done with Formula One and ""Drive to Survive"" and golf in ""Full Swing."" So they're going to take characters from both of those, so professional golfers and professional F1 drivers, put them on a golf course, mic them up and stream a live event from Las Vegas, at least per the ""Wall Street Journal"" that's what's going to happen.I personally don't love it. I'm so sick of celebrity golf tournaments and people thinking that we're interested in this. I think that was a pandemic peak. It was fun when there weren't any sports and I was bored. There's real sports on now. I don't really care about watching.- Well, hopefully they don't fumble this one, like they did-- sorry for the sports pun there-- like they did with ""Love is Blind,"" right?JOSH SCHAFER: It'd be a swing and a miss.- Exactly. There we go. That's a better pun.SEANA SMITH: [INAUDIBLE] what I was going to say, I wonder if they're really using this more just in terms of their experiment and practicing with live events before maybe they potentially reach some sort of partnership with sports. I don't know.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Look, I think it's smart just because to actually get live sports content like we've seen with Apple and Amazon, it's so expensive. And Netflix has repeatedly said that's not an area they want. So rather than that, they're focusing on documentaries. They're focusing on creating their own live sports content, creating these cast of characters that are then becoming viral that they can piggyback on, essentially, in order to create more content.So I think it's a smart move. And I've spoken to many experts that the live sports arena in general is pretty much untapped right now in the streaming space. I think there's a lot of more that you can do there. And I think it's smart that Netflix is taking a different approach.SEANA SMITH: But why do it?- Well, content.SEANA SMITH: No, no, no, no, no. But why this teaming up, I'm saying. Like just in terms of the demand for that, I don't see this being--JOSH SCHAFER: You're leveraging, I guess-- I said I didn't like it in the beginning and now I'm playing the other side, right. But you're leveraging the characters that you have, right. So it might make me like Max Verstappen more or someone from F1 more. It might make me like Brooks Koepka more.SEANA SMITH: And it gets into the loyalty factor.JOSH SCHAFER: Right. So then it gets you back to watch the next season of ""Full Swing,"" I guess, because this takes them-- those live golf events, I will say, if anything, you do hear a little bit more of the athlete's personality than you normally would, because they're on a hot mic. So you can kind of-- the announcer, whoever is emceeing the event can mess with them a little bit. And so it feeds into their own content. I think it's more about that than it is about sports.ALEXANDRA CANAL: And ""Full Swing"" was rolling when the PGA-LIV Golf merger was announced. So you know they're probably going to tease that a little bit with this celebrity tournament. So Netflix is very smart. They're always thinking one step ahead. And I think that is the narrative moving forward at this company.- Yeah.SEANA SMITH: Maybe. I don't know. I'm just skeptical. I mean, you guys have laid out very, very strong cases for why Netflix would do this and this exact pairing when it comes to F1 ""Drive to Survive"" and with the golf, what was it called, Swing--JOSH SCHAFER: ""Full Swing.""SEANA SMITH: ""Full Swing."" I watched some of it, but I got a little bit bored. To me, that's why I'm not fully on board with all this. But it does make sense, just in terms of their broader play here, entry into live events and what that could look like for Netflix.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah. And they have live events. They have a lot of international content, like ""Squid Game"" and ""Squid Game"" was actually one of the first series to get me into closed captioning. And that's what I'm watching today.Because apparently, that's what all the young kids are doing. They are watching content with the captions on. According to a May survey, 70% of adult Gen-Z respondents and 53% of Millennial respondents said that they watch content with text. And if you compare that to older respondents, there was only about 1/3 of those that said that they did that. So it's transitioning from people watching closed captions because they can't hear versus people just like it more. They concentrate better. I think people have gotten used to seeing that on social media and TikTok. I know I personally do it. I find myself doing it a lot.- Oh, I do it. I do it all the time. It's a multitasking, so I'll speak to the, I guess, the senior citizen side of this table. I do it. It's not because, I haven't lost this yet, my hearing yet. But I do. I think it is, to your point, a habit from social media. I do also like the accessibility factor. Like this is providing accessibility for people who are hard of hearing. So that is a nice feature. But my main reason is definitely the multitasking aspect. But one thing I know that stood out was some people are doing it because of accents, right, with some shows--ALEXANDRA CANAL: Oh, yes, ""Bridgerton,"" I need it.JOSH SCHAFER: That's how I use it. One of my favorite shows was ""Peaky Blinders."" They're speaking English but they just have very hard accents to understand.SEANA SMITH: I was going to say, it's easy when, or at least to me, it became a little bit addicting, I started using it when I started watching ""Downton Abbey."" And sometimes when they're speaking a little fast, it's hard to follow with the British accent. So I started using it there and then fell in love with it. And I use it across the board with social media too.You can see, we have up on our screen some of the hardest to understand actors.- Two of those, I don't know. I mean, I could see, I could see Arnold Schwarzenegger being a little difficult to understand sometimes. Sean Connery, now, come on.JOSH SCHAFER: Tom Hardy in ""Peaky Blinders."" In ""Peaky Blinders,"" he's very hard to understand in that show. Case in point. But overall, it's good for the streamers, right, because it makes your library bigger. And I think that's the biggest thing here is you can now offer us something that we wouldn't have been able to watch before.The Spotify documentary or series that's featuring Daniel Ek is all in subtitles. It's pretty good. I would have never watched it, because it's in Swedish.ALEXANDRA CANAL: With the rise of AI and everything like that, I think there's going to be a lot of developments in this space. Apple is exploring when you're FaceTiming someone, you can get the closed captions of what they're saying. So there's only going to be more of this.And now there's a lot of options too. You can pick your colors. You can pick your font. It's not just one size fits all. Because I have contacts. I have bad eyesight. Not hard of hearing, but bad eyesight.JOSH SCHAFER: Closed captions in the headset. That's what I'm excited for.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah. Yeah. That's true.JOSH SCHAFER: As we're all wearing headsets--[INTERPOSING VOICES]JOSH SCHAFER: Once we're all wearing headsets 24/7, we'd get the closed captions in there.ALEXANDRA CANAL: We'll be here sitting on this table in 10 years--[INTERPOSING VOICES] People rightSEANA SMITH: People right now are watching us with closed captions. You never know.Guys, we got to leave it there. Josh, Alli, thanks so much.]"

109,7871d476-1ecd-341a-b30d-42626ca73299,PSX,2023-06-14,The 7 Best Stocks to Buy in June for the Looming Recession,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-stocks-buy-june-235022786.html,1686181822,STORY,"['ALL', 'PG', 'PSX', 'KO', 'KR', 'ALRM']","[Although recent data points suggest that investors should anticipate a robust bull market ahead, a potentially upcoming plot twist might favor the best stocks for looming recession. At first, such a notion seems ridiculous primarily because of the most recent May jobs report. With the economy adding more employment opportunities than anticipated, what’s the big worry?While a positive development, the reality of a strong labor market is that more dollars chase after fewer goods. Obviously, that’s an inflationary dynamic – the very circumstance that the Federal Reserve wanted to avoid. Therefore, it’s possible that the central bank could continue to aggressively raise rates. If so, at some point, the economy might enter a downcycle, benefitting safe stocks for recession.Moreover, retailers have noticed that consumers have been trading down to cheaper alternatives for commonly purchase items. Specifically, even well-off customers have traded down to cheaper forms of protein. Thus, all might not be so well, providing a cynical catalyst for these top stocks for economic downturn.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsProcter &amp; Gamble (PG)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockA multinational consumer goods giant, Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) might as well symbolize the quintessential example of best stocks for looming recession. While it’s a slightly different narrative, when the Covid-19 crisis struck, Procter &amp; Gamble proved its worth. Providing everyday necessary products, the company hardly rates as a sexy investment. Nevertheless, it pretty much will always be relevant.Financially, the consumer goods enterprise’s main strengths lie predictably in its profitability metrics. For example, its trailing-year operating margin stands at 21.7% while its net margin (during the same period) clocks in at 17.69%. Both stats rank well above their respective sector median values. In addition, P&amp;G’s return on equity (ROE) soars at 31.72%, outflanking 94.42% of its peers.Story continuesOperationally, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate (on a per-share basis) is 5.8%, which is roughly in the middle for the underlying industry. However, its EBITDA growth rate comes in at 31.2%, beating 80.91% of its peers. Finally, analysts peg PG as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $165.44, implying almost 15% upside potential.Coca-Cola (KO)Man holding stacks of money. Top millionaire-maker stocks to buySource: Epic Cure / ShutterstockA multinational soft drink icon, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) commands attention for its namesake line of beverages. Fundamentally, the company should attain relevance as one of the best stocks for looming recession thanks to the trade-down effect. For instance, as more businesses start cracking the whip regarding return-to-office mandates, Coca-Cola could become the cheaper caffeine-providing alternative.Further, as people return to the drudgery of the nine-to-five grind, they’ll need a pick-me-up. For that, it’s difficult to beat the value proposition underlining Coca-Cola. Thus, KO appears a solid case for safe stocks for recession. Indeed, if a downturn materializes, people will likely be desperate to keep their jobs. And that means showing up to the office everyday if necessary.In fairness, Coca-Cola’s financials aren’t exactly remarkable. However, its main strength lies in its profitability. Its net margin clocks in at 22.69%, beating out 94.29% of the competition. Also, its ROE impresses at 41.12, indicating an extremely high-quality enterprise. Lastly, analysts peg KO a consensus strong buy. Their average price target hits $69.94, implying over 15% upside potential.Allstate (ALL)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comAs an insurance company, Allstate (NYSE:ALL) enjoys a concept known as a captive or hostage audience. Put another way weather we suffer a recession or not companies like Allstate will likely be permanently relevant. For example, in the U.S., most states require drivers to have some form of auto insurance. Basically, recession or no recession, drivers will have to pay for their insurance coverage. Cynically, ALL’s an ideal play for top stocks for economic downturn.In full disclosure, insurance enterprises don’t usually have sterling financials and Allstate is no different. Conspicuously, the company’s balance sheet could use some work. Its cash-to-debt ratio sits at 0.08 times, ranked worse than 95.22% of its peers. As well, its equity-to-asset ratio of 0.18 is rather middling.On the flipside, Allstate represents a viable idea for best stocks for looming recession thanks to its three-year revenue growth rate of 14.2%. This stat ranks better than 82.68% of the competition. Even with that robust performance, the market prices ALL at a trailing sales multiple of only 0.55. As a discount to revenue, Allstate rates better than 72.41% of other insurance players. In closing, analysts peg ALL as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes in at $134.27, implying 22% upside potential.Phillips 66 (PSX)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7A downstream energy specialist, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) focuses on the refining, chemical and retail components of the hydrocarbon value chain. Very quickly, Phillips 66 differs from upstream players, which deal with exploration and production and midstream enterprises, which involve storage and transportation. Fundamentally, downstream companies could enjoy a rise in demand thanks to the aforementioned return-to-office dynamic.More than likely, the audience may be tired of hearing about the return of the nine-to-five grind. However, as an investor, this shift imparts significant implications, especially for best stocks for looming recession. Again, as worker desperation heightens amid concerns about an economic slowdown, people will see to be counted. To paraphrase tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, you can’t do that phoning it in.Obviously, for Phillips 66, the benefit centers on a rising total addressable market. Currently, the company enjoys a three-year revenue growth rate of 14.9%, which is quite impressive. However, my argument is that sales should increase as companies recall their employees back to the cubicles. Making another case for reliable stocks in recession, analysts peg PSX a consensus strong buy. Their average price target reaches $121.44, implying over 25% upside potential.Kroger (KR)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comSometimes, the most obvious ideas for best stocks for looming recession turns out to be the most effective. Therefore, I’m putting my eyes on Kroger (NYSE:KR). Again, we saw similar trends play out during the initial onslaught of the Covid-19 crisis. While it’s a slightly different tale, people nevertheless rushed to their local grocery stores to buy essential goods.Put another way, Kroger benefits from a permanently relevant business profile. Even amid the threat of a pernicious pandemic, people needed access to everyday products. I’m certain a similar framework will appear for KR should a recession turn up. Therefore, Kroger makes sense as one of the reliable stocks in recession.Even better, Kroger offers an enticingly discounted proposition. Right now, the market prices KR at a forward multiple of 10.31. As a discount to projected earnings, Kroger ranks better than 80.3% of the competition. Operationally, it’s no slouch either, printing a three-year revenue growth rate of 10.3%, above 71.43% of sector players. Looking to the Street, analysts peg KR as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $59, implying over 28% upside potential.Alarm (ALRM)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image.Source: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.comTo be completely upfront, Alarm (NASDAQ:ALRM) represents an unorthodox and risky candidate for best stocks for looming recession. However, ALRM has held up well, gaining almost 5% of equity value since the Jan. opener. Much of this positively may center on its core business of home automation and monitoring services. It’s cynical but should a recession appear, personal safety will likely take precedence.Now, to present a fair assessment, much debate exists around the idea that recessions spark increased criminality. However, as the World Economic Forum pointed out, recessions usually lead to an increase in youth unemployment. Further, youth who graduate during economic downturns are more likely to engage in crime.Whatever the academic reality is, people today are vey much concerned about increases in criminal activity and the broader criticism of law enforcement that have hurt retention efforts among police departments. Just by logical deduction, ALRM appears one of the more relevant stocks to buy before recession.Further, analysts peg ALRM as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target hits $64.50, implying 25% upside potential.Kelly Services (KELYA)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comAn office staffing company with a global footprint, Kelly Service (NASDAQ:KELYA) might seem irrelevant as one of the best stocks for looming recession. After all, the latest jobs report came in hotter than expected, implying that a recession may be well off. Still, the Fed might respond aggressively to the implied inflationary dynamic. After so much intervention, the action could lead to a downturn.If so, I believe Kelly represents a candidate for safe stocks for recession. Naturally, should the economy slow down, more companies will issue mass layoffs. In turn, workers will likely become desperate. As a side note, this is why employees should be careful about putting up too much of a fuss regarding back-to-office initiatives. You don’t want to get a bad reputation at a bad time.Now, Kelly Services stands out from other employment agencies because of its diverse connections. In other words, the company isn’t just limited to certain professional fields. It also offers opportunities in warehousing and manufacturing roles. Hey, desperate times call for desperate measures. On a final note, analysts peg KELYA as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $25, implying nearly 35% upside potential.PGProcter &amp; Gamble$144.80KOCoca-Cola$60.22ALLAllstate$112.22PSXPhillips 66$101.05KRKroger$45.46ALRMAlarm.com$52.09KELYAKelly Services$19.06On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Favorable responses to deals, with product offerings appealing to a broader customer base, have been contributing to Ollie's Bargain’s performance. No wonder, the company’s favorable vendor relationships are also its strength.Business Model Resonates Well With CustomersOllie's Bargain’s focus on value-driven merchandise assortments positioned it well to capitalize on opportunities in the marketplace and effectively meet consumer demand. Ollie's Army continued to be a major sales driver, with membership increasing continuously. The company ended the first quarter of fiscal 2023 with more than 13.3 million active Ollie's Army members, which accounted for slightly more than 80% of sales.The company’s results depend on the availability of the brand name and closeout merchandise at compelling prices. Brand name and closeout merchandise represented about 65%, and non-closeout goods and private-label products collectively accounted for roughly 35% of fiscal 2022 merchandise purchases.Undoubtedly, Ollie's Bargain remains committed to offering better deals, improving operating margins and increasing the store count. The company should benefit from a favorable closeout environment and trade-down activity.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStore Growth StrategyAs far as Ollie's Bargain’s store growth strategy is concerned, management aims for more than 1,050 stores in the long run, with a goal to open 50 to 55 stores annually. Ollie's Bargain increased its store base at a CAGR of 11.5% from 303 stores in fiscal 2018 to 468 stores in fiscal 2022.We note that the company opened 46 and 40 stores in fiscal 2021 and 2022, respectively. It now intends to open 45 new stores, less one closure in fiscal 2023. In addition to opening new outlets, Ollie's Bargain is also remodeling stores. The company plans to remodel 30 to 40 stores and has so far completed 11 remodels. Ollie's Bargain also continues to invest in the distribution network to support store growth.Taking a cue from the past, we noticed that net sales surged at a CAGR of 10.2% from $1.241 billion in fiscal 2018 to $1.827 billion in fiscal 2022.Story continuesSolid Q1 Highlights PotentialOllie's Bargain registered a stellar first-quarter fiscal 2023 performance, wherein the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while the bottom line met the same. Markedly, both metrics grew year over year.The company posted adjusted earnings of 49 cents a share, which came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased meaningfully from 20 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. Net sales of $459.2 million jumped 12.9% year over year due to a comparable store sales increase and new store unit growth. The top line came ahead of the consensus mark of $451 million and marked the second straight beat.Robust first-quarter results and continued momentum in the business prompted management to lift the fiscal 2023 view.Management now envisions fiscal 2023 net sales between $2.052 billion and $2.067 billion, suggesting an increase from $1.827 billion reported in fiscal 2022. Ollie’s Bargain now anticipates comparable store sales to rise in the band of 2-2.8% against the comparable store sales decline of 3% reported last fiscal year.Management now foresees fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings in the range of $2.56-$2.65 per share, up from the adjusted earnings of $1.62 reported last fiscal. The company had earlier projected adjusted earnings between $2.49 and $2.58 per share.ConclusionOllie's Bargain’s strategic endeavors position the stock firmly for growth. We believe that improved closeout opportunities, increased trade down from consumers and significant room for increasing the store count should support this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Shares of this Harrisburg, PA-based company have rallied 36.6% so far in the year against the industry’s decline of 7.1%.Stocks Looking Red HotHere we have highlighted three better-ranked stocks, namely Kroger KR, The TJX Companies TJX and Walmart WMT.Kroger, a supermarket operator, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Through their participation in these programs, customers are expected to save approximately $300 million1 on their utility bills annually. These savings are the result of many program activities, including recycling over 16,000 appliances, delivering over 11 million high-efficiency LED lightbulbs and completing over 53,000 home energy audits from the program's implementation through March 2023.Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG) is a publicly traded diversified energy company.

117,914939b3-3a28-3964-8513-d1369f50170a,GD,2023-06-14,General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) shareholders have earned a 14% CAGR over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-dynamics-nyse-gd-shareholders-120033678.html,1686744033,STORY,['GD'],"[Thanks in no small measure to Vanguard founder Jack Bogle, it's easy buy a low cost index fund, which should provide the average market return. But you can make superior returns by picking better-than average stocks. To wit, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) shares are up 37% in three years, besting the market return. In contrast, the stock is actually down 1.0% in the last year, suggesting a lack of positive momentum.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for General Dynamics There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.General Dynamics was able to grow its EPS at 1.2% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. In comparison, the 11% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago. It's not unusual to see the market 're-rate' a stock, after a few years of growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on General Dynamics' earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for General Dynamics the TSR over the last 3 years was 48%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveGeneral Dynamics shareholders are up 1.3% for the year (even including dividends). But that was short of the market average. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 5% over five years. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for General Dynamics   you should know about.General Dynamics is not the only stock insiders are buying.

(“CAB”), the representative body of banks and other financial institutions in the region.Shares of Mastercard declined 1.1% on Jun 13, replicating declines in broader markets.The partnership with the CAB provides an opportunity to Mastercard to leverage its technology, expertise and resources for the seamless integration of Mastercard Cross-Border Services within the product suite of Caribbean banks. Simultaneously, the tech giant will also make its knowledge and educational platforms available to the region’s citizens and small business owners. This, in turn, is likely to make them acquainted with the benefits of using MA’s cross-border services offering and other digital financial tools.The ulterior move behind the collaboration remains to extend advanced financial services and pave the way for seamless cross-border payments for customers across the member jurisdictions of the CAB. A diversified client base comprising consumers, small and medium-sized enterprises, government agencies and commercial entities can reap the benefits of faster and more reliable cross-border money transfers.  Mastercard also intends to complement one of its longstanding endeavors through the latest move, which is to bring the unbanked and the underbanked within the ambit of a booming digital economy.By extending solutions tailored to meet the specific needs of markets in different parts of the world, Mastercard has successfully established a solid foothold across the global digital payments market. An expanding digital economy spurred by increased Internet penetration and higher adoption of mobile phones might have lured Mastercard to delve deeper into the region via the MoU.The recent tie-up seems to be a tmely move on the part of Mastercard and will further solidify the footprint of the tech giant in the Caribbean region. Concerns related to intra and inter-regional payments, the high cost of fund transfer and multiple intricacies in the way of making cross-border payments across the CAB jurisdictions make an affordable and tech-based solution the need of the hour for Caribbean people.Mastercard’s innovative digital suite built on collaborations and substantial investments makes it the preferred choice for infusing digitization across several markets by financial institutions worldwide.In April 2023, MA inked a MoU with the national payment switch of Ethiopia, EthSwitch, to enable the latter bring about secure, fast as well as seamless domestic and cross-border digital money transfers across the country through leveraging the Mastercard Send platform.Shares of Mastercard have gained 14.2% in a year, compared with the industry’s 6.3% growth.

Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.DLocal and MasterCard are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This means that DLO's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.DLO currently has a forward P/E ratio of 21.19, while MA has a forward P/E of 30.63. We also note that DLO has a PEG ratio of 0.77. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. MA currently has a PEG ratio of 1.75.Another notable valuation metric for DLO is its P/B ratio of 8.90. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, MA has a P/B of 66.05.These metrics, and several others, help DLO earn a Value grade of B, while MA has been given a Value grade of C.Story continuesDLO has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than MA, so it seems like value investors will conclude that DLO is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for QUALCOMM Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$9.30bUS$11.8bUS$11.4bUS$12.4bUS$13.0bUS$13.4bUS$13.8bUS$14.2bUS$14.5bUS$14.9bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x8Analyst x7Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.24%Est @ 2.90%Est @ 2.67%Est @ 2.50%Est @ 2.38% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 10% US$8.4kUS$9.7kUS$8.5kUS$8.4kUS$8.0kUS$7.5kUS$7.0kUS$6.5kUS$6.1kUS$5.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$76bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 10%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$15b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (10%– 2.1%) = US$188bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$188b÷ ( 1 + 10%)10= US$71bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$147b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$122, the company appears about fair value at a 7.6% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at QUALCOMM as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.360. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for QUALCOMMStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For QUALCOMM, we've compiled three relevant aspects you should assess:Risks: We feel that you should assess the 2 warning signs for QUALCOMM (1 shouldn't be ignored!) we've flagged before making an investment in the company.Future Earnings: How does QCOM's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

Is It Time To Buy In?,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pentagon-just-announced-2-1-162053135.html,1686673253,STORY,"['LMT', 'RTX']","[The U.S. Department of Defense announced a new $2.1 billion security assistance package for Ukraine.The package includes funding for additional munitions for Patriot air defense systems, HAWK air defense systems and missiles, Puma unmanned aerial systems, laser-guided rocket system munitions, 105 mm and 203 mm artillery rounds as well as support for training and maintenance.The new funding is being provided under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI).“This USAI package illustrates the continued commitment to both Ukraine’s critical near-term capabilities as well as the enduring capacity of Ukraine’s armed forces to defend its territory and deter Russian aggression over the long term,” the Pentagon said in a statement.Since the Russia-Ukraine war began in February 2022, the Biden administration has provided more than $39.7 billion in security assistance to Ukraine.Developments along geopolitical conflicts often generate increased interest in the defense sector. Here’s a look at two defense contractors that stand to benefit from Biden’s new military aid package — Wall Street also sees upside in this duo.Don't miss:Bezos-Backed Startup Lets You Become A Landlord With $100Elon Musk Is Bullish On Austin. Here's How To Invest In The City's Growth Before He Floods It With New Tech WorkersLockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT)Bloomberg reports that one of the components of the package is the Patriot Advanced Capability Missile-3 (PAC-3) made by Lockheed Martin.Lockheed Martin has a long track record of doing business with the U.S. Department of Defense and other federal government agencies. Out of the $66 billion of net sales the company generated in 2022, $48.5 billion — or 73% — came from the U.S. government.Known for its F-35 fighter jets, the company has four operating segments: aeronautics, missiles and fire control, rotary and mission systems and space.As you’d expect from the current geopolitical landscape, the defense contractor’s business is doing well. In the first quarter of 2023, Lockheed Martin generated $15.1 billion in net sales, $1.7 billion in net earnings and $1.3 billion in free cash flow.Story continuesIt also returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks during the quarter. At the current share price, the company offers an annual dividend yield of 2.6%.Citi analyst Jason Gursky has a Buy rating on Lockheed Martin and a price target of $579, implying a potential upside of 26%.Raytheon Technologies Corp. (NYSE: RTX)The new weapons package also includes the Guidance Enhanced Missile (GEM-T) manufactured by Raytheon, according to Bloomberg.Raytheon is another heavyweight player in aerospace and defense. In 2022, it brought in $67 billion in sales, up 4% from 2021.Business continues to grow in 2023.According to its latest earnings report, Raytheon generated $17.2 billion in sales in the first quarter, representing a 10% increase year over year. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.22, up 6% from the year-ago period.Like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon is a dividend-paying company. With a quarterly payout of 59 cents per share, the stock offers an annual yield of 2.4%.Baird analyst Peter Arment has an Outperform rating on Raytheon and a price target of $115 — around 16% above where the stock currently sits.Raytheon has been paying cash dividends every year since 1936. But aerospace and defense isn’t the only place investors can find dividend opportunities. For instance, passive income investors have long been attracted to residential real estate because of its potential for providing consistent rental income and building long-term wealth.Whether it’s war or peace, people will always need a place to live, and a growing number of people are now renting instead of buying. These days, there also are options to invest in rental properties with as little as $100.Read next: Closing the Wealth Gap: Investment Fund Delivers Impressive Returns To Its Investors And TenantsHow These Accredited Investors Pulled In Better Returns Than Warren Buffett Photo: Kyiv, Ukraine February 20, 2023 U.S. President Joe Biden and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy attend a joint news briefing, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine.

The positive turn can also be witnessed in the builder confidence level that rose five points to 50 in May from April, according to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI). This was the first time since July 2022, when sentiment levels reached the midpoint.Market pundits noted that owing to the limited existing inventory, new construction is getting a boost and defying financial market challenges.Apart from the prevailing industry headwinds, affordability was the most important issue. The same did not allow buyers to indulge in home-buying activity. Nominal wage gains, lower mortgage rates and declining home prices boosted housing affordability in the first quarter of 2023. Per the recent NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Opportunity Index (HOI), 45.6% of new and existing homes sold in the first quarter were affordable to families earning the U.S. median income of $96,300. This was higher than fourth-quarter 2022 levels, where only 38.1% homes were affordable.Another important factor that limited homebuilders to build more was lack of buildable lot. The recent HMI survey also revealed that a total of 67% of builders reported some type of shortage versus 76% in September 2021.On another positive note, private residential construction spending grew for the first time since June 2022 to 0.5% in April compared with March 2023 levels.Demand for new homes, which is improving in lower-density markets, effective cost control and higher operating leverage are also helping industry players to offset challenges like higher inflationary pressure, tight labor and tightening credit conditions on construction loans. These positives are benefiting the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry and its supportive building materials and other industries.Companies like Toll Brothers, Inc. TOL, PulteGroup Inc. PHM, M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. MDC, Owens Corning OC, PGT Innovations, Inc. PGTI, Comfort Systems USA, Inc. FIX and LSI Industries Inc.

Management expects expenses to rise 3% this year, and the recent growth initiatives will likely add another 1%.

The global hedge fund industry’s assets amounted to $3.8 trillion at the end of the year. Last year was also one of the worst for the sector in terms of returns since the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. HFRI 500 Fund Weighted Composite Index, which tracks the performance of some of the biggest global hedge funds, reported that overall hedge funds fell by 4.25% in 2022, with equity hedge funds declining by 10.37%.Despite this performance, some of the biggest funds managed to deliver stable returns, compensating for the losses of the overall industry. Bloomberg reported that major hedge funds like Citadel Investment Group and Millennium Management produced double-digit gains last year. The report also mentioned that the funds with a focus on macroeconomic trends also reported strong gains. These funds made bets on stocks benefitting from inflation and consistent interest rate hikes, which was a smart move considering analysts’ prediction of a shaky market this year as well.Also read: Dividend Champions vs Aristocrats: 12 Under-the-Radar Stocks to ConsiderThese unstable market conditions push investors to seek conservative investments in well-known companies due to their brand reputation, financial strength, and market dominance.

ROK as the Bull of the Day and International Paper IP as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Nvidia NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices AMD, and Intel INTC.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Rockwell Automation, Inc. is an industrial automation and digital transformation company that’s posting strong top and bottom-line growth as it benefits from broader mega-trends across the economy, including reshoring and a never-ending push to streamline work through technological advancement.Rockwell aims to help companies throughout various sectors and industries improve via an array of smart manufacturing offerings. ROK shares have soared over the last year, including an impressive climb over the last month.Despite Rockwell’s market-crushing performance during the last 12 months and the last decade, ROK trades 10% below its own highs. And investors with a technical outlook might appreciate where ROK stands. Rockwell also pays a dividend and boasts other potentially attractive fundamentals right now.Smart ManufacturingRockwell is an industrial automation and digital transformation company that aims to create what it often refers to as the next generation of smart manufacturing. ROK is helping drive forward the tech-supported and constantly-connected economy to help its customers with all of their automation challenges.ROK operates three core business units: Intelligent Devices, Software &amp; Control, and Lifecycle Services. Rockwell’s products and solutions serve an array of industries including power generation, aerospace, infrastructure, semiconductors, life sciences, warehouse and fulfillment, and beyond.Rockwell’s product categories include connection devices, energy monitoring, human machine interface, motion control, industrial control, sensors &amp; switches, and much, much more. ROK’s software offerings broadly cover areas such as analytics and data management, design, industrial communications, and beyond.Story continuesGrowth and OutlookThe economic trends that have helped Rockwell thrive are almost certainly going to keep progressing. Rockwell is also benefitting from reshoring in places such as the U.S. as companies reevaluate their own supply chains and manufacturing following covid bottlenecks and geopolitical pressures.Companies are now diving headfirst into building semiconductors, EVs, solar panels, and much more in the U.S. and other places outside of China. Rockwell’s revenue climbed by roughly 11% in both FY21 and FY22. ROK most recently posted blowout Q2 FY23 results and provided upbeat guidance in late April.Zacks estimates call for Rockwell’s revenue to climb by over 14% in FY23 to $8.87 billion and then pop another 4% in FY24. Meanwhile, its adjusted earnings are projected to jump by 27% and 7%, respectively to hit $12.84 a share next year.ROK’s upward earnings revisions for FY23 and FY24 help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now.Price, Technical Levels &amp; ValuationRockwell shares have soared roughly 1,200% in the last 20 years to blow away the S&amp;P 500’s 340% and its Zacks Industrial Products sector’s 230%. ROK’s total return over this stretch of around 1,900% also tops the benchmark’s 600%.Rockwell has posted a 255% run over the past 10 years to top the S&amp;P 500’s 175% and its sector’s 60%. ROK shares are closer to neck-and-neck with the benchmark in the past three years, with its recent surge helping Rockwell look slightly stronger.As we touched on up top, Rockwell has soared 55% in the last year as Wall Street jumps back into the beaten-down stock. ROK trades near its 52-week highs, but around 10% beneath its late 2021 records.  ROK’s year-long comeback helped it achieve the bullish golden cross back in November. Rockwell found support at its 50-day moving average at the end of May and has rebounded higher since then.ROK is coming up against the edge of overbought RSI levels on a 12-month basis, which means it could face some near-term selling pressure. But ROK remains closer to neutral on a five-year time scale.On the valuation side, ROK trades at a roughly 27% discount to its own 10-year highs at 24.3X forward 12-month earnings, while trading 10% below its peaks in terms of price. And Rockwell is trading not too far above its own five-year median even though its stock price has jumped 90% during this stretch.Bottom LineRockwell’s dividend currently yields around 1.5%. And the company closed last quarter with $1.1 billion remaining under its existing share repurchase authorization.Investors have shown their love for Rockwell given its ability to grow alongside crucial segments of the economy, and benefit from the never-ending need to automate and infuse tech into every aspect of the industrial ecosystem.Most recently, Rockwell is poised to ride the newfound wave and commitment to domestic manufacturing and reshoring in the U.S. and elsewhere for years, if not decades.Bear of the Day:International Paper is a global producer of paper, packaging, and more. International Paper is coming off two strong years of revenue growth.International Paper shares have, however, tumbled over the past two years after getting overheated. Wall Street also sold IP stock as its outlook for earnings began to fade further and further.What’s Going On with IP?International Paper is a global producer of packaging, pulp, and other fiber-based products. The company also boasts that it is one of the largest recyclers in North America. And as its name suggests, IP operates around various parts of the world, with manufacturing in North America, Latin America, North Africa, and Europe.International Paper’s packaging unit includes corrugated, bulk, solid fiber, retail packaging &amp; display, and more. IP’s paper segment features containerboard and beyond, with a pulp segment that includes fluff, papergrade, and more. International Paper also has an expansive recycling unit, alongside various packaging services from printing and testing to graphic and structural design. International Paper’s revenue climbed roughly 9% in 2022 after it jumped by 10% in 2021. Zacks estimates call for IP’s revenue to slip by 6% in FY23 and another 3% next year.On top of that, IP’s adjusted earnings are projected to slide by 26% YoY this year and then slip another 9% lower in FY24 to hit $2.14 a share.International Paper’s projected downturn comes amid a wider global economic slowdown and a difficult to compete against stretch of growth during the post-covid boom. IP’s CEO noted in prepared Q1 remarks that it is ""navigating a challenging and dynamic macro environment.""Bottom LineUnfortunately, Wall Street has continued to be disappointed by International Paper’s guidance. IP’s FY23 Zacks consensus earnings outlook is down 19% in the last two months, with FY24’s figure about 20% lower. These downward estimate revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) right now.The nearby chart also showcases that International Paper’s rough earnings outlook has continued to get worse over the last year-plus. IP shares are now down around 50% over the last two years. The paper company has also seen its stock price drop by 45% in the past five years.IP stock is trading below both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Some investors might want to think about trying to call a bottom. But it might be best for investors who think highly of International Paper to wait for it to start showing signs of life instead of trying to catch a falling knife.Additional content:Nvidia: 5 Reasons the Tech Giant's Ascent is Far From FinishedNvidia is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Though the company has been public for decades, it has pulled away from former industry juggernauts such as Intel (INTC) and is dominating the chip space. Before the tech-centric bear market of 2022, Nvidia was enjoying strong growth in its chips for high-performance computing, autonomous vehicle technology, crypto mining, gaming, and more. In 2022, inflation soared to 40-year highs, and investors punished high-valuation growth stocks such as Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Shopify. However, in early 2023, two significant factors began driving Nvidia:A broad tech rebound: After shedding 32.58% in 2022, the Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQ) bottomed out in October and never looked back (QQQ is up 33% year-to-date). What was behind the move? Inflation petered out at 40-year highs, and the Federal Reserve recently began to ease up on raising interest rates. Remember, a rising tide lifts all ships (especially the strong ones).Artificial Intelligence went Mainstream: In early 2023, Open AI unveiled its Microsoft (MSFT) backed chatbot, Chat GPT. Though Artificial Intelligence has been around for years and has been used by well-known companies such as Amazon (AMZN), Chat GPT became the first AI product to gain widespread use. A mere two months after its release, Chat GPT amassed a massive 100 million monthly active user base – making it the fastest-growing consumer app in history. Today, that number is more than 1.8 billion visitors per day. Why is Chat GPT driving NVDA? Nvidia’s GPUs are rapidly benefiting from the proliferation of AI because they are necessary for large computers to run generative AI and process large swaths of data.In May, Nvidia reported first-quarter results that were better than expected. However, the news that sent shares soaring by more than 20% was Nvidia’s forward guidance. In one of the largest guides higher, Nvidia management is forecasting revenue of $11 billion for Q2 – a mind-boggling $4 billion above the consensus estimates of $7.1 billion! While many investors believe that Nvidia is overvalued, and the strong fundamentals are priced in, 5 factors suggest that the move may just be getting started, including:High but realistic expectations: In a recent interview, Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang made a bold statement. Huang touted his company’s future AI growth by saying, “We have reinvented computing for the first time since the IBM (IBM) 360 system, 60 years ago. There’s a trillion dollars’ worth of data center infrastructure installed in the world based on that old method of doing computation. Now, we have accelerated computing and we have the killer app for generative computing: generative AI.” Though the rhetoric is intriguing, in my experience, it is best to not blindly trust but rather verify such statements. Huang is not a CEO who makes bold statements without backing them up – he built the nearly 1 trillion-dollar company with more than empty rhetoric. Furthermore, Nvidia has beaten expectations in 17 of the past 20 quarters. In other words, all else being equal, the company is likely to live up to the lofty expectations.The AI Race is Just Getting Started: The more the world moves to AI, the better it is for Nvidia. Though Chat GPT has the early lead in the AI space, other tech giants are scrambling to make their foray into the industry. For example, Alphabet (GOOGL) released its Chat GPT competitor Bard in March. Chinese search giant Baidu (BIDU) will release its generative AI model in the coming months. Nvidia’s relationships with cloud providers such as Amazon and enterprise giants like Microsoft should spur even further growth.Institutional Sponsorship: Institutional investors (mutual funds, pension funds, etc.) are the most important market participants to monitor. Because of their deep pockets and in-depth research, having smart institutional money in a stock is a confidence booster. Stanley Druckenmiller has one of the most impressive track records ever. Over four decades of investing, the billionaire investor has never had a down year. In recent interviews, Druckenmiller has talked up AI and NVDA’s role in the AI revolution. In recent interviews, Druckenmiller said, “AI could be as impactful as the internet” and that he could see himself holding the stock for at least two to three years. Druckenmiller isn’t alone – according to the latest filings, Will Danoff’s Fidelity Contra Fund (FCNTX) holds more than 10 million shares of NVDA. Fidelity Contra Fund has the second-largest assets under management (AUM). Despite the mutual fund’s massive size, it has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index over the past 10 years.Robust Estimates: Don’t just take Jensen Huang’s word for it. Wall Street analysts tracked by Zacks have finally come around to the stock and have provided some eye-popping estimates for the foreseeable future. NVDA also earns the best possible Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Price &amp; Volume Action Provides Clues: On May 25th, NVDA shares gapped up by 25% on volume 241% above the norm. The massive price jump and volume are evidence of institutional accumulation. However, what the stock has done since is even more interesting. The past three weekly closes have been within 1.5% of each other. After a significant move, you would expect investors with large gains to take chips off the table – this is not the case with NVDA. If the stock clears its recent range, expect fireworks to the upside over the next 6-12 months.ConclusionThough Nvidia has gone on a huge run over the past few months, ample evidence suggests that the move may be just getting started. Strong fundamentals are just one piece of the puzzle. Forward expectations, institutional sponsorship, and robust price and volume action are all flashing green signals.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

The company handed over only 17 MAXs to customers the prior month, when Boeing found a bracket installation defect that forced it to fix aircraft before delivery.Boeing also delivered eight widebody 787 Dreamliners, three 767 freighters, three 777 freighters and a 737 that will be modified into a P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft for South Korea.Boeing's monthly orders and deliveries snapshot comes a week before aerospace executives gather for the Paris Air Show, where both Boeing and Airbus are expected to cement new deals.At the same time, both airplane makers are struggling with supply chain challenges that threaten to curb deliveries - a closely watched metric for Wall Street analysts, as Boeing and Airbus receive the bulk of payment for aircraft after handing over jets to customers.Boeing has started to deliver reworked 737s, Chief Financial Officer Brian West said in late May, adding the company predicted MAX deliveries would increase from about 30 per month to about 40 per month in the second half of the year.However, Dreamliner deliveries could slow in June due to a new production glitch disclosed by the company last week. The problem, involving miniscule gaps in a fitting on the horizontal stabilizer located at the base of the 787's tail, must be fixed before Boeing can hand over planes to customers.Boeing booked 69 orders in May, including 59 MAXs and 10 Dreamliners. It also reported 11 cancellations, which included four 737 MAXs for Air Niugini, six 777 freighters for Hong Kong International Aviation and one 777-300ER for an unidentified customer.Over the first five months of the year, Boeing delivered 206 aircraft - fewer than rival Airbus, which has delivered 244 over the same period. Airbus is also slightly ahead on net orders, with 144 to Boeing's 127.(Reporting by Valerie Insinna; Editing by Mark Potter)]"

LMT clinched a modification contract involving F-16 fighter aircraft. The award has been offered by the 338th Enterprise Sourcing Squadron, Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph, TX.Details of the DealValued at $74 million, the contract is projected to be completed by Mar 21, 2026. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will offer operational training capability for F-16 Block 70/72, F-16 upgrades and F-16V models.Work related to this deal will be executed in Orlando, FL, and several locations outside the continental United States. The contract involves Foreign Military Sales.Importance of the F-16 JetsOver the past decade, a rapid rise in global terrorism and adverse geopolitical situations across borders have boosted the demand for defense products. Combat aircraft constitute a major portion of this portfolio. It is imperative to mention here that the F-16 Falcon jets have significantly risen in importance on a global scale over the past few years.For the past couple of years, the F-16 has witnessed a significant development, with nations like Taiwan, Bulgaria, Morocco and Bahrain signing agreements to procure new F-16 aircraft.In order to make the most of this rising demand, Lockheed introduced F-16 Block 70/72 in 2020, the most advanced F-16 aircraft, combining numerous capabilities and structural upgrades. This model provides a new aircraft structure that lasts 50% longer than the previous F-16 version. Such advancements might have been ushering in contracts from Pentagon and other U.S. allies, like the latest one, thereby boosting Lockheed’s revenue prospects.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, other nations like Europe and the United States have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest weapons exporter worldwide, the nation has been spending significantly on defense products, including combat aircraft.Story continuesLockheed, being a prominent combat aircraft manufacturer in the United States, enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global fighter aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 3.95% during 2023-2028, with North America constituting the largest share of this market.Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities, and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Lockheed, along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Boeing BA, Northrop Grumman NOC and Textron TXT.Boeing’s Defense, Space &amp; Security segment engages in the research, development, production and modification of manned and unmanned military aircraft. This segment's primary products include military aircraft like F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15, P-8, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk aircraft.BA has a long-term earnings growth rate of 4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 sales implies a 18% increase from the 2022 reported figure.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned combat aircraft. The company also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance and aircraft self-protection systems. This helps warfighters in accomplishing missions anytime, anywhere and under any conditions.NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.8%.

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $887.9 million, the contract is expected to be completed by December 2026. Per the terms of the deal, Raytheon will procure spare parts, modules, support equipment/packaging handling shipping and transportation material as well as depot lay-in material for F135 propulsion system.The contract will serve the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers and non-Department of Defense participants.Work related to this deal will be executed in East Hartford, CT.Raytheon’s Growth ProspectsCombat aircraft witnessed a surge in demand with the rapid rise in political risks and global terrorism. In this context, F-35 jets, built by America’s largest defense contractor, Lockheed Martin LMT, enjoy a lucrative position in the combat aircraft arena. These jets also witness a steady flow of orders from the U.S. Army, seven international partner countries and eight FMS customers.Lockheed has delivered 899 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, with 340 jets in the backlog as of Mar 26, 2023.  This reflects the solid demand that this jet program enjoys in the defense space, resulting in multiple order wins for both LMT and RTX. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.The production of F-35 jets is expected to continue for several years, given the U.S. government's current inventory target of 2,456 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy.Consequently, Pratt &amp; Whitney, which builds F-35’s engine, is likely to witness more order inflows for the F-35 engine and its propulsion system in the coming days, like the latest one. This should significantly bolster this defense contractor’s top line.Peer GrowthApart from Lockheed and Raytheon, defense majors that stand to benefit from the expanding production rates of F-35 are:Northrop Grumman NOC: The company renders its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology for the F-35 program.

Like all great builders, he’s suffered many setbacks along the way, but so far, his successes will define his legacy.This is a look at Elon Musk’s best investments, along with some knowledge you can gain from them.Want to vote for Elon as your favorite money expert? Click here and go to his expert page.Zip2Musk had several creative but amateurish entrepreneurial endeavors under his belt before 1995. But that year, according to Money, he took a leap of faith and dropped out of a Stanford Ph.D. program to found Zip2 with his brother on a $28,000 loan from their father.The company, which provided maps and directories for online publications, must be listed among Musk’s greatest investments — because it’s the one that made all the others possible. Four years later, the brothers sold Zip2 to Compaq for $307 million, with Elon clearing his first $22 million.Technically, the lesson is to drop out of school and borrow money from your parents. But when viewed through a wider lens, the message is to take calculated risks and seize the moment. Musk gambled it all — but only when he had a reliable partner, a great idea and the money to back it up.The dreamer was now a doer. Zip2 made Musk a wealthy player in the emerging online space and gave him the capital to found online banking startup X.com. Elon Musk was just getting started, though.I’m a Self-Made Millionaire: These Are the 6 Investments Everyone Should Make During an Economic DownturnPayPalMusk’s entrepreneurial brand is built on electric cars and space rockets, but his two most famous endeavors stood on the shoulders of the ones that came before.Story continues“Without a doubt, Tesla and SpaceX are currently the most successful investments in Elon Musk’s portfolio,” said June Jia, a quantitative researcher at GF Securities and owner of Canny Trading. “However, it’s critical to remember that Musk’s initial capital for these groundbreaking ventures came from the sale of PayPal to eBay in 2002.”PayPal was formed when Musk’s X.com merged with Peter Thiel’s P2P payment system Confinity — and it’s one of Musk’s best investments because he built it into a business worth buying.“At that time, PayPal was a company with significant growth potential,” said Jia.But Musk faced fierce adversity along the way. In 1999, CBS News named PayPal one of that year’s “worst business ideas.” One year later in 2000, the board removed Musk as CEO and replaced him with his business partner Thiel while Musk was on his honeymoon.The takeaway is the importance of perseverance.“This situation underscores a key investment principle,” said Jia. “While risk-laden investments may necessitate considerable sacrifice, they often provide substantial returns.”In 2002, eBay bought PayPal for $1.5 billion in stock, and Musk walked away with $160-$180 million. He was now in the big leagues with the capital and credibility to build the brands that would make him famous.TeslaIt’s hard to argue that Tesla hasn’t been Musk’s most successful investment. He probably grabs more headlines now for his Twitter takeover, but he bankrolled that deal by leveraging his holdings in the company that brought EVs to the masses.With nearly $818 billion in market cap, Tesla is one of the seven biggest companies in the world, dwarfing all legacy automakers. Forbes says Musk owns 23% of the company, with about half his holdings pledged as loan collateral.EVs, charging stations and the Tesla name are all now familiar, but it’s hard to exaggerate how steep an uphill climb Musk faced in disrupting the industry that had defined America’s capitalistic and industrial culture for a century. Few people are more intimately familiar with the lessons of Tesla than fellow tech entrepreneur and artificial intelligence aficionado David Ciccarelli, founder and CEO of Voices.ai.“I recall when I was just starting Voices.ai, we were swimming against the current, much like Elon did with Tesla in its early days,” Ciccarelli said. “Many thought electric vehicles were a far-fetched dream, yet he pursued it relentlessly. And just look at where Tesla is today. It’s an inspiring reminder that innovation often requires going against the grain.”SpaceXBefore there was Tesla, there was SpaceX. Musk used his PayPal windfall to launch the space exploration company in 2003, one year before he dived into EVs.Musk founded the company with the goal of colonizing Mars and built the business into the most dominant force in the commercial space industry. The brand’s extraordinary ambition and execution have come to define Musk’s entrepreneurial vision and spirit.“SpaceX was possibly the most ridiculous, far-fetched idea anyone could have uttered,” said Cathryn Chen, CEO and founder of MarketX Ventures, a private equity investment management platform. “Yet it’s fulfilling its vision on a scale and a timeline that nobody could have dreamt possible while transforming how different nations and sectors cooperate.”According to Forbes, SpaceX is worth at least $137 billion.More From GOBankingRatesIn Less Than a Decade, You Won't Be Able To Afford a Home in These CitiesPlanning To Buy a Home?Take_Our_Poll3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000Experts: 4 Safest Places To Keep Your InvestmentsThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Elon Musk’s Best Investments — and What You Can Learn From Them]"

However, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, increasing greenhouse gas emissions are affecting the health of the ocean (e.g. warming and acidifying seawater), so reducing the ocean's ability to absorb carbon dioxide and safeguard life on the planet.This year, we are focusing our attention on one of nature's most amazing marvels: coral reefs. These ecosystems play a vital role in sustaining marine life, capturing CO2 and mitigating the effects of global warming, presenting an opportunity to form part of an enterprise's overall plan to address its sustainability goals and reduce its impact on the environment.Why is preserving current coral reefs and building engineered reefs important? Almost one billion people depend entirely on healthy coral reefs for their livelihoods. More than 60% of the global population depends entirely on seafood for all protein intake and more than 25% of all life in the planet's oceans starts as a direct result of healthy coral reefs.Nowadays, human activities and climate change are pushing these delicate ecosystems to the brink of collapse. If no significant action is taken, 90% of all coral reefs are predicted to be extinct by 2050.The responsibility of businesses to reduce global emissionsTo make the greatest impact, we all need to work together, including businesses. Businesses today have greater responsibility than providing a return to investors; they have a role to play in helping reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.Story continuesAccording to a recent IBM Institute for Business Value survey, 95% of surveyed global executives say their organizations have developed ESG propositions. However, many of these organizations lack a clear pathway to realizing their goals and 41% of surveyed executives cite inadequate data as their biggest obstacle to ESG progress.While the numerous environmental challenges we face are daunting, we have reason to be optimistic. Technology, when harnessed effectively, can provide innovative solutions such as those that help to protect and restore reefs. We also know that building a more sustainable world will require strong partnerships. One such collaboration exists between IBM and The Reef Company.Collaborating for coral reef restorationIBM and The Reef Company have recently joined forces signing a joint initiative agreement aimed at bolstering their ocean conservation endeavors. The Reef Company is on a mission to build 2.500 engineered reefs, covering an average area of 50Km2 each, with a total investment of USD 500 Billion. The primary objective of this grand project is to restore and revitalize the marine ecosystem, sustaining the invaluable ecosystem of services nature offers, including carbon capture. Together with IBM's support, the aim is leveraging data from the ocean and technology, and taking the project to the next level.The Reef Company designs reef modules, which are engineered with low-carbon impact materials and are manufactured locally. These building blocks create the foundation for new underwater habitats, and enable marine life (flora and fauna) to thrive whilst serving as a hotspot for marine biodiversity. The reefs are also equipped with the BluBoxx™ ocean data platform, and can be adapted to different environments to monitor and collect a wide range of ocean data.The BluBoxx™ solution works with various sensors and cameras, which are fed via surface solar panels, used to measure salinity, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, pressure, and carbon dioxide. BluBoxx™ also enables data transmission from the subsea sensor collection devices to the surface. The data is then uploaded into the cloud platform which extracts valuable insights that are used to support ocean research as well as to serve a broad range of industries.IBM Consulting, with its industrial experience and IBM's cutting-edge technologies, will play a crucial role in supporting The Reef Company reef restoration efforts.Having a well-designed data architecture and fact-based data can help with understanding performance and measuring progress against broad-based operational and ESG goals. Insights generated from this data can help organizations further their ESG programs as well as drive operational efficiency. Moreover, credible environmental reporting is supported by factual data. These elements support business intelligence and analysis, automation, and AI-all of which can help organizations to quickly seize market opportunities, build customer value, achieve greater efficiencies and respond to risks.This collaboration creates new opportunities for the two companies to potentially explore leveraging IBM's AI and data platform and data analytics capabilities, such as watsonx or Sustainability Software solutions like IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite, which could assist in the monitoring, reporting and management of these artificial coral reefs.By harnessing the power of watsonx generative AI capabilities and pre-trained foundation models, IBM could potentially analyze large volumes of data collected from various sources, such as satellite imagery, BluBoxxTM underwater sensors, and historical records, to identify patterns and predict potential threats to coral reefs. This proactive approach could help conservationists take timely action, implement mitigation strategies, and allocate resources more effectively.The IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite, an AI-powered SaaS solution, provides timely and fact-based actionable intelligence that can help organizations and users proactively plan for and manage the impact from severe weather events and climate change events.IBM's collaboration with scientists, conservation organizations, and local communities can help drive innovation in coral reef restoration, offering technological solutions that support informed decision-making, efficient resource management, and long-term sustainability of these fragile ecosystems.This new agreement has the potential to create powerful positive environmental impact, knowledge, employment, academic research, and economic benefits for multiple industries and local communities.As we celebrate World Oceans Day this month, we are reminded that addressing climate change will take more than any one organization. It will requires companies, governments, nongovernmental organizations and communities, all working together, with the aid of technology, to improve the efficiencies of our activities and operations and to reduce costs, waste and emissions.By embracing the power of technology, we can gather critical data, accelerate restoration efforts, and promote awareness at an unprecedented scale. However, technology alone is not the solution. We must also address the root causes of reef decline, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, curbing pollution, and promoting sustainable fishing practices.By combining our collective efforts and leveraging technology, we can help preserve and protect the beauty and biodiversity of healthy oceans for future generations to come.Learn more*Statements regarding IBM's future direction and intent are subject to change or withdrawal without notice, and represent goals and objectives only.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from IBM on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IBMWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/ibmEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IBMView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/760937/Celebrating-World-Oceans-Day-Revitalizing-the-Marine-Ecosystem-With-Technology-Driven-Engineered-Reefs-To-Accelerate-CO2-Capture]"

In the meantime, he said Tesla does not expect to produce its Semi electric trucks in large volume until sometime next year, because of the need to ensure a sufficient battery supply for the model, which uses larger batteries than a passenger car.In December, Musk delivered the long-delayed Semi to PepsiCo without offering updated forecasts for the truck's pricing, production plans or how much cargo it could haul. Musk previously said Tesla would aim to produce 50,000 of the trucks in 2024.

The company has been strengthening its brand portfolio through meaningful acquisitions and innovations.Along with its first-quarter 2023 results, management raised its net sales and earnings per share (EPS) guidance to the high end of its earlier guidance. The company now anticipates net sales growth of nearly 8% for 2023. Hershey envisions a reported EPS increase of nearly 15% and adjusted EPS growth of almost 11%.Brand StrengthHershey is a renowned producer of quality chocolate products in the United States, which markets some of the world’s leading brands. The company is also a global leader in sugar confectionery products, which form an attractive category as confectionery products are easily available, affordable and highly indulgent, making the industry almost recession-resistant.Hershey’s core brands — Hershey’s, Reese’s, Hershey’s Kisses, Jolly Rancher, Brookside, Sofit and Ice Breakers — have been growing strongly due to advertising investments, in-store merchandising, and programming and innovation. HSY regularly brings innovation to its core brands to meet consumer demand and needs not addressed by its current portfolio.Hershey is committed to supporting brands through solid media marketing. An important strategy of the company is to create a unique and holistic portfolio for every season, which can meet consumers’ seasonal shopping needs.Hershey has been undertaking buyouts to augment portfolio strength and boost revenues. In April 2023, the company signed an agreement to acquire two production facilities from Weaver Popcorn Manufacturing — a well-known leader in popcorn production and co-packing and a co-manufacturer of HSY’s SkinnyPop brand.SkinnyPop has been witnessing impressive retail sales growth for ready-to-eat popcorn in the past three years. The move is likely to help Hershey sustain its robust growth in the SkinnyPop brand through supply-chain expansion.In December 2021, Hershey acquired Dot’s Pretzels LLC — the owner of Dot’s Homestyle Pretzels, a leading brand in the pretzel category. The addition of Dot’s Pretzels is a perfect match for Hershey’s growing salty snacking portfolio. On its last earnings call, management highlighted that Dot’s Pretzel’s performance continued to remain solid, with retail sales growth of more than 25% in the first quarter of 2023, resulting in a pretzel category share gain of 100 basis points.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPricing Aids Amid High ExpensesHershey has been undertaking strategic pricing initiatives to improve its performance.

It anticipates net sales growth in 2023 in the range of flat to 2%, while organic sales are projected to increase 2-4%.Growth Pillars &amp; Robust Savings PlanKimberly-Clark has been committed to its three key strategic growth pillars. These include a focus on improving its core business in developed markets, speeding up the growth of the Personal Care segment in developing and emerging markets and enhancing digital and e-commerce capacities. The company expects to meet these objectives through product development across different categories and leveraging capabilities in marketing and sales.KMB has been progressing well with these objectives, which have been aiding its portfolio and expanding the global business. In February 2022, Kimberly-Clark acquired a majority stake in Thinx, Inc. — the pioneer in the reusable period and incontinence underwear category.In October 2020, Kimberly-Clark completed the acquisition of Softex Indonesia — a leading player in the Indonesian personal care market.

Southwest (LUV) is tailing behind in the airline rally with a still respectable one-month gain of 12%.There are likely two factors behind the airline stock propulsion.First, is the raw demand to travel at the moment — which appears to have been strong for Memorial Day weekend and now into July 4.MADRID, SPAIN - 2023/06/10: An Airbus A319 of Iberia comercial flight flies over the skyscrapers of Madrid's skyline, known as the ""Four Towers Business Area"", after departing from Adolfo Suarez Madrid Barajas Airport.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the top 5 most profitable airlines in the world.Even though the airline industry has arguably been the most integral in improving globalization across the last several decades, and even though it has a reputation of being too expensive, it is actually the industry with the lowest profit margins. Because of this, the airline industry is unable to adapt to downward pricing pressure or economic instability, as witnessed during the pandemic.When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, most countries forbade travel and went into lockdowns, severely impacting the hospitality industry, with airlines being particularly hard hit. In fact, from 2020 to 2022, when the worst of the pandemic passed over, the airline industry is estimated to have lost more than $200 billion, resulting in tens of thousands of job cuts even among the most profitable airlines in the world.Top 20 most profitable airlines in the worldPhoto by emiel molenaar on UnsplashHowever, 2022 saw the resumption of global travel as most countries removed restrictions which resulted in pent-up demand being released across summer and airlines recording one of the most profitable quarters in airline history in Q2 2022. Even though the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing year-plus war result in airspace issues, airlines have managed to persevere and the outlook is quite bright.Of course, you can't discuss 2022 without discussing the economic uncertainty that dominated the year, resulting in a horrendous year for the stock markets, with rising inflation and aggressive interest rate hikes combined with an impending recession resulting in a negative mindset for investors. Despite this, airlines recorded the highest price per mile in history, and even though volume hasn't reverted to pre-pandemic levels, the rise in prices has resulted in higher revenues for airlines with many returning to profitability after a couple of years of losses, which is great news for the most profitable airlines in the world.Story continuesAccording to CNN, Europe, one of the premier destinations for tourists, is already seeing high levels of tourism, even though summer has barely started. This is only going to get worse as schools start breaking for summer and more and more tourists start traveling, with tour operators selling out months in advance. According to Allianz Partners, Americans traveling to Europe will increase by 55% as compared to 2022, with Italian cities dominating the most popular destination lists. Even though volumes are increasing significantly, prices don't seem to be coming down, which might lead to the richest airlines in the world simply getting richer.Many of the most profitable airlines in the world are also well-known for the level of service provided, and are often counted among the best airlines in the world based on assessments by various magazines and websites, with the World Airline Awards being considered the most prestigious. Some of the best airlines based on various categories include Singapore Airlines and Qatar Airways.A large part of an airline's profitability depends on the routes it flies. Even at a time when profits have been under pressure, some routes will still earn airlines hundreds of millions of dollars, with the most lucrative route in the world being worth over $1 billion, according to Forbes. The top 10 most lucrative routes earn revenues of over $6 billion between 2018 and 2019, with British Airways earning $1.16 billion on its route between London and New York. In fact, half of the most profitable routes are based from London's Heathrow Airport, one of the most popular airports in the world in terms of number of passengers. Recently, the airport saw its busiest month since the pandemic started, and this is only bound to increase in the next few months as summer truly grips Europe.However, one thing that investors in airline stocks are concerned about is the industry's contribution to climate change, with many governments emphasizing and preferring travel by train. In fact, France recently banned short-haul flights where a train journey of 2.5 hours would suffice. While many believe this is just lip service and doesn't impact climate change significantly, other similar bans could follow, which will be disastrous for European airlines.While short-haul flights being banned in the future is a possible negative outcome in the future, the rest does seem quite positive. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), net profits of the airline industry are expected to double to nearly $10 billion in 2023, at a net margin of just over 1.2% while operating profits are expected to exceed $22.4 billion in the same time period. The current expectation is that over 4.35 billion people will fly in 2023, much closer to 4.54 billion people who flew in 2019. Further, revenues are expected to cross $800 billion in 2023 for the first time since the pandemic hit, all of which shows that the airline industry is well on its way to recovery. IATA's Director General stated ""“Airline financial performance in 2023 is beating expectations. Stronger profitability is supported by several positive developments. China lifted COVID-19 restrictions earlier in the year than anticipated. Cargo revenues remain above pre-pandemic levels even though volumes have not. And, on the cost side, there is some relief. Jet fuel prices, although still high, have moderated over the first half of the year.” This has also resulted in a much more positive outlook by Delta's CEO Ed Bastian who said in the company's Q1 2023 earnings call ""With solid first quarter performance and visibility into the strength of summer travel demand, we are confident in our full year guidance for revenue growth of 15% to 20% year-over-year, earnings of $5 to $6 per share and free cash flow of over $2 billion, the three main guideposts we shared with you last December. For the June quarter, we expect to deliver the highest quarterly revenue in our history, a 15% operating margin and EPS of $2 to $2.25 a share. Our forecast operating profit of $2 billion matches Q2 of 2019, demonstrating that the earnings power of this franchise is intact.""However, despite the recovery posted by airlines, it is important to note that even some of the biggest airlines in the world have still not returned to profitability. This is why, some of the most profitable airlines in the world are still currently making losses, though if trends continue, that will not be the case for much longer. To determine our listing, we ascertained the 25 biggest airlines in the world through Fortune 500 and annual reports of each airline, and ranked them based on either their TTM net profit from continuing operations, or net profit as determined through their annual report, especially for airlines that aren't listed.

We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Pinnacle West Capital Step By Step Through The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) -US$89.0m-US$256.0m-US$268.0m-US$159.0mUS$334.0mUS$509.0mUS$698.9mUS$885.9mUS$1.06bUS$1.21bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 52.40%Est @ 37.31%Est @ 26.75%Est @ 19.36%Est @ 14.18% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% -US$83.3-US$224-US$220-US$122US$240US$342US$439US$521US$582US$622(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$2.1bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.2b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$26bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$26b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$13bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$15b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$81.1, the company appears quite undervalued at a 41% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Pinnacle West Capital as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Pinnacle West CapitalStrengthNo major strengths identified for PNW.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Interest payments on debt are not well covered.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Electric Utilities market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Paying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

(NASDAQ:ISRG) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 86%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intuitive-surgical-inc-nasdaq-isrg-130018150.html,1686661218.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Intuitive Surgical's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsThe top 22 shareholders own 50% of the companyOwnership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stockIf you want to know who really controls Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 86% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Intuitive Surgical, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Intuitive Surgical?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.We can see that Intuitive Surgical does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Intuitive Surgical's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Intuitive Surgical. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.4%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.3% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.8% by the third-largest shareholder.Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 22 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Intuitive SurgicalThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Intuitive Surgical, Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$532m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 13% stake in Intuitive Surgical. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Intuitive Surgical better, we need to consider many other factors.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can find historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.Ultimately the future is most important.

These travel-related companies are contributing to the strong performance of the top-rated Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services Industry which is in the top 23% of over 250 Zacks industries.Year to date the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Industries collective total return including dividends is +29% to easily top the S&amp;P 500’s +14% and roughly match the Nasdaq’s strong performance.Let’s take a look at three highly-ranked stocks in the industry that currently boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBluegreen Vacations (BVH)Starting out is Bluegreen Vacations which is a holding corporation that operates as a vacation ownership company. Bluegreen's markets and sells vacation ownership interests and manages resorts in leisure and urban destinations.What stands out about Bluegreen stock is its price-to-earnings valuation at 8.3X forward earnings despite shares of BVH already up +37% YTD. This is reason to believe Bluegreen’s strong performance could continue as BVH still trades at a considerable discount to the industry average of 21.7X and nicely beneath the S&amp;P 500’s 20.1X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurthermore, earnings estimates have trended higher over the last 60 days offering further support.

Increased bookings amid pent-up demand lingering from the pandemic is starting to reiterate the cruise company’s massive earnings potential.In addition to its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) Royal Caribbean also has an “A” Style Scores grade for Growth. In correlation to strong booking demand, Royal Caribbean’s fiscal 2023 earnings estimates have soared 46% over the last 60 days with FY24 EPS estimates rising 21%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRoyal Caribbean’s pandemic hiatus is behind it with annual earnings now projected to skyrocket to $4.71 per share compared to an adjusted loss of -$7.50 a share in 2022.

At $94 a share, Royal Caribbean’s P/E valuation of 19.8X forward earnings is sitll below the industry average and the benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTrip.com (TCOM)Rounding out the list is travel service company Trip.com. Based in Shanghai, Trip.com is a viable option to get exposure to high travel demand in and out of China.With China reopening its economy earlier in the year, Trip.com is back on the path to being one of the more recognizable global online travel companies. Trip.com’s product offerings include flights, discount hotels, and train tickets along with service support and reviews.Notably, earnings are forecasted to soar 334% this year at $1.26 per share compared to EPS of $0.29 in 2022. Fiscal 2024 earnings are projected to leap another 56% at $1.96 per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSimilar to Royal Caribbean, Trip.com’s top-line recovery is intriguing. Sales are forecasted to climb 88% this year to $5.53 billion and surpass 2019 pre-pandemic sales of $5.12 billion.

Robinson hangs on to S&P debt rating but outlook now negative,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/c-h-robinson-hangs-p-181932654.html,1686680372,STORY,['CHRW'],"[The level of stock buybacks at C.H. Robinson has led to concern at S&amp;P. (Photo: C.H. Robinson)C.H. Robinson is keeping its investment-grade-level rating with S&amp;P Global, but it has fallen below a key benchmark and its outlook has been downgraded by the ratings agency.S&amp;P Global Ratings said in a report issued last week that the ratio of funds from operations (FFO) to debt at C.H. Robinson (NASDAQ: CHRW) had fallen to 41% at the end of the first quarter, dropping below the 45% level that is considered significant. That number was described by S&amp;P Global as its “downgrade threshold,” though the company’s credit rating was not downgraded. Instead, what is known as the issuer credit rating was affirmed at BBB+.A BBB, BBB+ or BBB- issuer credit rating is assigned to companies that are viewed by S&amp;P (NYSE: SPGI) as having “adequate capacity to meet its financial commitments. However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to weaken the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitments.” BBB+ is three notches above the cutoff between investment and non-investment-grade debt.The negative outlook that S&amp;P Global now has on C.H. Robinson could be seen as a prelude to a downgrade, as that is often the case with ratings agency actions. But any move could be a long time coming; in its definition of a negative outlook, S&amp;P Global said a positive or negative outlook reflects “the potential direction of a long-term credit rating over the intermediate term, which is generally up to two years for investment grade and generally up to one year for speculative grade.” With BBB+ solidly in the investment grade category, the negative outlook for C.H. Robinson could stick around awhile before turning into a downgrade, if ever.One of the concerns raised by S&amp;P Global is the pace of corporate buybacks at C.H. Robinson. The ratings agency described it as “elevated” and is a reason why the FFO-to-debt levels are now at a number considered by S&amp;P to be “weak.”“We believe there is an increased potential that the company’s financial policies will limit its ability and willingness to preserve credit measures we view as commensurate for its rating,” S&amp;P said. Those measures include that 45% FFO-to-debt level.Story continuesFFO to debt at C.H. Robinson was 64% at the end of 2020, S&amp;P said.In the company’s most recent earnings call with analysts, CFO Mike Zechmeister said C.H. Robinson had share repurchases of $51.2 million in the first quarter. The total amount of cash returned to shareholders was $125 million, as the company also paid out $73.4 million in dividends. S&amp;P said share buybacks totaled about $1.46 billion in 2022, so a quarterly rate of $51.2 million in the first quarter would have been well below the average quarterly amount of buybacks last year.A spokesman for C.H. Robinson, in response to an email query from FreightWaves, confirmed the company did begin slowing down buybacks in the fourth quarter of 2022 “given where we are in the freight cycle.”“As has been the case for the past several years, our level of share buybacks results from our capital allocation strategy,” he said in an email. “We target an investment grade credit rating and fund the operation of our business from the cash generated. We prioritize close in investments, on a risk adjusted return basis, while growing our dividend in alignment with long term cash generation from the business. After any M&amp;A activity, excess cash is used to buy back shares. In soft freight markets, we generally buyback less shares, all else equal.Revolving debt is used by C.H. Robinson “to support liquidity” when spot rates spur a need for it, S&amp;P said.  That revolving debt gets paid back when spot rates allow it, according to S&amp;P. “This dynamic began to change in early 2021, coinciding with a material increase in share buybacks,” it said.In 2022, S&amp;P said, debt at C.H. Robinson “remained high owing to past working capital-related funding and the company prioritizing shareholder distributions over debt repayment. Moreover, steeper-than-expected volume and pricing declines over the past two quarters have pressured the company’s EBITDA and FFO, and it is unclear when they will recover.”The competing Moody’s ratings agency (NYSE: MCO), a few days after the S&amp;P report, published what it refers to as an update on C.H. Robinson. But the Moody’s report took no action. The debt rating was not changed from its level of Baa2, which is considered weaker than the BBB+ at S&amp;P. BBB+ at S&amp;P is considered equivalent to Baa1 at Moody’s, and Baa2 is one step down from Baa1.Moody’s also kept the outlook on C.H. Robinson at stable.After recapping the market conditions faced by 3PLs, Moody’s appeared to take issue with the S&amp;P findings.“We expect the company to maintain a conservative balance sheet given a disciplined approach to share repurchases and acquisitions,” Moody’s said. “We believe over the long term that a combination of size and scale will allow the company to capture a greater share of the market than smaller carriers that are unable to meet demand.”The decisions at C.H. Robinson on how much cash to spend on buybacks and how much on debt repayment in 2021 and 2022 would have been implemented under the former regime of Bob Biesterfeld, who was ousted as CEO at the start of the year. David Bozeman recently was named the replacement for Biesterfeld.The S&amp;P analysts could almost be seen as sending a signal to the new management when they said they were unsure of “management’s commitment to maintaining credit metrics appropriate” for a BBB+ rating. “As such, we believe there is less certainty that the company’s credit metrics will improve over the next two years.”Cost cuts through staff reductions are “going according to expectations” at C.H. Robinson, S&amp;P said. But if “business conditions weaken further than expected, management will have to identify additional savings opportunities, which may be limited, as it will want to avoid cutting too deep to remain adequately staffed for a rebound.”Even though by dropping to a 41% FFO-to-debt rating the door might have been opened to an actual downgrade of the debt, S&amp;P said it held off doing that because it believes “there is a path for restoring credit measures.“We believe management is committed to improving its FFO to debt to above 45%, potentially by the end of this year, with reductions in share buybacks throughout the remainder of the year being one component of this,” S&amp;P said.Asked specifically whether C.H. Robinson believes it can get back to that 45% ratio, the spokesman said the company’s “capital allocation strategy” is geared to “target an investment grade credit rating to optimize our weighted average cost of capital.”He also said the BBB+ rating by S&amp;P has been assigned to C.H. Robinson since the company first accessed public debt markets in 2018.Free operating cash flow is expected to be about $740 million this year and that should “enable opportunities to repay debt and restore credit measures to levels firmly in line with the rating,” S&amp;P said. “However, this will depend on the company’s capital allocation priorities with respect to debt repayment and share repurchases.”Given S&amp;P’s optimism about the steps available to C.H. Robinson management, it gave the company a negative outlook rather than a downgrade. The negative outlook, the ratings agency said, “is based on our view of the financial policy uncertainty around buybacks, which the company may not curtail as needed, coupled with a possible prolonged trough in volumes and spot rates which do not rebound later in the year, precluding sustained FFO to debt above 45%.”The opinions of ratings agencies are not comments on a company’s stock price. CHRW stock, trading at about $90.60 midday Tuesday, is down 9.9% in the last 12 months, but is down more than 25% since its 52-week high recorded in August 2022.More articles by John KingstonJ.B.

Yahoo Finance entertainment reporter Allie Canal joins the Live show to explain.Video TranscriptDIANE KING HALL: Disney has updated its release dates for its next set of Marvel, Star Wars, and Avatar films, and fans may not be happy about it. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal is back with us with the details. So break it to us easy.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yes, I know, I know. Now, Deadline is reporting that this is due to the writers strike with production currently on pause. Screenplays not fully ready. I did reach out to Disney for comment on that. They did not get back to me. But in terms of those delays, we're talking some major films. Two Avengers movies pushed back a year. Avengers Kang Dynasty moving from May 2025 to May 2026, which then pushes Avengers Secret Wars to 2027.And it's crazy to think about how far out that timeline is considering it's just 2023 right now. But this is what experts have been talking about due to that long lead time in making a movie. The writers strike, 2023 was largely going to be insulated. With 2024 and beyond, that's where you were going to see a lot of that impact.And for Disney, in particular, they want to make sure that their scripts are rock solid for those Avengers movies. Because post-pandemic they haven't done that well at the box office. And at the same time too, there's also been a lot of criticism from fans. So that's an important factor as well.And then if you take a look at some of these Avatar films, that's a huge franchise for Disney. A one year delay for Avatar 3, which will push the other sequels currently in the works all the way as you can see, 2029 and then 2031.

(NASDAQ:FFIV) By 50%?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-undervaluing-f5-inc-nasdaq-100531153.html,1686737131,STORY,['FFIV'],"[Key InsightsF5's estimated fair value is US$299 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$150 suggests F5 is potentially 50% undervalued The US$154 analyst price target for FFIV is 49% less than our estimate of fair valueToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of F5, Inc. (NASDAQ:FFIV) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for F5 The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$660.2mUS$810.8mUS$886.0mUS$1.01bUS$1.12bUS$1.21bUS$1.28bUS$1.34bUS$1.40bUS$1.44bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 7.60%Est @ 5.95%Est @ 4.80%Est @ 3.99%Est @ 3.43% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2% US$610US$693US$700US$736US$758US$754US$738US$715US$687US$657(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$7.0bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.4b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.2%– 2.1%) = US$24bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$24b÷ ( 1 + 8.2%)10= US$11bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$18b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$150, the company appears quite undervalued at a 50% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at F5 as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.023. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for F5StrengthCurrently debt free.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatAnnual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For F5, we've compiled three additional factors you should further examine:Risks: To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with F5 .Future Earnings: How does FFIV's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

JNPR recently inked an agreement with the University of Tokyo (UTokyo) for an undisclosed amount to augment the latter’s wireless network capabilities across its campuses in Japan. The improvement in infrastructure facilities is expected to provide a seamless unified wireless experience for different departments, enabling flexible management and improving operational efficiency.With 48,000 students and faculty actively engaged in learning and research across 10 faculties and 15 graduate schools, UTokyo has created a mark as one of the world’s most prestigious universities. The university aims to improve students' and faculty's educational and research experiences by developing a reliable, secure and high-performing wireless network capable of accommodating large numbers of users, with multiple devices per person on each campus.This is where Juniper routing solutions come to the fore by effectively helping UTokyo with a unified view of the entire network on a single dashboard. Its AP32 Access Points leverage the Mist-AI-driven platform to offer streamlined network management and operations for the different departments. The network has enabled the university to seamlessly support the simultaneous connection of approximately 18,000 devices during peak usage periods.The simplified network traffic management from Juniper eradicates the complexity associated with multiple networks and delivers optimal bandwidth utilization. With the latest routing platforms, the company aims to significantly improve the network for more agile service delivery and better security features for enhanced visibility and customer data protection. This is expected to provide a shorter time-to-market for new services while ensuring regulatory compliance and data security.Segment routing simplifies operations and reduces resource requirements in the network by removing network state information from intermediate routers and placing path information into packet headers at the ingress node. This improves operational flexibility and agility for cost-effective user experiences as fewer network elements are involved, avoiding slow response to sudden network changes.Juniper is set to capitalize on the growing demand for data center virtualization, cloud computing and mobile traffic packet/optical convergence. The company offers new suites of products, such as the T4000 core router, QFX data center platform, ACX and PTX packet/optical solution, among others. With the growing use of smartphones and tablets, mobile data traffic has gone up. This has resulted in higher demand for advanced networking architecture, leading service providers to spend more on routers and switches. Juniper is expected to benefit from the higher spending pattern among carriers to upgrade their networks to support incremental growth in data traffic.Despite short-term challenges, particularly within the cloud and service provider verticals, Juniper expects healthy progress in most areas of its business, which augurs well for its long-term growth. The company has made significant changes to its go-to-market structure to better align its sales strategies with each of its core customer verticals. Moreover, several new products are in the pipeline, which are expected to further strengthen its competitive position across service provider, cloud and enterprise markets.The stock has gained 9.4% over the past year against the industry’s decline of 3.9%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchJuniper currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Key PicksInterDigital, Inc.

The report also stated that trends like commercial lines witnessing growth at a faster pace than personal lines and homeowners’ premiums improving at a better rate than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023.Insurers invest a portion of their premium income. Therefore, higher the rates. better the investment results. Also, the interest rate environment is improving. The Fed has already made three hikes in 2023, taking the tally to 10 since March 2022. Also, investment income is an important component of insurers’ top line. However, concerns related to whether Fed will pause further hikes remain. Thus, all eyes are on the outcome of the two-day Fed meeting concluding this Thursday. These solid fundamentals should help companies to maintain dividend streakPlayers are investing heavily in technology to improve scale and efficiencies.

However, those looking to provide the financial footing for a lower-stress retirement may want to consider dividend stocks, for added passive income when the time comes to finally enter their next chapter.Indeed, in this growth-focused world with cryptocurrencies and AI, little attention is paid to high-potential dividend stocks. But such companies can often provide superior total returns over the long-term. A solid base of dividends can provide portfolio stability in times of economic turmoil. For those thinking we could be headed into a recession, high-quality dividend stocks are where they’d want to position their portfolios right now.Here are three of the best dividend stocks I think are worth buying right now for those nearing or entering retirement.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsRealty Income Corporation (O)realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browserSource: ShutterstockRealty Income Corporation (NYSE:O), a prominent real estate investment trust known as the “monthly dividend company,” offers income-focused investors a unique opportunity. Realty Income stands out as a reliable choice in an uncertain market for income-focused investors seeking stability and potential growth. With a strong portfolio of commercial properties and steady occupancy rates, the company consistently delivers dividends. Its ability to provide consistent income, along with the potential for capital appreciation, makes it an attractive option in a market affected by rising interest rates.Realty Income is not the flashiest stock, but it offers remarkable consistency. Unlike most companies that pay dividends quarterly, Realty Income pays them monthly and has increased its dividend for 102 consecutive quarters, creating a streak that has lasted over 25 years. This means investors receive a modest raise four times a year. Adding Realty Income to a long-term portfolio can be advantageous for any investor seeking stability.Story continuesDevon Energy (DVN)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comDevon Energy (NYSE:DVN), a U.S.-focused independent oil and gas company, has faced a 13% decline due to falling oil prices. However, the outlook is optimistic as oil prices are expected to rise, coupled with a high dividend yield of 9.42%. Insider confidence is evident, with CEO Richard Muncrief purchasing 7,500 shares in March. Furthermore, management has expanded the share buyback program by 50% to $3 billion, emphasizing the attractive value of their shares.Based in Oklahoma, Devon Energy is a leading U.S. onshore drilling company. It possesses a high-quality portfolio of shale basins in strategic locations including the Anadarko Basin, Delaware Basin, Powder River Basin, Williston Basin, and Eagle Ford. Devon Energy has outperformed its peers by excelling in good performance and cost efficiency. In Q1 2023, the company achieved a record-breaking production of 320,000 barrels per day.Devon’s stock stands out for its exceptional operational efficiencies and secure production assets. Moreover, investors can take advantage of its appealing valuation and generous dividend yield. With a forward-looking earnings yield of 14%, Devon’s shares offer significant value compared to a risk-free asset like a 10-year U.S. Treasury bill.Restaurant Brands (QSR)A photo of a Burger King light-up sign outside a Burger King restaurant.Source: Savvapanf Photo/ShutterStock.comRestaurant Brands (NYSE:QSR) is a holding company that operates quick-service restaurants under its three main segments: Tim Hortons, Burger King, and Popeyes.Restaurant Brands exceeded analysts’ expectations in Q1 with an EPS of 75 cents, beating the consensus forecast of 64 cents.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Oracle is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.12 = US$14b ÷ (US$134b - US$23b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to May 2023).Therefore, Oracle has an ROCE of 12%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 9.9% generated by the Software industry. View our latest analysis for Oracle roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Oracle compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From Oracle's ROCE Trend?Over the past five years, Oracle's ROCE and capital employed have both remained mostly flat. This tells us the company isn't reinvesting in itself, so it's plausible that it's past the growth phase. So don't be surprised if Oracle doesn't end up being a multi-bagger in a few years time.The Bottom Line On Oracle's ROCEIn a nutshell, Oracle has been trudging along with the same returns from the same amount of capital over the last five years. Investors must think there's better things to come because the stock has knocked it out of the park, delivering a 174% gain to shareholders who have held over the last five years. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.Story continuesIf you want to continue researching Oracle, you might be interested to know about the 1 warning sign that our analysis has discovered.While Oracle isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

The company can opt for a one-year extension option and pay a fee of 0.125% on the amount of the extended commitments.Alternatively, it can choose to exercise one or both of the two six-month extension options available. Both the six-month options are subject to an extension fee of 0.0625% on the amount of the extended commitments.In addition, per the terms of the third amended and restated credit agreement, Public Storage will have the choice to either borrow up to $1.5 billion under the new credit facility, with an option to increase commitments or incur one or more term loans in an aggregate amount of up to an additional $1.0 billion at any point of time, subject to certain conditions. These loans will bear interest at variable rates.The agreement also mandates Public Storage to comply with certain financial covenants, including a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio test, a maximum consolidated secured leverage ratio test, a maximum consolidated unsecured asset coverage ratio test and a minimum consolidated debt service coverage ratio test on a quarterly basis.The company may use the borrowing under the facility to fund property development costs, capital expenditures, repay debt, general working capital needs and other general corporate purposes, including payment of dividends, acquisitions, and repurchases and redemptions of securities, among other things.This self-storage real estate investment trust (REIT) is one of the largest owners and operators of storage facilities in the United States.

It exited the first quarter of 2023 with $695.4 of cash and equivalents. As of Jun 12, 2023, PSA did not have any borrowing under the newly stated facility. Also, its investment-grade credit ratings render it favorable access to the debt market.Further, its focus on strategic acquisitions and an encouraging development pipeline bode well for growth.Nonetheless, elevated supply in some of its markets and a rise in move-out rates with the abatement of the pandemic may create pressure on occupancy levels.

The company is expected to report EPS of -$1.57, down 160.62% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $3.69 billion, down 57.26% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of -$4.71 per share and revenue of $15.45 billion, which would represent changes of -156.41% and -49.78%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Micron. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

239,cdbfdc13-af07-3357-94db-eefe53041cff,MU,2023-06-14,Is It Worth Investing in Micron (MU) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worth-investing-micron-mu-based-133007314.html,1686663007,STORY,['MU'],"[When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Micron (MU) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Micron currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.71, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 27 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.71 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 27 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 18 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 66.7% and 7.4% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MUBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MUCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Micron here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Micron, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is MU a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Micron, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at -$4.71.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Micron. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Micron.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The industry has shown resilience and adaptability by implementing digital solutions, expanding delivery and takeout options and optimizing operations.The companies have increased their investments to seek better methods for offering convenience, value addition and enhanced guest experience. Restaurant operators are also focused on new restaurant openings, menu innovation, outdoor dining options, to-go alcohol offerings and reimagining initiatives.The fact that companies have resorted to strategic pricing actions, using a more data-driven approach (to mitigate the impact of inflationary pressures), are adding to the positives. The initiative not only helps companies predict demand and manage inventory levels but also paves a path for optimal menu pricing, product development and marketing strategies based on sales data and customer feedback.Restaurant Sales GainsAccording to preliminary data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the restaurant &amp; bars industry registered total sales of $88.1 billion (on a seasonally-adjusted basis) in April 2023 compared with the previous month’s $87.6 billion. It was encouraging to note that the sales figure inched up 0.6% sequentially.Solid sales, courtesy of a rise in average check, is said to have driven the momentum in May. Per the report, US Quick-Service Restaurant sales (in May) is said to have increased 3.7% year over year compared with a 5.7% growth reported in the previous quarter. Average check increases during the month increased 5.5% year over year compared with the 7.7% growth reported in the previous month. The industry is said to have witnessing year-over-year growth in delivery (14.6%) and dine-in traffic (20%).What’s Driving the Industry?Restaurant operators are emphasizing on customer engagement as it provides a direct link with the respective companies’ business outcomes such as profit margins, share price and ROI.  Improved turnover correlates with more consistent retail environments, the removal of expenditures associated with new hires (and training) and quantifiable gains in productivity, service speed and partner customer experience ratings.Story continuesMajority of the restaurant operators have scratched the surface of their respective digital position and implemented advanced tools like automation and AI to drive personalization, loyalty and frequency.The fact that restaurant operators are constantly enhancing their omnichannel guest experience through loyalty program and other initiatives makes it an initiative placed in the right direction.Reversion toward the traditional industry standard staffing model have led to a decline in false waits and extended wait times. Per the NRA, the foodservice industry is likely to add 500,000 new jobs in 2023, bringing the employment count to 15.5 million. The industry is projected to add an average of nearly 150,000 jobs a year, bringing the total staffing levels to 16.5 million by 2030.Road AheadAlthough macroeconomic challenges like dealing with staffing impediments and commodity cycles persist, we believe that the idea of creating a seamless, integrated and uniform experience across all channels and customer touchpoints will likely play a major role in enhancing guest satisfaction and creating a sticky and frequent customer behavior. With input costs gradually normalizing, we expect to see stronger dining rooms, takeout and delivery businesses in the upcoming periods. According to the NRA, the food industry is anticipated to hit sales of $997 billion in 2023 (compared with $898 billion in 2022) buoyed by pent up consumer demand and high menu prices. Investing in the retail sector seems profitable now. It is worth noting that the Zacks Retail – Restaurants industry is currently in the top 17% (Zacks Industry Rank #42) out of 251 Zacks industries.Here, we have highlighted three stocks that are likely to witness earnings growth in 2023 buoyed by robust sales-building initiatives.3 Restaurant Stocks to Watch Out ForGiven the backdrop, here are three restaurant stocks that are likely to move higher in 2023.

Rowe Price, a global investment management firm and a leader in retirement, today published a new white paper focused on how the primary sources of financial stress—specifically, the lack of emergency savings and the burden of student loan debt—can negatively affect an individual's retirement savings. Additionally, the paper provides insights on how provisions in the recently passed SECURE 2.0 Act retirement legislation could help with these challenges. The findings are based on multiple studies conducted by T. Rowe Price, with a focus on the firm's annual Retirement Savings and Spending study, which surveys a national representative group of 401(k) participants.Key insights from the Retirement Savings and Spending survey featured in the paper include:Fifty-five percent of survey respondents stated that they are not saving enough for retirement or are not sure if they are. Among these respondents, 62% indicated that they were saving all they could afford.Fourteen percent of respondents stated that they were likely to tap into their workplace retirement accounts to cover emergency expenses. The survey also found that respondents who took multiple small loans and hardship withdrawals had significantly lower contribution rates and lower retirement plan account balances than their peers who did not take loans or hardship withdrawals.Ten percent of respondents who took two or more loans also had taken hardship withdrawals. These workers had an average account balance of $26,000, about one-quarter of the account balance of their peers with no loans.Among those surveyed, roughly one in four reported that they had outstanding college debt. Retirement savers with student loans had lower average contribution rates than those without loans.More details on the specific SECURE 2.0 provisions that could improve retirement savers' financial wellness, including provisions on emergency savings and student loans, as well as more insights from T. Rowe Price's annual study can be found here.Story continues""Short-term financial responsibilities can be a significant source of financial stress and a potential barrier to saving for retirement,"" said Rachel Weker, vice president, senior retirement strategist at T. Rowe Price. ""But postponing retirement saving and taking repeated loans or hardship withdrawals can really damage financial wellness. Employers can implement meaningful changes that could have a positive impact on retirement savings for many Americans by helping to address these shorter-term financial challenges.

UPS is being aided by rising demand for online shopping and a solid free cash flow. Nonetheless, increasing capital expenses are worrisome.Factors Favoring UPSWe are encouraged by UPS' solid free cash flow. In 2021, UPS repurchased shares worth $500 million, up 130% year over year.Concurrent with fourth-quarter 2022 earnings release, UPS’ board of directors has raised its quarterly cash dividend to $1.62 per share, effective from the first quarter of 2023. This marks the 14th consecutive year of a dividend increase.Additionally, UPS has approved a $5 billion share-repurchase authorization, replacing the company’s existing buyback program. For full-year 2023, UPS expects making dividend payments of $5.4 billion and share repurchases of $3 billion.Demand for online shopping has slowed down from the pandemic peak with the reopening of economy. However, the figures are still higher than the pre-pandemic levels. To meet the demand swell in the holiday season, UPS added more than 100,000 seasonal workers throughout the United States.Key RisksRising capital expenses add to the company’s woes. In 2022, UPS incurred $4,769 million of capital expenditures, up 13.7% year over year. Management now expects current-year capital expenditures to be $5.3 billion, well above 2022 levels. The elevated capex guidance, even though aimed at long-term benefits, may dent current-year profit margins. Our estimate for 2023 capex is also pegged at $5.3 billion.Zacks RankCurrently, UPS carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the Zacks Transportation sector are Copa Holdings, S.A.

258,49714101-4c72-3ac0-97fa-3076ba400fd9,OXY,2023-06-14,The 3 Most Undervalued Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy in June 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-most-undervalued-warren-buffett-163021808.html,1686155421,STORY,"['BRK-A', 'OXY', 'GM']","[Warren Buffett stocks are on the rise, and many think that the Oracle of Omaha is back. After weathering a stormy market and making some eyebrow-raising moves, including panic selling his 10% stake in Delta (NYSE:DAL), United (NASDAQ:UAL), American (NASDAQ:AAL) and Southwest (NYSE:LUV), his mammoth conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) is up nearly 7% since January. But still, as we roll into June, some top Warren Buffett stocks remain on sale for investors ready to heed the Oracle.Remember that Buffett’s stock picks are a masterclass in value investing strategies, which are all about spotting stocks that are on sale or undervalued. Value investing analytics range widely, but two of the best indicators are price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios.The P/E ratio, calculated by dividing a company’s market price per share by its earnings per share, provides a measure of the price investors are willing to pay for every dollar of a company’s earnings. If a company’s P/E ratio is lower than its industry peers, it might be a sign that it’s undervalued, which basically means investors can buy its earnings on the cheap.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLikewise, the P/B ratio, determined by dividing a company’s stock price by its book value per share, gives an indication of whether the market price accurately reflects the company’s net asset value. If the P/B ratio is on the low side, some read the indicator as suggesting that its intrinsic value (based on its assets) is higher than what the market’s currently pricing it at.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comAfter consistently buying the dip throughout the year, Buffett now holds a considerable 222 million shares of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). This $13 billion investment equates to a nearly 25% stake in the company. This clearly indicates Buffett’s robust confidence in OXY despite ongoing oil industry challenges.Story continuesOperationally, OXY’s production exceeded expectations by 2% in the recent quarter, and the company maintained its spending below the $6 billion mark, contributing to an impressive trailing-12-month net margin of 24.58%, hugely outperforming the industry average of 16.3%.Alongside these stats, OXY achieved a return on invested capital of 22.34%. This is superior to the industry standard of 17.63%, making it a perfect addition to a portfolio of Warren Buffett stocks.Chevron (CVX)chevron stockSource: LesPalenik / Shutterstock.comBuffett is bullish on the oil industry, as we saw with OXY. His Chevron (NYSE:CVX) stake reinforces his thesis.The stock made a splash with its first-quarter earnings report, profiting $6.7 billion. This outperformed market predictions while also trumping last year’s $6.5 billion.The quarter also saw Chevron shelling out $2.9 billion (roughly 4%) in dividends and buying back $3.75B worth of shares. That equates to a hefty 31% payout ratio for hungry investors. Second-quarter plans include a $4.375 billion buyback, a move that’s a part of its recently declared $75 billion grand strategy.The company also aggressively addressed its debt thus far in 2023, with net debt dipping quarter-over-quarter. It came in at 3.3%, which indicates the firm is well-positioned for further rate hikes and economic uncertainty.General Motors (GM)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is the perfect value play for those wanting a piece of the electric vehicle (EV) industry. As the second-largest producer of EVs in the U.S., GM is charging ahead with additional offerings. In 2023, these offerings will include the Silverado EV, the Blazer EV and the Equinox EV later in the year.Predicting $225 billion in total revenue by 2025, GM is banking on at least $50 billion to come from its EV offerings. GM will likely be a major global EV player in just a few years. It is betting on economies of scale alongside plummeting battery costs to steer its EV profitability.Aside from its aspirations, GM’s balance sheet is solid. Its $28.2 billion in cash and dwindling debt provides the financial bedrock needed to run day-to-day operations and plan for growth.GM ticks all the right boxes for a quintessential value pick. It’s a dominant force in a concentrated industry, ripe with growth opportunities and an enticing valuation.On the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held a long position in OXY.

259,83440e0e-2c1c-3155-a0a3-73c3b47571a4,OXY,2023-06-14,The 3 Best Movie Stocks to Buy Now (Not Named AMC),InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-best-movie-stocks-buy-140016733.html,1686146416,STORY,"['AMC', 'AMZN', 'AAPL', 'OXY']","[Movie theaters have had it tough over the past three years, without the ongoing writers’ strike in Hollywood putting its revenue engine in doubt. CNN Business reported Moody’s comments in early May, “New big-budget tent-pole releases tend to fill theaters. Theaters rely on these volumes for food and beverage sales as well, so exhibitors could feel the effects of a protracted strike more significantly.” This is a very tricky time to be considering the best movie stocks to buy. So why would anyone in their right mind consider a movie stocks investment? Good question. AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC) is up more than 18.07% year-to-date. Investors are betting that movie theaters will continue generating strong box offices come summer. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn 2022, the domestic box office was $7.37 billion, 64.4% higher than in 2021. Through June 5, it was $3.61 billion, or about $722 million per month. While that’s reasonable relative to 2021, it’s nowhere near 2018’s record box office that, averaged $991 million per month, 37% higher than in 2022. Given AMC’s debt and the potential pain of a protracted strike, it would not be wise to bet on America’s largest theater chain. Instead, here are three ways to bet on promising movie industry stocks without too much risk.Vanguard Communications Services ETF (VOX)vanguard website displayed on a mobile phone screen representing vanguard etfsSource: ShutterstockThe Vanguard Communications Services ETF (NYSEARCA:VOX) has four movie theater chains amongst its 116 holdings: AMC at 0.31%, Cinemark Holdings (NYSE:CNK) at 0.23%, IMAX (NYSE:IMAX) at 0.12% and Marcus (NYSE:MCS) at 0.05%.I realize this amounts to a minimal bet on movie stocks, but sometimes it’s better to be a little more conservative in your investments. That’s especially true when you’ve got something like a writer’s strike hanging over your head. Better to be safe than sorry.    However, If you go through the list of holdings,  you will see that movie-related businesses account for three of the top 10: Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) at 5.77%, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) at 4.42% and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).Story continuesIf you’re concerned about VOX’s performance, you needn’t be. YTD, it’s up more than 25%, more than double the index, and 22% over the past five years. It’s delivered reasonable, if not spectacular, returns over this period. Amazon (AMZN)Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stockSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comThese last two selections are indirect ways to bet on movie stocks.Of course, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has its Prime video streaming service. However, it really got into the movie business when it acquired MGM Studios in March 2022, paying $8.45 billion for the iconic American movie studio. It merged the studio with Prime Video and Amazon Studios to make a formidable movie business. Amazon Studio produced Air!, Ben Affleck’s latest directing effort, a movie about Nike (NYSE:NKE) signing Michael Jordan to a sponsorship deal.By insulating yourself in the Amazon ecosystem, you are diversifying your interests beyond the movie business into its more lucrative industries such as data centers and cloud computing through Amazon Web Services, as well as the advertising business, which is growing faster than AWS.The former had revenues of $21.4 billion in the first quarter, 16% higher than a year earlier, while the latter’s sales grew 21% to $9.5 billion. More importantly, the two segments have huge operating margins, allowing Amazon to do whatever it wants in e-commerce and elsewhere. Don’t forget the goal of investing is to make money over the long haul. It’s a marathon rather than a sprint. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A,BRK-B)The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comEven more indirect, Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-A,NYSE:BRK-B) connection to the movie business is through its passive equity investments in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA). Berkshire’s 5.8% stake in Apple accounts for nearly 48% of the holding company’s $345 billion equities portfolio.  Apple launched Apple Studios in October 2019 to create content for its Apple TV+ video streaming business. Berkshire’s 15.3% stake in Paramount is a much smaller equity position, accounting for just 0.4% of its portfolio. It’s not even in its top 10.Paramount recently cut its dividend to preserve free cash flow to grow its business. Its shares have been hit mercilessly, down 50% over the past year. Warren Buffett discussed the Paramount situation at Berkshire’s annual meeting in early May. “The streaming business is extremely interesting to watch, because people love to use their eyeballs being entertained on a screen in front of them or a phone, whatever it may be, but there is a lot of companies doing it, and you need fewer companies or you need higher prices, or it doesn’t work,” The Hollywood Reporter reported Buffett’s comments. I consider Paramount similar to Berkshire’s investment in Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Investors thought Buffett had lost his touch for a long time because of the large energy investment. Higher oil prices have changed investor perception. Occidental is now Berkshire’s sixth-largest holding, valued at $13.2 billion, giving it nearly 25% of the oil and gas producer. Warren Buffett is patient capital. I suspect he ends up smelling like roses when it comes to Paramount. On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

260,07c9afb8-0836-3f54-b6da-7cdcdecdc65e,BSX,2023-06-14,"Insiders At Boston Scientific Sold US$6.3m In Stock, Alluding To Potential Weakness \",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-boston-scientific-sold-us-110030421.html,1686740430,STORY,['BSX'],"[The fact that multiple Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Boston Scientific The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Boston ScientificThe insider, Eric Francis Thepaut, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.8m worth of shares at a price of US$52.49 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$51.16. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.In the last year Boston Scientific insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Boston Scientific Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Boston Scientific. Specifically, insider Eric Francis Thepaut ditched US$2.8m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Boston ScientificLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Boston Scientific insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$176m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Boston Scientific Tell Us?An insider sold Boston Scientific shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. On the plus side, Boston Scientific makes money, and is growing profits. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. When we did our research, we found 3 warning signs for Boston Scientific (1 can't be ignored!) that we believe deserve your full attention.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

262,321156fe-12a9-3acd-a5dd-6a8cb341cded,BSX,2023-06-14,Here's Why You Should Retain BD (BDX) Stock in Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-retain-bd-bdx-142700705.html,1686666420,STORY,"['BDX', 'HOLX', 'BSX']","[Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX, popularly known as BD, is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of a few product launches over the past few months. The optimism led by a solid second-quarter fiscal 2023 performance, along with a few regulatory approvals, is expected to contribute further. Forex woes and significant consolidation persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 6.1% compared with the 18.6% rise of the industry and 16.4% growth of the S&amp;P 500.The renowned medical technology company has a market capitalization of $71.21 billion. It projects 10.1% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. BD has delivered an earnings surprise of 5.8% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Regulatory Approvals: BD has been progressing impressively on the regulatory front, raising our optimism. In May, BD received the FDA’s 510(k) clearance for the new BD Kiestra Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus imaging application.At the time of its second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings release in May, BD confirmed that its BD Life Sciences segment’s Integrated Diagnostic Solutions business unit filed for US regulatory clearance of BD MiniDraw.Product Launches: We are upbeat about BD’s slew of product launches in recent times. In May, the company announced expanded customer availability of an all-in-one prefilled flush syringe with an integrated disinfection unit designed to reinforce compliance with infection prevention guidelines and simplify nursing workflow.The same month, BD announced the worldwide commercial launch of a new-to-world cell sorting instrument, BD FACSDiscover S8 Cell Sorter, featuring two breakthrough technologies (BD SpectralFX Technology and BD CellView Image Technology).Strong Q2 Results: BD’s solid second-quarter fiscal 2023 results buoy our optimism. The company registered solid top-line and bottom-line results, along with improvements in the overall base revenues. Robust performances by the majority of its segments and both geographic regions were seen. Strength in BD’s segment’s business units during the reported quarter was also witnessed. The expansion of both margins bodes well.Story continuesDownsidesSignificant Consolidation: The medical technology industry has been experiencing a significant amount of consolidation, resulting in companies with greater scale and market presence than BD. As a result, competition among medical device suppliers to provide goods and services has increased. Further consolidation in the industry could intensify competition among medical device suppliers and exert additional pressure on the demand for and prices of BD’s products.Forex Woes: BD generates a substantial amount of its revenues from international operations. The revenues BD report with respect to its operations outside the United States may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. BD cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which it can mitigate such risks.Estimate TrendBD is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for fiscal 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 0.4% north to $12.19.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $4.83 billion, suggesting a 3.9% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

Like many companies, it has not disclosed the sale price.Pinskiy and rapper Timati unveiled their new brand, Stars Coffee, in August 2022, opening the bulk of acquired sites in September and October. Starbucks had held 130 stores in Russia, operated by its licensee Alshaya Group, with nearly 2,000 employees in the country.In an interview with TASS, published on Tuesday, Pinskiy said some cafes had closed due to the terms of the lease, while others in new sites had opened. He said he paid around 500 million roubles.""I think the money spent on acquiring and relaunching the assets will be returned by the end of the year,"" Pinskiy told TASS, with the chain now charging more on average and recovering from a slow start.""Such a chance could not be missed,"" Pinskiy said, adding that he had also participated in the tender to buy McDonald's former restaurants in Russia and had even signed a preliminary contract before ultimately losing out to businessman and McDonald's franchisee Alexander Govor.Corporate exits from Russia have typically involved huge discounts, with some buyers snapping up several assets on the cheap.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. See our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals How Quickly Is Vertex Pharmaceuticals Increasing Earnings Per Share?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Shareholders will be happy to know that Vertex Pharmaceuticals' EPS has grown 29% each year, compound, over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. On the one hand, Vertex Pharmaceuticals' EBIT margins fell over the last year, but on the other hand, revenue grew. So it seems the future may hold further growth, especially if EBIT margins can remain steady.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Vertex Pharmaceuticals.Story continuesAre Vertex Pharmaceuticals Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since Vertex Pharmaceuticals has a market capitalisation of US$88b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$196m. This comes in at 0.2% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Should You Add Vertex Pharmaceuticals To Your Watchlist?If you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Vertex Pharmaceuticals' strong EPS growth. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Vertex Pharmaceuticals' continuing strength. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. If you think Vertex Pharmaceuticals might suit your style as an investor, you could go straight to its annual report, or you could first check our discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation for the company.Although Vertex Pharmaceuticals certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

A study conducted by Forrester Consulting on behalf of Mailchimp underscores several major issues that today’s small and midsize businesses (SMBs) face when it comes to maturing their marketing practices, like creating new content on a regular basis and having the right insights to help them deliver that content to the right audience at the right time to drive the desired behavior**. Luckily, marketers today have access to marketing toolkits that are integrated with advanced AI and machine learning (ML) technologies. 88% of marketers believe their marketing organization must increase use of automation and AI to meet customer expectations and stay competitive.This press release features multimedia.

(Graphic: Business Wire)The survey, collected in March 2023 from more than 300 SMB marketers in North America, Australia, and the UK, tells us that marketers are struggling to stay competitive, but they are also eager and excited to incorporate advanced technology solutions into their marketing strategies. Intuit Mailchimp used the study’s research findings to explore how the power of machine learning can be combined with the content generation power of generative AI to solve some of the most common challenges facing marketers today and help them stay competitive.Story continues""Some of the most frequent and important feedback we hear from marketers and SMBs about content creation is that they don’t have the time, data, expertise or tools necessary to create great tailored content, not to mention the time it takes to analyze it,"" said John Humphrey, Head of Data Platform Product at Intuit Mailchimp. ""So at Mailchimp, we think a lot about ‘personalization at scale,’ or breaking down why a campaign performs the way it did with detailed insights and suggestions for how to improve those campaigns and who to share them with.""The Data Tells a StoryMarketing is one industry that is rapidly evolving and will continue to do so as customer needs change and technology advances. This report explores what this could mean for marketers, how marketers feel about advancements in technology, and how these technologies may be used to address marketers' needs in the future. We learned that small and mid-sized company marketers are facing a multitude of issues:On average, marketers use 5 different platforms to plan, execute, and analyze their marketing campaigns44% of marketers say the limited ability to compare their performance to peers is holding them back from achieving their goals49% see limited scalability as the most significant risk associated with inadequate marketing automation and AI adoptionBut we also learned that they are eager for solutions:67% of respondents believe that strategically increasing the adoption of marketing automation is essential for acquiring and retaining customers70% of marketers say insights on campaign performance against business targets are valuable to their marketing organization in attaining its top priorities73% of marketers said insights around ​​omnichannel customer engagement insights (i.e., 360-degree view of customer's interactions with the business for better personalization and engagement) are valuable to their marketing organization achieving its top prioritiesHelping Marketers Meet Their NeedsMachine learning has vastly improved SMB marketers' ability to tailor content and better connect with their audiences, but it has not addressed the need for scalable solutions to generate the content required to support personalized experiences. That's where industry peers anticipate AI stepping in, a supportive tool that helps marketers save time and take their marketing further without relinquishing control. In fact, 50% of marketers believe inadequate AI adoption is holding them back from achieving their goals.""My advice to marketers is to take time to understand machine learning and understand what it unlocks in terms of the potential to differentiate groups of customers at scale to stay ahead of the curve,"" said Maya Wilson, Director of Data Science at Intuit Mailchimp. ""AI-powered tools are starting to understand content the way a marketer understands it, and can provide recommendations based on that understanding. This can be used for design, segmentation strategy and content optimization.""Automations powered by machine learning and AI can be great solutions for content creation and audience generation, but there are other challenges marketers face. For example, 88% of small and medium business marketers agree that customer expectations are at an all-time high, but roughly 70% of respondents lack data-driven recommendations to improve performance compared to peers. Data is powerful, and in partnership with AI/ML tools, marketers can gain insights and recommendations that could significantly improve their ability to understand and connect with their customers at scale, segment them, or even benchmark against their competitors.""We were able to use customer data accessed via our Shopify integration to identify and segment customers based on purchase history and how they interact on our website, allowing us to retarget our customers based on previous purchases with suggestions for a similar coffee if they liked the one they tried,"" said Alan Fischer from PERC Coffee, an Intuit Mailchimp customer. ""Attrition is by far the highest between the first and second purchases. If someone hasn't made a second purchase in 21 days, they’re probably out of coffee, so we’re prodding them and offering discount codes.""So What?The fact is that many marketers at businesses small and large have already found new and exciting ways to integrate AI and automations into their daily toolkits. We think that marketers will be able to use their time in new ways as AI technology allows them to create and launch more campaigns and products at a higher quality and frequency than they were capable of before. Marketers may find that after integrating trusted automations, they suddenly have the time to focus on the most pressing issues: what their customer pain points are that they’re not yet addressing or what products and offers could address those unmet customer needs.*Based on competitor brands' publicly available data on worldwide numbers of customers in 2021/2022. **Based on 2022 data for the following products: Product recommendations, Send Time Optimization, A/B testing, CLV segmentation, Likelihood to Purchase Segmentation, and PBJ.**To view the report, click here.

The company has been witnessing muted consumer sentiments from inflation and increasing interest rates, along with the ongoing war in Ukraine and unfavorable currency.Global supply-chain disruptions and rising raw material costs also continue to hurt Whirlpool’s performance. The company has been witnessing elevated raw materials, freight and logistic costs, as well as energy costs. All these factors marred its margin performance across most regions in first-quarter 2023.Whirlpool’s gross profit declined 10.3% year over year in first-quarter 2023. Ongoing EBIT fell 45.8% from the year-ago quarter. The ongoing EBIT margin of 5.4% contracted 400 basis points (bps) year over year.Despite the earnings and sales beat in first-quarter 2023, both metrics declined year over year. Results were impacted by the global demand softness, and an unfavorable mix of product and price. Adjusted earnings declined 49.9% year over year, whereas net sales fell 5.5% from the year-ago quarter.Management reaffirmed its expectations for 2023 net sales of $19.4 billion, reflecting a 1-2% decline from that reported in the prior year. The view is also in line with our estimate. On a GAAP and ongoing basis, Whirlpool downgraded its earnings per share expectation to $13-$15 from the previously disclosed $16-$18. However, it reaffirmed ongoing earnings per diluted share of $16-$18.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s current financial year’s sales and earnings suggests declines of 1.7% and 16.4%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s reported numbers.The company’s high debt levels concern investors. Whirlpool ended the first quarter with a long-term debt of $7,382 million, up 0.3% on a sequential basis. Its debt-to-capitalization ratio of 0.78 at the end of the first quarter compares unfavorably with 0.75 at the end of the preceding quarter.The company’s debt load appears too high to be managed by its cash and cash equivalents of $1,359 million as of Mar 31, 2023.Story continuesCan Growth Efforts Save the Day?Whirlpool is on track with early and decisive actions to protect margins and productivity amid the ongoing supply-chain constraints and significant inflationary pressures. It has implemented cost takeout actions, including curtailing structural and discretionary costs, capturing raw material deflation opportunities, effectively managing working capital and syncing its supply chain and labor levels with demand. It announced significant cost-based price increases of 5-18% in various countries across the globe.The company is on track with its long-term targets, with profitable growth of 5-6% and ongoing EBIT margin expansion of 11-12%. It also launched a cost takeout program worth $500 million, which is likely to reduce fixed and variable costs in 2023.Keeping in these lines, management is on track with its cost takeout actions, and expects $800-$900 million related to gains from the aforementioned measures and eased raw material inflation. The company expects to generate $500 million in net cost takeout actions via premium cost reductions of more than $250 million and supply-chain inefficiencies. Also, it cut its current global salaried workforce by 4%.Whirlpool recently concluded the strategic review of its EMEA segment. As part of this, the company’s Europe major domestic appliance business will form an entity with Arçelik. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2023.The new company is likely to generate more than €6 billion in annual sales and above €200 million in cost synergies. WHR retained the ownership of its EMEA KitchenAid business, which forms part of the small appliance business. It is progressing with the integration efforts of its latest buyout of InSinkErator and has been on track with sustained EBIT margins of above 20%. This buyout is expected to add 50 basis points to WHR’s consolidated EBIT margins. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research The Whirlpool stock has rallied 9.4% in the past three months compared with the industry’s and the Consumer Discretionary sector’s growth of 8.2% and 5.2%, respectively.Stocks to FocusSome better-ranked Consumer Discretionary stocks are GIII Apparel Group GIII, Skechers SKX and lululemon athletica LULU.GIII Apparel has an expected EPS growth rate of 15% for three to five years.

As lightweight, hygienic and durable materials, they play a vital role in products used around the globe, every day. Innovative plastic materials help to keep food fresh longer so it can be safely stored and transported long distances, reducing food waste. These materials also provide safe, high-quality solutions for healthcare. Plastics are key to the energy transition, from the latest automotive components that enable vehicle lightweighting, to integral components for wind turbines and solar panels.Unfortunately, the mismanagement of plastic waste has reached a tipping point. Society, governments and industry are accelerating efforts to close the loop and prevent plastic leakage to the environment, keeping plastics circulating in the economy through recycling and reuse. We believe circularity is critical to helping end plastic waste, and it also offers strong economic, social and climate benefits.According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation,1 achieving a circular economy for plastics by 2040 has the potential to reduce the annual volume of plastics entering our oceans by 80%, reduce GHG emissions by 25%, generate a savings of $200 billion per year, and create 700,000 net additional jobs.1LyondellBasell is leading change, fostering innovative products and technologies that will unlock a circular and low carbon economy. In September 2022, we announced our new Circular and Low Carbon Solutions business to deliver on our ambition to produce and market at least 2 million metric tons of recycled and renewable-based polymers annually by 2030. This goal represents approximately 20% of our global sales of PE and PP in 2022.The role of public policyEffective public policies are essential to address the plastic waste challenge and advance a circular economy. We support legislation and policy to:Story continuesAdvance waste management systems, infrastructure and recycling standards.Increase the reuse and recycling of plastic.Support the introduction of new recycling technologies needed to complement existing mechanical recycling technologies.Strengthen demand for recycled plastics.Promote the use of renewable-based plastics.Inform consumers and incentivize responsible consumer behavior to recycle and reduce plastic waste.OUR GOALSProduce and market at least 2 million metric tons of recycled and renewable-based polymers annually by 2030For every dollar we invest in venture funds that address the plastic waste challenge, we help catalyze another five dollars from co-investorsZero loss of plastic pellets to the environment from our operationsOUR APPROACHExpand our recycling capacity globallyAccelerate the development and implementation of scalable recycling technologies, including our advanced recycling technology, MoReTecOptimize the value chain for circularity by building integrated regional hubs to access and supply plastic waste feedstockInvest along our value chain to become a full-solution provider for customers and brand ownersGrow our Circulen portfolio of recycled and renewable-based productsCatalyze investments from venture funds' partners to increase the recovery and recycling of plastic and accelerate technology and other solutions to end plastic wasteSupport effective policies and infrastructure development to improve plastic waste management and recycling through engagement with governments and industry peersOUR GOAL: PRODUCE AND MARKET AT LEAST 2 MILLION METRIC TONS OF RECYCLED AND RENEWABLE-BASED POLYMERS ANNUALLY BY 2030Achieving this ambitious goal will require a range of actions to secure access to plastic waste feedstock and build our capacity to produce more recycled and renewable-based products. Our new Circular and Low Carbon Solutions business is focused on securing feedstock supply, growing our recycling footprint and developing scalable technologies to grow our Circulen portfolio of products.CirculenRecover: Products made from plastic waste through a mechanical recycling process. This type of recycling upgrades plastic waste into usable materials through mechanical processes including sorting, washing, grinding, melting and forming new pellets. The resulting polymers can also be blended or compounded with traditional fossil-based products, allowing us to deliver high-quality polymers with an optimal balance of performance characteristics and mechanically- recycled content. These polymers can be used in a wide variety of industrial, household and consumer product applications.CirculenRevive: Products made using an advanced recycling process to convert plastic waste back to its molecular level, which is then used as a feedstock in our conventional production processes to produce new polymers. A broad range of plastics can be recycled using this process including hard-to-recycle items such as mixed materials, composites, multilayer and flexible plastics. The advanced recycled feedstock is mixed with conventional feedstocks in our process, and allocated to CirculenRevive products using a mass balance approach certified according to the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) PLUS standard. These polymers can be used in highly regulated applications such as food contact and healthcare.CirculenRenew: Products made from renewable feedstocks derived from bio-based wastes and residual oils, such as used cooking oils. These feedstocks are used in our conventional production processes along with conventional feedstocks, and are allocated to CirculenRenew products using an ISCC PLUS-certified mass balance approach. The use of renewable feedstocks offers a lower carbon footprint compared to fossil-based feedstocks. These polymers can also be used in highly regulated applications such as food contact and healthcare.Expanding our mechanical recycling capacity globallyIn 2022, we took steps to boost our mechanical recycling capacity while supporting the development of plastics recycling infrastructure in India and China. With these steps, our mechanical recycling footprint will encompass joint ventures in Europe, India and China.In India, we announced plans to form a joint venture with Shakti Plastic Industries, India's largest plastic scrap recycler and waste collection company, to build and operate a fully automated mechanical recycling plant. The plant is intended to process rigid packaging post-consumer waste and produce 50,000 metric tons of recycled PE and PP per year, equivalent to the single- use plastic waste produced by 12.5 million people. Our concept is that the new facility will become the largest mechanical recycling plant in India with an estimated start at the end of 2024. LyondellBasell will market the recycled products produced by this joint venture adding volume to its CirculenRecover range of existing PE and PP materials to help meet increasing demand by converters and brand owners in India for recycled polymer materials.In China, we announced plans to form a joint venture with Genox Recycling to build a plastics recycling plant in Zhaoqing, Guangdong Province. Genox Recycling is a leading manufacturer for integrated service providers of the solid waste treatment industry in China. This facility has a planned start-up date in 2023 and will use mechanical recycling technology to process post-consumer PE and PP waste and produce new polymers sold under the LyondellBasell CirculenRecover product portfolio.LyondellBasell is currently a joint venture partner with Veolia in Quality Circular Polymers (QCP), an industry-leading mechanical recycling company with a production capacity of 55,000 metric tons per year. The QCP site in Geleen, the Netherlands, produces high-quality polymers from post-consumer plastic waste. Both pre-consumer and post-consumer waste are processed at the QCP Blandain, Belgium, site.Implementing advanced recycling technology at commercial scaleWe began focusing on advanced recycling in 2017 as a complementary solution to mechanical recycling because it can address hard-to-recycle plastics that end up inincineration or landfill`s. We collaborated with Germany's Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) to develop our proprietary MoReTec technology, which uses a catalyst to improve the breakdown of plastic waste. This technology allows us to convert post-consumer plastic waste into pyrolysis oil and pyrolysis gas for use in our crackers as feedstock for the production of new polymer materials.The differential advantage of MoReTec technology is the combination of scale with leading energy efficiency and a lower GHGfootprint, compared with other advanced recycling technologies. The technology's innovative process maximizes the plastic recycling rate while minimizing waste and fuels. In the future, opportunities for the process to be powered by renewable electricity will further reduce the carbon footprint of this technology.The start-up of our pilot plant in Ferrara, Italy, in 2020 and its expansion in 2021 were important milestones as we improved the efficiency and economics of the technology.In 2022, we announced plans to move forward with the engineering phase to build a commercial-scale advanced recycling plant using our MoReTec technology at our site in Wesseling, Germany. Pending a final investment decision in 2023, the start-up of the plant is planned for the end of 2025 with a capacity to consume 50,000 metric tons of plastic waste per year. A material part of the feedstock will be provided by Source One Plastics, our joint venture with 23 Oaks Investment. (See ""Investing upstream to secure access to plastic waste feedstock"" below.)Offering renewable-based polymers globallyIn 2022, we continued to offer PP and PE with mass balance certificates or measurable carbon-14 content from renewable feedstocks, following our introduction of these polymers at commercial scale in 2021. The renewable feedstocks can be used in our existing manufacturing process. They are also ISCC PLUS- certified as sustainably sourced and not in competition with the food chain. The renewable feedstock is produced from 100% bio-based waste and residues, such as used cooking oils. These polymers offer a lower carbon footprint compared with fossil-based polymers, are manufactured in Europe and the U.S. and marketed globally under the CirculenRenew brand.Investing upstream to secure access to plasticwaste feedstockWe are also investing upstream in state-of-the-art sorting units to secure access to plastic waste feedstock, with facilities planned in the U.S. and Germany.In 2022, we formed a joint venture with 23 Oaks Investments to build an energy-efficient, advanced plastics sorting facility in Germany. Using renewable energy from wind and biomass, the new unit is designed to process the amount of plastic packaging waste generated by approximately 1.3 million German people per year. This waste is not recycled today and is mostly incinerated. The Source One Plastics facility will produce processed waste, providing a material part of the feedstock for the advanced recycling plant planned at our Wesseling site using our proprietary MoReTec technology.We also signed an agreement with Cyclyx International and ExxonMobil to advance the development of a plastic waste sorting and processing facility in the greater Houston area. The new facility will address a critical missing link in the plastic waste supply chain by connecting community recycling programs to new and more advanced recycling technologies that have the potential to take a much wider variety of plastic materials. With a designed capacity of 150,000 metric tons of mixed plastic waste and commercial start-up expected in 2024, the Cyclyx Circularity Center will be unique among plastic recovery facilities, producing feedstock for both mechanical and advanced recycling. The center will leverage new technologies to analyze plastics based on their composition and sort them according to customer specifications for their highest and best reuse.LyondellBasell, Cyclyx and ExxonMobil are members of the Houston Recycling Collaboration, a collaboration that brings together government, industry and the community to significantly increase Houston's plastics recycling rate and help establish the city as a leader for both mechanical and advanced recycling processes. The Houston Recycling Collaboration announced the launch of its first specific project, a new plastic collection program at the Kingwood Recycling Center expanding the materials accepted for recycling to include nearly all plastics. The program launched on December 10, 2022, and collected 3,900 pounds of plastic waste in the first weekend.Collaborating across the value chain to grow our Circulen product offeringWe entered into a long-term supply agreement with Envision Plastics to purchase mechanically recycled high-density polyethylene post- consumer resin (HDPE PCR) for use in CirculenRecover products in North America.The HDPE PCR is made from curbside-collected, post-consumer food and beverage containers and is especially unique because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration allows it to be used for direct food contact. CirculenRecover polymers include a range of formulated single pellet solutions, combining fossil-based resin with PCR, that can be used in a wide variety of applications.Innovating solutions for food-grade recycled PPPP is the most widely used polymer in food packaging, but closing the loop on food-grade PP is a challenge. In 2022, LyondellBasell joined NEXTLOOPP, an initiative that brings together more than 40 major industry players to develop circular food-grade recycled PP from post-consumer packaging. NEXTLOOPP is able to close the loop on PP by using a combination of cutting-edge technologies, developed by Nextek Ltd. It does this by separating food- grade PP from the rest, and decontaminating the polymer. Following outstanding results of its innovative tracer-based sorting trials, Nextek Ltd. recently started production trials of food- grade compliant recycled PP.View the full LyondellBasell 2022 Sustainability Report.For information about the factors that could impact our forward-looking statements, please see page two of the LyondellBasell Sustainability Report.LyondellBasell, Tuesday, June 13, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from LyondellBasell on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: LyondellBasellWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/lyondellbasellEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: LyondellBasellView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/760943/LyondellBasell-2022-Sustainability-Report-Building-a-Circular-Economy]"

NL is a Norway-based company that is responsible for producing infrastructure for cross-border carbon dioxide (CO2) transportation and storage.CCS is required to lower emissions from the power and heat market in Europe. It diminishes CO2 discharge from hard-to-abate industries where the availability of substitutes is limited. The deal will allow GE and NL to work together to explore technical and logistical solutions to capture, transport and store CO2 which will be pivotal to establish a competent CCS supply chain. This agreement between the two companies aligns with GE’s goal to reduce carbon footprint from gas-fired facilities to supply flexible, reliable and cost-effective electricity for homes and businesses.In March 2023, GE entered into a joint development agreement (JDA) with the Canadian company, Svante, to develop and evaluate solid sorbent-based carbon capture technology for natural gas power generation applications. The agreement is a part of General Electric’s sustainability initiatives to drive energy transition by investing in crucial technologies like carbon capture, which can help significantly reduce emissions.Through the latest collaboration, Svante’s novel carbon capture filters made by coating solid adsorbents can be used in multiple applications to capture carbon dioxide emissions at refineries, cement, steel, aluminum, lime, boilers, pulp and paper industries. The technology can be used for point-source post-combustion carbon capture to prevent carbon dioxide emissions from reaching the atmosphere.General Electric Company Price General Electric Company PriceGeneral Electric Company price | General Electric Company QuoteStory continuesThe JDA between GE Gas Power and Svante will focus on the development and commercialization of novel solid sorbent technologies to decarbonize natural gas-fired turbines in a cost-effective and environment-friendly way.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderGE currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(NYSE:UNH) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:""UnitedHealth Group Incorporated is the leading health care franchise in the U.S., with more than $350 billion in annual revenue. Following relatively strong performance in 2022, shares corrected 10.1% during the first quarter, along with other managed-care companies, primarily on sector rotation. Despite solid fourth-quarter results with 12% year-over-year revenue growth, 19% EPS growth, and a conservative initial 2023 guidance that fell within its 12% to 15% long-term earnings growth goal, investors stepped to the sidelines on concerns about proposed changes to the Medicare audit program, preliminary 2024 Medicare Advantage (MA) rates, and the impact of Medicaid recertification. We believe UnitedHealth is the best-positioned managed-care player, with a leading franchise in MA, the market's fastest growing segment. We expect continued strong growth and profitability, driven by positive demographic trends, effective cost management through economies of scale, industry-leading technology investments, enhanced expertise in population health, and a growing portfolio of providers, all of which enables UnitedHealth to keep and effectively manage more of its health care spending in-house.""Story continuesAfrica Studio/Shutterstock.comOur calculations show that UnitedHealth Group Inc.

295,333aff39-6591-34dc-8775-db37da619a97,EL,2023-06-14,7 High-Risk Stocks That Could Skyrocket in the Next 12 Months,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-high-risk-stocks-could-000245169.html,1686182565,STORY,"['PYPL', 'PLAY', 'YOU', 'EL']","[With the labor market printing a much hotter-than-anticipated figure for the month of May, speculators may be emboldened to consider high-risk stocks to buy. Ever since the Covid-19 disaster (and even earlier), more than a few voices have sounded the alarm about a possible recession. However, time and again, the market keeps proving the naysayers wrong.Hearing the cries of wolf one too many times, it’s possible that at least some investors want to go in the opposite direction. Rather than electing defensive risk-off enterprises, they want to throw their chips at high potential risky stocks. Understandably, because so many fear a recession, going contrarian here might yield significant returns for the intrepid.At the same time, investors also need to be careful about overdoing the contrarian thesis. If the Federal Reserve decides to tame the inflationary pressure associated with the hot jobs print, this could hurt equities. Nevertheless, if you want to ride with the bulls, below are volatile stocks with high returns.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsClear Secure (YOU)a person turns a dial labeled ""RISK"" higher as a meter measuring ""Return"" maxes out. High-risk stocksSource: ShutterstockWhile biometric travel document verification service Clear Secure (NYSE:YOU) offers a fundamentally relevant business profile, on the charts, YOU represents one of the high-risk stocks to buy. On paper, it’s just not going to appeal to everyone. Since the beginning of this year, shares lost more than 12% of equity value. In the past one-year period, YOU dipped 15%. Since its public market debut in 2021, it collapsed over 49%.Despite these setbacks, contrarian bulls can potentially rely on the underlying phenomenon known as revenge travel. Basically, people who were tired of being stuck at home longed for the day when Covid-19-related restrictions would ease. So, when the mitigation protocols finally faded, people eagerly took that long-awaited vacation.Based on multiple sources, revenge travel continues to be a catalyst in this year as well. Therefore, Clear Secure’s specialty of getting people quickly through airport security lines should be supremely relevant. However, the main risk centers on the company’s lack of profitability. Still, analysts peg YOU as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $30.14, implying nearly 24% upside potential.Story continuesEstee Lauder (EL)Source: ShutterstockA multinational cosmetics firm, Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL) commands a massive presence in the beauty care segment. Currently, the company carries a market capitalization of nearly $66 billion. Unfortunately, the equities sector doesn’t seem to care much about its historical prominence. Since the beginning of this year, EL stock gave up more than 27% of value. In the trailing year, it’s down over 32%.Despite the troubles, EL may be one of the high-risk stocks to buy. To be upfront, the underlying enterprise doesn’t seem to offer an attractive value proposition. For example, the market prices EL at a forward multiple of 34.59, which is incredibly elevated. Also, EL trades at 4.2-times trailing sales.On the other hand, Estee Lauder is consistently profitable. Further, it posts a trailing-year net margin of 6.88%, beating out 72.69% of the competition. Also, its return on equity (ROE) clocks in at 18.79%, above 85.45% of its peers. With the return-to-office movement becoming more prominent, EL could see increased demand. Lastly, analysts peg EL as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target comes in at $245.86, implying almost 34% upside potential.Imax (IMAX)Two sets of blocks with the words ""risk"" and ""reward"" are placed on a seesaw with ""reward"" tipping downward.Source: ShutterstockA Canadian theater company specializing in advanced cameras and projection systems, Imax (NYSE:IMAX) makes a grand case for high potential risky stocks. On one hand, with the Covid-19 crisis forcing a reclusive lifestyle for the masses, businesses that specialized in high social contact suffered significantly. Plus, it’s not entirely clear whether Hollywood can comprehensively recover from the pandemic.On the other hand, with inflation raising the price of just about everything, Imax offers an entertainment value proposition. Basically, through its advanced projector systems, moviegoers can enjoy an experience that they wouldn’t be able to replicate anywhere else. And because other forms of entertainment – such as live concerts and sporting events – have become so expensive, Imax offers great bang for the buck. That’s what makes it one of the volatile stocks with high returns.Over the trailing year, IMAX has been all over the map, ultimately printing a gain of nearly 9%. However, this year, IMAX is up almost 28%. Thanks to the strong debut of the latest Spider-Man film franchise, more folks appear enthused about the box office. Thus, IMAX is one of the risky stocks with high potential.In closing, analysts peg shares as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target hits $24.88, implying over 32% upside potential.PayPal (PYPL)hand of businessman pulling out or placing wood block on the tower in modern office. plan and strategy in business.Source: ShutterstockOn paper, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) offers an incredibly relevant service. As a popular digital payments processor, PayPal already commanded a significant foothold in the broader financial technology (fintech) space. However, with the Covid-19 pandemic forcing even greater dependency on digitalization, PYPL seemed a no-brainer for high-risk stocks to buy.Unfortunately, it hasn’t been able to keep pace with bullish expectations. Since the January opener, PYPL slipped nearly 13%. Over the trailing one-year period, PYPL gave up nearly 27% of equity value. Much of the recent red ink came about because of PayPal’s first quarter of 2023 earnings report. Though the company beat expectations, the market fretted about its operating margins.Still, PYPL could be a solid candidate for high-risk, high-reward stocks. Financially, PayPal still sports a solid three-year revenue growth rate of 16.7%. This stat ranks better than slightly over 75% of companies listed in the credit services industry. As well, its book growth rate impresses at 7.4%. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg PYPL as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $96.83, implying nearly 49% upside potential.Dave &amp; Buster’s Entertainment (PLAY)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% UpsideSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comAt first glance, Dave &amp; Buster’s Entertainment (NASDAQ:PLAY) appears an especially treacherous example of high-risk stocks to buy. Since the Jan. opener, PLAY dipped nearly 5%. Fundamentally, the restaurant and entertainment business depends heavily on high-volume foot traffic. Unfortunately, with the remote work transition following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, Dave &amp; Buster’s attempted to spark momentum in its digital, off-store business.However, the work-from-home paradigm could be ending over time. An increasing number of companies have implemented at least a hybrid schedule, typically work three days in office and two at home. Eventually, with recession pressures rising, it wouldn’t be out of the question for companies to mandate a full return. In that case, PLAY could soar as one of the high potential risky stocks.To be fair, the pandemic imposed a sharp blow on Dave &amp; Buster’s financials. For example, its balance sheet technically appears distressed. On the positive side, the market prices PLAY at a forward multiple of 10.59. As a discount to projected earnings, PLAY ranks better than 64.22% than the competition.Looking to the Street, analysts peg PLAY as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target lands at $52.14, implying almost 55% upside potential.Sea (SE)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockEver since hitting a peak in Nov. 2021 – and subsequently collapsing in market value – tech conglomerate Sea (NYSE:SE) has long been a target for high-risk stocks to buy. At its zenith, SE on average traded hands above $350 per share. As of this writing, you can buy the stock for a little over $61. That’s a massive fall from grace. Nevertheless, those seeking a discount in the tech space might be attuned to the opportunity.Based in Singapore, Sea offers relevancies in fintech, e-commerce and gaming. While all three sectors enjoy massive addressable markets, the advantage to the enterprise is its geography. In 2022, the Southeast Asia internet economy reached a valuation of $194 billion. By 2025, the sector could be worth $330 billion, according to a Reuters report.To be sure, the impact of Covid-19, along with the global economic challenges such as blistering inflation negatively affected Southeast Asia’s market projections. Still, it wouldn’t be out of the question for the regional digital economy to hit $1 trillion by 2030 (or around that time). For now, you’ll just have to be satisfied with SE being one of the high-potential risky stocks. Analysts peg shares a strong buy with a $102.44 average price target, implying over 67% upside potential.Sibanye Stillwater (SBSW)Man holding stacks of money. Top millionaire-maker stocks to buySource: Epic Cure / ShutterstockOn the surface, Sibanye Stillwater (NYSE:SBSW) makes an intriguing case for high-risk stocks to buy. A precious metals miner based in resource-rich South Africa, Sibanye benefits from a geographic advantage. Not only that, worries about a recession along with the social instability that a downcycle may catalyze offers cynical relevance for gold. Given how much shares floundered, SBSW could be worth a gamble.On the other hand, there’s a reason why SBSW dropped nearly 33% of equity value since the January opener. In the trailing year, it slipped almost 42%. With issues such as labor disputes particularly pronounced for Sibanye, many investors have decided to jump ship. Nevertheless, the red ink makes SBSW look quite undervalued. For instance, the market prices SBSW at only a forward multiple of 5.46.Moreover, Sibanye mines other resources besides gold. Perhaps most notably, it’s a strong producer of palladium. Historically, Russia has been the world’s leader in palladium production. Obviously, that’s not a tree worth barking up right now, affording fortuitous pertinence to Sibanye. On a final note, analysts peg SBSW as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $14.50, implying over 99% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

We're really focused more on the entry level first time builder. So that would be a DR or a Meritage Homes, for instance. But it's a very interesting dynamic that's in the market right now. There is very little existing home supply as you alluded to, 2.8 months of existing home supply. The supply that's out there is old and it's generally at price points that the first time buyer is not interested in.On the flip side of the coin, you have the private builders which are 60% of the market, many of which are having problems getting land, getting labor, getting materials, and now getting financing. So while demand has certainly slowed, the demand that is out there is all being kind of channeled towards these public homebuilders that, oh, by the way, can offer financing. So no one's paying 7% now. They're paying 6%, they're paying 5 and 1/2%. So it's a really, really interesting opportunity for market share gains.Story continues- At the same time, John, aren't the publicly traded homebuilders still grappling with supply issues, labor issues, that part of the challenge?JOHN LOVALLO: 100%. I mean, supply chains are still not back to where they need to be, build cycles are elongated, materials, depending on the day, the materials are still hard to come by. Right now, it's transformers. So getting the communities actually electrified is the biggest hiccup.And I would even say go as far back as the actual development and entitlement of the land. Getting land actually zoned and ready to be billed upon and then ultimately built upon it is taking a lot longer than it has historically. So the whole process is delayed relative to how it's been in the past.- And so what should buyers expect with that still lingering in the home purchasing process now?JOHN LOVALLO: I think the market is still pretty competitive. And so on the existing home side, as I mentioned, there's just not much out there. So I think buyers that are looking for a home at this point are probably more inclined today than at any point in history to have to focus on a new home. And so this dynamic is sort of what's keeping home prices from falling. They've actually been very, very resilient which is a good thing for the overall home market and for the homebuilders in general. But it's a competitive market for sure.- One of the things that we've talked about regularly when it comes to new home construction is finding places to put them, right? Buying the land, getting the zoning, et cetera, et cetera. And I know that this is highly regional. So it's difficult to make sort of a national generalization. But what kinds of trends are we seeing there, especially given the tight supply? Have we seen sort of a loosening of the willingness to get these things built?JOHN LOVALLO: It's a great question. I mean, I think in certain markets, as you mentioned, it is a very market by market dynamic. In certain markets, it is easier. Texas and the markets throughout Texas is a great example, kind of a builder friendly environment. The same would be in Florida.And I think this is really important because if you think about a couple of things-- one-- kind of the flow of migration trends into kind of the Sunday Belt states-- that's where all the job growth is, that's where a lot of people are moving for the weather and for just kind of a different type of lifestyle, not to mention jobs, the first time buyer that's going into these markets is generally a little bit more willing to make concessions, meaning that they'll move a little further away from the city, they'll by a smaller footprint. These are the things that sort of help the math pencil in the market that is really a challenge from an affordability standpoint. So I think to your point, you're seeing-- at least for the public homebuilders that we cover, you're seeing very little sort of infill building, you're seeing them move out sort of to on the periphery of markets where there's open space and where they can develop these very large communities and, by the way, help the map pencil for the homebuyer.- Yeah. No, no, no, that's spot on. So where does this sit right now for the newest kind of cohort of homebuyers and entrance into the home markets? I'm speaking about millennials especially as there are now more millennial homeowners than there are those who don't own homes. And I'm now in the minority, I suppose, as that's kind of flipped on its head here. So are we going to expect to see a steady movement, a steady trickle of more millennial homeowners into homes if we continue to see some moderation perhaps on price even though we're still looking at a broader rate environment where that means that the home is going to be more expensive over time?JOHN LOVALLO: Yeah, we think so, right? I think to your point, this millennial buyer is reaching sort of prime home buying age-- so call it 30 to 35 years old-- and having life events. They're getting married, they're having children-- things that, by definition, necessitate more space. And we've certainly gone through a very bumpy market over the past 15 years or so.But the allure of home ownership has really not lost its luster and it is still sort of that American dream. And people want to move into homes and they're going to do what they can to make that happen. We're also in the midst of probably the largest generational wealth transfer in the history of the country, which is helping some of these first time buyers make down payments, make the affordability equation a little bit more palatable. So yes, the simple answer is that millennials and future generations are still going to want to buy homes, and they're out there right now looking pretty intently to do so.- John, let's bring you back to investors. Do you like all the homebuilders? Are there ones that are think are going to do particularly well in this environment?JOHN LOVALLO: So we think the group at large is well positioned, the public homebuilders that we cover for the market share dynamics that I had mentioned. But to your question, DR Horton and Meritage homes are kind of entry level first time focused home builders. We think that that's sort of where the juice in the market really still is. And that goes back to the need based buyer element that we just spoke to and the fact that there are a lot of folks that are reaching this prime homebuying age.So those are the two that we would kind of point to as being, in our view at least, best positioned from a price point standpoint. And then in terms of geographic footprint, most of the builders, as we previously discussed, are in those kind of sunshine states. So from a footprint standpoint, also very well positioned.- All right. Our thanks to John Lovallo who is the UBS US homebuilders building products equity research analyst. John, great to speak with you today.JOHN LOVALLO: Thanks for having me.]"

Southwest (LUV) is tailing behind in the airline rally with a still respectable one-month gain of 12%.There are likely two factors behind the airline stock propulsion.First, is the raw demand to travel at the moment — which appears to have been strong for Memorial Day weekend and now into July 4.MADRID, SPAIN - 2023/06/10: An Airbus A319 of Iberia comercial flight flies over the skyscrapers of Madrid's skyline, known as the ""Four Towers Business Area"", after departing from Adolfo Suarez Madrid Barajas Airport.

""Stronger profitability is supported by several positive developments. China lifted COVID-19 restrictions earlier in the year than anticipated.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the top 5 most profitable airlines in the world.Even though the airline industry has arguably been the most integral in improving globalization across the last several decades, and even though it has a reputation of being too expensive, it is actually the industry with the lowest profit margins. Because of this, the airline industry is unable to adapt to downward pricing pressure or economic instability, as witnessed during the pandemic.When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, most countries forbade travel and went into lockdowns, severely impacting the hospitality industry, with airlines being particularly hard hit. In fact, from 2020 to 2022, when the worst of the pandemic passed over, the airline industry is estimated to have lost more than $200 billion, resulting in tens of thousands of job cuts even among the most profitable airlines in the world.Top 20 most profitable airlines in the worldPhoto by emiel molenaar on UnsplashHowever, 2022 saw the resumption of global travel as most countries removed restrictions which resulted in pent-up demand being released across summer and airlines recording one of the most profitable quarters in airline history in Q2 2022. Even though the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing year-plus war result in airspace issues, airlines have managed to persevere and the outlook is quite bright.Of course, you can't discuss 2022 without discussing the economic uncertainty that dominated the year, resulting in a horrendous year for the stock markets, with rising inflation and aggressive interest rate hikes combined with an impending recession resulting in a negative mindset for investors. Despite this, airlines recorded the highest price per mile in history, and even though volume hasn't reverted to pre-pandemic levels, the rise in prices has resulted in higher revenues for airlines with many returning to profitability after a couple of years of losses, which is great news for the most profitable airlines in the world.Story continuesAccording to CNN, Europe, one of the premier destinations for tourists, is already seeing high levels of tourism, even though summer has barely started. This is only going to get worse as schools start breaking for summer and more and more tourists start traveling, with tour operators selling out months in advance. According to Allianz Partners, Americans traveling to Europe will increase by 55% as compared to 2022, with Italian cities dominating the most popular destination lists. Even though volumes are increasing significantly, prices don't seem to be coming down, which might lead to the richest airlines in the world simply getting richer.Many of the most profitable airlines in the world are also well-known for the level of service provided, and are often counted among the best airlines in the world based on assessments by various magazines and websites, with the World Airline Awards being considered the most prestigious. Some of the best airlines based on various categories include Singapore Airlines and Qatar Airways.A large part of an airline's profitability depends on the routes it flies. Even at a time when profits have been under pressure, some routes will still earn airlines hundreds of millions of dollars, with the most lucrative route in the world being worth over $1 billion, according to Forbes. The top 10 most lucrative routes earn revenues of over $6 billion between 2018 and 2019, with British Airways earning $1.16 billion on its route between London and New York. In fact, half of the most profitable routes are based from London's Heathrow Airport, one of the most popular airports in the world in terms of number of passengers. Recently, the airport saw its busiest month since the pandemic started, and this is only bound to increase in the next few months as summer truly grips Europe.However, one thing that investors in airline stocks are concerned about is the industry's contribution to climate change, with many governments emphasizing and preferring travel by train. In fact, France recently banned short-haul flights where a train journey of 2.5 hours would suffice. While many believe this is just lip service and doesn't impact climate change significantly, other similar bans could follow, which will be disastrous for European airlines.While short-haul flights being banned in the future is a possible negative outcome in the future, the rest does seem quite positive. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), net profits of the airline industry are expected to double to nearly $10 billion in 2023, at a net margin of just over 1.2% while operating profits are expected to exceed $22.4 billion in the same time period. The current expectation is that over 4.35 billion people will fly in 2023, much closer to 4.54 billion people who flew in 2019. Further, revenues are expected to cross $800 billion in 2023 for the first time since the pandemic hit, all of which shows that the airline industry is well on its way to recovery. IATA's Director General stated ""“Airline financial performance in 2023 is beating expectations. Stronger profitability is supported by several positive developments. China lifted COVID-19 restrictions earlier in the year than anticipated. Cargo revenues remain above pre-pandemic levels even though volumes have not. And, on the cost side, there is some relief. Jet fuel prices, although still high, have moderated over the first half of the year.” This has also resulted in a much more positive outlook by Delta's CEO Ed Bastian who said in the company's Q1 2023 earnings call ""With solid first quarter performance and visibility into the strength of summer travel demand, we are confident in our full year guidance for revenue growth of 15% to 20% year-over-year, earnings of $5 to $6 per share and free cash flow of over $2 billion, the three main guideposts we shared with you last December. For the June quarter, we expect to deliver the highest quarterly revenue in our history, a 15% operating margin and EPS of $2 to $2.25 a share. Our forecast operating profit of $2 billion matches Q2 of 2019, demonstrating that the earnings power of this franchise is intact.""However, despite the recovery posted by airlines, it is important to note that even some of the biggest airlines in the world have still not returned to profitability. This is why, some of the most profitable airlines in the world are still currently making losses, though if trends continue, that will not be the case for much longer. To determine our listing, we ascertained the 25 biggest airlines in the world through Fortune 500 and annual reports of each airline, and ranked them based on either their TTM net profit from continuing operations, or net profit as determined through their annual report, especially for airlines that aren't listed.

The Electrical Global segment consists of the same activities as mentioned in Electrical Americas but are primarily produced and sold outside of North and South America.Vehicle segment includes the company's erstwhile truck and automotive segments. The truck segment designs, manufactures and markets powertrain systems and other components for commercial vehicle markets. Aerospace segment is a supplier of aerospace fuel, hydraulic and pneumatic systems for commercial and military use.The eMobility segment focus on two technologies within electrical vehicles, namely Power electronics &amp; conversion and Power distribution &amp; circuit protection.Eaton's segments — Electrical Americas, Electrical Global, Aerospace, Vehicle and eMobility — contributed 41%, 28.2%, 14.6%, 13.6% and 2.6%, respectively to 2022 revenues.Story continuesBottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Eaton ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in June 2013 would be worth $2,984.10, or a 198.41% gain, as of June 13, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 169.08% and the price of gold went up 36% over the same time frame.Analysts are anticipating more upside for ETN.Eaton’s ongoing research and development investments allowed it to develop products for providing efficient power management solutions to customers. Eaton will benefit from the improving end market conditions and contribution from its organic assets assisting it to retain a strong market position. ETN is expanding via acquisitions and rising backlogs further boost its performance. Eaton's strategy to manufacture in the zone of sale has helped it reduce costs. Its shares have outperformed the industry in the past year. Our model projects total revenues to increase in 2023-2025 period. Yet, ETN’s global operations expose it to unpredictable currency translation, changes in tax rates, and security breaches, which might impact operations. The shortage of raw materials and supplier insolvencies might impact production and operations.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 11.55%, and there have been 7 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Aflac (NYSE:AFL). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. See our latest analysis for Aflac How Quickly Is Aflac Increasing Earnings Per Share?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. It certainly is nice to see that Aflac has managed to grow EPS by 22% per year over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Our analysis has highlighted that Aflac's revenue from operations did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. Aflac's EBIT margins are flat but, worryingly, its revenue is actually down. Suffice it to say that is not a great sign of growth.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Aflac's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Story continuesAre Aflac Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$42b company like Aflac. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$343m. This comes in at 0.8% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Should You Add Aflac To Your Watchlist?You can't deny that Aflac has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Aflac's continuing strength. The growth and insider confidence is looked upon well and so it's worthwhile to investigate further with a view to discern the stock's true value. Even so, be aware that  Aflac is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...Although Aflac certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see insider buying, then this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying, could be exactly what you're looking for.Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.Have feedback on this article?

Unfortunately, that means many stocks have performed poorly vs. the indices. On the plus side though, that means there are many names that still have plenty of upside. Specifically, we can look for the best blue-chip stocks for high returns.Investors can look for high yield blue-chip stocks or they can look for blue-chip stocks with high potential. They can also look in between for a more balanced approach. Either way, it’s pretty surprising how many high-quality stocks are available for investors to choose from.A blue-chip stock is easy to define. Put simply, investors are looking for a high-quality company that has a strong business and relatively consistent earnings and cash flow. Ideally, it will also pay a rising dividend and have a history of solid stock performance.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSo let’s dig in and look for the best blue-chip stocks with high potential.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)A red Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.comJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a high-quality company and a name that investors almost always like to buy the dip in. It’s one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy over the long haul, even as it has appreciated a considerable amount.Now though, the stock has stumbled. Shares are down more than 15% from the high, a level that was hit in April 2022. With that information, you can deduce a couple of notable points.First, when the market was undergoing significant volatility, investors had sought, and found, safety in J&amp;J as shares hit new all-time highs. Second, the stock is clearly out of favor now, as it was down almost 20% from those highs at its recent low.So where does that leave us?Investors now have the opportunity to pay under 15 times this year’s earnings, which are forecast to grow in the mid-single-digits. Alongside those quality earnings, J&amp;J stock also pays a dividend yield of around 3%. That dividend has been raised for 61 consecutive years.Story continuesBetween it all, the stock is a good buy-and-hold name to tuck away.Disney (DIS)Source: ShutterstockDisney (NYSE:DIS) investors only wish the stock paid a dividend yield like J&amp;J, or was only down 15% from the all-time high. While life has felt tough for Johnson &amp; Johnson shareholders, it’s been truly difficult for Disney bulls.Even though the stock has rallied 6% amid a five-day win streak, shares are still down a whopping 55% from the all-time high. It’s been brutal.The firm even brought back former CEO Bob Iger to run the ship and navigate a difficult turnaround. Sparring with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis doesn’t seem to be helping matters either.Even worse, Disney stock is not exactly cheap. Although analysts do expect growth this year and next year, the stock trades at 23 times this year’s consensus earnings forecast. Further, investors worried about a recession sure aren’t jumping out of their seats to buy this name.That all said, Disney is the king of entertainment. It dominates in everything from theme parks and cruises, to the studios and streaming. My personal take? When looking for blue-chip stocks with high potential, go with the high-quality names with strong brandsPepsiCo (PEP)Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.Source: FotograFFF / ShutterstockLast but not least, an interesting opportunity is popping up with PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP). This has been one of the top performing blue-chip stocks as of late.PepsiCo made a nice push to all-time highs, hitting $196.88 on May 15. It was up about 9% on the year and up 17% from the 2023 low. However, shares have quickly shed their value since those highs.Perhaps this one has further to sink, but don’t forget, PepsiCo absolutely dominates the grocery store. Everything from Pepsi to Gatorade to Tropicana is owned by the company, as is Sabra hummus, Stacy’s Snacks, Doritos, Lays and many others.Analysts expect mid-single-digit revenue growth this year and next year, along with roughly 8% earnings growth in both years. That goes along with its near 3% dividend yield, which has not only been paid but has been raised in 51 consecutive years.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in JNJ.

These sectors have consistently outperformed the market in 2022 as consumers tend to maintain their spending on these essential products regardless of economic conditions.In times of economic hardship, defensive stocks are favored by investors for their resilience. These stocks are less vulnerable to the broader economic downturn and offer a sense of stability. As interest rates rise and the economy slows, investors are likely to turn to defensive stocks as a protective measure for their portfolios.That said, here are three defensive stocks that investors may want to consider for their portfolios.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPepsiCo (PEP)Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.Source: FotograFFF / ShutterstockPepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) has emerged as a successful investment choice, delivering positive returns to shareholders. Despite facing significant cost pressures, the company implemented a successful pricing strategy that safeguarded profit margins without negatively impacting demand. Moreover, PepsiCo recently provided an optimistic outlook for 2023, raising expectations for sales and earnings performance.Investors had plenty of reasons to be pleased with Pepsi’s recent sales update. Organic revenue growth remained strong at 14%, matching the impressive gains seen in 2022. Despite a slight decline in overall sales volumes, the acceptance of higher prices on snacks and beverages contributed to positive performance. PepsiCo reported a 3% decrease in food segment volume and a 1% increase in beverage volume. CEO Ramon Laguarta expressed satisfaction with the company’s performance and business momentum, highlighting the resilience of its categories and geographies.PepsiCo’s acquisition of Frito-Lay has been instrumental in driving the company’s upward trajectory.

As Quest transitions to the post-pandemic period, we anticipate that there will be additional impacts and we will remain focused on sustainability considerations.Key elements driving our environmental sustainability programPollution prevention: We will minimize waste in our operations through process improvements and focused recycling effortsEnergy efficiency, sourcing and use: We will include renewable energy in our sourcing of energy when cost-effective and feasible. We will use energy efficiently and make efforts to improve efficiency through technology and innovationFleet conservation: We will utilize technology to improve our ground fleet efficiency, thereby reducing carbon fuel use and associated greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)Strategic sourcing: We will take environmental impact into consideration when making decisions about the materials and services we purchase in order to reduce consumption of natural resources and decrease waste and emissionsOur Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) department leads the development of our strategic environmental plans and GreenQuest, working closely with regional teams to identify opportunities for improvements and to lead local projects. We maintain programs to monitor the environmental impacts at our major laboratories and audit environmental management. We train key staff in environmental management, covering handling of chemicals, pathogens, and waste reduction, and include localized training in the specifics of each facility. We continue to pursue ISO 14001 and ISO 22301 certifications in 2022 for our San Juan Capistrano laboratory, and we are also pursuing LEED-equivalent certification for our new Clifton laboratory.Climate actionIn 2021, we started the process of analyzing climate risks and opportunities for our business based on the recommendations of the Task Force for Climate Related Financial Disclosures. We created teams to review our climate risks and opportunities, as well as our water use and waste. We also initiated efforts to improve measurement of our GHG emissions, with a focus on Scopes 1 and 2.Story continuesData in the following tables include estimates. US EIA's Commercial Building Energy Consumption Surveys (CBECS) data and EPA's Emissions &amp; Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGrid) were used to estimate utility usage and related emissions factors for small locations when not available from other sources. These data cover 100% of our operations in North America and Latin America.To date, our efforts to reduce our GHG emissions have included energy efficiency measures at our facilities, such as laboratory testing platform consolidations, LED lighting retrofits, purchase of green power, and route optimization, including the following key accomplishments in 2021:Completed the consolidation of the majority of our East Region lab operations into our Clifton, NJ labLED lighting retrofits which we believe will reduce our overall electricity consumption by 59% in our Marlborough cytology labReduction of 1.2M miles in driving through route optimization projects for our fleet, which we believe will result in reduction of 424 metric tons of CO2 emissionsQuest continues to qualify for the EPA's Green Power Partnership by exceeding 7% renewable energy use.Fleet conservation is another key aspect of our efforts to reduce GHG emissions, which we estimate resulted in a reduction of 1.8 billion pounds of CO2 and the elimination of more than 1,100 surplus vehicles in the last 15 years.Electric vehiclesWe are considering electric vehicles for our fleet. In 2021, we began the development of an electric vehicle pilot project. At our lab in Clifton, NJ, we installed charging stations in the public area of the garage. We are building out charging infrastructure at out Marlborough, MA lab and plan to begin infrastructure design and construction at remaining pilot locations.A Gold Rating in IndiaOur office facilities in India achieved a Gold Rating from the India Green Building Council, which encourages green concepts and techniques to address national priorities in India. The rating considers site and facility management, water efficiency, energy efficiency, health and comfort, and innovation.Waste reductionQuest works with suppliers to find products and processes that can minimize waste across our operations. In 2021, several of our facilities completed new waste management projects which we believe reduced hazardous waste or landfill waste, such as:Our Las Vegas facility eliminated pH wastewater disposal, thus reducing hazardous waste generation by 285,000 lbsAt our West Hills, CA and Sacramento, CA labs, all paperwork was required to be recycled, reducing our future annual landfill waste by 210,000 lbsCleveland HeartLab™ began recycling and reusing Styrofoam shipping containersSpecimen cup and stool container redesigns, among other changes, reduced Quest's plastic waste by 105 tons in 2021, for a total of 407 tons saved since the project initiated in 2018Reduced the amount of paper waste in our PSCs by an additional 270 tons in 2021, for a total of 546 tons saved since the project initiated in 2018Water reductionOur facilities continue to look for creative ways to reduce water consumption. Overall, in 2021, we reduced our water consumption by 16%.In California, several of our logistics hubs transitioned to waterless fleet vehicle washing, which we estimate will save 32,490 gallons of water per yearAt the Las Vegas facility, a 310 linear-foot planter was removed to reduce water used to maintain plants, which we estimate will save 164,250 gallons of waterAt Cleveland HeartLab, all toilets are now fitted with water-saving flushersIn the Dallas lab facility, all urinals were replaced with flushless unitsOccupational health and safetyThe Quest Diagnostics EHS team believes our critical business objectives include workplace safety; the health of our em ployees, contractors, and others working in our facilities; and the protection of the environment. We are committed to proactively managing workplace safety to eliminate risks and hazards as well as ensure regulatory compliance. In 2021, we invested in safety data management software which will allow us to improve performance, gain insight, and drive compliance. Our safety management system aligns with ISO 45001 and ANSI Z10 elements by:Creating regional/business unit strategic plans that review current metrics, evaluate and develop EHS programs, identify opportunities to reduce workplace injuries, address trends, mitigate risks, generate action plans for identified risks and professional development of our EHS professionalsPeriodically conducting internal audits at all facilities • Encouraging employee engagement in safety committeesRequiring employees to review and acknowledge job hazard analysesProviding monthly job-specific safety training to employees through the company's learning management systemRead moreQuest Diagnostics , Tuesday, June 13, 2023, Press release pictureSOURCE: Quest DiagnosticsView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/760951/Environmental-Sustainability-Drives-Operational-Excellence]"
