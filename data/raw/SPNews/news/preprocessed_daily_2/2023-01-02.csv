Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Nucor's (NYSE:NUE) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Nucor is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.43 = US$12b ÷ (US$32b - US$4.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).So, Nucor has an ROCE of 43%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 18% earned by companies in a similar industry. Check out our latest analysis for Nucor roceIn the above chart we have measured Nucor's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Nucor.The Trend Of ROCENucor is displaying some positive trends. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 43%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 112%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Nucor thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.In Conclusion...All in all, it's terrific to see that Nucor is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.Story continuesNucor does come with some risks though, we found 2 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those doesn't sit too well with us...If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

It comes in response to the country's invasion of Ukraine, and will affect refined petroleum products such as diesel.It follows an EU embargo on seaborne imports of Russian crude effective December 5 and a G7 move to cap the country's oil at $60 a barrel. Both measures aim to blunt Moscow's export revenue while still keeping Russian crude flowing through global markets to prevent a supply shock.According to analysts, the next round of sanctions — combined with a rebound in Chinese demand as zero-Covid restrictions ease — will likely squeeze oil markets and push prices higher.Russian crude output could fall by 1 million barrels a day""We expect the European ban on seaborne Russian crude and refined products (to come into force on February 5) to result in a drop of Russian production of at least 1 million barrels per day in 2023, with Russia having difficulties in finding alternative markets,"" said Giovanni Staunovo, a commodity analyst at UBS Global Wealth Management.Indeed, Russia has threatened it would slash production by up to 700,000 barrels a day in retaliation to the G7 price cap, suggesting another potential hit to the country's oil output.The nation has been rerouting increasing volumes of its oil to India and China amid rising political tensions with Europe, one of its biggest markets, due to the war in Ukraine. In the week leading up to December 9, Moscow sent 89% of its crude, amounting to about 3 million barrels a day, to Asia.Story continuesBut shipments to Asia are now proving more difficult as European sanctions make it tougher for traders to find enough insured vessels to transport Russian crude.According to Rystad Energy, however, the risk of a sharp decline in Russian crude production was more acute in mid-2022, when global supplies were tighter.""As long as US shale performs and delivers growth, we see the market moving towards a more normal equilibrium,"" Louise Dickson, a senior analyst at Rystad Energy told Insider.Crude prices could climb past $100 a barrelWith global supplies expected to get squeezed, crude prices will likely soar past $100 a barrel next year, according to Saxo Bank's Ole Hansen and UBS Global Wealth's Staunovo.""The embargo on seaborne crude from now and fuel products from February will likely have a price-supportive impact on markets,"" said Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo.

As path to profitability is the topic on Bowen Coking Coal's investors mind, we've decided to gauge market sentiment. We've put together a brief outline of industry analyst expectations for the company, its year of breakeven and its implied growth rate. View our latest analysis for Bowen Coking Coal According to the 2 industry analysts covering Bowen Coking Coal, the consensus is that breakeven is near. They anticipate the company to incur a final loss in 2022, before generating positive profits of AU$127m in 2023. The company is therefore projected to breakeven around a year from now or less! At what rate will the company have to grow in order to realise the consensus estimates forecasting breakeven in under 12 months? Using a line of best fit, we calculated an average annual growth rate of 16%, which is relatively reasonable. However, if this rate turns out to be too buoyant, the company may become profitable later than analysts predict.earnings-per-share-growthGiven this is a high-level overview, we won’t go into details of Bowen Coking Coal's upcoming projects, though, keep in mind that by and large metals and mining companies, depending on the stage of operation and metals mined, have irregular periods of cash flow. This means, a double-digit growth rate is not abnormal as the company is beginning to reap the benefits of earlier investments.Before we wrap up, there’s one issue worth mentioning. Bowen Coking Coal currently has a relatively high level of debt. Generally, the rule of thumb is debt shouldn’t exceed 40% of your equity, which in Bowen Coking Coal's case is 50%.

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 63% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Morgan Stanley. Check out our latest analysis for Morgan Stanley ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Morgan Stanley?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Morgan Stanley. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Morgan Stanley's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Morgan Stanley. Our data shows that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 22% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.2% and 6.7%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.We did some more digging and found that 7 of the top shareholders account for roughly 51% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.Story continuesWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Morgan StanleyWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Morgan Stanley in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$375m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 14% stake in Morgan Stanley. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 22% of the Morgan Stanley shares on issue. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for Morgan Stanley  you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

14,d1efeb1c-8a10-3109-b811-5ad4fab75158,FE,2023-01-02,Can the North Sea become Europe’s new economic powerhouse?,The Economist,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/north-sea-become-europe-economic-174628245.html,1672595188,STORY,['NG=F'],"[PICTURE A MECCANO set, but one made for gods. Blades as long as Big Ben is tall, rotors and tower sections the size of school buildings, shafts and generators so heavy they must be rotated every 20 minutes so as not to be crushed by their own weight: all these parts are strewn across an area the size of 150 football pitches. Clicked together, they form edifices rivalling the Eiffel Tower, except more useful—wind turbines to be planted somewhere in the North Sea.Welcome to Esbjerg, the hub of Europe’s offshore-wind industry. Two-thirds of the turbines currently spinning off its coast, enough to power 40m European homes, were put together in the Danish port town of 72,000. And Esbjerg’s gods have only started tinkering. The city’s port operator plans to nearly triple capacity to handle wind projects by 2026. Local engineering firms that once catered chiefly to the fossil-fuel industry now supply the windpower industry instead. Meta has bought 212 hectares of farmland outside Esbjerg to build a renewables-powered data centre for its social networks. Out on the sea, cables that will ferry 30% of the international data traffic into Norway are being laid down. Esbjerg’s mayor has travelled as far as Vietnam and Washington, DC to share its success story.With a dose of strategic thinking, and a bit of luck, a constellation of Esbjergs could combine and scale up into a new North Sea economy. This would help Europe achieve its ambitious climate goals and rebalance its energy sources away from countries ruled by tyrants such as Russia’s Vladimir Putin. Its newly minted corporate champions could offer Europe’s best, and perhaps last, chance to stay globally relevant. And it could alter the continent’s political and economic balance by creating an alternative to the sputtering Franco-German engine.The North Sea has always been economically important. Bordered by six European countries—Belgium, Britain, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Norway—it is where many important shipping routes intersect. Its strong tides, which sweep nutrients to its shallow seabed, are a boon for fishermen. In the 20th century oil and gas were discovered beneath the seabed. At their peak in the 1990s Britain and Norway, the two largest North Sea producers, together cranked out 6m barrels a day, half as much again as the United Arab Emirates does today. One Scottish field, Brent, lent its name to the global price benchmark. Now as that bounty runs out—and demand for what remains dwindles because of growing concerns about climate change—the turbulent body of water is finding lucrative new uses.Story continuesSpin doctrineThe biggest bet is on a resource of which the sea has an infinite amount—awful weather. With average wind speeds of ten metres per second, the basin is one of the gustiest in the world. The day your correspondent visited Esbjerg speeds were twice that, enough to push the wholesale price of electricity down to nearly zero. The North Sea floor is mostly soft, which makes it easier to affix turbines to the seabed (the floating kind have yet to be deployed at scale anywhere in the world). It is also typically no more than 90 metres deep, which allows wind farms to be placed farther away from the coast, where winds are more consistent. Ed Northam of Macquarie Group, an investment firm with stakes in 40% of all British offshore wind farms in operation, says his offshore turbines work at up to 60% of capacity, compared with the 30-40% that is typical onshore.In 2022 North Sea countries auctioned off 25 gigawatts (GW) in capacity, making it the busiest year by far. Nearly 30GW-worth of tenders have already been scheduled for the next three years. Yearly new connections are expected to grow from under 4GW today to more than 10GW by the late 2020s. At a meeting in Esbjerg in May the European Commission and four countries bordering the North Sea agreed to install 150GW of windpower by 2050, five times Europe’s and three times the world’s current total. In September this group and another five countries raised the number to 260GW, equivalent to 24,000 of today’s largest turbines.This ambition is made possible by wind’s version of Moore’s law, which described the exponential rise in computing power. Three decades ago the world’s first offshore wind farm—Vindeby in Denmark, made up of 11 turbines—had a total capacity of five megawatts (MW). Today a single turbine can generate 14MW, and one farm may contain more than 100 of them. More robust cables and transformers at sea to convert windpower from alternating into direct current, which can travel over long distances without big losses, enable more electricity to be generated farther away.The result is that several wind farms being installed now surpass 1GW in capacity, the typical output of a nuclear plant. The Dogger Bank wind farm, located between 130km and 200km off the British coast and due to start operating in the summer of 2023, will clock in at a record 3.6GW at full capacity in 2026. Economies of scale are driving down costs, making offshore wind competitive with other sources of power. In July Britain awarded contracts to five projects, including Dogger Bank, at a price of £37 ($44) per megawatt-hour—less than a sixth of the country’s wholesale electricity price in December.The awful weather is not always a boon: its vagaries can also stress the grid. Helpfully, technology and falling costs are allowing windpower operators to combat the elements. One way to do this is with more interconnections, first between the farms and land—today most wind farms have one link to the shore, which is inefficient—then among the farms themselves. Half of the 3GW to be tendered by Norway will have the option to create links to more countries. Phil Sandy of National Grid, which runs Britain’s power infrastructure, predicts a future of complex undersea grids similar to that on land.Another way to manage the variability of windpower is to use it to split water molecules to produce “green” fuels, such as hydrogen and ammonia. In May the European Commission and heavy-industry bosses pledged a ten-fold increase of EU manufacturing capacity for electrolysers, which do the splitting, by 2025. This would allow it to produce 10m tonnes of green fuels by 2030. The commission has also proposed a “hydrogen bank”, capitalised with €3bn ($3.2bn), to help finance the projects.Investors are giddy. In August Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP), a private-equity firm, said it had raised €3bn for a fund that will invest solely in hydrogen assets. A dozen projects have been announced in Europe; the three largest together amount to 20GW of green power. Topsoe, a Danish firm that provides technology for such ventures, says its orders add up to 86GW.Eventually the North Sea’s power system could take the form of an archipelago of “energy islands” that host wind-farm repair staff, aggregate electricity and produce hydrogen in bulk, to be transported onshore by ship or pipeline. As many as ten such schemes are being considered, according to SINTEF, a research firm. North Sea Energy Island, an artificial atoll 100km off the Danish coast, is due to be tendered in 2023. It will serve as a hub for ten surrounding wind farms, with links to neighbouring countries.One bidder, a joint venture between Orsted, a Danish offshore wind developer that is the world’s largest, and ATP, a local $150bn pension fund, envisages a modular design, with components made onshore and assembled at sea. “We expect it to still be functional in 100 years’ time,” says Brendan Bradley of Arup, an engineering firm that is advising the bid. Thomas Dalsgaard of CIP, which is part of a rival consortium, reckons that producing green fuels offshore will not only help reduce pressure on grids but also save money: hydrogen pipelines are one-fifth the cost of high-capacity power-transmission lines.Grids unlockedThere is more to the new North Sea economy than the energy sector. For electricity and hydrogen will not be the only things to be coursing across the North Sea floor. So will carbon dioxide. Some industries, such as cement-making or chemicals, are hard or impossible to decarbonise. But their CO2 can be collected and pumped into depleted gasfields in the North Sea. Such carbon capture and storage (CCS) used to seem an unappealing way to fight climate change, because of its high cost and unpopularity among environmentalists, who worry it would prolong the life of fossil fuels. Now, as with wind, the costs are falling, political resistance easing and projects multiplying.One seeking approval in Rotterdam, called Porthos, would connect Europe’s biggest port via a pipeline to a compressor station, and then out to an empty offshore gasfield. Although a court recently delayed its start, the project has already received the green light from Dutch regulators. Once operational, it would take in about 2.5m tonnes of CO2 annually for 15 years, nearly 2% of Dutch carbon emissions. The port of Amsterdam is planning something similar. Farther north, near the Norwegian city of Bergen, Equinor, an energy company, and its partners have already finished drilling operations for a CO2 injection well as part of a project called Northern Lights. According to Guloren Turan of the Global CCS Institute, a think-tank, Europe now has more than 70 such facilities in various stages of development.The last valuable product increasingly criss-crossing the North Sea is information. If you follow one of the newer transatlantic submarine data cables that land in Esbjerg, called Havfrue, and then turn right at a fork in the middle of the North Sea, you end up in Kristiansand, a city in southern Norway. It is the home of N01 Campus, the “world’s largest data-centre campus powered by 100% green energy”, according to its owner, Bulk Infrastructure. “We want to build a platform for sustainable digital services,” says Peder Naerbo, the firm’s founder.North Sea countries are an excellent place to store and process data. Low electricity prices make for cheaper number-crunching, which is energy-intensive. A cold climate means data centres can be cooled just by circulating outside air instead of using costly cooling systems. The region boasts a highly skilled workforce, stable institutions and some of the world’s most enlightened data laws. Latency, the time it takes to move data in and out of the computing clouds, is becoming less of a problem as the technology improves, so digital workloads can be processed in ever more far-flung facilities. And data centres are hitting limits elsewhere in Europe. In 2021 Irish data centres and other digital uses consumed 17% of the country’s power. To prevent blackouts, EirGrid, a state-owned Irish utility, will no longer supply electricity to new server farms.According to TeleGeography, a data provider, 13 new cables have been installed in the North Sea since 2020, compared with five in all of the 2010s. Data centres, too, are springing up, as big cloud providers vow to decarbonise their supply chains. Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure, the two largest cloud providers, have built server farms in the Nordics. Meta has its plot outside Esbjerg. Older industries are also moving more of their computing north. Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen have computers sitting in former mines in Norway; these simulate wind-tunnel and crash tests for their cars. On average, estimates Altman Solon, a consultancy, demand for data centres in the Nordics will grow by 17% a year until the end of the decade.Go north, old industrialistMore European economic activity could be drawn north. “Abundance of energy tends to attract industry,” says Nikolaus Wolf, an economic historian at Humboldt University in Berlin. That is what happened in the early 19th century, when abundant hydropower helped attract the cotton industry to Lancashire. Mr Wolf and Nicholas Crafts of the University of Warwick calculate that a 10% decline in Lancashire’s hydropower would have led to a 10% decline in textile employment by 1838 in key places.Energy is easier to distribute via grids and pipelines today than it was in the Industrial Revolution, and existing industrial centres across Europe exert their own pull. Transplanting cement-making kilns to North Sea shores would mean transporting limestone to them and cement back to customers, making the process uneconomical (and, until the advent of zero-emissions lorries, climate-unfriendly). Giant steam crackers, which split hydrocarbons into smaller molecules at chemical factories, will not be moving north soon, either: they are too big an investment, too integrated in existing supply chains, and already in the process of being electrified.But Mr Wolf’s principle still holds for some industries—and may benefit other northerly locations not directly on the North Sea. In Narvik, farther north on the Norwegian Sea, Aker Horizons, a firm that invests in renewable energy, wants to establish a green industrial hub powered by offshore wind. In Boden, a Swedish town near the eastern coast of the Scandinavian Peninsula, H2 Green Steel is erecting a new steel mill, Europe’s first in half a century. The factory will run not on coal or natural gas but on green hydrogen, created in one of the world’s largest electrolysis plants using onshore wind and hydroelectric power.Besides exporting steel, H2 Green Steel hopes to export its hydrogen and sponge iron, an intermediate product that has already taken in much of the energy needed in the steelmaking process. This would amount to splitting the steel industry in two, explains Henrik Henriksson, the firm’s chief executive. The energy-intensive bits of the process would migrate to where they can be done most efficiently: right next to the sources of renewable energy. The more labour- and knowledge-intensive parts could remain in Europe’s steelmaking heartlands like the Ruhr valley.In Wilhelmshaven, a German city on the North Sea, Uniper, a state-owned energy company, has just completed Germany’s first terminal for imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG), to replace some of the Russian gas no longer flowing through pipelines from Siberia. The firm is planning to erect crackers to produce hydrogen from ammonia next to the LNG terminal. In another corner of the port, close to a decommissioned coal plant, Uniper will build its own hydrogen plant and provide plenty of space for energy-hungry businesses. “Wilhelmshaven will play an important role as the place where green energy comes onshore,” says Holger Kreetz, who is in charge of managing Uniper’s assets.Other companies flocking north include manufacturers of electric-vehicle batteries, which also require lots of energy to make, and producers of wind turbines, which have suffered from recent supply-chain snarls. Vestas, the world’s biggest turbine-maker, is closing a factory in China and will open one in Poland, in part to be close to a new wind farm on the Baltic Sea.As with all such shifts, some see problems. Renewable energy will be even cheaper elsewhere, warns Christer Tryggestad of McKinsey, another consultancy. Rather than investing in and around the North Sea, firms could move to sun-kissed places such as the Middle East or Spain. Not everyone is convinced that the EU can meet its ambitious goals to ramp up the production of offshore windpower. Vestas and its fellow turbine-makers are already complaining bitterly that permits for new wind parks can take a decade or more to secure. The offshore-wind-services firms warn that they may soon run out of people and machinery to keep customers happy.The last obstacle comes from across the Atlantic. President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act includes $370bn in subsidies and tax credits for climate-friendly products and services, so long as they are made in America. The EU worries that the handouts will lure investors away from its shores. The bloc is looking into whether the law breaches international trade rules.If these problems can be overcome, the new North Sea economy’s impact on the continent will be momentous. As Europe’s economic epicentre moves north, so will its political one, predicts Frank Peter of Agora Energiewende, a German think-tank. This could shift the balance of power within littoral countries. Coastal Bremen, one of Germany’s poorest states, could gain clout at the expense of rich but landlocked Bavaria. At the European level, France and Germany, whose industrial might underpinned the European Coal and Steel Community, the EU’s forebear, may lose some influence to a new bloc led by Denmark, the Netherlands and, outside the EU, Britain and Norway. The French and Bavarians may bristle at the idea of a de facto Windpower and Hydrogen Community centred on the North Sea. But it would give Europe as a whole a much-needed economic and geopolitical boost.© 2023 The Economist Newspaper Limited. All rights reserved.From The Economist, published under licence.

However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Starbucks hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. View our latest analysis for Starbucks peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Starbucks will help you uncover what's on the horizon.How Is Starbucks' Growth Trending?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Starbucks' is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.If we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 20%. As a result, earnings from three years ago have also fallen 3.0% overall. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been undesirable for the company.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 19% per year over the next three years. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.2% per annum, which is noticeably less attractive.With this information, we can see why Starbucks is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Bottom Line On Starbucks' P/EWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.Story continuesWe've established that Starbucks maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.Before you take the next step, you should know about the 5 warning signs for Starbucks (2 are a bit concerning!) that we have uncovered.You might be able to find a better investment than Starbucks.

Major American equity markets fell into bear market territory. Most international markets didn’t fare much better. Meanwhile, fixed income failed to protect investors from volatility amid an unprecedented surge in inflation. However, the big drop in asset prices has created some real opportunities for investors in long-term stocks. 2022 was interesting in that almost all companies sold off meaningfully, regardless of how well they’d fared in the past. This has put some tremendous long-term stocks at more approachable starting valuations.For the list below, all the long-term stocks profiled have increased in value at least 300% over the past 10 years. And, that’s even counting 2022’s declines. These seven companies have all showed amazing historical success. While some are currently facing significant short-term headwinds, all seven of these have a good probability of returning to their high-octane performance ways once this current market downturn lets up.NFLXNetflix$291.12ROPRoper Technologies$436.87ZTSZoetis$148.15VVisa$208.06HEIHeico$153.47URIUnited Rentals$356.21HIFSHingham Institution for Savings$275.49InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNetflix (NFLX)An image of a phone with the Netflix logo on the screen, laying next to a container of popcorn with popcorn splayed acrossSource: xalien / ShutterstockAfter losing roughly half its value in 2022, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) might not seem like a winner anymore. However, don’t let the recent past color your perspective too much. NFLX stock, even after its large drop in 2022, is still up nearly 2,000% over the past 10 years. Shares were trading at just $14 (split-adjusted) at the start of 2013, after all.The company’s subscriber slowdown is well-known. The streaming wars have put pressure on everyone, including the market leader, Netflix. Shares plummeted in early 2022 as Netflix shocked the market with net subscriber losses.However, Netflix has now returned to growth, with subscriber Q3 numbers surging ahead of expectations. Netflix, unlike many tech companies, is also already significantly profitable, giving it plenty of flexibility while working through this current slowdown in the streaming space. It won’t be an overnight return back to all-time high stock prices, but the Netflix story is picking up steam once again, and may be one of the most solid long-term stocks to consider.Story continuesRoper Technologies (ROP)A man examines a digital screen with different icons for software.Source: ShutterstockRoper Technologies (NYSE:ROP) is a software conglomerate, and is another one of the most solid long-term stocks to consider. The firm initially focused on industrial manufacturing, but, over the years, it has exited most direct industrial businesses and instead evolved to become a software provider to those sorts of companies. Today, Roper has software for managing power plants, insurance, architecture and engineering, trucking, and much more.ROP stock has posted exceptional returns primarily for two reasons. One, management is constantly buying more software companies to add to the fold. And, since it operates in less glamorous markets than many software rivals, it can buy businesses at much more reasonable valuations.In addition to acquisitions, Roper has another tool at its disposal. The company earns a lot of license fees for software in advance. This is called deferred revenue, as Roper gets paid up front but delivers those contractual software services over a period of months and years. In the meantime, Roper can immediately roll that upfront revenue into making more software acquisitions, which helps keep the ball rolling.Roper’s tremendous capital allocation skills over the years have led to the company producing a 15.1% annualized total return over the past decade. That’s an excellent result from a seemingly mundane collection of software assets.Zoetis (ZTS)A terrier lies on a dog bed with a cone on.Source: ShutterstockZoetis (NYSE:ZTS) is the largest player in the animal health industry. The company produces vaccines, parasite-killers, and anti-infective drugs for animals. It also sells diagnostic tools and instruments for animal care. Zoetis has a fairly even sales split between pets and commercial animals such as pigs, livestock, and poultry.Despite the company’s considerable success over the past decade, Zoetis might not be a household name yet. That’s probably because the company was the long-time animal health division of Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). It only became an independent company and completed its initial public offering (IPO) in 2013. However, Zoetis’ roots, within Pfizer, go back to the 1950s.gZTS stock is now up more than 330% since its 2013 IPO. However, gains were much larger prior to 2022. That’s because shares pulled back 40% over the past year. Investors dumped any and all stocks related to animal health as the pandemic-related animal adoption boom came to an abrupt end. Regardless, while animal companionship enthusiasm has returned to more normal levels, the longer-term demand for better quality pet care isn’t going anywhere, and Zoetis will be back to its winning ways soon.Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comAnother one of the top long-term stocks to consider is Visa (NYSE:V), one of the world’s two primary credit card networks. It, along with Mastercard (NYSE:MA), has a dominant position in commerce virtually everywhere across the globe. The company’s results were disrupted during the pandemic. The card companies rely heavily on international payments as they can charge much higher fees on cross-border transactions as opposed to domestic ones. Visa shares have remained depressed over the past year as it has taken longer than hoped for international tourism to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, the threat of a recession lingers as the calendar turns to 2023.That said, Visa has been an incredible compounder since going public, and its long-term prospects are as strong as ever. If anything, the past couple years were a boon to the company, as many vendors — particularly in emerging markets — finally started adopting touchless payments while trying to de-emphasize the use of physical cash.In any case, V stock has been flat for the past three years, which sets it up for a solid breakout once this consolidation period ends. Besides that, shares are now at less than 25 times forward earnings, whereas Visa has historically traded closer to 30 times earnings.Heico (HEI)image of a plane flying in the sky representing airline stocksSource: ShutterstockOftentimes, the biggest market winners are found in unlikely places. One such case is airplane parts manufacturer Heico (NYSE:HEI). It produces components for jet engines, structural and mechanical plane pieces, insulation and so on for various types of aircraft.This may sound like a dull business, but its returns have been anything but. HEI stock is up a jaw-dropping 775% over the past decade. How has the company achieved such a feat? It is an M&amp;A machine, constantly buying up other small aerospace parts makers. Meanwhile, competition is limited as there is a high regulatory barrier to getting approval for making new airplane components. In effect, Heico has something close to a monopoly for many of the parts that it makes.This sort of unbeatable economics tied to a large and growing industry with numerous acquisition candidates has made Heico an all-star performer. Shares may seem exceptionally expensive at 50 times earnings today. However, Heico has a tendency to grow earnings so quickly that the starting valuation hasn’t mattered too much. If shares pull back during a potential 2023 recession, investors should put Heico at the top of their long-term stock watchlist.United Rentals (URI)image of businessman holding a fiery arrow that's heading in an upward trajectorySource: ShutterstockUnited Rentals (NYSE:URI) is another firm with an unbelievably profitable niche. The company owns a variety of expensive equipment and rents it out to contractors and other professionals that need a specific tool for a short period of time. United offers backhoes, loaders, earthmoving equipment, water pumps, power tools and so on.Like Heico, this may seem like a mundane business, but shares are up more than 700% since 2013. United Rentals has created a powerful business model, buying equipment with cheaply-borrowed capital and then renting it out at a substantial premium to its ownership cost. The firm has a scale advantage over mom-and-pop rental shops since it can borrow funds more cheaply and get better terms when buying equipment in large quantities.United Rentals also benefits from having a large pool of acquisition targets. It can buy up the countless smaller rental companies that come onto the market during economic downturns or when an owner wants to get out of the business.Shares are currently at a muted valuation, trading at just 11 times forward earnings. This is presumably due to worries that the business will slow down during a potential recession. However, United Rentals has proven adept at navigating complicated economic conditions before, and long-term investors will likely be richly rewarded for hanging in there during the current uncertainty.Hingham Institution For Savings (HIFS)Finger pointing at the word ""banking""Source: PopTika/ShutterStock.comMost investors probably don’t think of banks as big long-term stock winners. The skepticism certainly makes sense after the horrific performance we saw from the financial sector in 2008. That said, not all banks are created equal. Hingham Institution For Savings (NASDAQ:HIFS) is America’s most efficient multi-branch bank. Efficiency, in banks, is a metric of a bank’s income versus its overhead expenses. Hingham’s unmatched efficiency is thanks to its laser focus on costs, along with having a large amount of deposits per branch, giving it unmatched scale effeciencies.Hingham has shown superior capital allocation skills, which has powered its double-digit annualized total returns dating back to the mid-1990s. Over the past ten years, HIFS stock has soared 325%. Despite that rally, shares remain at a reasonable price, going for 14 times forward earnings. Adding to that HIFS stock pulled back around 30% in 2022 thanks to economic uncertainty, giving investors a much better entry point going forward.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in HIFS, ROP, and V stock.

(NYSE:HCA) loaded up on US$19m of stock earlier this year",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bullish-insiders-hca-healthcare-inc-130038672.html,1672578038,STORY,['HCA'],"[Over the last year, a good number of insiders have significantly increased their holdings in HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA). This is encouraging because it indicates that insiders are more optimistic about the company's prospects.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for HCA Healthcare HCA Healthcare Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Founder &amp; Chairman Emeritus Thomas Frist for US$19m worth of shares, at about US$215 per share. We do like to see buying, but this purchase was made at well below the current price of US$240. Because the shares were purchased at a lower price, this particular buy doesn't tell us much about how insiders feel about the current share price.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 91.70k shares for US$19m. On the other hand they divested 59.56k shares, for US$14m. In total, HCA Healthcare insiders bought more than they sold over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeHCA Healthcare is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.HCA Healthcare Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of HCA Healthcare shares. In total, insiders sold US$5.9m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Insider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. HCA Healthcare insiders own about US$887m worth of shares (which is 1.3% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At HCA Healthcare Tell Us?Insiders haven't bought HCA Healthcare stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. On the other hand, the insider transactions over the last year are encouraging. We are also comforted by the high levels of insider ownership. So the recent selling doesn't worry us. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing HCA Healthcare. When we did our research, we found 3 warning signs for HCA Healthcare (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that we believe deserve your full attention.But note: HCA Healthcare may not be the best stock to buy.

It has amassed assets over $10.21 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap BlendCompanies that find themselves in the large cap category typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. They tend to be stable companies with predictable cash flows and are usually less volatile than mid and small cap companies.Blend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.CostsSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.09%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.61%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 25.20% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 6.35% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN).The top 10 holdings account for about 23.3% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskGSLC seeks to match the performance of the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity Index before fees and expenses. The Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity Index is designed to deliver exposure to equity securities of large-capitalization U.S. issuers.Story continuesThe ETF has lost about -18.92% so far this year and is down about -18.88% in the last one year (as of 01/02/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $71.02 and $95.40.The ETF has a beta of 0.98 and standard deviation of 24.86% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 439 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesGoldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, GSLC is a good option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (IVV) and the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) track a similar index. While iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF has $289.92 billion in assets, SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF has $361.26 billion. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.03% and SPY charges 0.09%.Bottom-LineRetail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Schlumberger's (NYSE:SLB) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Schlumberger:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.11 = US$3.7b ÷ (US$44b - US$11b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, Schlumberger has an ROCE of 11%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 7.0% generated by the Energy Services industry. Check out our latest analysis for Schlumberger roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Schlumberger compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Schlumberger.What Does the ROCE Trend For Schlumberger Tell Us?You'd find it hard not to be impressed with the ROCE trend at Schlumberger. The data shows that returns on capital have increased by 166% over the trailing five years. The company is now earning US$0.1 per dollar of capital employed. In regards to capital employed, Schlumberger appears to been achieving more with less, since the business is using 46% less capital to run its operation. A business that's shrinking its asset base like this isn't usually typical of a soon to be multi-bagger company.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Schlumberger's ROCEIn summary, it's great to see that Schlumberger has been able to turn things around and earn higher returns on lower amounts of capital. Astute investors may have an opportunity here because the stock has declined 17% in the last five years. With that in mind, we believe the promising trends warrant this stock for further investigation.If you want to continue researching Schlumberger, you might be interested to know about the 2 warning signs that our analysis has discovered.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

(NYSE:ZTS) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 1st of March to $0.375. Despite this raise, the dividend yield of 1.0% is only a modest boost to shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Zoetis Zoetis' Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageThe dividend yield is a little bit low, but sustainability of the payments is also an important part of evaluating an income stock. Before making this announcement, Zoetis was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 33.2% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 27% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendZoetis Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $0.26 total annually to $1.50. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 19% a year over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. It's encouraging to see that Zoetis has been growing its earnings per share at 18% a year over the past five years. Zoetis definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio.Zoetis Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that Zoetis is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For example, we've picked out 1 warning sign for Zoetis that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock. Is Zoetis not quite the opportunity you were looking for?

Major American equity markets fell into bear market territory. Most international markets didn’t fare much better. Meanwhile, fixed income failed to protect investors from volatility amid an unprecedented surge in inflation. However, the big drop in asset prices has created some real opportunities for investors in long-term stocks. 2022 was interesting in that almost all companies sold off meaningfully, regardless of how well they’d fared in the past. This has put some tremendous long-term stocks at more approachable starting valuations.For the list below, all the long-term stocks profiled have increased in value at least 300% over the past 10 years. And, that’s even counting 2022’s declines. These seven companies have all showed amazing historical success. While some are currently facing significant short-term headwinds, all seven of these have a good probability of returning to their high-octane performance ways once this current market downturn lets up.NFLXNetflix$291.12ROPRoper Technologies$436.87ZTSZoetis$148.15VVisa$208.06HEIHeico$153.47URIUnited Rentals$356.21HIFSHingham Institution for Savings$275.49InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNetflix (NFLX)An image of a phone with the Netflix logo on the screen, laying next to a container of popcorn with popcorn splayed acrossSource: xalien / ShutterstockAfter losing roughly half its value in 2022, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) might not seem like a winner anymore. However, don’t let the recent past color your perspective too much. NFLX stock, even after its large drop in 2022, is still up nearly 2,000% over the past 10 years. Shares were trading at just $14 (split-adjusted) at the start of 2013, after all.The company’s subscriber slowdown is well-known. The streaming wars have put pressure on everyone, including the market leader, Netflix. Shares plummeted in early 2022 as Netflix shocked the market with net subscriber losses.However, Netflix has now returned to growth, with subscriber Q3 numbers surging ahead of expectations. Netflix, unlike many tech companies, is also already significantly profitable, giving it plenty of flexibility while working through this current slowdown in the streaming space. It won’t be an overnight return back to all-time high stock prices, but the Netflix story is picking up steam once again, and may be one of the most solid long-term stocks to consider.Story continuesRoper Technologies (ROP)A man examines a digital screen with different icons for software.Source: ShutterstockRoper Technologies (NYSE:ROP) is a software conglomerate, and is another one of the most solid long-term stocks to consider. The firm initially focused on industrial manufacturing, but, over the years, it has exited most direct industrial businesses and instead evolved to become a software provider to those sorts of companies. Today, Roper has software for managing power plants, insurance, architecture and engineering, trucking, and much more.ROP stock has posted exceptional returns primarily for two reasons. One, management is constantly buying more software companies to add to the fold. And, since it operates in less glamorous markets than many software rivals, it can buy businesses at much more reasonable valuations.In addition to acquisitions, Roper has another tool at its disposal. The company earns a lot of license fees for software in advance. This is called deferred revenue, as Roper gets paid up front but delivers those contractual software services over a period of months and years. In the meantime, Roper can immediately roll that upfront revenue into making more software acquisitions, which helps keep the ball rolling.Roper’s tremendous capital allocation skills over the years have led to the company producing a 15.1% annualized total return over the past decade. That’s an excellent result from a seemingly mundane collection of software assets.Zoetis (ZTS)A terrier lies on a dog bed with a cone on.Source: ShutterstockZoetis (NYSE:ZTS) is the largest player in the animal health industry. The company produces vaccines, parasite-killers, and anti-infective drugs for animals. It also sells diagnostic tools and instruments for animal care. Zoetis has a fairly even sales split between pets and commercial animals such as pigs, livestock, and poultry.Despite the company’s considerable success over the past decade, Zoetis might not be a household name yet. That’s probably because the company was the long-time animal health division of Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). It only became an independent company and completed its initial public offering (IPO) in 2013. However, Zoetis’ roots, within Pfizer, go back to the 1950s.gZTS stock is now up more than 330% since its 2013 IPO. However, gains were much larger prior to 2022. That’s because shares pulled back 40% over the past year. Investors dumped any and all stocks related to animal health as the pandemic-related animal adoption boom came to an abrupt end. Regardless, while animal companionship enthusiasm has returned to more normal levels, the longer-term demand for better quality pet care isn’t going anywhere, and Zoetis will be back to its winning ways soon.Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comAnother one of the top long-term stocks to consider is Visa (NYSE:V), one of the world’s two primary credit card networks. It, along with Mastercard (NYSE:MA), has a dominant position in commerce virtually everywhere across the globe. The company’s results were disrupted during the pandemic. The card companies rely heavily on international payments as they can charge much higher fees on cross-border transactions as opposed to domestic ones. Visa shares have remained depressed over the past year as it has taken longer than hoped for international tourism to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, the threat of a recession lingers as the calendar turns to 2023.That said, Visa has been an incredible compounder since going public, and its long-term prospects are as strong as ever. If anything, the past couple years were a boon to the company, as many vendors — particularly in emerging markets — finally started adopting touchless payments while trying to de-emphasize the use of physical cash.In any case, V stock has been flat for the past three years, which sets it up for a solid breakout once this consolidation period ends. Besides that, shares are now at less than 25 times forward earnings, whereas Visa has historically traded closer to 30 times earnings.Heico (HEI)image of a plane flying in the sky representing airline stocksSource: ShutterstockOftentimes, the biggest market winners are found in unlikely places. One such case is airplane parts manufacturer Heico (NYSE:HEI). It produces components for jet engines, structural and mechanical plane pieces, insulation and so on for various types of aircraft.This may sound like a dull business, but its returns have been anything but. HEI stock is up a jaw-dropping 775% over the past decade. How has the company achieved such a feat? It is an M&amp;A machine, constantly buying up other small aerospace parts makers. Meanwhile, competition is limited as there is a high regulatory barrier to getting approval for making new airplane components. In effect, Heico has something close to a monopoly for many of the parts that it makes.This sort of unbeatable economics tied to a large and growing industry with numerous acquisition candidates has made Heico an all-star performer. Shares may seem exceptionally expensive at 50 times earnings today. However, Heico has a tendency to grow earnings so quickly that the starting valuation hasn’t mattered too much. If shares pull back during a potential 2023 recession, investors should put Heico at the top of their long-term stock watchlist.United Rentals (URI)image of businessman holding a fiery arrow that's heading in an upward trajectorySource: ShutterstockUnited Rentals (NYSE:URI) is another firm with an unbelievably profitable niche. The company owns a variety of expensive equipment and rents it out to contractors and other professionals that need a specific tool for a short period of time. United offers backhoes, loaders, earthmoving equipment, water pumps, power tools and so on.Like Heico, this may seem like a mundane business, but shares are up more than 700% since 2013. United Rentals has created a powerful business model, buying equipment with cheaply-borrowed capital and then renting it out at a substantial premium to its ownership cost. The firm has a scale advantage over mom-and-pop rental shops since it can borrow funds more cheaply and get better terms when buying equipment in large quantities.United Rentals also benefits from having a large pool of acquisition targets. It can buy up the countless smaller rental companies that come onto the market during economic downturns or when an owner wants to get out of the business.Shares are currently at a muted valuation, trading at just 11 times forward earnings. This is presumably due to worries that the business will slow down during a potential recession. However, United Rentals has proven adept at navigating complicated economic conditions before, and long-term investors will likely be richly rewarded for hanging in there during the current uncertainty.Hingham Institution For Savings (HIFS)Finger pointing at the word ""banking""Source: PopTika/ShutterStock.comMost investors probably don’t think of banks as big long-term stock winners. The skepticism certainly makes sense after the horrific performance we saw from the financial sector in 2008. That said, not all banks are created equal. Hingham Institution For Savings (NASDAQ:HIFS) is America’s most efficient multi-branch bank.

Over the past ten years, HIFS stock has soared 325%. Despite that rally, shares remain at a reasonable price, going for 14 times forward earnings.

To be sure, publicly broadcasting predictions can either make one look like a genius or a complete clown. In this business, I’ve had experiences with both. Nevertheless, I’m going to try to bring some reasonable forecasts to the table.If a central theme exists to any stock market outlook for 2023, it could be a focus on transitions. Early in the coronavirus pandemic, many policymakers responded to the immediate needs of their constituents. Unsurprisingly, these actions sparked massive changes in the stock market. However, with the Covid-19 crisis largely fading, the government must now prioritize normalization.In turn, we could suffer some growing pains as we transition from one paradigm to another. And this too will cause undulations (including occasional sharp gyrations) to the equities sector. To prep for this possible coming circumstance, below is my stock market outlook for 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHousing Market DeclinesFlat cut-out image of house jammed into the crack of dry desert, symbolizing housing crisisSource: shutterstock.com/Roman BodnarchukAlthough a contentious issue, in terms of a stock market outlook for 2023, I see major problems with real estate. It really comes down to the Federal Reserve’s commitment to tackling inflation through raising the benchmark interest rate. Throughout this year, the central bank consistently and aggressively hiked rates. Further, the latest jobs report suggests that policymakers will be keen on killing inflation next year.Unfortunately for the Fed, the hotter-than-expected November employment numbers indicated that its measures failed to resonate. Therefore, to get a true hold on rising prices, the gloves must come off. Frankly, that’s a scary thought for folks that need to borrow money. And it could be an uppercut blow to the housing market.Without getting into complicated narratives, I just go with this one truism: you can have higher rates or higher prices but you can’t have both at the same time. To be fair, many if not most homeowners currently sit on massive equity. Still, layoffs at scale – stemming from higher rates – could force more home sales at discounted prices. It’s just my opinion but I would stay away from names like Redfin (NASDAQ:RDFN) which have struggled badly in 2022.Story continuesWFH EndsA woman is sitting at a table and working on a laptop.Source: ShutterstockIf any obvious benefit materialized from the awful Covid-19 crisis, it’s that the pandemic forced Americans to rethink work. Once a privilege – which occasionally led to snide bickering among the less privileged – working from home (WFH) enabled corporate America to stay afloat during the catastrophe. Of course, with the genie being let out of the bottle, very few wanted to return to business as usual.Unfortunately for America’s white-collar employees, WFH may come to an end next year. As I’ve cited many times, Resume Builder reports that “90% of companies will require employees to return to office in 2023.” Not only that, “21% of companies will fire workers who do not return to the office.”While revolting against your boss sounds like a morally righteous idea, here’s a tip: you don’t want to be the guy (or gal) to get let go during a recession. And you especially don’t want to be let go for stupid reasons like insubordination for refusing to do, you know, your job.Therefore, my stock market outlook for 2023 involves a cynically bullish take on companies like Robert Half International (NYSE:RHI). Invariably, some folks will learn the hard way. And they’ll be scrambling for employment.Gig Economy Risesgig economy stocks to buySource: ShutterstockInterestingly, the above stock market outlook for 2023 enjoys a counterpart. Recently, I came across a BBC News article that detailed the story of one worker who quit because of a return-to-the-office mandate. Let me just stress again how utterly stupid such a move is if you don’t have an alternative situation lined up.Forget the political correctness, forget about a stock market outlook for 2023. The best thing you can do for yourself next year is to not be stupid.Anyways, the possibly next best thing you can do for yourself in 2023 is to consider companies that may rise on the burgeoning gig economy. Let’s think about it this way. Working from home has been so important for employees that they’ll risk nuking their careers (and reputations) for the privilege. A less-painful method to making this lifestyle permanent is to become independent contractors (i.e. gig workers).Globally, the gig economy featured a valuation of $355 billion in 2021. By 2027, experts project that this segment will reach a value of $873 billion. Therefore, one should target companies like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), which offer freelancers digital payment processing and business management services.Defense Stays RelevantA photograph of two jet fighters flying above clouds.Source: ShutterstockGiven the controversial nature of the publicly traded defense segment, it doesn’t represent the most popular avenue for profits. While I wouldn’t say that contractors in this space carry nearly the same toxicity as privately owned prisons, for many investors, the sector carries unwanted juju. I get it. At the same time, as a viable stock market outlook for 2023, it’s unignorable.Obviously, the most pressing concern for the entire planet centers on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. According to the latest information from The New York Times, peace talks remain a far-off proposition. And any kind of negotiations that involve ceding of land will likely be a non-starter. Imagine if someone burgled your home and offered part of your belongings back in exchange for you not calling the police. Again, it’s a non-starter.Further, U.S. support of Ukraine isn’t just a matter of Ukrainian independence, as beautiful of a story that it is. Rather, Washington must keep Moscow in check. Otherwise, it sends a signal to other aggressive or imperialistic nations – read China – that it’s okay to invade sovereign countries. Therefore, whether we like it or not, companies like Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) will be extraordinarily relevant as a stock market outlook for 2023.Personal Security Draws Attentiona business man pressing a button with an open lock on it that's connected to a symbol of a cloud and various security related iconsSource: ShutterstockStaying in line with a controversial segment, another stock market outlook for 2023 centers on personal security. During the height of the Covid-19 crisis, another crisis materialized, that of social inequality. Frankly, it was difficult to ignore that the rich got richer during the pandemic. Indeed, government data on the wealth gap demonstrates that the ultra-affluent won big.Invariably, the combustible mix of a once-in-a-blue-moon pandemic and severe wealth disparities sparked protests across the nation. Sadly, many innocent people got caught in the crossfires of this smoldering social conflict. Frankly, we’re still healing from the opened wounds, putting a focus on personal safety and protection.Early in 2022, The Wall Street Journal noted that law enforcement agencies lost many police officers. As well, they struggled to replace them. Increasingly, the occupation has become a thankless job while remaining incredibly dangerous, if not more so. Put another way, regular folks increasingly must take care of themselves. Personally, my stock market outlook for 2023 on this subject matter would involve considering firms like Alarm.com (NASDAQ:ALRM). Specializing in home automation and monitoring services, ALRM could be surprisingly buoyant.Focus on the FamilyMan in suit with hands over paper cutouts of family, car and home. Represents insurance.Source: thodonal88 / Shutterstock.comWith rising interest rates next year seemingly a sure thing based on prior Fed comments, the insurance sector may play a significant role regarding a stock market outlook for 2023. Based on historical trends, insurance stocks share a direct relationship with benchmark rates. In other words, as rates rise, so too does the valuation of publicly traded insurance providers.Of course, insurance represents a varied field. In particular, though, the life insurance segment may enjoy a demand influx. Fundamentally, the Covid-19 crisis forced people to recognize their own mortality. In addition, the pandemic popped the illusory bubble that people living in developed nations tend to operate under. Thanks to the interconnected world, a health conflagration in one part of the plant can contaminate others alarmingly quickly.Essentially, anything can happen to anyone at any time. A U.S. passport will not mitigate certain vulnerabilities. Many more people realize this crude reality following the pandemic. Thus, for the sake of protecting loved ones, life insurance providers may rise. And that may bode well for leaders in the space like MetLife (NYSE:MET). Sure enough, MET is up around 14% for the year.Big Tech Recoverscommunication technology for internet business. global world network and telecommunication on earthSource: greenbutterfly / Shutterstock.comNot surprisingly, the broader technology sector suffered disproportionately from the myriad headwinds of 2022. Regarding the sector, the global supply chain disruption negatively impacted the flow of semiconductors, leading to chaos in the early phases of the Covid-19 crisis. However, just as companies started to improve their inventory levels, demand erosion then led to supply imbalance concerns.Further, the Fed has been no friend to tech-centric names. Generally speaking, enterprises in the innovation space focus on growth rather than earnings. This framework ran beautifully during a dovish monetary environment. However, under an increasingly tight dovish one, the rise in borrowing costs disincentivizes expansionary endeavors. Certainly, several startups in the field may suffer continued declines.Nevertheless, big tech – I’m thinking presently embattled names like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) – may be due for a big comeback. True, many of these entities suffer from a credibility crisis. Still, as a stock market outlook for 2023, the reality is that their underlying platforms offer extraordinary relevancies.For instance, should people lose their jobs, they’re going to turn to Google. Or they may try to network on Facebook. In other words, some services are too vital to ignore.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

35,592bc6d3-3e3f-33ed-903a-f64b5bfed82c,MDT,2023-01-02,Medtronic plc's (NYSE:MDT) Earnings Haven't Escaped The Attention Of Investors,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medtronic-plcs-nyse-mdt-earnings-120010728.html,1672660810,STORY,['MDT'],"[Medtronic plc's (NYSE:MDT) price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 23.9x might make it look like a strong sell right now compared to the market in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios below 14x and even P/E's below 8x are quite common. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.While the market has experienced earnings growth lately, Medtronic's earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price. View our latest analysis for Medtronic peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Medtronic.Is There Enough Growth For Medtronic?In order to justify its P/E ratio, Medtronic would need to produce outstanding growth well in excess of the market.If we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 7.2%. As a result, earnings from three years ago have also fallen 8.5% overall. So unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that the company has not done a great job of growing earnings over that time.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 14% each year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.2% each year, which is noticeably less attractive.In light of this, it's understandable that Medtronic's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Bottom Line On Medtronic's P/ETypically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of Medtronic's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Many other vital risk factors can be found on the company's balance sheet. You can assess many of the main risks through our free balance sheet analysis for Medtronic with six simple checks.Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than Medtronic.

(NYSE:MRK) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Merck Merck Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP &amp; General Counsel, Jennifer Zachary, for US$1.7m worth of shares, at about US$99.85 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$111. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was only 30% of Jennifer Zachary's holding.In the last year Merck insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like Merck better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At Merck Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Merck. Specifically, insiders ditched US$3.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of MerckI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Merck insiders own 0.06% of the company, worth about US$178m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Merck Insiders?Insiders haven't bought Merck stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. But since Merck is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. To assist with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Merck.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

38,80b613cc-856d-3a95-b5c9-997fef790a49,PFE,2023-01-02,Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE) investors will be pleased with their respectable 78% return over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pfizers-nyse-pfe-investors-pleased-120026908.html,1672660826,STORY,['PFE'],"[Passive investing in index funds can generate returns that roughly match the overall market. But you can do a lot better than that by buying good quality businesses for attractive prices. For example, the Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) share price is up 41% in the last five years, slightly above the market return. In stark contrast, the stock price has actually fallen 9.5% in the last year.So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Pfizer In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Pfizer managed to grow its earnings per share at 27% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 7% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock. The reasonably low P/E ratio of 9.60 also suggests market apprehension.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Pfizer has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Pfizer's TSR for the last 5 years was 78%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that Pfizer shares lost 6.6% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 22%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 12%, each year, over five years. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Pfizer that you should be aware of before investing here.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

As I’ve cited many times, Resume Builder reports that “90% of companies will require employees to return to office in 2023.” Not only that, “21% of companies will fire workers who do not return to the office.”While revolting against your boss sounds like a morally righteous idea, here’s a tip: you don’t want to be the guy (or gal) to get let go during a recession. And you especially don’t want to be let go for stupid reasons like insubordination for refusing to do, you know, your job.Therefore, my stock market outlook for 2023 involves a cynically bullish take on companies like Robert Half International (NYSE:RHI). Invariably, some folks will learn the hard way. And they’ll be scrambling for employment.Gig Economy Risesgig economy stocks to buySource: ShutterstockInterestingly, the above stock market outlook for 2023 enjoys a counterpart. Recently, I came across a BBC News article that detailed the story of one worker who quit because of a return-to-the-office mandate. Let me just stress again how utterly stupid such a move is if you don’t have an alternative situation lined up.Forget the political correctness, forget about a stock market outlook for 2023. The best thing you can do for yourself next year is to not be stupid.Anyways, the possibly next best thing you can do for yourself in 2023 is to consider companies that may rise on the burgeoning gig economy. Let’s think about it this way. Working from home has been so important for employees that they’ll risk nuking their careers (and reputations) for the privilege. A less-painful method to making this lifestyle permanent is to become independent contractors (i.e. gig workers).Globally, the gig economy featured a valuation of $355 billion in 2021. By 2027, experts project that this segment will reach a value of $873 billion. Therefore, one should target companies like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), which offer freelancers digital payment processing and business management services.Defense Stays RelevantA photograph of two jet fighters flying above clouds.Source: ShutterstockGiven the controversial nature of the publicly traded defense segment, it doesn’t represent the most popular avenue for profits. While I wouldn’t say that contractors in this space carry nearly the same toxicity as privately owned prisons, for many investors, the sector carries unwanted juju. I get it. At the same time, as a viable stock market outlook for 2023, it’s unignorable.Obviously, the most pressing concern for the entire planet centers on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. According to the latest information from The New York Times, peace talks remain a far-off proposition. And any kind of negotiations that involve ceding of land will likely be a non-starter. Imagine if someone burgled your home and offered part of your belongings back in exchange for you not calling the police. Again, it’s a non-starter.Further, U.S. support of Ukraine isn’t just a matter of Ukrainian independence, as beautiful of a story that it is. Rather, Washington must keep Moscow in check. Otherwise, it sends a signal to other aggressive or imperialistic nations – read China – that it’s okay to invade sovereign countries. Therefore, whether we like it or not, companies like Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) will be extraordinarily relevant as a stock market outlook for 2023.Personal Security Draws Attentiona business man pressing a button with an open lock on it that's connected to a symbol of a cloud and various security related iconsSource: ShutterstockStaying in line with a controversial segment, another stock market outlook for 2023 centers on personal security. During the height of the Covid-19 crisis, another crisis materialized, that of social inequality. Frankly, it was difficult to ignore that the rich got richer during the pandemic. Indeed, government data on the wealth gap demonstrates that the ultra-affluent won big.Invariably, the combustible mix of a once-in-a-blue-moon pandemic and severe wealth disparities sparked protests across the nation. Sadly, many innocent people got caught in the crossfires of this smoldering social conflict. Frankly, we’re still healing from the opened wounds, putting a focus on personal safety and protection.Early in 2022, The Wall Street Journal noted that law enforcement agencies lost many police officers. As well, they struggled to replace them. Increasingly, the occupation has become a thankless job while remaining incredibly dangerous, if not more so. Put another way, regular folks increasingly must take care of themselves. Personally, my stock market outlook for 2023 on this subject matter would involve considering firms like Alarm.com (NASDAQ:ALRM). Specializing in home automation and monitoring services, ALRM could be surprisingly buoyant.Focus on the FamilyMan in suit with hands over paper cutouts of family, car and home. Represents insurance.Source: thodonal88 / Shutterstock.comWith rising interest rates next year seemingly a sure thing based on prior Fed comments, the insurance sector may play a significant role regarding a stock market outlook for 2023. Based on historical trends, insurance stocks share a direct relationship with benchmark rates. In other words, as rates rise, so too does the valuation of publicly traded insurance providers.Of course, insurance represents a varied field. In particular, though, the life insurance segment may enjoy a demand influx. Fundamentally, the Covid-19 crisis forced people to recognize their own mortality. In addition, the pandemic popped the illusory bubble that people living in developed nations tend to operate under. Thanks to the interconnected world, a health conflagration in one part of the plant can contaminate others alarmingly quickly.Essentially, anything can happen to anyone at any time. A U.S. passport will not mitigate certain vulnerabilities. Many more people realize this crude reality following the pandemic. Thus, for the sake of protecting loved ones, life insurance providers may rise. And that may bode well for leaders in the space like MetLife (NYSE:MET). Sure enough, MET is up around 14% for the year.Big Tech Recoverscommunication technology for internet business. global world network and telecommunication on earthSource: greenbutterfly / Shutterstock.comNot surprisingly, the broader technology sector suffered disproportionately from the myriad headwinds of 2022. Regarding the sector, the global supply chain disruption negatively impacted the flow of semiconductors, leading to chaos in the early phases of the Covid-19 crisis. However, just as companies started to improve their inventory levels, demand erosion then led to supply imbalance concerns.Further, the Fed has been no friend to tech-centric names. Generally speaking, enterprises in the innovation space focus on growth rather than earnings. This framework ran beautifully during a dovish monetary environment. However, under an increasingly tight dovish one, the rise in borrowing costs disincentivizes expansionary endeavors. Certainly, several startups in the field may suffer continued declines.Nevertheless, big tech – I’m thinking presently embattled names like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) – may be due for a big comeback. True, many of these entities suffer from a credibility crisis. Still, as a stock market outlook for 2023, the reality is that their underlying platforms offer extraordinary relevancies.For instance, should people lose their jobs, they’re going to turn to Google. Or they may try to network on Facebook. In other words, some services are too vital to ignore.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

That is, there were more number of shares sold by insiders than there were purchased.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for International Business Machines International Business Machines Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe insider, Robert Del Bene, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$445k worth of shares at a price of US$148 each. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$141. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive). The only individual insider seller over the last year was Robert Del Bene.Robert Del Bene sold a total of 4.60k shares over the year at an average price of US$145. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At International Business Machines Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of International Business Machines shares. Specifically, insider Robert Del Bene ditched US$445k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Insider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. International Business Machines insiders own 0.08% of the company, currently worth about US$103m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The International Business Machines Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider hasn't bought International Business Machines stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

(NYSE:PNC) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At PNC Financial Services GroupOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP and Head of Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking, Michael Lyons, for US$1.0m worth of shares, at about US$183 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$158. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.In total, PNC Financial Services Group insiders sold more than they bought over the last year.

In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. PNC Financial Services Group insiders own 0.3% of the company, currently worth about US$217m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At PNC Financial Services Group Tell Us?An insider hasn't bought PNC Financial Services Group stock in the last three months, but there was some selling.

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.Analog Devices certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. View our latest analysis for Analog Devices peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Analog Devices will help you uncover what's on the horizon.How Is Analog Devices' Growth Trending?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Analog Devices' is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.Taking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 51% last year. The strong recent performance means it was also able to grow EPS by 47% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 12% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.2% per annum, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.With this information, we can see why Analog Devices is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.What We Can Learn From Analog Devices' P/E?Typically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of Analog Devices' analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 1 warning sign for Analog Devices that you need to be mindful of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.

Major American equity markets fell into bear market territory. Most international markets didn’t fare much better. Meanwhile, fixed income failed to protect investors from volatility amid an unprecedented surge in inflation. However, the big drop in asset prices has created some real opportunities for investors in long-term stocks. 2022 was interesting in that almost all companies sold off meaningfully, regardless of how well they’d fared in the past. This has put some tremendous long-term stocks at more approachable starting valuations.For the list below, all the long-term stocks profiled have increased in value at least 300% over the past 10 years. And, that’s even counting 2022’s declines. These seven companies have all showed amazing historical success. While some are currently facing significant short-term headwinds, all seven of these have a good probability of returning to their high-octane performance ways once this current market downturn lets up.NFLXNetflix$291.12ROPRoper Technologies$436.87ZTSZoetis$148.15VVisa$208.06HEIHeico$153.47URIUnited Rentals$356.21HIFSHingham Institution for Savings$275.49InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNetflix (NFLX)An image of a phone with the Netflix logo on the screen, laying next to a container of popcorn with popcorn splayed acrossSource: xalien / ShutterstockAfter losing roughly half its value in 2022, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) might not seem like a winner anymore. However, don’t let the recent past color your perspective too much. NFLX stock, even after its large drop in 2022, is still up nearly 2,000% over the past 10 years. Shares were trading at just $14 (split-adjusted) at the start of 2013, after all.The company’s subscriber slowdown is well-known. The streaming wars have put pressure on everyone, including the market leader, Netflix. Shares plummeted in early 2022 as Netflix shocked the market with net subscriber losses.However, Netflix has now returned to growth, with subscriber Q3 numbers surging ahead of expectations. Netflix, unlike many tech companies, is also already significantly profitable, giving it plenty of flexibility while working through this current slowdown in the streaming space. It won’t be an overnight return back to all-time high stock prices, but the Netflix story is picking up steam once again, and may be one of the most solid long-term stocks to consider.Story continuesRoper Technologies (ROP)A man examines a digital screen with different icons for software.Source: ShutterstockRoper Technologies (NYSE:ROP) is a software conglomerate, and is another one of the most solid long-term stocks to consider. The firm initially focused on industrial manufacturing, but, over the years, it has exited most direct industrial businesses and instead evolved to become a software provider to those sorts of companies. Today, Roper has software for managing power plants, insurance, architecture and engineering, trucking, and much more.ROP stock has posted exceptional returns primarily for two reasons. One, management is constantly buying more software companies to add to the fold. And, since it operates in less glamorous markets than many software rivals, it can buy businesses at much more reasonable valuations.In addition to acquisitions, Roper has another tool at its disposal. The company earns a lot of license fees for software in advance. This is called deferred revenue, as Roper gets paid up front but delivers those contractual software services over a period of months and years. In the meantime, Roper can immediately roll that upfront revenue into making more software acquisitions, which helps keep the ball rolling.Roper’s tremendous capital allocation skills over the years have led to the company producing a 15.1% annualized total return over the past decade. That’s an excellent result from a seemingly mundane collection of software assets.Zoetis (ZTS)A terrier lies on a dog bed with a cone on.Source: ShutterstockZoetis (NYSE:ZTS) is the largest player in the animal health industry. The company produces vaccines, parasite-killers, and anti-infective drugs for animals. It also sells diagnostic tools and instruments for animal care. Zoetis has a fairly even sales split between pets and commercial animals such as pigs, livestock, and poultry.Despite the company’s considerable success over the past decade, Zoetis might not be a household name yet. That’s probably because the company was the long-time animal health division of Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). It only became an independent company and completed its initial public offering (IPO) in 2013. However, Zoetis’ roots, within Pfizer, go back to the 1950s.gZTS stock is now up more than 330% since its 2013 IPO. However, gains were much larger prior to 2022. That’s because shares pulled back 40% over the past year. Investors dumped any and all stocks related to animal health as the pandemic-related animal adoption boom came to an abrupt end. Regardless, while animal companionship enthusiasm has returned to more normal levels, the longer-term demand for better quality pet care isn’t going anywhere, and Zoetis will be back to its winning ways soon.Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comAnother one of the top long-term stocks to consider is Visa (NYSE:V), one of the world’s two primary credit card networks. It, along with Mastercard (NYSE:MA), has a dominant position in commerce virtually everywhere across the globe. The company’s results were disrupted during the pandemic. The card companies rely heavily on international payments as they can charge much higher fees on cross-border transactions as opposed to domestic ones. Visa shares have remained depressed over the past year as it has taken longer than hoped for international tourism to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, the threat of a recession lingers as the calendar turns to 2023.That said, Visa has been an incredible compounder since going public, and its long-term prospects are as strong as ever. If anything, the past couple years were a boon to the company, as many vendors — particularly in emerging markets — finally started adopting touchless payments while trying to de-emphasize the use of physical cash.In any case, V stock has been flat for the past three years, which sets it up for a solid breakout once this consolidation period ends. Besides that, shares are now at less than 25 times forward earnings, whereas Visa has historically traded closer to 30 times earnings.Heico (HEI)image of a plane flying in the sky representing airline stocksSource: ShutterstockOftentimes, the biggest market winners are found in unlikely places. One such case is airplane parts manufacturer Heico (NYSE:HEI). It produces components for jet engines, structural and mechanical plane pieces, insulation and so on for various types of aircraft.This may sound like a dull business, but its returns have been anything but. HEI stock is up a jaw-dropping 775% over the past decade. How has the company achieved such a feat? It is an M&amp;A machine, constantly buying up other small aerospace parts makers. Meanwhile, competition is limited as there is a high regulatory barrier to getting approval for making new airplane components. In effect, Heico has something close to a monopoly for many of the parts that it makes.This sort of unbeatable economics tied to a large and growing industry with numerous acquisition candidates has made Heico an all-star performer. Shares may seem exceptionally expensive at 50 times earnings today. However, Heico has a tendency to grow earnings so quickly that the starting valuation hasn’t mattered too much. If shares pull back during a potential 2023 recession, investors should put Heico at the top of their long-term stock watchlist.United Rentals (URI)image of businessman holding a fiery arrow that's heading in an upward trajectorySource: ShutterstockUnited Rentals (NYSE:URI) is another firm with an unbelievably profitable niche. The company owns a variety of expensive equipment and rents it out to contractors and other professionals that need a specific tool for a short period of time. United offers backhoes, loaders, earthmoving equipment, water pumps, power tools and so on.Like Heico, this may seem like a mundane business, but shares are up more than 700% since 2013. United Rentals has created a powerful business model, buying equipment with cheaply-borrowed capital and then renting it out at a substantial premium to its ownership cost. The firm has a scale advantage over mom-and-pop rental shops since it can borrow funds more cheaply and get better terms when buying equipment in large quantities.United Rentals also benefits from having a large pool of acquisition targets. It can buy up the countless smaller rental companies that come onto the market during economic downturns or when an owner wants to get out of the business.Shares are currently at a muted valuation, trading at just 11 times forward earnings. This is presumably due to worries that the business will slow down during a potential recession. However, United Rentals has proven adept at navigating complicated economic conditions before, and long-term investors will likely be richly rewarded for hanging in there during the current uncertainty.Hingham Institution For Savings (HIFS)Finger pointing at the word ""banking""Source: PopTika/ShutterStock.comMost investors probably don’t think of banks as big long-term stock winners. The skepticism certainly makes sense after the horrific performance we saw from the financial sector in 2008. That said, not all banks are created equal. Hingham Institution For Savings (NASDAQ:HIFS) is America’s most efficient multi-branch bank. Efficiency, in banks, is a metric of a bank’s income versus its overhead expenses. Hingham’s unmatched efficiency is thanks to its laser focus on costs, along with having a large amount of deposits per branch, giving it unmatched scale effeciencies.Hingham has shown superior capital allocation skills, which has powered its double-digit annualized total returns dating back to the mid-1990s. Over the past ten years, HIFS stock has soared 325%. Despite that rally, shares remain at a reasonable price, going for 14 times forward earnings. Adding to that HIFS stock pulled back around 30% in 2022 thanks to economic uncertainty, giving investors a much better entry point going forward.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in HIFS, ROP, and V stock.

49,ca5f6ea0-59be-33c8-843a-fe51ef85f681,KLAC,2023-01-02,KLA's (NASDAQ:KLAC) investors will be pleased with their splendid 277% return over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/klas-nasdaq-klac-investors-pleased-132820815.html,1672579700,STORY,['KLAC'],"[When you buy shares in a company, it's worth keeping in mind the possibility that it could fail, and you could lose your money. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For example, the KLA Corporation (NASDAQ:KLAC) share price has soared 243% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. It's also good to see the share price up 19% over the last quarter.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for KLA While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, KLA managed to grow its earnings per share at 29% a year. This EPS growth is remarkably close to the 28% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that KLA has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? Take a more thorough look at KLA's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for KLA the TSR over the last 5 years was 277%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, KLA shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 11% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 22%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 30% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for KLA   you should know about.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

While 2022 has been an alarming year for stocks due to rampant inflation and rate hikes, with most tech and cyclical stocks facing massive selloffs, many stocks are still long overdue for a correction.The Federal Reserve remains hawkish, and I only see its tone changing once inflation trends downward more intensely. Most importantly, many people ignore Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s thoughts on the labor market. He is not just concerned about inflation; instead, he also wants to raise the civilian labor participation rate. To reach pre-pandemic labor force participation rates, the Fed needs more people to work for less. Such a trend would make the economy healthier in the long run.Unfortunately, further rate hikes will be necessary to slow the robust labor market. At this pace, the terminal rate could significantly inflation before we see a U-turn in monetary policy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThat means a lot of pain for companies with a lot of debt or significant exposure to a recession. The following three names are such stocks to sell before a recession:UMHUMH Properties$16.20CVXChevron Corporation$$177.60MCKMcKesson Corporation$377UMH Properties (UMH)Real estate investment trust REIT on an office desk.Source: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / ShutterstockI don’t recommend buying UMH Properties (NYSE:UMH) stock because of UMH’s poor fundamentals and the dangerous outlook of the real estate market. The company is a real estate investment trust that owns, manages, and finances manufactured home communities and residential land in the U.S. Although the company has a solid track record of growth and profitability, there are several reasons why investors should consider selling their shares of UMH Properties.First, the company’s stock price has been volatile in recent months, indicating that there may be underlying issues with its business model. UMH Properties also has high debt levels, which can weigh on the company’s financial performance and negatively affect its stock price. According to Gurufocus.com, the company’s Altman-Z score suggests that it is distressed, as its debt-to-equity ratio is ranked worse than 83.36% of 679 companies in the REIT sector.Story continuesSecond, UMH Properties is highly reliant on the manufactured home market, which is exposed to various economic and political risks. For example, the company’s business could be negatively impacted by a downturn in the economy or changes to federal regulations that affect the manufactured-home industry. Those risks are highly likely to materialize next year.Chevron Corporation (CVX)Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper buildingSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comSelling Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stock before a recession seems like a no-brainer as it looks overvalued compared to its competitors like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Sure, Chevron’s current position looks excellent as its profits are exploding due to high oil prices and lucrative drilling efforts. However, if a recession does hit in 2023, we could see this company’s stock nosedive.Furthermore, Russia’s war on Ukraine has increased the value of CVX stock. Wars between coumntries rarely last long and usually end in a ceasefire, de facto or de jure. Even if the war drags on for a long time, countries such as China and India continue to buy significant amounts of discounted Russian oil, alleviating the demand for Middle Eastern energy. That will undoubtedly result in oil prices falling further over the longer term. For these reasons, CVX is among the top stocks to sell for 2023.McKesson Corporation (MCK)McKesson headquarters in Irving, TXSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comMcKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) has grown tremendously over the past year, and its stock has climbed more than 52% during that period. The company’s remarkable financials and rising profit margins have compelled investors to pay a fortune for this stock, but the trend could soon reverse.The company’s stock is simply too expensive in this environment. Its price-earnings ratio is currently  26.75 times, which does not look too high considering its powerful growth. However, its Shiller P/E ratio, which “eliminates fluctuation of the ratio caused by the variation of profit margins during business cycles,” stands at 73.4 times. That’s worse than 91.3% of companies in the Medical Distribution industry. Further, a number of the company’s insiders have sold MCK stock recently.Overall, MCK is overdue for a significant correction. A similar correction to the downturn that the shares experienced in 2015 is likely as the firm’s fundamentals adjust to a tightening economy.On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

56,60834232-b378-3bc7-9839-234050b92cad,DIS,2023-01-02,Is There An Opportunity With The Walt Disney Company's (NYSE:DIS) 39% Undervaluation?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/opportunity-walt-disney-companys-nyse-110012442.html,1672657212,STORY,['DIS'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Walt Disney Is Walt Disney Fairly Valued?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$5.37bUS$8.16bUS$10.4bUS$14.2bUS$16.1bUS$17.5bUS$18.7bUS$19.7bUS$20.5bUS$21.2bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x9Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 8.66%Est @ 6.66%Est @ 5.25%Est @ 4.27%Est @ 3.58% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.1% US$5.0kUS$7.0kUS$8.2kUS$10.4kUS$10.9kUS$11.0kUS$10.9kUS$10.6kUS$10.2kUS$9.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$94bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$21b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.1%– 2.0%) = US$356bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$356b÷ ( 1 + 8.1%)10= US$164bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$258b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$86.9, the company appears quite undervalued at a 39% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Walt Disney as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.092. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Walt DisneyStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessNo major weaknesses identified for DIS.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

It has made $1.38 billion worldwide since its release on Dec. 16.That puts Disney’s film on track to surpass the $1.49 billion in sales for Paramount Global’s Top Gun: Maverick, the current highest-grossing film released in 2022. Both studios have some bragging rights. The Tom Cruise fighter-jet movie made the most money at domestic theaters within the year, while The Way of Water tops it internationally.The weekend performance demonstrates the unusual staying power of the Avatar franchise. The Way of Water didn’t even have one of the top three domestic openings of 2022. Its 2009 predecessor Avatar also started out slowly, but ultimately sold a record $2.92 billion worth of tickets.Visual effects, and the use of novel 3D-viewing technologies, have been a selling point for both movies. Avatar films incorporate the real-life movements of actors playing members of an indigenous Na’vi humanoid race into on-screen animation. The use of the tech helped make the movies some of the most expensive ever produced.The Way of Water is probably on course to at least break even financially, an accomplishment given its high production costs. That bodes well for a series of sequels Disney has planned for the franchise through 2028. The Burbank, California, entertainment giant acquired the rights to the James Cameron films as part of a $71 billion acquisition of 20th Century Fox in 2019.Story continuesDespite several strong performances theaters still had a bad year, compared to pre-pandemic times. North American box office sales reached about $7.46 billion in 2022, far less than the $11.4 billion sales figure from 2019, Comscore estimated.Part of the decline is because Covid-19 left movie-release schedules in such disarray they could take years to untangle. Audiences have also been conditioned to watch new films at home.

Major American equity markets fell into bear market territory. Most international markets didn’t fare much better. Meanwhile, fixed income failed to protect investors from volatility amid an unprecedented surge in inflation. However, the big drop in asset prices has created some real opportunities for investors in long-term stocks. 2022 was interesting in that almost all companies sold off meaningfully, regardless of how well they’d fared in the past. This has put some tremendous long-term stocks at more approachable starting valuations.For the list below, all the long-term stocks profiled have increased in value at least 300% over the past 10 years. And, that’s even counting 2022’s declines. These seven companies have all showed amazing historical success. While some are currently facing significant short-term headwinds, all seven of these have a good probability of returning to their high-octane performance ways once this current market downturn lets up.NFLXNetflix$291.12ROPRoper Technologies$436.87ZTSZoetis$148.15VVisa$208.06HEIHeico$153.47URIUnited Rentals$356.21HIFSHingham Institution for Savings$275.49InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNetflix (NFLX)An image of a phone with the Netflix logo on the screen, laying next to a container of popcorn with popcorn splayed acrossSource: xalien / ShutterstockAfter losing roughly half its value in 2022, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) might not seem like a winner anymore. However, don’t let the recent past color your perspective too much. NFLX stock, even after its large drop in 2022, is still up nearly 2,000% over the past 10 years. Shares were trading at just $14 (split-adjusted) at the start of 2013, after all.The company’s subscriber slowdown is well-known. The streaming wars have put pressure on everyone, including the market leader, Netflix. Shares plummeted in early 2022 as Netflix shocked the market with net subscriber losses.However, Netflix has now returned to growth, with subscriber Q3 numbers surging ahead of expectations. Netflix, unlike many tech companies, is also already significantly profitable, giving it plenty of flexibility while working through this current slowdown in the streaming space. It won’t be an overnight return back to all-time high stock prices, but the Netflix story is picking up steam once again, and may be one of the most solid long-term stocks to consider.Story continuesRoper Technologies (ROP)A man examines a digital screen with different icons for software.Source: ShutterstockRoper Technologies (NYSE:ROP) is a software conglomerate, and is another one of the most solid long-term stocks to consider. The firm initially focused on industrial manufacturing, but, over the years, it has exited most direct industrial businesses and instead evolved to become a software provider to those sorts of companies. Today, Roper has software for managing power plants, insurance, architecture and engineering, trucking, and much more.ROP stock has posted exceptional returns primarily for two reasons. One, management is constantly buying more software companies to add to the fold. And, since it operates in less glamorous markets than many software rivals, it can buy businesses at much more reasonable valuations.In addition to acquisitions, Roper has another tool at its disposal. The company earns a lot of license fees for software in advance. This is called deferred revenue, as Roper gets paid up front but delivers those contractual software services over a period of months and years. In the meantime, Roper can immediately roll that upfront revenue into making more software acquisitions, which helps keep the ball rolling.Roper’s tremendous capital allocation skills over the years have led to the company producing a 15.1% annualized total return over the past decade. That’s an excellent result from a seemingly mundane collection of software assets.Zoetis (ZTS)A terrier lies on a dog bed with a cone on.Source: ShutterstockZoetis (NYSE:ZTS) is the largest player in the animal health industry. The company produces vaccines, parasite-killers, and anti-infective drugs for animals. It also sells diagnostic tools and instruments for animal care. Zoetis has a fairly even sales split between pets and commercial animals such as pigs, livestock, and poultry.Despite the company’s considerable success over the past decade, Zoetis might not be a household name yet. That’s probably because the company was the long-time animal health division of Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). It only became an independent company and completed its initial public offering (IPO) in 2013. However, Zoetis’ roots, within Pfizer, go back to the 1950s.gZTS stock is now up more than 330% since its 2013 IPO. However, gains were much larger prior to 2022. That’s because shares pulled back 40% over the past year. Investors dumped any and all stocks related to animal health as the pandemic-related animal adoption boom came to an abrupt end. Regardless, while animal companionship enthusiasm has returned to more normal levels, the longer-term demand for better quality pet care isn’t going anywhere, and Zoetis will be back to its winning ways soon.Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comAnother one of the top long-term stocks to consider is Visa (NYSE:V), one of the world’s two primary credit card networks. It, along with Mastercard (NYSE:MA), has a dominant position in commerce virtually everywhere across the globe. The company’s results were disrupted during the pandemic. The card companies rely heavily on international payments as they can charge much higher fees on cross-border transactions as opposed to domestic ones. Visa shares have remained depressed over the past year as it has taken longer than hoped for international tourism to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, the threat of a recession lingers as the calendar turns to 2023.That said, Visa has been an incredible compounder since going public, and its long-term prospects are as strong as ever. If anything, the past couple years were a boon to the company, as many vendors — particularly in emerging markets — finally started adopting touchless payments while trying to de-emphasize the use of physical cash.In any case, V stock has been flat for the past three years, which sets it up for a solid breakout once this consolidation period ends. Besides that, shares are now at less than 25 times forward earnings, whereas Visa has historically traded closer to 30 times earnings.Heico (HEI)image of a plane flying in the sky representing airline stocksSource: ShutterstockOftentimes, the biggest market winners are found in unlikely places. One such case is airplane parts manufacturer Heico (NYSE:HEI). It produces components for jet engines, structural and mechanical plane pieces, insulation and so on for various types of aircraft.This may sound like a dull business, but its returns have been anything but. HEI stock is up a jaw-dropping 775% over the past decade. How has the company achieved such a feat? It is an M&amp;A machine, constantly buying up other small aerospace parts makers. Meanwhile, competition is limited as there is a high regulatory barrier to getting approval for making new airplane components. In effect, Heico has something close to a monopoly for many of the parts that it makes.This sort of unbeatable economics tied to a large and growing industry with numerous acquisition candidates has made Heico an all-star performer. Shares may seem exceptionally expensive at 50 times earnings today. However, Heico has a tendency to grow earnings so quickly that the starting valuation hasn’t mattered too much. If shares pull back during a potential 2023 recession, investors should put Heico at the top of their long-term stock watchlist.United Rentals (URI)image of businessman holding a fiery arrow that's heading in an upward trajectorySource: ShutterstockUnited Rentals (NYSE:URI) is another firm with an unbelievably profitable niche. The company owns a variety of expensive equipment and rents it out to contractors and other professionals that need a specific tool for a short period of time. United offers backhoes, loaders, earthmoving equipment, water pumps, power tools and so on.Like Heico, this may seem like a mundane business, but shares are up more than 700% since 2013. United Rentals has created a powerful business model, buying equipment with cheaply-borrowed capital and then renting it out at a substantial premium to its ownership cost. The firm has a scale advantage over mom-and-pop rental shops since it can borrow funds more cheaply and get better terms when buying equipment in large quantities.United Rentals also benefits from having a large pool of acquisition targets. It can buy up the countless smaller rental companies that come onto the market during economic downturns or when an owner wants to get out of the business.Shares are currently at a muted valuation, trading at just 11 times forward earnings. This is presumably due to worries that the business will slow down during a potential recession. However, United Rentals has proven adept at navigating complicated economic conditions before, and long-term investors will likely be richly rewarded for hanging in there during the current uncertainty.Hingham Institution For Savings (HIFS)Finger pointing at the word ""banking""Source: PopTika/ShutterStock.comMost investors probably don’t think of banks as big long-term stock winners. The skepticism certainly makes sense after the horrific performance we saw from the financial sector in 2008. That said, not all banks are created equal. Hingham Institution For Savings (NASDAQ:HIFS) is America’s most efficient multi-branch bank. Efficiency, in banks, is a metric of a bank’s income versus its overhead expenses. Hingham’s unmatched efficiency is thanks to its laser focus on costs, along with having a large amount of deposits per branch, giving it unmatched scale effeciencies.Hingham has shown superior capital allocation skills, which has powered its double-digit annualized total returns dating back to the mid-1990s. Over the past ten years, HIFS stock has soared 325%. Despite that rally, shares remain at a reasonable price, going for 14 times forward earnings. Adding to that HIFS stock pulled back around 30% in 2022 thanks to economic uncertainty, giving investors a much better entry point going forward.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in HIFS, ROP, and V stock.

This makes the dividend yield 1.6%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely. Check out our latest analysis for Oracle Oracle's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. However, prior to this announcement, Oracle's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 49.8% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 29%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendOracle Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.24 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.28. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 18% per annum over that time. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.Oracle Could Grow Its DividendInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Oracle has impressed us by growing EPS at 6.6% per year over the past five years. Oracle definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio.Oracle Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Oracle might even raise payments in the future. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. For instance, we've picked out 2 warning signs for Oracle that investors should take into consideration. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

(NYSE:PLD) sold US$7.5m worth of stock, possibly indicating weakness in the future",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-prologis-inc-nyse-pld-140024436.html,1672581624,STORY,['PLD'],"[In the last year, many Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Prologis The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At PrologisThe Lead Independent Director, Irving Lyons, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$7.3m worth of shares at a price of US$165 each. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$113). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 24.00k shares for US$2.8m. But they sold 45.74k shares for US$7.5m. All up, insiders sold more shares in Prologis than they bought, over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeI will like Prologis better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Prologis Insiders Bought Stock RecentlyIt's good to see that Prologis insiders have made notable investments in the company's shares. Independent Director David O’Connor spent US$1.0m on stock, and there wasn't any selling. This could be interpreted as suggesting a positive outlook.Story continuesInsider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Prologis insiders own about US$111m worth of shares (which is 0.1% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The Prologis Insider Transactions Indicate?It is good to see the recent insider purchase. On the other hand the transaction history, over the last year, isn't so positive. The recent buying by an insider , along with high insider ownership, suggest that Prologis insiders are fairly aligned, and optimistic. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for Prologis (of which 1 is a bit concerning!) you should know about.But note: Prologis may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

68,02823411-e4fb-3e7d-a3fb-cbf1ab3ed598,RHI,2023-01-02,Stock Market Outlook for 2023: 7 Things for Investors to Expect,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-outlook-2023-7-223339479.html,1672353219,STORY,"['RDFN', 'LMT', 'PYPL', 'RHI', 'ALRM']","[With the benchmark equities index recently falling to around 20% below parity, investors have begun earnestly researching topics related to a stock market outlook for 2023. To be sure, publicly broadcasting predictions can either make one look like a genius or a complete clown. In this business, I’ve had experiences with both. Nevertheless, I’m going to try to bring some reasonable forecasts to the table.If a central theme exists to any stock market outlook for 2023, it could be a focus on transitions. Early in the coronavirus pandemic, many policymakers responded to the immediate needs of their constituents. Unsurprisingly, these actions sparked massive changes in the stock market. However, with the Covid-19 crisis largely fading, the government must now prioritize normalization.In turn, we could suffer some growing pains as we transition from one paradigm to another. And this too will cause undulations (including occasional sharp gyrations) to the equities sector. To prep for this possible coming circumstance, below is my stock market outlook for 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHousing Market DeclinesFlat cut-out image of house jammed into the crack of dry desert, symbolizing housing crisisSource: shutterstock.com/Roman BodnarchukAlthough a contentious issue, in terms of a stock market outlook for 2023, I see major problems with real estate. It really comes down to the Federal Reserve’s commitment to tackling inflation through raising the benchmark interest rate. Throughout this year, the central bank consistently and aggressively hiked rates. Further, the latest jobs report suggests that policymakers will be keen on killing inflation next year.Unfortunately for the Fed, the hotter-than-expected November employment numbers indicated that its measures failed to resonate. Therefore, to get a true hold on rising prices, the gloves must come off. Frankly, that’s a scary thought for folks that need to borrow money. And it could be an uppercut blow to the housing market.Without getting into complicated narratives, I just go with this one truism: you can have higher rates or higher prices but you can’t have both at the same time. To be fair, many if not most homeowners currently sit on massive equity. Still, layoffs at scale – stemming from higher rates – could force more home sales at discounted prices. It’s just my opinion but I would stay away from names like Redfin (NASDAQ:RDFN) which have struggled badly in 2022.Story continuesWFH EndsA woman is sitting at a table and working on a laptop.Source: ShutterstockIf any obvious benefit materialized from the awful Covid-19 crisis, it’s that the pandemic forced Americans to rethink work. Once a privilege – which occasionally led to snide bickering among the less privileged – working from home (WFH) enabled corporate America to stay afloat during the catastrophe. Of course, with the genie being let out of the bottle, very few wanted to return to business as usual.Unfortunately for America’s white-collar employees, WFH may come to an end next year. As I’ve cited many times, Resume Builder reports that “90% of companies will require employees to return to office in 2023.” Not only that, “21% of companies will fire workers who do not return to the office.”While revolting against your boss sounds like a morally righteous idea, here’s a tip: you don’t want to be the guy (or gal) to get let go during a recession. And you especially don’t want to be let go for stupid reasons like insubordination for refusing to do, you know, your job.Therefore, my stock market outlook for 2023 involves a cynically bullish take on companies like Robert Half International (NYSE:RHI). Invariably, some folks will learn the hard way. And they’ll be scrambling for employment.Gig Economy Risesgig economy stocks to buySource: ShutterstockInterestingly, the above stock market outlook for 2023 enjoys a counterpart. Recently, I came across a BBC News article that detailed the story of one worker who quit because of a return-to-the-office mandate. Let me just stress again how utterly stupid such a move is if you don’t have an alternative situation lined up.Forget the political correctness, forget about a stock market outlook for 2023. The best thing you can do for yourself next year is to not be stupid.Anyways, the possibly next best thing you can do for yourself in 2023 is to consider companies that may rise on the burgeoning gig economy. Let’s think about it this way. Working from home has been so important for employees that they’ll risk nuking their careers (and reputations) for the privilege. A less-painful method to making this lifestyle permanent is to become independent contractors (i.e. gig workers).Globally, the gig economy featured a valuation of $355 billion in 2021. By 2027, experts project that this segment will reach a value of $873 billion. Therefore, one should target companies like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), which offer freelancers digital payment processing and business management services.Defense Stays RelevantA photograph of two jet fighters flying above clouds.Source: ShutterstockGiven the controversial nature of the publicly traded defense segment, it doesn’t represent the most popular avenue for profits. While I wouldn’t say that contractors in this space carry nearly the same toxicity as privately owned prisons, for many investors, the sector carries unwanted juju. I get it. At the same time, as a viable stock market outlook for 2023, it’s unignorable.Obviously, the most pressing concern for the entire planet centers on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. According to the latest information from The New York Times, peace talks remain a far-off proposition. And any kind of negotiations that involve ceding of land will likely be a non-starter. Imagine if someone burgled your home and offered part of your belongings back in exchange for you not calling the police. Again, it’s a non-starter.Further, U.S. support of Ukraine isn’t just a matter of Ukrainian independence, as beautiful of a story that it is. Rather, Washington must keep Moscow in check. Otherwise, it sends a signal to other aggressive or imperialistic nations – read China – that it’s okay to invade sovereign countries. Therefore, whether we like it or not, companies like Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) will be extraordinarily relevant as a stock market outlook for 2023.Personal Security Draws Attentiona business man pressing a button with an open lock on it that's connected to a symbol of a cloud and various security related iconsSource: ShutterstockStaying in line with a controversial segment, another stock market outlook for 2023 centers on personal security. During the height of the Covid-19 crisis, another crisis materialized, that of social inequality. Frankly, it was difficult to ignore that the rich got richer during the pandemic. Indeed, government data on the wealth gap demonstrates that the ultra-affluent won big.Invariably, the combustible mix of a once-in-a-blue-moon pandemic and severe wealth disparities sparked protests across the nation. Sadly, many innocent people got caught in the crossfires of this smoldering social conflict. Frankly, we’re still healing from the opened wounds, putting a focus on personal safety and protection.Early in 2022, The Wall Street Journal noted that law enforcement agencies lost many police officers. As well, they struggled to replace them. Increasingly, the occupation has become a thankless job while remaining incredibly dangerous, if not more so. Put another way, regular folks increasingly must take care of themselves. Personally, my stock market outlook for 2023 on this subject matter would involve considering firms like Alarm.com (NASDAQ:ALRM). Specializing in home automation and monitoring services, ALRM could be surprisingly buoyant.Focus on the FamilyMan in suit with hands over paper cutouts of family, car and home. Represents insurance.Source: thodonal88 / Shutterstock.comWith rising interest rates next year seemingly a sure thing based on prior Fed comments, the insurance sector may play a significant role regarding a stock market outlook for 2023. Based on historical trends, insurance stocks share a direct relationship with benchmark rates. In other words, as rates rise, so too does the valuation of publicly traded insurance providers.Of course, insurance represents a varied field. In particular, though, the life insurance segment may enjoy a demand influx. Fundamentally, the Covid-19 crisis forced people to recognize their own mortality. In addition, the pandemic popped the illusory bubble that people living in developed nations tend to operate under. Thanks to the interconnected world, a health conflagration in one part of the plant can contaminate others alarmingly quickly.Essentially, anything can happen to anyone at any time. A U.S. passport will not mitigate certain vulnerabilities. Many more people realize this crude reality following the pandemic. Thus, for the sake of protecting loved ones, life insurance providers may rise. And that may bode well for leaders in the space like MetLife (NYSE:MET). Sure enough, MET is up around 14% for the year.Big Tech Recoverscommunication technology for internet business. global world network and telecommunication on earthSource: greenbutterfly / Shutterstock.comNot surprisingly, the broader technology sector suffered disproportionately from the myriad headwinds of 2022. Regarding the sector, the global supply chain disruption negatively impacted the flow of semiconductors, leading to chaos in the early phases of the Covid-19 crisis. However, just as companies started to improve their inventory levels, demand erosion then led to supply imbalance concerns.Further, the Fed has been no friend to tech-centric names. Generally speaking, enterprises in the innovation space focus on growth rather than earnings. This framework ran beautifully during a dovish monetary environment. However, under an increasingly tight dovish one, the rise in borrowing costs disincentivizes expansionary endeavors. Certainly, several startups in the field may suffer continued declines.Nevertheless, big tech – I’m thinking presently embattled names like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) – may be due for a big comeback. True, many of these entities suffer from a credibility crisis. Still, as a stock market outlook for 2023, the reality is that their underlying platforms offer extraordinary relevancies.For instance, should people lose their jobs, they’re going to turn to Google. Or they may try to network on Facebook. In other words, some services are too vital to ignore.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

70,23988349-e8c3-34bc-be9a-9f410d815e3e,AXP,2023-01-02,American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 65% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-express-company-nyse-axp-130030626.html,1672578030,STORY,['AXP'],"[If you want to know who really controls American Express Company (NYSE:AXP), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 65% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about American Express. See our latest analysis for American Express ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About American Express?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.American Express already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see American Express' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. American Express is not owned by hedge funds. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 20% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.3% and 6.0%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 12 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of American ExpressThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of American Express Company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$129m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Public Company OwnershipIt appears to us that public companies own 20% of American Express. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that  American Express is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. For example, the Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc. (NASDAQ:COKE) share price has soared 154% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. It's also good to see the share price up 19% over the last quarter.With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. Check out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Consolidated There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During the five years of share price growth, Coca-Cola Consolidated moved from a loss to profitability. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Coca-Cola Consolidated's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Coca-Cola Consolidated's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Coca-Cola Consolidated's TSR for the last 5 years was 158%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Coca-Cola Consolidated returned a loss of 17% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 22%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 21%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Coca-Cola Consolidated better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Coca-Cola Consolidated , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

(NASDAQ:INTU),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-intrinsic-value-intuit-inc-110033915.html,1672657233,STORY,['INTU'],"[Does the January share price for Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Intuit Is Intuit Fairly Valued?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.20bUS$5.00bUS$5.65bUS$6.49bUS$7.47bUS$8.20bUS$8.80bUS$9.31bUS$9.74bUS$10.1bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x12Analyst x8Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 9.68%Est @ 7.37%Est @ 5.75%Est @ 4.62%Est @ 3.83% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.7% US$3.9kUS$4.3kUS$4.5kUS$4.8kUS$5.2kUS$5.3kUS$5.2kUS$5.2kUS$5.0kUS$4.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$48bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$10b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.7%– 2.0%) = US$181bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$181b÷ ( 1 + 7.7%)10= US$87bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$135b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$389, the company appears about fair value at a 19% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Intuit as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.020. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for IntuitStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Software market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Intuit, we've put together three additional factors you should further examine:Risks: As an example, we've found 2 warning signs for Intuit that you need to consider before investing here.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for INTU's future outlook?

As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. In this article, we decided to focus on Stryker's  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Stryker How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Stryker is:15% = US$2.5b ÷ US$16b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.15 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Stryker's Earnings Growth And 15% ROEAt first glance, Stryker seems to have a decent ROE. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 11% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. Yet, Stryker has posted measly growth of 2.3% over the past five years. This is interesting as the high returns should mean that the company has the ability to generate high growth but for some reason, it hasn't been able to do so. We reckon that a low growth, when returns are quite high could be the result of certain circumstances like low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Stryker's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 17% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is SYK worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether SYK is currently mispriced by the market.Is Stryker Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Despite having a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 49% (implying that the company retains the remaining 51% of its income), Stryker's earnings growth was quite low. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.Moreover, Stryker has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 31% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 20% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.SummaryOn the whole, we do feel that Stryker has some positive attributes. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

Given the cyclical nature of the capital markets, several folks hold out hope that the new year can bring good tidings. While that certainly might happen for specific sectors, it’s best to prepare for a wide range of outcomes. Flexibility will be key moving forward.Nevertheless, when it comes to stock market trends to watch in 2023, investors may bank on well-established trajectories. Fundamentally, the Federal Reserve’s commitment to attacking inflation through raising the benchmark interest rate dominates broader market and economic discourses. Essentially, developed societies must undo the excesses that helped us get through the coronavirus pandemic. Unfortunately, this action will almost surely incur growing pains.Ultimately, then, a balanced approach will likely be pivotal in additional to the aforementioned flexibility. To gear up for another 365 days, below are the biggest stock market trends to watch in 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsInterest Rates RiseA question mark among various percentages.. higher interest ratesSource: travellight / Shutterstock.comAs mentioned above, one of the top stock market trends to watch in 2023 will be the Fed. Throughout the outgoing year, the central bank aggressively smashed the accelerator of its tightening monetary policy. In theory, the associated rise in borrowing costs should cool inflation. However, the latest hotter-than-expected Nov. jobs report suggested that policymakers still have some ways to go.Fundamentally, the fact that there are still more dollars chasing after fewer goods worries market investors. Under this scenario, interest rates will continue to rise. However, an article by the Atlantic Council noted that Russia’s defeat (in its invasion of Ukraine) represents the top global priority for the new year.To be fair, the Atlantic Council piece is an op-ed so it’s speculation to ascertain what the Fed is thinking. However, it’s quite possible that policymakers have other goals besides inflation in mind regarding its monetary tightening. Either way, rising interest rates pings as one of the stock market trends to watch in 2023.Story continuesDefense Industry BoomsSource: ShutterstockOn a related note, those eyeballing the biggest stock market trends to watch in 2023 must put the defense sector in their crosshairs. Naturally, sector stalwarts like Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) cynically benefitted from the conflict. So too did smaller players like AeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV), which develops the Switchblade drones.Of course, defense-related stock market trends to watch in 2023 carry a controversial profile. For instance, you can make the argument that the Russians are the “bad guys” for dismissing diplomacy altogether. At the end of the day, none of this terrible destruction would have happened if cooler heads prevailed. Then again, human life is human life – and the poor almost always suffer at the hands of the elite.Still, we must accept the geopolitical new normal of alarming flashpoints poised to escalate: Taiwan, China, Iran, North Korea, to name but a few. Recently, tensions between Serbia and Kosovo flared up. With the world rapidly becoming a dangerous place, the defense industry will almost surely boom.Insurance RenaissanceSource: ShutterstockIf one sector enjoyed consistently strong demand throughout 2022, it would be the broader insurance sector. With so many uncertainties on the horizon, I don’t see anything changing in the new year. Therefore, one of the biggest stock market trends to watch in 2023 centers on an otherwise incredibly boring industry.Though an enterprise which arguably most folks take for granted, Progressive (NYSE:PGR) blossomed in the outgoing year. Since its January opener, shares gained over 27%. Fundamentally, Progressive benefits from a hostage audience, particularly with its auto insurance programs. As well, the Covid-19 crisis and the subsequent surge in serious car accidents provided a significant boost: a rise in volatile driving incentivized people to maximize their coverage.Another point about the insurance segment focuses on inelastic demand. Basically, irrespective of price fluctuations, enterprises benefitting from inelastic demand will see consistent, predictable sales influxes. Again, it’s hard to imagine how this sentiment will change given the lessons learned from the pandemic.Crypto WinterCrypto coins on a phone screen showing stats for various cryptocurrencies.. Cryptos to WatchSource: Chinnapong / ShutterstockIt’s probably safe to say that announcing belief in an extended cryptocurrency winter will not represent one of the most encouraging stock market trends to watch in 2023. To be fair, part of that assessment centers on the asset class itself. Cryptos represent their own thing if you will. So, it doesn’t have anything to do with the equities sector.To that, I’ll counter by referencing crypto pricing dynamics tend to follow the same indices as the equities sector. In particular, benchmark digital assets share a very strong statistical correlation with the real M2 money stock.  Put another way, as the money supply increases (inflation), crypto valuations tend to rise as well. However, when the money supply decreases (deflation), cryptos suffer losses.While it’s true that virtual currencies and stocks are different, because of the popularity of the former, publicly traded blockchain enterprises exist. However, if you give credence to the crypto winter concept, then these blockchain firms may suffer substantially.Gold Shines BrightAn image of multiple gold barsSource: ShutterstockA time used to exist when gold and other precious metals – not cryptos – represented the “in” alternative asset. In the run up to and during the Great Recession, a new generation of doomsday-bunker prophets warned America to buy gold and avoid the horrors of hyperinflation. The thing is, it’s 2022 and some are still beating the long-expired gold-and-silver horse.Nevertheless, even a broken clock is accurate twice during a 24-hour cycle. And it’s possible that one of the biggest stock market trends to watch in 2023 is the gold market. Laugh all you want but the yellow metal has been making some strong moves since early November this year. On an average basis, the spot price of gold bullion stands above both its 50 and 200-day moving averages.Fundamentally, it’s possible that the fear trade may spark interest in precious metals. Because these commodities command universally accepted intrinsic value, they offer wealth stability. You might not get rich with bullion. But you probably won’t go bankrupt either (since they probably won’t go to zero).Wear and Teara group of appliances in front of a blue wall, including a washing machine, a refrigerator, a microwave and moreSource: shutterstock.com/Digital GeneticsWhen assessing the biggest stock market trends to watch in 2023, it’s helpful to think fourth dimensionally if you will. By this, I’m simply referring to the recognition that subsegments in the economy typically don’t operate in a vacuum. What affects one sector can very well impact another. And that’s where the angle of wear and tear comes to the forefront.Among individual names for stock market trends to watch in 2023, my radar targets Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR). Ordinarily, appliance manufacturers don’t generate much interest. Sure enough, WHR fell almost 41% on a year-to-date basis. However, because of work-from-home policies, our appliances are incurring much greater usage. Just by mechanical realities, the “scheduled” failure rate of these appliances will be pushed up.Another idea to consider under this theme is Valvoline (NYSE:VVV). Amid rising layoffs at blue-chip firms, employers command greater negotiating power. And most of them could recall their workers, leading to increased vehicle usage. Cynically, this dynamic should boost VVV, making it among the intriguing stock market trends to watch in 2023.EV-Only Crowd SuffersIllustration of blue electric vehicle (EV) charging with dark black backgroundSource: shutterstock.com/DigitalPenIf you’ve watched Fox News – specifically its editorial arm – you’ll know it leans a bit to the right. Okay, let’s be real: the only turns on Fox News are right ones. That’s why it was so remarkable to hear pundits on this conservative outlet sing the praise of Japanese auto giant Toyota (NYSE:TM). Specifically, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee supported Toyota head Akio Toyoda’s “silent majority” remark.Essentially, Toyota represents an odd man out regarding not making an all-in wager on electric vehicles. Instead, it continues to build combustion, hybrid and EVs, enabling choices for consumers across the earnings spectrum. While EVs may very well be the future of transportation, TM’s leadership team argues that the infrastructure just isn’t ready.Further, EVs remain pound-for-pound incredibly expensive compared to what you can get on the combustion side. With both monetary policy and job losses imposing severe pressure on the consumer economy, people will be looking for cheap transportation. Thus, in terms of stock market trends to watch in 2023, EVs might not be poised for a recovery if the economy doesn’t cooperate.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

This was further compounded by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, constricting supply and consequently positively impacting share prices. However, the Federal Reserve’s efforts to curb inflation have normalized energy prices in recent months. Nevertheless, given the geopolitical situation and macroeconomic climate, there are plenty of energy stocks to watch.Energy stocks have had a great run for the better part of the year, but have dropped a fair share in recent months. Moreover, despite the Fed’s commitment to a hawkish policy, the erosion of purchasing power will take some time to fix, which bodes well for energy stocks. Therefore, buying discounted oil stocks now could pay off big time for anyone with faith in this market.CVXChevron$178.32VWDRYVestas Wind Systems$9.68COPConocoPhillips$116.39ARRYArray Technologies$19.03VLOValero Energy$126.32WDSWoodside Energy$23.93EPSNEpsilon Energy$6.62InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsChevron (CVX)Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper buildingSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comChevron (NYSE:CVX) had a banner year on the back of robust oil prices. Though earnings are likely to normalize next year, there is still every reason to remain optimistic about their CVX stock. As an income investment, Chevron offers an incredible dividend yield with consistent distributions to shareholders over the years. Going into 2023 and beyond, Chevron has the potential to be more than just an income play; if market conditions improve, investors could continue to grow returns in the future.In the third quarter, the energy giant reported impressive earnings of $11.2 billion and distributed $2.7 billion back to shareholders. Moreover, with a payout ratio of 0.32, it can continue to pay a high dividend for the foreseeable future. Chevron hasn’t reduced its dividend since 1988, a testament to its commitment to rewarding its shareholders.Story continuesVestas Wind Systems (VWDRY)A shot of wind energy mills with green hills and the skyline in the background.Source: ShutterstockVestas Wind Systems (OTCMKTS:VWDRY) is a leading wind energy company, and one of the leading green energy picks for 2023. With forward-thinking business operations and long-term sustainability initiatives, Vestas should remain at the forefront not only in 2023 but well into the post-carbon future.Wind-generated electricity is an increasingly important part of the U.S.’s overall production, accounting for a sizeable 10.2% of total power output. This is expected to become even more pronounced in the coming years, with the wind power market projected to increase at an impressive average annual rate of 9.4% between 2022 and 2030. Wind energy companies such as Vestas are set to reap substantial rewards from this trend. In its most recent quarter, the firm’s turbine order and services backlog remain sizable at €‎18.1 billion and €‎32.8 billion, respectively. Moreover, the stock is currently trading at below ten dollars, with plenty of upside ahead.ConocoPhillips (COP)a sign in front of the Conoco Philips office buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is another top pick in the energy space for 2023. The oil giant had an incredibly successful year in 2022, as its net income nearly doubled in the third quarter. The stellar financial performance resulted from superb management decisions, effective cost management and a red-hot market for fossil fuels.Moreover, with its incredible financial stability, ConocoPhillips is in a great position to continue on its current trajectory. Whether it’s investing in new projects and acquisitions or simply building up an even larger cushion for leaner times, the company having an impressive $8 billion in cash on hand is likely to ensure more growth over the coming years. Its current cash balance is an amazing 59% improvement from the same period last year. With such sound footing, ConocoPhillips looks primed to take off next year.Array Technologies (ARRY)Clean energy stocks: Rows of solar panels are lined up around a center aisle.Source: ShutterstockArray Technologies (NASDAQ:ARRY) is a leading supplier of solar tracking systems in the U.S. and internationally. With a series of successful acquisitions, Array Technologies has made great strides in 2022. Its third-quarter performance was especially impressive, showing a whopping 173% increase in sales from last year, making it a highly attractive renewable energy play.In January, Array Technologies made a bold move with its acquisition of STI Norland, a top Spanish solar tracker and fixed structure manufacturer. Consequently, Array’s revenues rose dramatically, and the firm could post $28.6 million in net income in the third quarter. A year prior, it had lost $33 million in revenue, which called into question its financial standing. Now, investors in Array Technologies can be more confident about its future prospects in a more conducive environment next year.Valero Energy (VLO)A daytime picture of a Valero (VLO) gas station located in San Francisco bay and clear blue sky in the background.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comValero Energy (NYSE:VLO) is an industry leader in the global energy sector, and its impressive refinery portfolio reflects this. Not only does Valero own and operate refineries across North America, but it has also extended operations to the U.K., cementing its international presence. Valero’s contributions to the global energy sector have established it as a top-tier organization that demonstrates unparalleled commitment to energy production while upholding environmental standards. Their efforts afford them prime positioning in the industry, allowing them further growth opportunities with respect to both production and knowledge when looking towards the future of energy development worldwide.The past few months have been incredibly exciting for Valero – the refining giant has seen refining margins soar due to fundamental factors, and are reaping huge rewards as a result. With no new refineries coming online for many years, existing infrastructure is being relied upon more heavily to meet consumer demand. Thankfully, Valero is well equipped to handle this strong demand; not only do they possess enough capacity to make sure their products are available when consumers need them, but they can also operate their existing refineries at a much higher rate than normal. This means that by taking advantage of high demand and prices hitting new highs, Valero is able to deliver more output and make more profit than ever before.Woodside Energy (WDS)Several natural gas tanks with a sunrise in the backgroundSource: OlegRi / ShutterstockWoodside Energy (NYSE:WDS) based in Perth, Australia, and representing the country’s largest independent dedicated oil and gas company, has been a major player in the energy industry for many years. Like other companies in the sector, the company has grown its sales and EBITDA by triple-digit margins in the past year.Based on the robust natural gas and liquified natural gas prospects, the firm has a tremendous growth runway ahead. Moreover, it has an excellent track record of paying roughly 80% of its profits as dividends. Also, it boasts a robust balance sheet with incredible liquidity metrics. Hence, from a fundamentals perspective, it’s one of the best oil and gas players with strong wiggle room for long-term expansion.Epsilon Energy (EPSN)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump.

80,c68e1190-392d-3cca-9a1f-fd686ee4697a,UNH,2023-01-02,"With 89% ownership of the shares, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/89-ownership-shares-unitedhealth-group-110020271.html,1672657220,STORY,['UNH'],"[A look at the shareholders of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 89% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of UnitedHealth Group, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About UnitedHealth Group?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that UnitedHealth Group does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at UnitedHealth Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in UnitedHealth Group. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.9% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.6% and 7.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 16 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of UnitedHealth GroupWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$1.7b worth of shares. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 11% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over UnitedHealth Group. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand UnitedHealth Group better, we need to consider many other factors. Be aware that  UnitedHealth Group is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

We'll use ROE to examine Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT), by way of a worked example.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for Federal Realty Investment Trust How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Federal Realty Investment Trust is:12% = US$395m ÷ US$3.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.12 in profit.Does Federal Realty Investment Trust Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Federal Realty Investment Trust has a better ROE than the average (6.9%) in the REITs industry.roeThat's what we like to see. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . To know the 3 risks we have identified for Federal Realty Investment Trust visit our risks dashboard for free.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesCombining Federal Realty Investment Trust's Debt And Its 12% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Federal Realty Investment Trust, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.36. While its ROE is pretty respectable, the amount of debt the company is carrying currently is not ideal. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.But note: Federal Realty Investment Trust may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

(NASDAQ:REGN)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-regeneron-pharmaceuticals-140044277.html,1672581644,STORY,['REGN'],"[Does the January share price for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Step By Step Through The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.05bUS$4.41bUS$3.83bUS$4.25bUS$4.73bUS$4.87bUS$5.00bUS$5.12bUS$5.23bUS$5.35bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 2.87%Est @ 2.60%Est @ 2.42%Est @ 2.29%Est @ 2.19% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.7% US$3.8kUS$3.9kUS$3.2kUS$3.3kUS$3.4kUS$3.3kUS$3.2kUS$3.1kUS$2.9kUS$2.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$33bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.3b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.7%– 2.0%) = US$117bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$117b÷ ( 1 + 6.7%)10= US$61bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$94b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$721, the company appears about fair value at a 18% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.840. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Regeneron PharmaceuticalsStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Shareholders have been diluted in the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

86,8cd9505b-9a22-31f0-aec5-fcc3a5f83234,CSCO,2023-01-02,"Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 74% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-inc-nasdaq-csco-140014761.html,1672581614,STORY,['CSCO'],"[A look at the shareholders of Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 74% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Cisco Systems. See our latest analysis for Cisco Systems ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Cisco Systems?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Cisco Systems already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Cisco Systems, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Cisco Systems is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 9.2% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.4% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.4% of the company stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Cisco SystemsWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Cisco Systems, Inc. in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$52m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 26% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Cisco Systems. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.Many find it useful to take an in depth look at how a company has performed in the past. You can access this detailed graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.
