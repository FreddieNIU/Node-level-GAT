4,f3b94f3d-3a7f-3956-8ace-7c9e3996f84b,TXN,2023-09-14,Is Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) A Risky Investment?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/texas-instruments-nasdaq-txn-risky-110114107.html,1694689274,STORY,['TXN'],"[Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We note that Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?Why Does Debt Bring Risk?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Texas Instruments What Is Texas Instruments's Net Debt?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at June 2023 Texas Instruments had debt of US$11.2b, up from US$7.24b in one year. However, it does have US$9.55b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$1.67b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Texas Instruments' Balance Sheet?Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Texas Instruments had liabilities of US$2.71b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$12.3b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$9.55b as well as receivables valued at US$1.96b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$3.49b.Story continuesSince publicly traded Texas Instruments shares are worth a very impressive total of US$149.2b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse. But either way, Texas Instruments has virtually no net debt, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).Texas Instruments has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.17. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 31.8 times the size. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. But the bad news is that Texas Instruments has seen its EBIT plunge 16% in the last twelve months. If that rate of decline in earnings continues, the company could find itself in a tight spot. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Texas Instruments's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Texas Instruments recorded free cash flow worth 59% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Our ViewTexas Instruments's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. But we must concede we find its EBIT growth rate has the opposite effect. All these things considered, it appears that Texas Instruments can comfortably handle its current debt levels. On the plus side, this leverage can boost shareholder returns, but the potential downside is more risk of loss, so it's worth monitoring the balance sheet. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Texas Instruments   (of which 1 is significant!) you should know about.If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay.Have feedback on this article?

These locations are highly appealing to life science, agtech and technology companies seeking tenancy. Moreover, these locations are characterized by high barriers to entry for new landlords, high barriers to exit for tenants and a limited supply of available space. Given this backdrop, the company is generally able to command high rents at its properties, aiding steady revenues.In the six months ended Jun 30, 2023, Alexandria’s total leasing activity aggregated 2.5 million rentable square feet (RSF) of space, of which 82% was generated from existing tenants. Lease renewals and re-leasing of space amounted to nearly 2.2 million RSF.To enhance its operating platform, Alexandria has been focusing on the acquisition, development and redevelopment of new Class A properties in AAA locations. From the beginning of 2023 through Jul 24, Alexandria completed acquisitions with development/redevelopment opportunities worth $235.4 million.Also, in the six months ended Jun 30, 2023, the company placed into service development and redevelopment projects totaling 840,587 RSF across multiple submarkets. This resulted in $81 million of incremental annual NOI.On the balance sheet front, Alexandria had $6.3 billion of liquidity as of the end of the second quarter of 2023. Further, as of the end of the second quarter of 2023, ARE had no debt maturities before 2025, and its weighted-average remaining term was 13.4 years. With a strong financial footing and enough financial flexibility, it is well-placed to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders, and ARE has remained committed to that. Alexandria has increased its dividend 10 times in the last five years, and the five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 5.79%. Check Alexandria’s dividend history here.Given the company’s solid operating platform, our adjusted FFO year-over-year growth projection of 12.7% in 2023, a decent financial position and a lower payout ratio compared with that of the industry, this dividend rate is likely to be sustainable.However, Alexandria’s substantial active development and redevelopment pipeline, although encouraging for long-term growth, exposes it to the risk of rising construction costs and lease-up concerns amid a macroeconomic slowdown.Further, a high-interest-rate environment is a concern for Alexandria. Elevated rates imply high borrowing costs for the company, affecting its ability to purchase or develop real estate. Moreover, with high interest rates in place, the dividend payout might seem less attractive than the yields on fixed-income and money-market accounts.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have declined 8.3% in the past three months, wider than its industry’s fall of 2%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Welltower WELL, SBA Communications SBAC and Americold Realty Trust COLD, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Cintas (CTAS), which belongs to the Zacks Uniform and Related industry, could be a great candidate to consider.When looking at the last two reports, this uniform rental company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 4.35%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, Cintas came out with earnings of $3.33 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.19 per share, representing a surprise of 4.39%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $3.01 per share and it actually produced earnings of $3.14 per share, delivering a surprise of 4.32%.With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Cintas. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Cintas currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.61%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on September 26, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.A company's changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating. The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years.The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Cintas basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. That's partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.For Cintas, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.Earnings Estimate Revisions for CintasThis uniform rental company is expected to earn $14.18 per share for the fiscal year ending May 2024, which represents a year-over-year change of 9.2%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Cintas. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1.2%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here &gt;&gt;&gt;The upgrade of Cintas to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Cintas (CTAS) earns a Zacks Rank #2 14 days from its next quarterly earnings release on September 27, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $3.71 a share.CTAS has an Earnings ESP figure of 1.61%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $3.71 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.65.CTAS is just one of a large group of Industrial Products stocks with a positive ESP figure. Johnson Controls (JCI) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on November 2, 2023, Johnson Controls holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.10 a share 50 days from its next quarterly update.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Johnson Controls is $1.10, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.33%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, CTAS and JCI could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Within Critical Care, contributions from all product lines in the second quarter of 2023 appear promising. The company’s strong liquidity position makes it an attractive stock for investors.Meanwhile, elevated expenses are adversely affecting EW’s margins. Over the past few quarters, the adverse foreign currency impact has been dragging the company’s gross margin, which does not bode well for the stock.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has decreased 22.1% compared with the 2.2% fall of the industry and a 14% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned global medical device company has a market capitalization of $45.51 billion. Edward Lifesciences has an earnings yield of 3.41% compared to the industry’s -7.11%. Edward Lifesciences’ earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, delivering an average surprise of 1.62%.Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesTAVR Looks Promising: Across the product group, Edwards Lifesciences’ sales growth continues to be driven by its leading SAPIEN platform. In the second quarter, TAVR sales in the United States were particularly aided by improved hospital staffing levels and the continued SAPIEN 3Ultra RESILIA launch.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOutside the United States, in the upcoming period, TAVR sales growth in Japan is expected to improve as markets continue to recover from lingering pandemic headwinds. In Europe, the company’s sales growth continues to be broad-based by country, led by the demand for the SAPIEN platform.Critical Care Business Holds Potential: Edwards Lifesciences is a leading player, particularly in advanced hemodynamic monitoring systems. These are used to measure a patient's heart function and fluid status in surgical and intensive care settings.Story continuesThe company is currently driving the adoption of its Smart Recovery Technologies as well as the Acumen IQ sensor. EW’s HemoSphere monitoring platform continued its sales momentum in the second quarter of 2023, along with a healthy pipeline of future opportunities.Strong Solvency and Capital Structure: Edwards Lifesciences has a solid balance sheet position. At the end of the second quarter of 2023, the company reported total debt of $597 million and a cash and cash equivalent (including short-term investments) balance of $1.51 billion, indicating a sound financial position. Edwards Lifesciences did not have any current maturities of long-term debt.Further, the company’s debt to capital was 8.5% at the second quarter-end, better than 9% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.DownsidesEscalated Expenses: Edwards Lifesciences has been grappling with escalated expenses for a while. In the second quarter of 2023, high SG&amp;A expenses were driven by performance-based compensations and investments in transcatheter field-based personnel in support of EW’s growth strategy. In addition, the gross and adjusted operating margins declined in the quarter, which raises concern.Foreign Exchange Headwinds: In the second quarter of 2023, foreign exchange rates decreased reported sales growth by 70 basis points or $8 million compared to 2022. The company also posted a lower year-over-year adjusted gross profit margin of 77.7% due to a less favorable impact of foreign exchange.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Edwards Lifesciences’ 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has remained constant at $2.55 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $6.01 billion. This suggests an 11.7% rise from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Haemonetics HAE, SiBone SIBN and Quanterix QTRX.Haemonetics has an earnings yield of 4.23% against the industry’s -1.33%. Haemonetics’ earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 19.39%.

But Walmart failed to provide accommodations for the test to workers with disabilities as required by federal law, the EEOC said.The EEOC filed the lawsuit on behalf of two Arkansas women who said they were fired by Walmart after failing the test. One is deaf and the other has intellectual disabilities, according to the lawsuit.Randy Hargrove, a spokesman for Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart, said the testing program was discontinued several years ago. When it was in use, workers were presented with pop-up notifications advising them of accommodations, he said.The EEOC has filed a series of lawsuits in recent years accusing Walmart, the largest private U.S. employer, of discriminating against workers and job applicants with disabilities.The agency last week accused Walmart of failing to provide interpreters for deaf employees, and has filed at least four other lawsuits this year on behalf of individual Walmart employees. Walmart has denied wrongdoing in those cases.In 2021, a federal jury in Wisconsin awarded $125 million to a former Walmart employee who the EEOC said was fired because she has Down's syndrome. A judge lowered the award to $300,000, the cap on damages under the federal law banning discrimination against workers with disabilities.(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Grant McCool)]"

XXII has launched FDA-approved VLN reduced-nicotine-content cigarettes. These innovative products are now accessible at more than 1,200 drug store locations across Texas, Florida, Illinois, North Carolina and Georgia, beginning in September.This expansion marks a significant increase in the accessibility of VLN products, bringing the total number of stores carrying VLN to more than 4,000 across 16 states. This shows remarkable growth in the count from approximately 1,100 stores as of Jul 1. John Miller, the interim chief executive officer of 22nd Century Group, emphasized the role of VLN in providing a clinically researched solution to help adult smokers gradually reduce their smoking habit and associated health risks.Research conducted among VLN users has yielded positive feedback, with a majority reporting that the product has aided them in reducing their consumption of regular cigarettes. Miller highlighted, ""Research with VLN users indicates that while most non-prescription methods of quitting or reducing smoking are strongly disliked, more than 75% of VLN users say they like their experience with the product. As a result of using VLN, 80% of adult consumers report a reduction in usage of their regular brand, and many want to share their positive experience with other adult smokers.""Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat distinguishes VLN is its unique status as the first and only FDA-authorized combustible cigarette labeled as a tobacco harm-reduction product. Independent scientific studies, along with comprehensive FDA reviews, have demonstrated that lowering nicotine levels in cigarettes has the potential to significantly mitigate the burden of smoking-related deaths and diseases. It is estimated that a nicotine product standard with 95% less nicotine than conventional U.S. cigarettes could potentially save millions of lives and tens of millions of life years over the coming years.22nd Century Group's distribution agreements with the top U.S. C-Store product distributors and regional distributors have paved the way for the robust growth of VLN's presence in convenience stores, mass merchants and drug stores. VLN cigarettes represent a remarkable breakthrough as the first and only combustible cigarettes that the FDA has authorized as Modified Risk Tobacco Products.The VLN King and VLN Menthol King variants contain a staggering 95% less nicotine than traditional addictive cigarettes. To ensure clarity for adult smokers, the FDA mandates the inclusion of the statement ""Helps You Smoke Less"" on every package of VLN, underscoring the product's distinct purpose.Story continuesWrapping UpThe announcement by 22nd Century Group represents a significant step forward in the mission to reduce the harm caused by tobacco use and provide smokers with a safer alternative to conventional cigarettes. The availability of VLN in drug stores across key states underscores the company's commitment to improving public health and promoting responsible tobacco consumption.22nd Century Group, a pioneering biotechnology firm specializing in advanced plant technologies, carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

GPS has been gaining from lower airfreight, improved promotions and cost-cutting actions. It is on track with the execution of its Power Plan 2023 plan.Analysts also seem optimistic about the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GPS’s fiscal 2023 earnings inched up a penny in the past seven days. It has a decent history of delivering earnings surprises, with an average beat of 1,001.6% in the trailing four quarters.Consequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have risen 16.8% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 3.5%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Let’s delve deeper.Growth Factors Aiding GPSGap has been on track with its aggressively undertaking cost-management actions in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The company has been making efforts to simplify and optimize its operating model and structure. These include increasing spans of control and decreasing management layers to improve the quality and speed of decision-making, as well as creating a consistent organizational structure across all four brands. These actions are expected to generate $300 million in annualized savings, of which half is expected to be realized in the latter half of fiscal 2023.Apart from these efforts, the company is expected to realize $250 million in annualized savings, as announced in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Gap revealed plans to further optimize its marketing spend and rationalize its technology investments over the next few years.The company is on track with the execution of its Power Plan 2023, which focuses on opening highly-profitable Old Navy and Athleta stores, while closing the underperforming Gap and Banana Republic stores. As part of the plan, it expects the Old Navy and Athleta brands to contribute about 70% of sales by 2023.As part of its 350-store closure plan, the company expects to close 50-55 Gap and Banana Republic stores this year. Gap is likely to fulfill its 350-store closure plan by the end of 2023. It has already achieved 90% of the target in 2022. With the closing of underperforming Gap and Banana Republic stores, the company expects to realize $100 million in EBITDA savings on an annualized basis by the end of 2023.Further, GPS expects to leverage its powerful platform to deliver competitive omni capabilities to meet customers’ needs, all fueled by its scaled operations. The company targets the e-commerce business to contribute 50% to sales by the end of 2023. Through the plan, it expects to deliver consistent sales growth, margin expansion and a strong operating cash flow.Also, expansion in merchandise margins stemming from lower airfreight contributed to margins in second-quarter fiscal 2023. Gap’s gross margin of 37.6% expanded 310 basis points (bps) and 160 bps, respectively, from the prior-year period’s reported and adjusted gross margins. Adjusted operating income was $119 million compared with $65 million in the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the adjusted operating margin expanded 170 bps to 3.4%, driven by an improved gross margin and adjusted SG&amp;A leverage.Also, adjusted SG&amp;A expenses declined 8% year over year. Adjusted SG&amp;A, as a percentage of sales, leveraged 10 bps to 36.6% due to lower advertising expenses, payroll and technology investments resulting from cost-saving actions. Owing to these factors, adjusted earnings of 34 cents per share in the fiscal second quarter also significantly improved from the 8 cents reported in the second quarter of fiscal 2022.Going ahead, management expects continued margin expansion and improved cash flow. The gross margin is likely to expand in fiscal 2023. This is likely to result from a 200-bps leverage due to the lapping of elevated airfreight costs in the prior year and a 100-bps margin gain from improved inventory position and promotional activity, offset by a 10-bps deleverage from inflationary costs.Additionally, the company expects inflationary deleverage to turn into leverage in the second half of fiscal 2023 due to gains from improved commodity costs and ocean freight rates. ROD, as a percentage of sales, is expected to deleverage 70 bps year over year. For third-quarter fiscal 2023, Gap anticipates the gross margin to be in line with the 38.7% reported last year. It envisions lower inflation and airfreight costs to be offset by 150 bps of ROD deleverage.Story continuesHurdles on the PathHowever, Gap has been reeling under uncertain macro and consumer environments. This resulted in a dismal top line in the fiscal second quarter. Net sales dipped 8% year over year to $3,548 million and slightly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,597 million. This includes a currency headwind of 1 percentage point and adverse impacts of 2 percentage points from the sale of Gap China. Comparable sales (comps) fell 6% in the fiscal second quarter.Going ahead, management anticipates fiscal 2023 sales to decline in the mid-single digits compared with the low to mid-single-digit decline mentioned earlier. The company reported net sales of $15.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. It expects sales for fiscal 2023 to include an impact of $300 million from the sale of Gap China and a positive effect of $150 million from the 53rd week.For third-quarter fiscal 2023, Gap expects a sales decline in the low-double digits, whereas it reported $4.04 billion last year. This can be attributed to the sale of Gap China, which is expected to impact net sales by $70 million in the fiscal third quarter.ConclusionAlthough uncertain macro and consumer environments are likely to linger in the near term, solid merchandise margins, cost-saving efforts and reduced air freight expenses are likely to help GPS drive growth ahead. Topping it, a VGM Score of A and a long-term earnings growth rate of 12% raise optimism in the stock.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks are BJ's Restaurants BJRI, Urban Outfitters URBN and Walmart WMT.BJ's Restaurants, which operates a chain of high-end casual dining restaurants in the United States, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Compared to last year, the cost of food at home rose 3.0%, compared to a 3.6% increase in July. Overall, consumer prices increased by 3.7% in August over the prior year and 0.6% month over month, as energy prices caused inflation to spike.America's largest grocer, Walmart (WMT), expects the pace of food inflation to continue to slow, but it will take some time for prices to come down to where they were two years ago.""Inflation and higher prices are kind of with us,"" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said at the Goldman Sachs Global Consumer Conference in New York City on Tuesday. ""We'll see disinflation but not all the way back to deflation. ... Certainly not in the short term.""What's driving higher pricesThe meats, poultry, fish, and eggs category was one of the biggest drivers of food inflation month over month. Prices for these items increased by 0.8% on a seasonally adjusted basis.""Pork saw the biggest increase since November 2021,"" BLS economist Steve Reed told Yahoo Finance. ""Meat prices being [up] across the board — beef, pork, poultry — was the most notable thing.""Prices of pork increased 2.2% last month and bacon prices jumped roughly 4%, while chicken prices jumped 2.1%.Pork and meat prices, as shown in the refrigerated aisle at this Walmart store, drove food inflation higher in August. (Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) (Jeff Greenberg via Getty Images)Other items that saw price increases include fresh biscuits, rolls, and muffins, which rose 2.7%; shelf-stable fish and seafood, up roughly 2%; and salad dressing, up 2.1%. Ahead of Halloween, prices for sugar and sweets saw a 0.6% uptick month over month.Looking ahead, higher gas costs could also hit groceries once again.""It's certainly reasonable to think that some of the higher gas fuel costs could be having some effect on pricing,"" Reed said. ""I don't think that usually takes long to pass through.""Story continuesEgg prices continue dropping as avian flu moves into rearview mirrorAfter a huge spike earlier this year, one area that continues to see price declines is eggs.The cost of eggs dropped 2.5% last month and is down 18.2% compared to the same time period a year ago. The average price for a dozen large Grade A eggs is currently $2.04.Reed wasn't too surprised by the shift, saying that egg prices are ""always volatile.""Kevin Bergquist of Wells Fargo said the cost of eggs should stay relatively stable; however, he added a side of caution.""The most recent USDA egg wholesale numbers are showing a slight price increase for producers in the last couple of weeks,"" Bergquist told Yahoo Finance. ""If producers are able to push this through to buyers at the grocer level, and if this data is captured by the next CPI report, then you could possibly see a very slight egg price increase, slight being the keyword.""Trey Braswell, president of Braswell Family Farms, which is based in Nashville, N.C., echoed that sentiment. Braswell told Yahoo Finance that he expects prices to be ""less volatile for consumers for a while"" as long as COVID restrictions don't begin again and ""birds stay healthy.""Good news on the horizon, though: The avian flu appears to be behind us. Bergquist said he is ""not really"" seeing the highly contagious avian flu that impacted thousands of flocks and caused prices to spike 70% year over year in January.""There have been some notable [avian flu] incidents in the global Southern Hemisphere, but the outlook for North America is cautiously optimistic,"" Bergquist added. However, we're not out of the clear yet, as ""another outbreak in 2024 is entirely possible,"" he said.Additionally, an increase in baking in the fall and winter is another potential factor for egg prices.""October is the start of the holiday baking season when egg prices have historically begun to increase,"" Bergquist said.Read more coverage on where inflation stands:Inflation accelerated in August as oil prices surgedStocks edge up after inflation data comes in hot: Stock market news todayThe Fed will look past inflation uptick, economists sayInflation: New and used car prices are moderating—Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

""We've been attributed for things that have happened in other cities in the Bay Area, as well as even as far as Los Angeles. We have unfortunately been the punching bag.""""But the city has changed, and it has changed in some ways for the better,"" Breed added. ""We're still the technology capital of the world. In fact, of the top 20 artificial intelligence companies in the world, eight are here in San Francisco. People still want to be here. They're starting their companies, their businesses here.""London Breed, mayor of San Francisco, stands in front of the historic cable car ""Big 19"" on June 13. (Photo by Barbara Munker/picture alliance via Getty Images) (picture alliance via Getty Images)San Francisco's complex challengesTurning around a historic city that counts Salesforce (CRM), X (formerly Twitter), and Levi's (LEVI) as large employers remains a big-time challenge despite Breed's many efforts. And in many respects, the success of that turnaround will likely determine if she is re-elected in more than a year.Story continuesAccording to a recent study by McKinsey, 70% of San Francisco residents cite homelessness among the city's top three problems. On any given night, 38,000 Bay Area residents are homeless, the study found.Meanwhile, drug use on the streets and retail crime continue to be pressing issues the city is dealing with daily.A homeless couple sleeps on a sidewalk in San Francisco on Sept. 2. (Photo by Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) (Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)Experts pin the blame on a range of factors, from the pandemic pushing out office workers and leaving buildings empty to inflation making it harder for people to live day to day. The Big Tech names in the city also fetch their fair share of the criticism for triggering wealth inequality.The societal problems have reached such a level that in 2023 the likes of retailers Nordstrom (JWN) and Whole Foods (AMZN) closed stores in San Francisco due to safety worries.Breed acknowledged the challenges.""Fentanyl has really devastated many American cities like nothing we've ever experienced,"" Breed explained. ""Methamphetamine has already taken over parts of rural US in recent years as well. And so our ability to deal with those issues has been really challenging.""""In fact what we're doing here in San Francisco to combat that is making the hard decision to arrest people for public and intoxication — and there's a lot of critics of that,"" Breed continued. ""But the goal is to try and get people into treatment. We know it's not easy. We know having an addiction is a hard thing, but we can't just say business as usual goes. There's help and treatment.""Salesforce's annual Dreamforce Conference will be held on Sept. 11 and is expecting 35,000 attendees at Moscone Center in San Francisco. (Photo by Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) (Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in a San Francisco Chronicle interview that this year's Dreamforce event could be the last one in the city if there were any safety-related issues that popped up.The comments came as a blow, as Benioff has given generously to the city's school and hospital system for decades. The 61-floor Salesforce Tower is the tallest building in San Francisco. And Dreamforce has generated hundreds of millions of dollars for the city in all its years of being held there.Breed said that Benioff remains committed to San Francisco as a tech hub and holding the Dreamforce conference there.""We do everything we can to roll out the red carpet,"" Breed said. ""People love coming [to Dreamforce]. It's a wonderful experience. And I just think Marc was just having a conversation, and it unfortunately got blown up in the international and national press. But Marc is truly committed to San Francisco.""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor. Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.

However, the terms of which were not disclosed. The acquiree specializes in the trucking industry as a retail insurance broker for clients in Kentucky and surrounding states. This acquisition would add to AJG’s expertise in the transportation space and aid in tapping growth opportunities of this market.Inorganic Growth StoryArthur J. Gallagher has an impressive inorganic story with buyouts made in the Brokerage and Risk Management segments. This insurance broker acquired 25 entities in the first half of 2023, which contributed about $418 million to estimated annualized revenues. AJG has a strong merger and acquisition pipeline with about $300 million of revenues, associated with about 55 term sheets either agreed upon or being prepared, representing more than $700 million of annualized revenues.A solid capital position supports this insurance broker in its growth initiatives, and it thus remains focused on continuing its tuck-in mergers and acquisitions.

The group has targeted telecommunications and business process outsourcing companies to pull off SIM swaps of phone numbers that can then be used in phishing attacks to steal data from victim systems and extort a ransom.Charles Carmakal, chief technical officer for Mandiant Inc., part of Google Cloud, described the hackers as “one of the most prevalent and aggressive threat actors impacting organizations in the United States today.” Mandiant first came across the group in May 2022.He said many of the members of the group are young native English speakers who are “incredibly effective social engineers.” They have started deploying ransomware encryptors and sometimes expose victims on infrastructure used by another hacking group, ALPHV.The FBI said in April 2022 the group had leased its ransomware to others that has resulted in compromises of at least 60 entities worldwide.In the MGM hack, Scattered Spider may have worked with ALPHV, according to two people familiar with the group’s operations.Hackers use several different techniques to extort victims for money.For instance, ransomware is a type of malware that locks up a victim’s computer files. The hackers then promise to provide a decryption key if an extortion fee is paid.More recently, hacking groups have shifted away from ransomware and instead focused on stealing sensitive data from victims. They then threaten to release the information online unless they are paid.(Updates with Caesars filing in third, sixth and seventh paragraphs, share prices in the eighth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekMBAs Are Spurning McKinsey to Buy Small CompaniesTikTok Shop Is a Real E-Commerce ThreatThe Real-Life Inspiration Behind The Bonfire of the VanitiesPhonemakers Not Named Apple Are in Love With Foldable Phones©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

40,af9b1369-146c-35a3-83f9-26d9371ebef8,IT,2023-09-14,We Think Gartner (NYSE:IT) Might Have The DNA Of A Multi-Bagger,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/think-gartner-nyse-might-dna-133505613.html,1694612105,STORY,['IT'],"[What trends should we look for it we want to identify stocks that can multiply in value over the long term? Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Gartner's (NYSE:IT) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Gartner:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.29 = US$1.2b ÷ (US$7.4b - US$3.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).So, Gartner has an ROCE of 29%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the IT industry average of 14%. Check out our latest analysis for Gartner roceIn the above chart we have measured Gartner's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Gartner here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?Gartner is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 344% in that same time. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.Story continuesAnother thing to note, Gartner has a high ratio of current liabilities to total assets of 45%. This can bring about some risks because the company is basically operating with a rather large reliance on its suppliers or other sorts of short-term creditors. While it's not necessarily a bad thing, it can be beneficial if this ratio is lower.The Bottom Line On Gartner's ROCEAs discussed above, Gartner appears to be getting more proficient at generating returns since capital employed has remained flat but earnings (before interest and tax) are up. Since the stock has returned a staggering 129% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.Gartner does have some risks, we noticed   3 warning signs  (and 1 which shouldn't be ignored)  we think you should know about.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

The Dow ended down fractionally.Investors thinking ahead to next week's Federal Reserve meeting might be forgiven for looking through the headline print to the core number, which the Fed prefers. Core inflation excludes volatile food and energy and just dropped to 4.3% — the lowest since September 2021. And with good news out of core inflation, why should investors think the Fed should react to high gas prices, which, if anything, suppress spending on non-gasoline items?But those higher gasoline prices come as WTI crude oil (CL=F) has rallied 28% over the last three months, with technicals pointing to huge potential upside. In early September, WTI broke to new highs on the year, and now $90 per barrel is only minor potential resistance on the path to last year's highs around $120.To those who would laugh at $120 crude, we point to the recent words of JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. Only days ago — and to little fanfare — he raised the possibility of an eyewatering $150 handle.Speaking at a Barclays conference, Dimon said his general bearishness last year is based on ""huge, semi-tectonic shifts"" that he's seeing in the economy — signs that point to potentially higher prices across the board one year from now.Story continuesDimon said he wouldn't be surprised to see the US 10-year Treasury note (^TNX) yielding 5.5% (over 100 basis points higher than the current 4.3% rate) and crude oil landing between $120 and $150.""These things are tectonic differences from what you've experienced since 1945,"" he added. When the chairman of the world's biggest bank says we haven't seen the likes of this environment since the end of World War II, investors might well listen.Looking at the historical reaction of stocks on CPI release dates reveals a tight correlation to the overall direction of the market.While the correlation isn't perfect, the big drops in the orange line (shown above) reflect just how sudden and dramatic changes in critical data can lead to a major repricing of risk.Should headline CPI continue to accelerate to the upside, it will eventually force a reckoning with the bullish pricing of stocks. For those looking to time an exit to the substantial bull market rally off last year's October lows, this event could well be that catalyst.If Jamie Dimon is correct, then the time frame is sometime in the next year.morning brief imageClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Granite Ridge Resources, Inc. GRNT, Viper Energy Partners VNOM, Evolution Petroleum EPM and Northern Oil and Gas NOG.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:4 Stocks to Gain as Oil Prices Hit 2023 HighsOptimism over a rise in demand for oil coupled with tightening of supply through output cuts has bolstered the price of oil.With oil prices now hitting their highest level this year, stocks such as Granite Ridge Resources, Inc., Viper Energy Partners, Evolution Petroleum and Northern Oil and Gas are well-positioned to gain shortly.Oil Prices Hit a Near 10-Month HighBrent crude, the global oil benchmark, increased 1.6% to $92.06 a barrel on Sep 12. The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude also settled 1.8% higher to $88.84 a barrel in the last trading session.Both prices have now hit the highest level since November 2022, and have remained overbought for eight consecutive days. Oil prices scaled northward following bullish technical indications, and are now widely expected to reach $100-$102 a barrel soon.What Led to the Rise in Oil Prices?Oil prices scaled upward after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) recently said that the global oil demand is expected to remain robust amid tighter supply.OPEC expects the demand for oil to increase by 2.25 million barrels per day (bpd) across the globe in 2024. OPEC expects oil demand to remain robust this year as well since major economies are expanding at an encouraging pace. By the way, an expansion in China’s manufacturing activity in August is expected to provide the country the wherewithal to import oil and boost demand.The Energy Information Administration of the United States had said earlier that global crude oil stockpiles are projected to drop by nearly a half million bpd in the second half of this year, which in turn will push the price of Brent crude to around $93 a barrel in the fourth quarter.Story continuesMeanwhile, trimming of output by oil producers has also perked up oil prices lately. Russia is expected to curtail its oil exports by 300,000 barrels a day till the end of this year. Similarly, Saudi Arabia is aiming to extend its production cut of 1 million barrels a day for another three months till the end of December 2023.How to Play Oil’s Northward JourneyMajor oil producers and explorers, rig operators, and pipeline owners are all poised to witness an improvement in their profit margins as oil prices increase.

51,f14263ee-14c8-301d-bacf-12afc6cde69c,CRM,2023-09-14,"Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) Is Up But Financials Look Inconsistent: Which Way Is The Stock Headed?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-inc-nyse-crm-financials-110101964.html,1694689261,STORY,['CRM'],"[Salesforce's (NYSE:CRM) stock is up by 3.2% over the past three months. Given that the stock prices usually follow long-term business performance, we wonder if the company's mixed financials could have any adverse effect on its current price price movement Particularly, we will be paying attention to Salesforce's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Salesforce How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Salesforce is:2.7% = US$1.6b ÷ US$58b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.03.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Salesforce's Earnings Growth And 2.7% ROEAs you can see, Salesforce's ROE looks pretty weak. Not just that, even compared to the industry average of 9.9%, the company's ROE is entirely unremarkable. Hence, the flat earnings seen by Salesforce over the past five years could probably be the result of it having a lower ROE.We then compared Salesforce's net income growth with the industry and found that the average industry growth rate was 19% in the same 5-year period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is CRM fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Salesforce Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Salesforce doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that potentially all of its profits are being reinvested in the business. However, this doesn't explain why the company hasn't seen any growth. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.ConclusionIn total, we're a bit ambivalent about Salesforce's performance. While the company does have a high rate of reinvestment, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping any benefit to its investors, and moreover, its having a negative impact on the earnings growth. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

It could be a personal financial decision or it could be based on the insider's assessment of the company's current valuation and future prospects. However, the overall trend of insider selling at Salesforce Inc, combined with the company's valuation, suggests that potential investors should carefully consider these factors before making an investment decision.As always, insider transactions should not be used in isolation when making investment decisions.

Clara Shih, CEO of Salesforce AI, sits down with Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi at the Dreamforce Conference to discuss how the company is integrating AI and offering services like Einstein to its customers.""It's very similar to what we saw with the internet 20 years ago — some jobs will change, [actually] every job will change,"" Shih says. ""I think we all have to [adopt] that growth mindset and reinvent ourselves.""Shih also addresses worries of ""hallucinations"", or misinformation produced by large language models, and the future of consumer-driven AI.Video TranscriptBRIAN SOZZI: Yahoo Finance has been enjoying its latest Dreamforce in San Francisco all week. Lots of talk about how Salesforce was reinventing itself in large part because of AI and in large part because of a lot of the efforts from our next guest, Clara Shih, the CEO of Salesforce AI. Good to see you. You're a little bit of a star of the show here. A lot of these innovations that you're bringing to life are being shown off at this event. So how has AI changed your role and how is it changing Salesforce?CLARA SHIH: I think it's changing all of us. I mean, what a historic moment for us to be in business and in technology, and this is a show, we're hearing from so many customers, getting inspiration and feedback on the products that we have out in the market.BRIAN SOZZI: Do these customers know how to use this? And I bring this up because I spent a little time on the campground floor watching people interact with the installations of Williams-Sonoma and FYI App. This stuff seems complicated. How is that training looking?CLARA SHIH: I think I can be very complex, and that's really the role that we see ourselves playing as Salesforce is that, how do we make something that's complex and risky, how do we make it safe, secure, and accessible for everyone?Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: What's the biggest upside to AI from a business perspective?CLARA SHIH: You know, I think that the biggest upside of AI is really augmenting human potential. It's taking the salesperson, making them that much more productive. It's taking the customer service person, automating the mundane so that they can up level and really connect with their customer.BRIAN SOZZI: As someone's spending a lot of time in the AI field, what does this all mean for jobs? If I have a chatbot following me around on the program, do I need one less person?CLARA SHIH: You know, I think it's very similar to what we saw with the internet 20 years ago, right? Some jobs will change. A lot-- every job will change. Some jobs will be created, like prompt engineers didn't exist before, and I think we all have to adapt that growth mindset and reinvent ourselves.BRIAN SOZZI: I might have to reinvent myself too. I don't know how to use some of this stuff. I mean, I look at Slack. You know, I go back to when that platform was founded, it was workforce management and productivity tools. We now the ability to have, I guess, transcripts just pop up. I don't have to be in the meeting. I mean, how has that platform changed?CLARA SHIH: I mean, Slack is incredible because it's a naturally conversational interface, but it's also collaborative, and so you have this amazing thing now where you can collaborate with your team and one of the team members can be AI.BRIAN SOZZI: How-- do we get enough work done? I bring this up because now we have all these productivity tools. Does it slow work down a little bit?CLARA SHIH: I think that's the feedback we've gotten from our customers and why so many customers have been looking to us to bring AI into where they're already doing their work. They want it in the flow of their salesperson, say, in the flow of their marketing team, say, in the flow of their commerce and developers, say, versus having to go off to a different application, different screen, and having to copy and paste.BRIAN SOZZI: Talk to us about the risks of AI, and do you share some of the concerns that we're hearing at this event? I've heard over the past two weeks, spending a lot of time out here in San Francisco.CLARA SHIH: Just like we saw with the internet, AI brings new risks, and we've seen this the last decade. We pioneered Einstein, the first predictive AI for CRM. We're doing the same thing with generative AI. And trust is our number one value. It's also the biggest question that we hear from customers.So the risks are definitely out there, and it's both on the data security and governance side, which is why we built the Einstein trust layer, as well as on the ethical responsibility side. And so as part of the trust layer, in addition to things like citations and prompt defense, we also have toxicity filters and ethical guardrails built in.BRIAN SOZZI: You know, I was talking to Mark Benioff, and he talked about hallucinations or large language models getting information that output false information. Is there a way to protect ourselves from that?CLARA SHIH: You know, the best way to prevent or reduce hallucinations is to have great data grounded into the prompt. So it's the context that you feed into the large language model. The more context you give it, the less it feels like it has to make it up, and so that's really why our data cloud is so essential to everything we're doing in AI, because data is the fuel for AI.BRIAN SOZZI: Is there risk, you know, into the society, some of this AI? These LLMs, as they're called, they're getting all these inputs and they come self-serving beasts. I mean, should they be stopped or--CLARA SHIH: Well, I think we've seen a lot of the risks to society from AI over the last decade in social media, in these algorithms that were just prioritizing one thing, which was more clickbait. And I think that the LLMs in an enterprise context I feel much more optimistic about, because we are able to put those guardrails in place, both from a data security as well as from an ethical guardrail standpoint.BRIAN SOZZI: As someone leading the charge for AI at Salesforce, how big is your team and can you find the talent right now to support how fast you're moving in this field?CLARA SHIH: So our team, we have over 1,400 people across the company working on AI across research and development. Our product managers, our product designers, our ethical researchers, and those engaging on the policy front with the White House, et cetera. It is very hard to find that talent, but I think Salesforce, we have such a strong story with leading with trust, with leading with our platform, allowing anyone to build an AI app with no code, low code, that we're able to attract a lot of the best and the brightest.BRIAN SOZZI: What's the next big thing in AI? Mark talked a little bit about general artificial intelligence that-- at his keynote there was a picture of a robot and a human, like, standing next to each other. Is that the future? What does that even look like?CLARA SHIH: Look, no one has a crystal ball, certainly not me, but what I know is customers, they need help, right? Everyone's been trying chatGPT, Google Bard, but now they want to know how they can do this securely for business in a way that drives real outcomes, accelerating growth, cutting costs, fundamentally reimagining and upleveling their customer experience and customer service, and so there's a lot of work to be done there.We're deploying the Einstein trust layer at more and more companies every day. Many of them are here at Dreamforce. And then focusing on those use cases by business, by department. And then, above all, I think organizational readiness, helping companies bring all of their employees along for this revolution, just like we did a few decades ago with the internet.BRIAN SOZZI: Clara, you're in many respects changing the lives of households, businesses, and a lot of investors on the Yahoo Finance platform because of technology that you developed. Tell us a little bit about yourself. How did you get into this field?CLARA SHIH: Well, I started my journey actually at Salesforce. I worked at the company in the mid 2000s, and then I left. I was so inspired by Salesforce I left. I started my own startup, Hearsay Systems, and I led that as a founder and CEO for 11 years. Then I took a personal break to have a baby, and I was rerecruited to come back to the company to lead the service cloud.BRIAN SOZZI: Boomerang employees that we were talking about [INAUDIBLE].CLARA SHIH: Yes, I am a boomerang employee. Came back to lead the service cloud. And you think in customer service there is so much AI, but traditionally chatbots are pretty brittle. I mean, those experiences as a consumer, very frustrating. And so when I saw the transformer technology, the large language models that our research team was developing and we started working with forward thinking customers like Gucci, I was sold on generative AI, and this happened just in time for chatGPT to capture everyone's imagination.BRIAN SOZZI: A lot of folks who may not be familiar with your work. They're going to certainly know about it now. They need to be following what you and the team are doing here. Clara Shih, Salesforce CEO of AI, thank you for joining Yahoo Finance. We appreciate it.CLARA SHIH: Thanks for having me.]"

It's a passion expressed not only in interviews but also in frequent video posts on Instagram, where one can find Breed working with city workers to clear the streets.""Sometimes [negative stories and videos] ... that you see go viral, those aren't always just in San Francisco,"" Breed told Yahoo Finance Live on the ground at Dreamforce (video above). ""We've been attributed for things that have happened in other cities in the Bay Area, as well as even as far as Los Angeles. We have unfortunately been the punching bag.""""But the city has changed, and it has changed in some ways for the better,"" Breed added. ""We're still the technology capital of the world. In fact, of the top 20 artificial intelligence companies in the world, eight are here in San Francisco. People still want to be here. They're starting their companies, their businesses here.""London Breed, mayor of San Francisco, stands in front of the historic cable car ""Big 19"" on June 13. (Photo by Barbara Munker/picture alliance via Getty Images) (picture alliance via Getty Images)San Francisco's complex challengesTurning around a historic city that counts Salesforce (CRM), X (formerly Twitter), and Levi's (LEVI) as large employers remains a big-time challenge despite Breed's many efforts. And in many respects, the success of that turnaround will likely determine if she is re-elected in more than a year.Story continuesAccording to a recent study by McKinsey, 70% of San Francisco residents cite homelessness among the city's top three problems. On any given night, 38,000 Bay Area residents are homeless, the study found.Meanwhile, drug use on the streets and retail crime continue to be pressing issues the city is dealing with daily.A homeless couple sleeps on a sidewalk in San Francisco on Sept. 2. (Photo by Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) (Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)Experts pin the blame on a range of factors, from the pandemic pushing out office workers and leaving buildings empty to inflation making it harder for people to live day to day. The Big Tech names in the city also fetch their fair share of the criticism for triggering wealth inequality.The societal problems have reached such a level that in 2023 the likes of retailers Nordstrom (JWN) and Whole Foods (AMZN) closed stores in San Francisco due to safety worries.Breed acknowledged the challenges.""Fentanyl has really devastated many American cities like nothing we've ever experienced,"" Breed explained. ""Methamphetamine has already taken over parts of rural US in recent years as well. And so our ability to deal with those issues has been really challenging.""""In fact what we're doing here in San Francisco to combat that is making the hard decision to arrest people for public and intoxication — and there's a lot of critics of that,"" Breed continued. ""But the goal is to try and get people into treatment. We know it's not easy. We know having an addiction is a hard thing, but we can't just say business as usual goes. There's help and treatment.""Salesforce's annual Dreamforce Conference will be held on Sept. 11 and is expecting 35,000 attendees at Moscone Center in San Francisco. (Photo by Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) (Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in a San Francisco Chronicle interview that this year's Dreamforce event could be the last one in the city if there were any safety-related issues that popped up.The comments came as a blow, as Benioff has given generously to the city's school and hospital system for decades. The 61-floor Salesforce Tower is the tallest building in San Francisco. And Dreamforce has generated hundreds of millions of dollars for the city in all its years of being held there.Breed said that Benioff remains committed to San Francisco as a tech hub and holding the Dreamforce conference there.""We do everything we can to roll out the red carpet,"" Breed said. ""People love coming [to Dreamforce]. It's a wonderful experience. And I just think Marc was just having a conversation, and it unfortunately got blown up in the international and national press.

Lots of focus on AI and the future of technology. But, of course, the future of the economy here in San Francisco, who better to discuss this all with than San Francisco Mayor London Breed? Mayor, thank you so much for joining us.LONDON BREED: Of course, glad to have you here. And welcome to San Francisco.BRIAN SOZZI: It's a little cold. Where did the heat go?LONDON BREED: Well, this is San Francisco. We wanted to make sure you had an authentic San Francisco experience.BRIAN SOZZI: Thank you, I think. So lots of people, over 40,000 people here at the latest Dreamforce, how important is this event to your economy here in San Francisco?LONDON BREED: Well, Dreamforce is important because we're not only talking about over 40,000 people participating in this conference but almost 80,000 hotel night stays and $57 million that is going to be poured into our economy, through our restaurants, our businesses, and all over the city. So we're really excited to have Dreamforce here.Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: I think Mark-- we've known Mark for a while in Salesforce. He made a couple of headlines saying, hey, is this-- could this be the last one here in San Francisco? What's your take on that? Were you surprised he said stuff like that?LONDON BREED: Well, Mark is committed to San Francisco. I think that some of it was probably blown out of proportion. If you look at his comments last year, he posted thanking San Francisco, zero incidents. And Dreamforce and its history of being here in San Francisco has not had any problems. And so we do everything we can to roll out the red carpet. People love coming here. It's a wonderful experience. And I just think Mark was just having a conversation. And it unfortunately got blown up in the international and national press. But Mark is truly committed to San Francisco.BRIAN SOZZI: And I know you were in the room with his keynote. I was certainly in the room with his keynote. He committed to San Francisco. This is his home. Yeah, Salesforce Tower, this is where it is. And again, there's just a lot of people here, a lot of activity. Take us through what is happening in the San Francisco economy. I think in New York and many other parts of the world, we hear a narrative of crime, looting, you name it. But there's another story here to be told.LONDON BREED: So I just want to say, sometimes when those stories and those videos that you see that go viral, those aren't always just in San Francisco. We've been attributed for things that have happened in other cities in the Bay Area as well as even as far as Los Angeles. And San Francisco has been, unfortunately, the punching bag.But the city has changed. But it's changed in some ways for the better. We're still the technology capital of the world. In fact, of the top 20 artificial intelligence companies in the world, eight are here in San Francisco. People still want to be here. They're starting their companies, their businesses. And we know that retail has been struggling. But retail has been struggling everywhere.I've talked to different audiences and people and asked, when was the last time you stepped foot in a brick and mortar department store or a mall or anything of that nature? It means that as we usher in a new era of technology, we have to adjust. We have to adapt to what our new normal is.And San Francisco will continue to be a leader in innovation and technology. And it's the reason why you keep hearing the stories of people who are saying they're coming back, they're moving back. Even Elon Musk has committed to San Francisco.And so I think that the story and what people are trying to paint, it's a moment in time. It's the challenges that exist with some of the issues that other big cities are facing all over the country. But in San Francisco because we are still the leader in technology and innovation and in opportunity, we continue to be looked at as really the model for everyone to follow and to focus on.BRIAN SOZZI: For those not familiar with your own personal story, tell us a little bit about yourself and how you will get that narrative and you will focus on that as you come up for re-election.LONDON BREED: Yeah. Well, I grew up in the city. And I was born and raised here by my grandmother in public housing. I unfortunately have a brother who was incarcerated. And I have a sister who I lost to a drug overdose. And I've experienced, you know, lot of this most of my life of poverty, of neglect, of so many things that continue to plague certain neighborhoods in San Francisco.It is why I am so committed to really digging down deep and coming up with new innovative solutions that can sometimes be controversial but necessary in order to help people change their lives, turn their lives around but also to provide opportunities so they never end up in these situations in the first place.BRIAN SOZZI: I don't know where I heard this. But I heard it somewhere. I think recently you said that I am running-- I am running as if I won't have a re-election or something along those lines. Do you lead that way, right? How important is that?LONDON BREED: Yeah, and I say I say to people because, you know, you look at the political world. And everyone's always trying to do what's necessary to get elected. But I have said that I am running without fear of losing my job because understandably so, the voters have a decision to decide whoever they want to be mayor. And I respect that.I pinch myself every day because I come from the most challenging of circumstances. And it is truly an honor and a blessing to be here to serve in this capacity and to be courageous in making hard decisions that you know and hope will turn people's lives around. So I'm committed to this job. I'm excited about what we're doing here in San Francisco.And I am looking forward to continuing to welcome people not just from all over the US but all around the world, especially when San Francisco hosts one of the biggest international events that we've seen since 1945 when the United Nations was established, APAC. The Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation is coming to San Francisco with heads of states from all over with the foreign press and business leaders. It is going to be just as amazing as Dreamforce is right now in our city.BRIAN SOZZI: Before I let you go, can you just tell us some of the businesses that have come back here. I think this is a very important story. I'm here. There is not doom and gloom in this environment. I know we're in an enclosed environment. But still there's growth happening here.LONDON BREED: Yes. Well, I'll tell you a little bit about some of the businesses who are focused on staying and expanding. You know, Salesforce is still here. They're not going anywhere. You have Ripple, which has been a great company. They are staying here and expanding. You know, Levi Strauss, this is their home. This is where they stand.And I tell people San Francisco is the place where creativity and innovation, new startups, OpenAI. Sam Altman is doubling down on his commitment to San Francisco. So we got a lot of amazing companies who are saying, look, people are saying what they want to say. Prologis is committed to San Francisco. But we are here to stay. We're not going anywhere. And we're going to change the world from San Francisco because if it can happen here, it can happen anywhere.BRIAN SOZZI: All right, mayor. San Francisco Mayor London Breed, thanks for coming on Yahoo Finance first time. We look forward to staying in touch with you. I'm following your really journey in improving San Francisco. Thank you so much.LONDON BREED: Thank you so much.BRIAN SOZZI: Thank you. Guys, back to you in New York.RACHELLE AKUFFO: All right, thanks to Yahoo Finance's executive editor Brian Sozzi for that interview.]"

(Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) (Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)A Williams-Sonoma (WSM) booth bustles with activity, giving a glimpse to those interested in how Salesforce's AI is powering furniture recommendations. Slack — a business Salesforce acquired in 2021 for $27.7 billion — has a booth explaining how a business could use new AI features on the platform to build improved marketing campaigns.Just one year ago at Dreamforce, Slack was still being played up as an office collaboration tool. Not any longer.In short, Dreamforce 2023 will go down as AI's coming out party for Salesforce.""I mean, it's unbelievable what is happening,"" Benioff added. ""Every business will get recreated with artificial intelligence. People are here trying to understand how to do that. How do they do it for themselves? How do they do it for their businesses?""Benioff thinks there is an AI spending boom on the cusp of unfolding (beyond buying chips from Nvidia and AMD) as businesses race to gain the pole position.And it's that optimism around Salesforce's AI potential — and a few other factors — that has the company's investors increasingly upbeat.The company increased its list prices by an average of 9% across its sales cloud, service cloud, marketing cloud, industries, and Tableau businesses in August.Meanwhile, earlier this year Salesforce unveiled its AI Cloud product that allows marketers to autogenerate personalized content for customers and allows developers to autogenerate code, among other use cases.Story continuesThese big AI product drops are all in addition to analysts praising Salesforce for better expense control after a bruising activist battle led by Elliott Management. The vibe on the Street is that Salesforce's profit margins have hit bottom and could ramp noticeably higher into next year.Salesforce's earnings call fed that view last week, when execs noted its 30% operating margin goal (initially put into place ahead of Dreamforce 2022) was a floor — not a ceiling.Benioff ultimately appears to be a co-founder who has gotten his mojo back with investors after considerable outreach. The renewed momentum at the company has even caused former employees, known internally as boomerangs, to return and help bring new AI advances to life.""I guess one of the best things about Salesforce is that you look at what we've been through over 25 years, and there's always been a lot of good and bad times, but our core values have never changed,"" Benioff said on the better-run Salesforce.Salesforce stock is up 66% year to date.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly. Top 5 Upgrades:UBS upgraded General Motors (GM) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $44, up from $41, as a new analyst took over coverage of the stock. Assuming a strike does not occur, the firm see second half earnings upside compared to consensus and argues that the current ""negativity"" priced into the shares creates an attractive risk/reward.Piper Sandler upgraded UMB Financial (UMBF) to Overweight from Neutral with a $74 price target. The firm cites its relatively discounted valuation compared to shares' historical premium over peers.BofA upgraded Southern Company (SO) to Neutral from Underperform with a price target of $68, up from $67. The shares have re-rated and now trade at a premium to most utility peers, notes the firm, which sees pending updates, including specifically an update on generation capital, helping to support the stock at current levels.Credit Suisse upgraded Sealed Air (SEE) to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $47, down from $59. The firm views Sealed Air as a major beneficiary of a soft-landing economic scenario in 2024 and sees the stock being priced for recession currently.Daiwa upgraded Cognex (CGNX) to Buy from Outperform with an unchanged price target of $57. An acceleration in battery investments as well as bottoming logistics and electronics spend will drive the company's growth in 2024, the analyst tells investors in a research note.Top 5 Downgrades:JPMorgan downgraded Oracle (ORCL) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $100, down from $112. The company's cloud growth may be peaking as the Cerner transition and date center buildout ""pose new hurdles,"" the analyst tells investors in a research note.Goldman Sachs downgraded Ultrapar (UGP) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $4, down from $4.50. The analyst cites valuation for the downgrade following the stock's outperformance.Credit Suisse downgraded Ball Corp. (BALL) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $58, down from $65, on more concerns about the mass beer category going forward given shifts in consumer spending away from the category as well as Ball's exposure to Anheuser-Busch (BUD).Citi analyst Andres Cardona downgraded Ecopetrol (EC) to Neutral from Buy with an unchanged price target of $12.50 after the company hosted its investor day meeting. The company made ""relatively small changes to the 2022 update,"" with perhaps some incremental emphasis on the energy transition agenda, but in practice the hydrocarbon business will remain the main business at least until the end of this decade and the ""big change"" will come after 2030, the analyst tells investors.Credit Suisse downgraded O-I Glass (OI) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $22, up from $21. While destocking is playing a role, the firm does have concerns that premium substrates like glass will see continued volume pressure ahead and as new glass capacity comes online, pricing pressure will likely intensify.Story continuesTop 5 Initiations:UBS assumed coverage of Ford (F) with a Buy rating and $15 price target as part of a broader research note on U.S. Autos, Auto Parts, and Auto-Tech names. The group at large has sold off owing in part to uncertainty around the UAW-D3 labor negotiations, but the firm's analysis suggests that on average, about 4 weeks of a strike at each of the D3 companies has been priced in, and if a strike occurs, it too will pass, the analyst tells investors in a research note.TD Cowen initiated coverage of J.M. Smucker (SJM) with an Outperform rating and $158 price target. After bolstering its management team, reshaping the portfolio, and sharpening its marketing, the company has created an advantaged commercial model that exceeds food peers, says the analyst.Citi initiated coverage of SQM (SQM) with a Buy rating and $85 price target. SQM has been an underperformer in the local market and current valuations ""seem to be on the bottom,"" the analyst tells investors.UBS initiated coverage of Tesla (TSLA) with a Neutral rating and $290 price target as part of a broader research note on U.S. Autos, Auto Parts, and Auto-Tech names. Tesla is well positioned for the long-term, but the firm prefers to await a better entry point with 2024 seen as a below trend growth year, says UBS.JPMorgan initiated coverage of Cactus (WHD) with a Neutral rating and $60 price target. The firm starts the stock at Neutral as it thinks Street expectations will need to be reset slightly lower given the greater than expected pullback in the U.S. rig count.]"

63,92254e0f-75d9-33e5-89dd-57bc6b9732df,ALGN,2023-09-14,Here's Why Align Technology (ALGN) is Poised for a Turnaround After Losing -10.74% in 4 Weeks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-align-technology-algn-133505112.html,1694612105,STORY,['ALGN'],"[Align Technology (ALGN) has been on a downward spiral lately with significant selling pressure. After declining 10.7% over the past four weeks, the stock looks well positioned for a trend reversal as it is now in oversold territory and there is strong agreement among Wall Street analysts that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier.Guide to Identifying Oversold StocksWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Here's Why ALGN Could Experience a TurnaroundThe heavy selling of ALGN shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 29.23. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.This technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering ALGN in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 0.3% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, ALGN currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 72% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Microsoft. Check out our latest analysis for Microsoft ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Microsoft?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Microsoft already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Microsoft, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Microsoft. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.8%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.2% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.0% by the third-largest shareholder.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of MicrosoftWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Microsoft Corporation. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$862m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 27% stake in Microsoft. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Microsoft , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.

If you want to skip our discussion on the technology market, head directly to 5 Best Technology ETFs To Buy. The pandemic had a profound impact on businesses around the world. As for the technology sector, COVID-19 induced a number of disruptions, while presenting plenty of opportunities as well. For instance, while the pandemic caused major supply chain issues for the semiconductor industry leading to massive shortages and delays, it also influenced a global need for remote work-spaces, online retail, telehealth, and EdTech. According to a report by Deloitte, the technology sector has not just endured these challenges, it has thrived. In 2023, while the slowing economy continues to put pressure on the industry, along with ongoing disruptions in supply chain and workforce, the industry is paving its path towards innovation. Don't Miss: 10 Best Silver ETFsAccording to Gartner, the global spending in IT is forecasted to be roughly $4.6 trillion in 2023, increasing 5.5% since the previous year. Regardless of the concerns about the macroeconomic pressures, the IT sector is expected to expand, even in regions with flat GDP growth rates. Although the devices segment is estimated to decline by 5% during 2023, the software segment seems set for a double-digit growth rate. John-David Lovelock, VP Analyst at Gartner, stated: “The macroeconomic headwinds are not slowing digital transformation. Prioritization will be critical as CIOs look to optimize spend while using digital technology to transform the company’s value proposition, revenue and client interactions.” As per McKinsey, generative artificial intelligence is set to spearhead the need for innovation in the technology sector. While the potential for a framework based on artificial intelligence is endless, the business applications for the tech are expected to reduce development times, empower non-technical staff, and enable businesses to explore avenues for value addition through assistive technology. As per an estimate, innovation in generative artificial intelligence is expected to add $4.4 trillion in economic value by increasing productivity for businesses and consumers. Furthermore, investors seem confident about the potential for the tech sector, as investments worth nearly $1 trillion were made in the sector during 2022.Story continuesAlso Read: 10 Best Dividend ETFsIn addition to artificial intelligence, another major focus for the tech sector is cybersecurity. According to a report by Fortune Business Insights, in 2022, the total market for cybersecurity was valued in excess of $172 billion and this is expected to increase to nearly $425 billion by 2030. As the number of data breaches continues to rise, businesses look towards improving safety measures. Data breaches affect everyone – consumers, businesses, and governments. The sensitive nature of data highlights a growing requirement for safety for all stakeholders involved. As the world continues to take steps towards digitization, the risk for such breaches only multiplies. According to McKinsey, the market opportunity for cybersecurity solutions can be valued in excess of $2 trillion. By 2025, the damage from cyber attacks is projected to cost $10.5 trillion annually. With numerous companies underfunded to improve their security measures, the opportunity lies in four major areas – cloud technologies, pricing mechanisms, artificial intelligence, and other managing services. With developments in artificial intelligence, companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are working on combining the two in products such as Microsoft Security Copilot. Similarly, investments in private cybersecurity companies continue to increase as well. Recently, cloud-based security firm Wiz managed to raise $300 million at a $10 billion valuation.  While inflation still remains high, sectors such as technology, healthcare, and industrials are expected to outperform the market and provide a cover for investors in 2023. Additionally, more than 75% of tech leaders expect a better performance for the tech sector during the year. This article discusses some of the best technology ETFs that provide investors with access to market leaders like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc.

(NASDAQ:QLYS) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Qualys, Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS), a cloud-based vulnerability management cybersecurity platform, detracted from performance. While third quarter revenue and profit beat consensus expectations, billings–a forward growth indicator based on contracts–decelerated slightly as the tough macro environment caused deal scrutiny, longer sales cycles among new customers, and a slower productivity ramp-up for newly hired sales reps. Despite near-term challenges, we think Qualys can continue compounding revenue and free cash-flow-per-share growth for several reasons.”11.

However both enjoyed a period of overearning through the pandemic, with CDW benefitting from abnormally high IT spend and Ulta seeing demand spike for beauty products as consumers emerged from their lockdown cocoons. As the normalization of these trends produced an air pocket in demand management adjusted full year expectations and both shares sold off sharply; Ulta fell almost 30% in May, from $560 to $400, while CDW fell 25% between February and May, from $215 to $160.”9. iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (BATS:IGV)5 Year Performance as of September 12: 78.44%Introduced in July 2001, the objective for the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (BATS:IGV) is to track the performance of the S&amp;P North American Expanded Technology Software Index, which consists of tech companies involved in software development, home entertainment, and computing solutions.

Oracle has messaged that this business has price-performance advantages as compared to the other infrastructure companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Google) and appears to be winning business as a result. On the earnings call, management made the case that OCI will play a significant role in the Generative AI workloads which bodes well for continued growth.”8.

The tougher macro environment caught up with Atlassian in the quarter as the company is seeing slower software user additions as customers of all sizes moderate hiring and spending. However, the company still expects to grow sales at a mid-20s rate in Q4 and grow its strategically important cloud revenues 40%–45%. These are slower rates than we expected, and could slow further, but Atlassian’s growth metrics remain solid in light of the environment. In the short term, slower revenue growth will likely pressure margins and profitability given the company’s rapid hiring expansion in recent periods. But we detect a meaningful shift in tone from management on expense growth and margins now that top-line growth is slowing. While we fully expect Atlassian to keep investing in its large growth opportunities, we think a prudent reprioritization of this spending will lead to margin tailwinds in the medium term. We are sensitive to the slowing near-term growth dynamics but believe remaining invested is appropriate given the longer term profit growth potential.”7.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft were also positive contributors, up 55.19% and 42.66%, respectively. All three stocks benefited from a renewed interest in growth stocks by investors in the first half of the year.Amazon had an impressive first half of the year as well with growth out of its retail segment but slightly slower growth in its cloud business. Customers optimized workloads for existing capacity they were already paying for rather than adding incremental capacity in the current environment. We remain very excited about the opportunity for the company to reduce the labor needs of its retail segment through the use of technology and automation in the future.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Technology ETFs To Buy.    Suggested articles:15 Worst Performing Dividend Stocks YTD25 Biggest Web3 Companies In The World10 Biggest EV Charging Companies in the US Disclosure: None. 12 Best Technology ETFs To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Three years later, these companies are “ditching” their diversity commitments after failing to embed DEI into their business. According to a February report from Revelio Labs, more than 300 DEI roles were impacted by layoffs at major organizations in the last half of 2022—the highest of any function.“If a company can do away with the D&amp;I officers because it didn't add business value, well, that's a problem, right?” said Tippens. “The situation wasn't set up in such a way that the D&amp;I leader was adding business value through metrics [such as] satisfying our customers or satisfying our team members.”Tippens advised leaders to focus on the “three Cs of diversity:” compliance, corporate social responsibility, and competitive advantage. “We have to show that diversity, equity, and inclusion add to business value, whether it's around eliminating regrettable attrition, making sure that our employees' needs are met, or making sure we can satisfy our customers in the marketplace,” he says, “We have to try and tie dollar value to the work that we do in terms of metrics.”In 2020, Cisco established a social justice action office focused on 12 measures, such as increasing the representation of Black employees, improving pay equity practices, and providing antidiscrimination and inclusive culture training to employees, partners, and select suppliers. Metrics from this program are reported to Cisco’s board of directors quarterly.At Walgreens Boots Alliance, the pharmacy store chain tries to ensure that its workforce reflects the communities it serves across the U.S. and relies on metrics it shares in external reports. ""In our ESG report, we use very stringent standards about being able to quantify our progress and in our measures,"" said fellow panelist Alethia Jackson, Walgreens Boots Alliance’s senior vice president of ESG and chief DEI officer.Story continuesLastly, organizations and leaders need the guts to stand by their DEI commitments—no matter how unpopular they may become.“Sometimes we have to make these decisions that this is what we stand by, this is our purpose. We're not going to waver from this,” said Tippens. “And if you don't agree with this, maybe this is not the company for you.”Watch the Fortune Impact Initiative livestream here.Paige McGlauflinpaige.mcglauflin@fortune.com@paidionThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

The ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy has limited mega-cap exposure, which has recently hampered relative performance and the strategy underperformed the Russell 3000 Growth Index benchmark during the quarter. The strategy recorded gains across four of the seven sectors in which it was invested on an absolute basis. IT sector was the primary contributor to the performance while the consumer discretionary sector detracted. Overall stock selection and sector allocation detracted from performance relative to the benchmark. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2023.ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy highlighted stocks like Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in the second quarter 2023 investor letter.

We took advantage of the narrow breadth in the second quarter to increase our exposure to the consumer discretionary sector with two purchases that further enhance portfolio diversification and should help support consistent performance through a full cycle.Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is the leading provider of specialty coffee beverages, operating close to 19,000 global stores primarily in North America, China and Japan and 37,000 licensed partner locations. We view Starbucks as a quality compounder with strong free cash flow, operating in a segment and in dayparts that are very much routine-based and habitual, balancing the business’s exposure to discretionary spending. Additionally, Starbucks is still in the early stages of its reinvention plan to help accelerate revenue growth over the next several years on the back of better same store sales and unit growth.

Organizers say union supporters were illegally fired while the company has denied the allegations.Schultz last year called unions a ""third party"" that the employees ""wouldn't need,"" adding that the company was ""in a battle for the hearts and minds of our people.""In March, Schultz defended himself and the company against allegations of ""union busting"" at a U.S. Senate committee hearing.During his 41-year association, Schultz played a crucial role in taking Starbucks from a small company selling only whole beans to a global coffeehouse chain with more than 36,000 stores in 86 markets.Schultz, 70, stepped down as CEO in March after he returned to the helm for the third time. He oversaw a major revamp in technology at Starbucks' stores during his latest stint, doubling down on equipment and employee training to improve service.Schultz will become lifelong chairman emeritus following the retirement.""I look forward to supporting this next generation of leaders to steward Starbucks into the future as a customer, supporter and advocate in my role as chairman emeritus,"" Schultz said.The honorary title typically brings no official position on the board and does not hold any voting power, attendance or other rights.Wall Street analysts said the move did not come as a surprise.""With the executive team and board both built out and aligned to longer-term strategic goals, it makes sense that (Schultz) could confidently take a step back,"" Stephens analyst Joshua Long said.The company elected Wei Zhang as the ninth director on its board, effective Oct. 1.

His departure from the board is “part of a planned transition,” the company said Wednesday.In a prepared statement Wednesday, Schultz said his “gratitude to (Starbucks employees) and the millions of stakeholders and customers that have helped Starbucks endure is beyond measure.” He added that he looks ""forward to supporting this next generation of leaders to steward Starbucks into the future as a customer, supporter and advocate in my role as chairman emeritus.”After purchasing Starbucks in 1987, Schultz headed the company as CEO until 2000 and again between 2008 and 2017. He later came out of retirement to return as interim CEO while the company searched for a new chief executive last year — but bid farewell to that title after Laxman Narasimhan officially took the reins in March.Also on Wednesday, Starbucks announced that Wei Zhang, who most recently served as senior advisor to e-commerce company Alibaba Group, has been elected to the board effective Oct. 1.For its third fiscal quarter ended in July, Starbucks reported record revenue — with same-store sales (or sales at stores open at least a year) notably jumping 46% in China, reversing last year’s declines due to COVID restrictions. Still, the chain's revenue and same-store sales were lower than expected as North American store traffic slowed.The Seattle-based coffee giant said its overall revenue for the period rose 12% to $9.2 billion in the quarter — slightly under to analysts' expected revenue of $9.3 billion, according to FactSet. Meanwhile, the company’s net income rose 25% to $1.1 billion, or 99 cents per share. Excluding restructuring costs, the company earned $1 per share — higher than the 95 cents analysts forecast.In recent months, Starbucks and Schultz also came under fire over allegations that the company violated labor laws amid workers' unionization efforts. During his time as interim CEO, Schultz was called on by Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont Independent and chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, and others to testify.In a March appearance before the committee, Schultz insisted the coffee chain hasn’t broken labor laws and is willing to bargain with unionized workers — but was also firm in his stance that the company provides good wages and benefits and doesn’t need a union. The National Labor Relations Board previously charged Starbucks with hundreds of labor law violations, including firing labor organizers and illegally closing unionized stores.]"

For a quick overview of the 10 most produced foods, read our article 10 Most Produced Foods in the World.As the world's population continues to grow, the demand for food will naturally increase. This means prioritizing food production and ensuring everyone has access to nutritious, safe, and affordable food is more important than ever. The production volume of food in the world is staggering. In 2020, global food production was around 9.8 billion tons. Sysco Corp (NYSE:SYY) states that global food production is expected to double by 2050 compared to its levels in 2020.According to the United Nations, the global per capita food production is around 95.1 billion metric tons yearly. This food production varies significantly from country to country. Only a few meals are made per person in some countries, such as China and India. There are several reasons behind this, including population density, land scarcity, and insufficient interest in agriculture. On the other hand, per capita food production is much higher in other countries, such as the United States and Canada. It is attributable to several factors, including the abundance of land, the favorable climate, and the high level of agricultural investment.However, not all food is produced equal. Some foods, such as sugarcane, are produced in much larger quantities than others. For example, in 2022, the production of sugarcane increased by 22% from 66.380 million tons to 81.009 million tons, making it one of the foods most built in the world. Other most produced crops include maize (corn), rice, wheat, soybeans, and potatoes.In the first half of 2022, global trade grew at double-digit rates; these big jumps were the result of increasing food and energy prices. In 2022, food production was estimated to be over $5 trillion, making it one of the largest industries in the world.Story continuesThe value of food production is determined by several factors, including the quantity of food produced, the price of food, and the cost of inputs such as fertilizer and labor.The worth of food production keeps increasing, but it needs to keep up with the food cost, which is expanding. This makes people worry about how low-income households can buy food. In its 2022 annual report, Sysco Corp (NYSE:SYY) highlights the growing concern that food production is increasingly becoming concentrated in a handful of countries. Sysco Corp (NYSE:SYY) highlights that China, India, Brazil, Russia, and the United States produce about one-third of the world's food.Moreover, the value of food production has generally affected the economic situation. Agriculture is an essential factor in GDP growth across many countries. It is vital to find a long-term way of increasing the value of food production. For this to happen, technological and agricultural practices will have to improve.In a Q&amp;A discussion, the Group president of North American Retail of General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS), one of the biggest USA-based branded food products processors, pointed out that they have raised prices 5 times, within the year 2021. One of the reasons for the historical rise in prices over a year is the increase in wheat prices. Wheat prices have been rising in recent years due to factors such as drought and crop failures. This has led to concerns about food security in some countries.The cost of fertilizer has also been rising due to the increasing demand for energy and other inputs. This is giving a hard time to farmers to make money. Precision agriculture is one type of new technology that is helping to improve the efficiency of food output. This means that rates go up and costs go down.How Does the Environment Affect Food Production?Overall, food production value in the world is a complex issue with various factors affecting it. It is essential to stay current on the latest trends to make informed food security and sustainability decisions. The way we produce and consume food has a significant impact on the environment and vice versa. General Mills Inc (NYSE:GIS) addresses the issue that the global food system accounts for about 26% of greenhouse gas emissions. General Mills Inc (NYSE:GIS) sets the bar high by aiming to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emission by 2050.Water is the most essential element in food production. Due to climate change, pollution, and population growth, water is becoming increasingly scarce in many parts of the world. Deforestation is another significant concern for the global environment. UN Environment Program offers insights that about 12 million hectares of forest are cleared yearly to make way for agricultural land. The world has lost one-third of its forests.Excessive food production is also a danger to the environment in terms of soil erosion and nutrition depletion. This is leading to the loss of biodiversity.Most Produced Foods in the WorldPixabay/Public DomainMethodologyIn this article, we have listed the 25 most produced foods in the world. To comprehensively assess their performance, we used four key metrics: Production Volume, Production Value, and Per Capita Production.To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the selected metrics, we draw upon reputable indexes and reports by the Food and Agriculture Organization, AG WEB Farm Journal, and Our World in Data.We started by scoring food on each metric from 1 to 25 (1 representing the most produced and 25 least produced in our list of 25). To provide a balanced evaluation, each metric was assigned a specific weight, reflecting its relative importance:Production Volume: 40%Production Value: 20%Per Capita Production: 20%By considering these specific weights of each metric, weighted averages were calculated that reflect the relative significance of each criterion. We then ranked the most produced foods worldwide in descending order from 25 to 1 (based on the weighted average results), with 1 representing the highest rank and 25 representing the lowest on our list.Here is our list of the 25 most produced foods in the world, shedding light on their economic contributions and growth trajectories in the global food trade arena.Most Produced Foods in the WorldOatsAnnual Per Capita Production in 2022: 3 kgUsed in many kinds, like oatmeal, bran, and oat flour, the global production of oats stands at 23,104,147 tons yearly.

Spirit Airlines also says promotional activity and decreasing demand are some of the reasons for its cut. They follow Southwest Airlines (LUV) and Alaska Air Group (ALK) which also recently warned of the financial impact of higher fuel costs.Yahoo Finance Live discusses how demand and higher fuel costs are impacting the airline industry.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: Also, we're tracking Spirit Airlines. Those shares are moving lower this morning by about 2.8% after cutting its forecast for the year. Spirit not the only one adjusting its forecast for the year. American Airlines, they also cited higher fuel costs for the change that is seeing shares down of American Airlines and Spirit here this morning.Both of them are down on the day. But these announcements had started to roll out even earlier this month. Southwest and Alaska Airlines, they cut their third quarter forecast, as well. You're taking a look at both Southwest Airlines and Alaska Air also down here on the day by about 2% for both of those.JULIE HYMAN: The numbers for Spirit Air, in particular, now, its third quarter operating margin, adjusted operating margin going to be dropping a drop of negative 14.5% to 15.5%. Previously, it had been negative 5.5% to 7.5%. So a huge decrease in that operating margin forecast. Part of it, indeed, put down to fuel costs here.But the company says, also, during the last few weeks-- this is from the statement from Spirit-- the company has seen heightened promotional activity with steep discounting for travel booked for the second half of the third quarter through the pre-Thanksgiving travel period. They also talk about fuel prices. But Spirit, I don't know, about alone among the airlines. Most of them are blaming the high fuel prices. But Spirit is also talking about this promotional activity and a little bit of a decrease in demand.Story continuesThis is something that investors have been asking questions about. When is demand going to start to weaken? So, at least, for the discount airline getting a little bit of a hint there.BRAD SMITH: And for another discount airliner as well, Frontier Airlines, also saying in its statement today, in recent weeks, sales have been trending below historical seasonality patterns here. Additionally, they cited fuel prices for the quarter expected to average approximately $0.23 a gallon more than previously forecasted here.So all of them essentially saying the same thing, especially on the low cost side, just to really spelling out where the demand environment, also is not favorable at the same time that they're being met with headwinds in the costs for their fuel expenses.JULIE HYMAN: And those Frontier shares are down by 8% with the others here.]"

The company being a consumer defensive stock, has been surviving the market turmoil pretty well.The discount retailer’s key strengths are strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives, and an emphasis on membership growth.

It has amassed assets over $467.65 million, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Small Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Small Cap BlendSitting at a market capitalization below $2 billion, small cap companies tend to be high-potential stocks compared to its large and mid cap counterparts, but come with higher risk.Typically holding a combination of both growth and value stocks, blend ETFs also demonstrate qualities seen in value and growth investments.CostsWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.20%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.41%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector--about 19.50% of the portfolio. Financials and Information Technology round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Sep 23 Cme Eminirus2k (RTYU3) accounts for about 1.11% of total assets, followed by Emcor Group Inc (EME) and Atkore Inc (ATKR).Performance and RiskGSSC seeks to match the performance of the Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity Index before fees and expenses. The Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity Index is designed to deliver exposure to equity securities of small capitalization U.S. issuers.Story continuesThe ETF has added roughly 5.17% so far this year and it's up approximately 4.98% in the last one year (as of 09/14/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $50.18 and $61.36.The ETF has a beta of 1 and standard deviation of 22.12% for the trailing three-year period. With about 1221 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesGoldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Small Cap Equity ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors.

IWM has an expense ratio of 0.19% and IJR charges 0.06%.Bottom-LineWhile an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., speaks to reporters in the Capitol last May. (Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) (Bill Clark via Getty Images)A debate about the appropriate aggressiveness of banking regulators is intensifying a decade and a half after a housing bust and Lehman’s bankruptcy triggered the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression, forcing Washington bailouts of several giant banks.That US aid branded certain institutions in the minds of many as ""too big to fail"" and kickstarted a long, national debate about which banks should be regulated more aggressively and how.The focus on this subject in Washington took another turn in 2023 as the banking industry experienced one of its most challenging years since 2008.Three sizable lenders went down in the spring, including Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic, as depositors pulled their money in a mass exit. First Republic and Silicon Valley Bank were the second- and third-largest bank failures in US history.Regulators sold the bulk of First Republic to JPMorgan Chase, a deal Warren has criticized for making a big institution even bigger. JPMorgan is the No. 1 bank in the US as measured by assets.Regulators seized First Republic in May and sold the bulk of operations to JPMorgan. (MattGush via Getty Images)To Warren, one lesson from 2008 is that it is dangerous to concentrate so much power in so few hands. Allowing big banks to acquire smaller banks will only increase those risks, in her view.Warren on Wednesday specifically called out Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu for being open to more bank mergers.Story continues“Despite all that we have learned since 2008 and despite President Biden ordering regulators to update merger guidelines, Acting Controller Hsu and Treasury Secretary Yellen have still signaled openness to more mergers,” said Warren.Several big bank CEOs this week are also pushing back against regulators for another reason, saying they are going too far. Specifically, they cited new proposed capital rules they claim would restrict lending and pose a danger to the US economy.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon on Monday called the new US proposal requiring banks to bolster their capital buffers ""hugely disappointing,"" warning that it could push more lending into private credit markets.""I would love to know what they really want to accomplish,"" Dimon said Monday, referring to regulators behind the proposal that was unveiled in July.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon in 2021. Photo: Michel Euler/Pool via REUTERS (POOL New / reuters)Banks affected by the changes proposed in July will see an aggregate 16% increase in their capital requirements. Regulators say the increase would primarily affect the largest banks and that most have enough capital already to comply. Capital is the buffer banks have to hold to absorb future losses.These changes are part of the US version of an international accord known as Basel III that was developed following the 2008 crisis by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon also didn’t hold back when he spoke Tuesday about the proposed change.""I don’t think these rules make sense,"" he said.Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon. Photo: REUTERS/Denis Balibouse (Denis Balibouse / Reuters)Several bank trade groups also sent a letter Tuesday to the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the OCC asking them to “re-propose” the rule, arguing that the initial proposal “relies on data and analyses that the agencies have not made available to the public.”Warren on Wednesday called for another change to how banks are scrutinized that also draws on lessons she said were learned in 2008.She asked Congress to pass legislation that would allow regulators to claw back executive bonuses and compensation in the event of a bank failure.The Senate Banking Committee in June voted on a bipartisan basis to pass a bill dubbed the RECOUP Act that would allow the FDIC to claw back compensation from senior executives at failed banks going back two years.The bill is a lighter version of legislation introduced by Senator Warren, also with bipartisan backing, in the wake of SVB's collapse in March. The full Senate will now take up the bill.“In a broken system, like the one we have, we know who gets ahead no matter who they've harmed. And that's Wall Street executives. That was true in 2008. And it is true today,” said Warren.Click here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

The recent forecast is double than its initial expectation of a 5% decline in NII.Over the last few quarters, funding costs had increased considerably given the high interest rate environment, with customers shifting their investments to other higher-yielding assets. This had adversely impacted the company’s deposit base.Given the tough macroeconomic backdrop, Northern Trust’s total deposits tumbled in the first half of 2023. Also, higher funding costs weighed on its net interest margin, which caused the metric to decrease over the same period.Nonetheless, Jason Tyler, NTRS’ chief financial officer stated that deposits have generally stabilized in the third quarter of 2023.Northern Trust is supported by its organic growth reflected by a rise in revenues and loan balances over the years. The uptrend continued for both metrics in the first half of 2023.Further, robust pipelines in asset servicing and several new wins across both operating segments will drive organic growth and propel fee income in the upcoming period.Northern Trust’s shares have lost 3.2% over the past three months against the industry’s growth of 0.8%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research NTRS presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Accordingly, CFG plans to reduce its non-core loan portfolio by $9.2 billion from $13.7 billion as of the second-quarter 2023 end.Management seems in no rush to sell non-core portfolio and intends to avoid recording losses related to the sales.

A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-06-30, American International Group Inc's dividend payout ratio is 0.20.American International Group Inc's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks American International Group Inc's profitability 5 out of 10 as of 2023-06-30, suggesting fair profitability. The company has reported net profit in 6 years out of the past 10 years.Growth Metrics: The Future OutlookTo ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. American International Group Inc's growth rank of 5 out of 10 suggests that the company has a fair growth outlook. Additionally, the company's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. American International Group Inc's revenue has increased by approximately 8.60% per year on average, outperforming approximately 66.59% of global competitors.The company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run.

According to Neumann, the firm's password-crackdown initiatives have led to a plateau in platform traffic, concurrently adding obstacles to Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s advertising business.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with GILD. Click here to check it out. NFLX 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NFLXAlthough Neumann believes the segment will eventually succeed, he thinks it will take time. After coming across Neumann's comments, I decided to assess the segment in further detail; here are a few factors that I picked up along the way.Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX): A top-down analysis of its headline numbersRecent data shows that Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s market share in the streaming business is declining. On one side, much of the decline is owed to the natural development of the streaming industry's business cycle, which is consolidating. Thus, one could argue that Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s lower market share is normal for a ""low barriers to entry business.""However, a contrasting argument is that competitors have upped the ante, providing better content and subsequently nibbling away at Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s market share. I base much of the argument on anecdotes as I have realized that Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s content variety is stagnating.Netflix's advertising revenue 'plateau' assessedSource: Similarweb (Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s market share, 2023)Netflix's Growth OpportunitiesAlthough Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) is struggling with receding market share, it must be considered that the streaming industry remains in secular growth territory, with compound annual growth of 18.45% anticipated to last until 2030. Moreover, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) is taking advantage of ex-U.S. revenue, with only 40% of its trailing twelve-month revenue stemming from the U.S., providing the company with diversification benefits and renewed growth opportunities.Story continuesAn abundance of opportunities exists within emerging markets as purchasing power-based pricing has led to a surge in streaming activity. In my view, emerging markets present a phenomenal opportunity for Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) as emerging markets are gaining ground on the global Gross Domestic Product mix.Netflix's advertising revenue 'plateau' assessedSource: International Monetary FundAn idiosyncratic vantage pointA quantitative measure of Neumann's claims shows that Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s year-to-date traffic has flatlined significantly. Although the flatlining can partially be attributed to other factors, such as the back-to-office landscape and a softening economy, it is no coincidence that the plateau occurred during the same period as the firm's password crackdown initiatives.Netflix's advertising revenue 'plateau' assessedSource: TipRanks (Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) Traffic)Netflix's Subscriber GrowthFortunately for Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), its paid subscribers have increased year-on-year, providing its subscription business with the necessary latitude to perform. I believe this somewhat contradicts Neumann's claims that a shakeout of subscribers is unfolding. Even though net usage and revenue have softened, the fact remains that paid subscriber support is robust.Netflix's advertising revenue 'plateau' assessedSource: Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) (second-quarter earnings results)Netflix's Operating Profit MarginsLastly, I felt it was necessary to mention that Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) is set to recover its operating profit margins. Firstly, the firm is regaining demand in the labor force, meaning a plateau in the economy has transferred wage demand from employees to employees. Moreover, the firm's restructuring has shown to have an immediate effect, ramping up Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s operating profit margin, which I believe will be sustained unless a structural break occurs within the company or its industry.Netflix's advertising revenue 'plateau' assessedCollectively, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s bottom-up features juxtapose its top-down attributes, illustrating that robust financial growth is present, somewhat phasing out its grapple for market share.ValuationNetflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s secular fundamental growth and high price multiples suggest it is still a growth stock. As such, I decided to focus on growth-orientated metrics instead of mean-reverting price multiples.Firstly, as illustrated below, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s EBITDA per share is on an exponential growth trajectory, which is encouraging to see. The EBITDA line item speaks volumes for technology firms as they often possess subjective depreciation and amortization policies. Moreover, the line items phase out volatile capital structures, which are inherent traits of growth-stage companies.Netflix's advertising revenue 'plateau' assessedNetflix's Forward Rate of ReturnAnother factor to consider is Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s Yacktman forward rate of return, which is an earnings-based expected return formulated for growth stocks. Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s forward rate of return is within the 72nd industry percentile, suggesting it possesses relative value.Guru TradesUnfortunately, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s guru trades index is in a year-to-date deficit, with the likes of Ken Fischer, George Soros (Trades, Portfolio), and Ray Dalio (Trades, Portfolio) all disposing of Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s shares. Although the guru trades index is an isolated observation, it holds substance as it tracks the outlook of some of the most renowned investors around the globe.Netflix's advertising revenue 'plateau' assessedFinal WordAn in-depth analysis shows that Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s market share is waning, which has scared many of Wall Street's top-tier investors. However, an enhanced analysis illustrates that much of Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s password crunch-down-induced market share decline has been phased out by robust idiosyncratic performance.Further, the company is aligned to take advantage of opportunities in emerging markets, presenting a case for renewed growth.Lastly, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s salient valuation multiples indicate that the stock is undervalued. Therefore, I believe the asset will discover new horizons if provided with the necessary support from market sentiment.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Lai is best know to Taiwanese audiences as a singer and as the actress who played a presidential candidate in the Chinese-language Netflix political drama Wave Makers, which is credited with triggering the #MeToo movement in Taiwan.“This presidential election is a critical turning point for Taiwan and of crucial importance to Taiwan’s future,” Gou said when explaining the choice of Lai as his running mate. “I, Terry Gou, an entrepreneur with almost 50 year’s of experience, together with Lai, an outstanding, all-round writer and spiritual mentor, we have no political baggage, and we are deeply concerned about the needs of the people.”Gou and Lai face an uphill battle to reach the presidential office in January’s election. Gou has consistently polled in last place among the four declared candidates. Vice President and ruling Democratic Progressive Party candidate Lai Ching-te, no relation to Lai Pei-hsia, currently leads the race with 30% support, according to a survey released by broadcaster TVBS earlier this month.Ko Wen-je of the young Taiwan People’s Party polled second with 23% and the Kuomintang’s Hou Yu-ih had 19%. Gou trails the others with a support rating of 14%.In a tearful speech, Lai laid out her qualifications for vice president, touting her skills as a communicator. As well as a career as a singer and an actress, she has spent much of the past 30 years studying psychology, during which time she has written several books on relationships and communication.Story continues“Before September, I didn’t understand much about Taiwanese politics,” Lai said at Thursday’s briefing. “I’d read the headlines but I wasn’t used to the way the media here communicates so I didn’t really watch the trends in Taiwan politics too closely, that was until Chairman Gou invited me to be his running mate.”Gou, who’s platform is based on forging better ties with China, acknowledged both he and Lai were newcomers to politics but insisted it was a strength, rather than a weakness, of his campaign.“We are both political amateurs,” he said. “But the public told me they have doubts about current politicians, as is the case in other countries.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekMBAs Are Spurning McKinsey to Buy Small CompaniesThe Real-Life Inspiration Behind The Bonfire of the VanitiesTikTok Shop Is a Real E-Commerce ThreatAn Online Startup Pitches a New Kind of MBAHow Sam Bankman-Fried’s Elite Parents Enabled His Crypto Empire©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

She played a presidential candidate in the hit Taiwanese Netflix show ""Wave Makers"" earlier this year. At the end of the show, she wins the election.That series, about the members of an election campaign team, including a supportive manager who convinces a young staffer who was groped that the issue is too important to be swept under the rug, kicked off a renewed #MeToo movement in Taiwan.""I'm quite open-minded. I told myself that last year I would set no ceiling for myself, and I didn't expect I'd actually be raised up this far,"" Lai told reporters.""After meeting Chairman Gou two or three times, I was very sure he's someone I could cooperate with. Because he's fascinating,"" she added. ""I told him, 'We're going to have fun.'""Gou has been tying to unite the anti-DPP vote, but has so far not managed to reach agreement with either the main opposition party, the Kuomintang, nor the small Taiwan People's Party on how that might work.The other parties have yet to announce running mates for their presidential candidates.Gou must gather close to 300,000 voter signatures by Nov. 2 to qualify as an independent candidate, according election regulations, and needed to decide his running mate before he could collect signatures.The Central Election Commission will review the signatures and announce the results by Nov. 14.Gou stepped down as Foxconn chief in 2019 and this month resigned as a company board member.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. Check out our latest analysis for TJX Companies TJX Companies' Improving ProfitsIn the last three years TJX Companies' earnings per share took off; so much so that it's a bit disingenuous to use these figures to try and deduce long term estimates. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. It's good to see that TJX Companies' EPS has grown from US$2.84 to US$3.48 over twelve months. There's little doubt shareholders would be happy with that 23% gain.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. EBIT margins for TJX Companies remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 3.2% to US$51b. That's a real positive.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of TJX Companies' future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Story continuesAre TJX Companies Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since TJX Companies has a market capitalisation of US$106b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$154m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.1% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Should You Add TJX Companies To Your Watchlist?As previously touched on, TJX Companies is a growing business, which is encouraging. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. The combination definitely favoured by investors so consider keeping the company on a watchlist. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 1 warning sign for TJX Companies that you need to be mindful of.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares.

127,ded5f39b-2418-3133-9beb-89febb27f89a,NEM,2023-09-14,The 3 Best Inflation Stocks to Buy Now: September 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-best-inflation-stocks-buy-130049315.html,1694091649,STORY,"['CVX', 'NEM', 'XOM', 'KO']","[Inflation is down from the 40-year highs it registered in 2022. However, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but any moderation is likely to be over. That’s why it’s still time to keep an eye out for some of the best inflation stocks. The biggest reason for higher inflation is that oil prices continue to rise. That will affect more than prices at the pump. If you’ve been at the grocery store, you know that food prices are still stubbornly high. Yet, it won’t be long before the companies with pricing power will pass their higher transportation costs along their supply chains. And precious metals may be another place to look for the best inflation stocks. If inflation starts moving higher, every dollar has less value. That’s a bullish scenario for the price of gold. And while some investors may choose to buy physical metals, gold stocks are also a good place to build an inflation hedge for your portfolio.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCoca-Cola (KO) The website for Coca-Cola Consolidated (COKE) displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comThe consumer staples sector is one place to look for the best inflation stocks, and an obvious choice is Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). Most investors know that KO stock is a favorite of Warren Buffett. However, the “why?” is as important as the 400 million shares that Buffett owns.Coke is a proven performer regardless of the economic situation. That performance translated into revenue, earnings and one of Buffett’s favorite items – dividends. Coke is a dividend king that has increased its dividend in each of the last 62 years.Don’t rule out the fact that this isn’t the same company that it was just 10 years ago. It’s still a beverage company, but it continues to strategically position itself for a younger audience looking for variety.Some investors may prefer PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). To be fair, both are solid choices. Both are expected to grow earnings above 7% in the next 12 months. Additionally, some investors may prefer PEP stock because of its dual focus that includes snack foods. However, at this moment, it looks like investors may get a little more share price growth with KO stock. It also trades for a slightly better valuation with a forward P/E of 22x.Story continuesChevron (CVX) Chevron logo on blue sign in front of skyscraper buildingSource: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comSometimes the best way to beat inflation is to lean into it. That’s the argument for investing in oil stocks – and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) is an undervalued choice for many reasons.First, despite CVX stock rising 4.2% in the last month, shares are still at $166. That’s not quite the bargain they were, but it’s still trading at a discount. Second, this is another solid dividend payer. Chevron hasn’t reached “king” status yet, but it has increased its dividend for 37 consecutive years. The dividend has been growing over 6% in the last three years.Chevron is one of the “traditional” energy companies making investments in alternative energy projects. The company has a “measure twice, cut once” strategy to ensure that its capex spend puts the company into a position where it can add value. Those initiatives are likely to boost earnings in coming years, which will lead to further share price gains.Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is another good name in this space. However, Chevron gets the nod in projected earnings and in analysts’ forecast for share price growth.Newmont Corporation (NEM) Newmont logo on a mobile phone screenSource: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockI know gold is a no-go for many investors. But you don’t need to be a gold digger to take a closer look at Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) at this time.The price of gold and the price of the dollar has an inverse relationship. That’s why falling inflation has put a ceiling on the spot price of gold. But if inflation begins to pick up, the price of gold will likely rise along with it. That’s why you can benefit by investing in the world’s largest gold miner based on the 2022 volume.Inflation isn’t the only scenario that can be bullish for gold. The BRICS nations may be years away from having a viable gold-based currency. But just the fact that a conversation is underway is noteworthy. Plus, if the Fed is successful in pulling off a soft landing, gold will be popular because of its utility in critical applications.Newmont is projected to grow earnings at a rate of 35% in the next 12 months. That has analysts giving NEM stock a consensus price that’s 50% higher than its closing price on September 5, 2023. Plus, the stock comes with a forward P/E ratio of just 18x which makes for an appealing valuation.On the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a LONG position in CVX.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance this year, and go directly to read 5 Worst Performing Dividend Stocks YTD. In 2023, dividend-paying stocks have not performed as well as other types of investments because many investors are showing a stronger preference for technology stocks. However, investment patterns change over time due to shifts in market sentiment and various economic factors. The US economy is uncertain this year due to unpredictable inflation. The latest CPI report showed that inflation increased in August from the same period last year, reversing the recent trend of slowing inflation. Compared to a year ago, it went up by 4.3%, which is in line with expectations and represents the smallest increase in almost two years.Because of the continuing economic uncertainty, the growth of dividends in the US slowed down during the second quarter of 2023. This deceleration in the country’s dividend growth resulted in a total of $148 billion worth of payouts, up modestly by 4.6% year-on-year when considering the core performance after accounting for lower one-time special dividends, according to the latest report by Janus Henderson. In general, dividend stocks haven’t performed that well this year. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, gained 2.33% this year so far, underperforming the tech-heavy NASDAQ, which delivered a 33.06% return to shareholders since the start of 2023.Also read: 15 Worst Performing Growth Stocks in 2023As the ongoing inflationary period continues to extend its course, dividend stocks can be a reassuring choice for concerned investors. Historical analysis also shows that dividend stocks have given a solid performance during periods of economic downturns. This is because dividend stocks are a defensive investment choice these equities tend to raise their dividend payments over time, which can help offset the effects of rising prices. In one of our previous articles, we cited Fidelity Investments’ data and mentioned that dividends accounted for more than half of the market's returns in periods of high inflation. The report also noted that in the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s, dividends made up 67%, 44%, and 73% of market returns, respectively. In those decades, when inflation averaged over 5%, total returns were below 10%.Story continuesAs mentioned above, tech stocks have dominated the market this year, surpassing dividend-paying companies. Even some of the biggest dividend companies such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) have also reported negative returns in 2023 so far. In this view, we will discuss some of the worst performing dividend stocks this year.15 Worst Performing Dividend Stocks YTDPhoto by Jp Valery on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we examined the worst-performing stocks of 2023 and selected dividend-paying stocks that have experienced substantial declines in their share prices so far this year.

This is our kind of company – despite the disparate parts, UGI grows earnings at a relatively steady high single digit rate over the long term while distributing excess cash through dividends.25 Shares are down due to a collection of short-term issues – driver shortages at the US propane business, losses from fixed priced contracts at the European energy marketing business, lower propane volumes in Europe and warmer weather.

(NYSE:ZTS) A Top Quality Stock?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boasting-48-return-equity-zoetis-120031227.html,1694692831,STORY,['ZTS'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS).Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Zoetis How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Zoetis is:48% = US$2.2b ÷ US$4.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.48 in profit.Does Zoetis Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Zoetis has a higher ROE than the average (22%) in the Pharmaceuticals industry.roeThat's clearly a positive. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesZoetis' Debt And Its 48% ROEZoetis clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.43. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings.

Pershing Square founder and CEO is best known for his aggressive campaigns designed to unlock and maximize shareholder value in undervalued stocks. Whether it is seeking board seats, pushing for mergers and acquisitions, or pushing for spin-offs, the hedge fund manager often seems to find his way into companies he invests in.Ackman is best known for his activist campaigns focusing on highly undervalued companies with tremendous potential. It all started with an investment in Wendy's in 2004, whereby he took a significant stake in the fast food chain and pressured management to spin off its Tim Horton's brand. His proxy battle would result in a substantial profit once he exited the position.However, it is not always rosy for Ackman, despite being one of the most prolific hedge fund managers. His biggest miss has to be his conviction for a $1 billion short position on the health supplement company Herbalife. His argument that the company was a pyramid scheme would put him at a crossroads with another ferocious activist investor, Carl Icahn. He exited the position in 2018, insisting that the capital could be better deployed in other better opportunities.Long-Term Returns of Bill Ackman's Activist TargetsIn recent years, Ackman has clarified that he is no longer interested in vocal short-selling campaigns.

133,e1ae4e34-58ea-3574-b8b5-e95507457f7b,NRG,2023-09-14,The 7 Best Utilities Stocks to Buy Now: September 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-utilities-stocks-buy-201744111.html,1694117864,STORY,"['NEE', 'TAC', 'NIMC', 'NRG']","[While even the so-called best utilities stocks will likely never be mistaken for sexy opportunities, they offer exceptional relevance, especially at this juncture. With Wall Street unsure how to digest various macroeconomic news, the utilities space brings some predictability to your portfolio.No, no one can guarantee upside, irrespective of whether we’re discussing the best utilities stocks or the merely good enough. However, the fundamental narrative is a dependable one. First, utilities benefit from natural monopolies. Basically, would-be competitors don’t even bother because of the steep barriers to entry.Second, the best utilities stocks are tied to critical services. And that means customers have to pay up, regardless of whatever’s going on with the economy. You’re not going to get this kind of dependency from, say a discretionary retailer.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTo further target the most viable opportunities, all of these ideas feature positive endorsement from Wall Street analysts. In addition, I’ll be leaning heavily into options market dynamics. Please refer to this article for a breakdown of the terminologies I’ll be using. With that, let’s dive into the best utilities stocks to buy now.NRG Energy (NRG)Close up of NRG logo on website against blurred background.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comBased in Houston, Texas, NRG Energy (NYSE:NRG) focuses on energy generation and retail electricity. Per its public profile, NRG’s portfolio includes natural gas, coal, oil, nuclear, wind and distributed solar generation. Since the beginning of this year, shares gained a bit over 19%, closing at $38.02 in the midweek session.Looking at the NRG’s options chain, its volatility smile presents an intriguing backdrop. From the strike price of $39 where implied volatility sits at a low of 0.24, this metric rises to 0.57 at the $50 strike. Based on the perspective of the call holder, as NRG options move out of the money (OTM), the underlying IV rises. Possibly, this dynamic suggests that at least some traders anticipate a bullish price move over the long run.Story continuesTo be fair, traders appear to be hedging against significant downside risk, with IV shooting up to 1.15 at the $20 strike. However, volatility appears muted between $30 and $40, suggesting a general confidence in price stability. Finally, analysts peg NRG as a strong buy with a $44.25 average price target, indicating over 16% upside. Thus, it’s one of the best utilities stocks to consider.NiSource (NI)Image of a gas burner with a blue flameSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Merrillville, Indiana, NiSource (NYSE:NI) is one of the largest fully regulated utility companies in the U.S. Per its corporate profile, NiSource serves approximately 3.5 million natural gas customers and half a million electric customers across six states. Since the start of the year, NI slipped about 4%. On Wednesday, it closed at $26.31.Turning to the options market, NI’s IV sits at a low of 0.23 at the $25 strike price. Steadily moving toward the OTM prices, IV rises to 0.85 at the $40 strike. This framework may indicate rising confidence that NI may move up in price over the long run. However, traders are also cognizant of the downside risk. Specifically, IV jumps to 2.33 at the $17.50 strike.However, the deep in-the-money (ITM) lift in IV suggests a mitigation of “tail risk.” Basically, IV spiked perhaps based on traders fear of a sharp crash in NI. However, the more realistic probability points to gradual positive returns. As evidence, analysts peg NI as a unanimous strong buy. Their average price target comes in at $30.67, implying almost 17% upside, making it one of the best utilities stocks.American Electric Power (AEP)the American Electric Power logo is magnified on a websiteSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comHailing from Columbus, Ohio, American Electric Power (NASDAQ:AEP) is a major investor-owned electric utility. Based on its public profile, the company delivers electricity to more than five million customers in 11 states. It also ranks as one of the largest generators of electricity in the U.S. Since the start of the year, AEP lost more than 19% of equity value. Recently, AEP closed at $77.34.While the red ink in the open market isn’t exactly pretty, it appears that options traders sense the worst may be over. From its volatility smile, IV sits at a low of roughly 0.18 at the $80 strike price. However, it gradually scoots higher to a blistering IV of 1.28 at the $130 strike. This backdrop indicates strong enthusiasm among the smart money that AEP will make a robust comeback.Even better, while traders are also protecting against downside risk – with IV rising to 0.62 at the $45 strike – the magnitude of volatility is relatively low for deep ITM calls versus far-off OTM calls. Therefore, AEP appears to benefit from bullish leanings. Plus, analysts peg AEP a consensus strong buy with a $94.64 price target, implying nearly 24% upside.NextEra Energy (NEE)The NextEra Energy (NEE) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comA popular idea among the best utilities stocks to buy, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) specializes in renewable energy, particularly wind and solar. Per its corporate profile, NextEra represents the largest electric utility holding firm by market capitalization. However, NEE has been off to a rough outing in 2023, shedding almost 22% since the January opener. On Wednesday, NEE closed at $65.69.Although disappointing for the time being, NEE’s volatility smile suggests a powerfully robust bullish backdrop. At the strike price of $71, IV printed a low of approximately 0.19. However, as NEE calls move toward the far OTM direction, IV rises dramatically. At the strike price of $85, IV stands at 0.62. This framework may indicate long-term optimism for NextEra.On the other side, the deep ITM strike prices don’t see a wild increase in IV. For example, at $55, IV comes in at only 0.30. Thus, the smart money doesn’t anticipate much movement toward the lower price points. Encouragingly, analysts peg NEE as a strong buy with an $85 price target, implying over 29% upside potential.TransAlta (TAC)Numerous electric lines are seen at sunset.Source: Pand P Studio / Shutterstock.comBased in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, TransAlta (NYSE:TAC) is an electricity power generator and wholesale marketing company. Per its public profile, TransAlta operates wind, hydro, natural gas and coal power generation facilities. It also focuses on sustainability initiatives. Since the start of the year, TAC gained nearly 6% of equity value. On the midweek session, TAC closed at $9.41.One of the apparently riskier ideas based on options dynamics, TAC’s IV sits at a low of 0.35 at the $10 strike. From there, IV rises to 2.40 at the $17.50 strike before dipping conspicuously to 1.11 at $20. Still, the overall takeaway is that the smart money anticipates TAC could possibly more than double in value.On the other side, IV stands at 5.69 at the $2.50 strike, which indicates risk mitigation. It’s possible that traders – while recognizing the upside opportunity – also see tail risk.However, analysts peg TAC as a consensus strong buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $13.87, implying over 47% upside potential. Thus, it still makes a case for best utilities stocks to buy now.AES (AES)A concept image of electricity flowing between two disconnected electric cables.Source: ESB Professional / Shutterstock.comDiving into the higher-risk, higher-reward ideas for best utilities stocks, AES (NYSE:AES) is a utility and power generation firm. Headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, AES owns and operates power plants, which it uses to generate and sell electricity to end users and intermediaries. While a relevant business, AEP has struggled in the market this year. Since the January opener, shares fell 38%.On Wednesday, AES closed at $17.43. Turning to its volatility smile, IV sits at a trough of 0.28 at the $18 strike. Moving in the OTM direction, IV steadily rises, almost in a linear fashion. At the apex, IV clocks in at 1.72 at the $32 strike. This suggests brewing sentiment for a bounce back among traders despite the open market’s crimson-stained sessions.Still, traders are accounting for downside risk. IV also rises rather acutely from the $16 strike moving deeper ITM. At $10, IV comes in at 1.37. Still, for the dice rollers, AES might be intriguing. First, it carries a strong buy consensus among analysts. Second, their average price target lands at $26.29, implying nearly 51% growth.Ameresco (AMRC)Ameresco building in Canada, AMRC stock.Source: JHVEPhoto / ShutterstockBased in Framingham, Massachusetts, Ameresco (NYSE:AMRC) specializes in comprehensive energy efficiency and renewable energy solutions. In addition to conducting energy audits for the purposes of infrastructural improvements, Ameresco provides myriad other services, including energy storage, microgrids and asset sustainability and maintenance. However, since the January opener, AMRC fell nearly 24%. On Wednesday, shares closed at $42.49.Though risky, traders appear to see upside potential, at least for the short to intermediate term. At the $45 strike price, IV sits at 0.46. From there, it shoots up to 1.38 at the $55 strike. Subsequently in the OTM direction, IV becomes choppy, peaking at 1.50 at $80. It then falls to 0.89 at $90. Again, traders may see short-to-intermediate-term profitability potential while waiting out the long term.As for risks, IV stands at a peak of 1.64 at the $25 strike. However, deep ITM IV doesn’t get elevated until $35. Thus, traders may anticipate relative predictability at the current open market price. For the gamblers, analysts peg AMRC as a unanimous strong buy. Their price target hits $65, implying 53% upside. If you’re seeking big gains, this could be one of the best utilities stocks.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance this year, and go directly to read 5 Worst Performing Dividend Stocks YTD. In 2023, dividend-paying stocks have not performed as well as other types of investments because many investors are showing a stronger preference for technology stocks. However, investment patterns change over time due to shifts in market sentiment and various economic factors. The US economy is uncertain this year due to unpredictable inflation. The latest CPI report showed that inflation increased in August from the same period last year, reversing the recent trend of slowing inflation. Compared to a year ago, it went up by 4.3%, which is in line with expectations and represents the smallest increase in almost two years.Because of the continuing economic uncertainty, the growth of dividends in the US slowed down during the second quarter of 2023. This deceleration in the country’s dividend growth resulted in a total of $148 billion worth of payouts, up modestly by 4.6% year-on-year when considering the core performance after accounting for lower one-time special dividends, according to the latest report by Janus Henderson. In general, dividend stocks haven’t performed that well this year. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, gained 2.33% this year so far, underperforming the tech-heavy NASDAQ, which delivered a 33.06% return to shareholders since the start of 2023.Also read: 15 Worst Performing Growth Stocks in 2023As the ongoing inflationary period continues to extend its course, dividend stocks can be a reassuring choice for concerned investors. Historical analysis also shows that dividend stocks have given a solid performance during periods of economic downturns. This is because dividend stocks are a defensive investment choice these equities tend to raise their dividend payments over time, which can help offset the effects of rising prices. In one of our previous articles, we cited Fidelity Investments’ data and mentioned that dividends accounted for more than half of the market's returns in periods of high inflation. The report also noted that in the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s, dividends made up 67%, 44%, and 73% of market returns, respectively. In those decades, when inflation averaged over 5%, total returns were below 10%.Story continuesAs mentioned above, tech stocks have dominated the market this year, surpassing dividend-paying companies. Even some of the biggest dividend companies such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) have also reported negative returns in 2023 so far. In this view, we will discuss some of the worst performing dividend stocks this year.15 Worst Performing Dividend Stocks YTDPhoto by Jp Valery on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we examined the worst-performing stocks of 2023 and selected dividend-paying stocks that have experienced substantial declines in their share prices so far this year. We started with a list of fifty companies by filtering them based on share price drops. From the resultant list, we picked the top 15 dividend stocks that performed the worst and arranged them in ascending order based on their share price drops as of September 13.15. NextEra Energy Partners, LP (NYSE:NEP)Year-to-Date Share Price Drop as of September 13: 31.16%NextEra Energy Partners, LP (NYSE:NEP) is an American publicly traded limited partnership that operates in the energy sector, with a specific focus on renewable energy and infrastructure. In the first half of the year, the company's funding strategy affected its share price significantly. Even though it announced a new plan to address these concerns, the share price continued to face challenges. The stock is down by 31.16% year-to-date, which makes it one of the worst performing dividend stocks on our list.In addition to NEP, some prominent dividend companies like The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) also declined this year.At the end of Q2 2023, 23 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in NextEra Energy Partners, LP (NYSE:NEP), compared with 24 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $285 million.14.

The stock has lost about 31% since the start of the year, which makes it one of the worst performing dividend stocks on our list. One of the main reasons for the stock's decline is the uncertainty in the regional banking sector, following the collapse of big banks earlier in March.Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.71 per share and has a dividend yield of 6.22%, as recorded on September 13.As of the close of Q2 2023, 46 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported owning stakes in Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA), the same as in the previous quarter.

Just like CMA, the fall in KeyCorp's share price is mainly due to the banking crisis that started in March and has affected the banking sector overall. Due to this, KEY is one of the worst-performing dividend stocks on our list.KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) has been raising its dividends for 12 consecutive years and currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.205 per share. As of September 13, the stock has a dividend yield of 6.87%.The number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) jumped to 49 in Q2 2023, from 34 in the previous quarter.

(NYSE:PFE) is a New York-based pharmaceutical and biotech company. Though the company has a strong dividend growth streak of 13 years, the share price still declined by 33.3% in 2023 so far. The negative returns are due to the uncertainty around the company's Covid-19 vaccine sales.

The reports finds that a focus on faster payment rails represents a significant market opportunity – and businesses that are not investing in new payments technology could find themselves at a competitive disadvantage. The report also finds that the increase in cross-border transactions is driving the need for real-time payments, as corporations looking to expand into new regions require more efficient and accessible methods.Key findings of the survey include:92% of respondents agreed that payments technology will be a significant to somewhat significant area of investment for their organization over the next 24-36 months.77% of respondents agreed that real-time payments can help provide a better customer experience, with 54% agreeing that it is better for urgent past-due payments, and 32% stating that real-time payments make cash flow easier and/or safer.55% of businesses in Asia have reported that they have already moved or would change financial services providers to have access to real-time payments.80% of respondents anticipate some increase to a significant increase in the volume of cross-border payments being made over the next 12-24 months.""The study reinforces that the adoption of real-time payment capabilities will continue to increase over the next few years as consumers expect more convenience and accuracy,"" said Carl Slabicki, Co-Head of Global Payments, Treasury Services at BNY Mellon. ""As more use cases emerge, businesses will need to be more proactive in upgrading their payment rails and working with providers that offer the latest solutions that meet the evolving payment needs of their clients.""Story continuesAll major real-time payment rails across North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific have experienced growth in the last year, including the recent launch of the FedNow service in the U.S., which operates 24/7/365 to clear and settle payments instantly. According to the report, this momentum will not slow down in the next 24-36 months.The report attributes this growth to the ever-expanding list of use cases and benefits that real-time payment capabilities bring, including better cash positioning and reporting, improved working capital, operational efficiencies, greater customer loyalty, strong business partnerships, and more satisfied employees.""While it is clear that the adoption and use cases are expanding, there remains room for further advocacy and education to drive the shift towards real-time payments,"" says Erika Baumann, Director, Aite-Novarica Commercial Banking &amp; Payments Practice ""This work will be critical over the next few years, as those that fail to act risk losing out on significant market share.""The report is based on an online survey of 1,037 employees of midsize and large corporations in 11 North American, European, and Asian Pacific countries.Media ContactRyan Wells+1 212 298 1249ryanw@bnymellon.comCisionView original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bny-mellon-and-datos-insights-release-global-survey-on-the-growth-and-future-of-real-time-payments-301926716.htmlSOURCE BNY Mellon]"

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation in FocusThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) is headquartered in New York, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of -0.31% since the start of the year. The company is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.42 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.7%. This compares to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 4.36% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.65%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.68 is up 18.3% from last year. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 6.45%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's current payout ratio is 29%, meaning it paid out 29% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.BK is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $4.85 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 5.66%.Story continuesBottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, BK is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The three-year agreement with one of the premier English Premier League (""EPL"") soccer clubs with a dedicated fanbase is likely to prove beneficial for Qualcomm and augment its global exposure.Per the deal, effective from the start of the 2024-25 season, the Snapdragon brand of Qualcomm will be put in front of the iconic jerseys of the EPL club. Snapdragon will feature on all the home, away and third kits of the men’s and women’s teams of Manchester United, replacing Germany-based software firm TeamViewer. Although no official deal value is currently available, people familiar with the proceedings have billed it to be one of the largest jersey deals in soccer.TeamViewer has been the official sponsor of MANU team jerseys since 2021 when it signed a five-year agreement worth £47 million per year. However, in December 2022, the companies signed a mutually agreeable pact under which Manchester United would buy back the rights to the sponsorship, with TeamViewer facing intense shareholder pressure to terminate the deal that reportedly drained its coffers.This opened the sponsorship gates for Qualcomm, who had been associated with the EPL club since 2022 as its global partner. Snapdragon was also the sponsor of the Red Devils’ 2023 U.S. summer tour. The expanded agreement will allow the chipmaker to showcase its processor that powers smartphones, PCs, connected cars, gaming devices and smart wearables.  Manchester United historically sells around 2 million shirts each year on average, with the club maintaining a rich legacy and huge fan-following base across the globe. This, in turn, is likely to provide additional mileage for upcoming Snapdragon models with top-of-the-mind recall and boost its brand presence. The deal gains further significance as Qualcomm chips will be featured in the upcoming iPhone models with a renewed deal inked with Apple Inc.Qualcomm is increasingly focusing on the seamless transition from a wireless communications firm for the mobile industry to a connected processor company for the intelligent edge with a diversified revenue stream. It is witnessing healthy traction in EDGE networking that helps to transform connectivity in cars, business enterprises, homes, smart factories, next-generation PCs, wearables and tablets. The automotive telematics and connectivity platforms, digital cockpit and C-V2X solutions are also fueling emerging automotive industry trends such as the growth of connected vehicles, the transformation of the in-car experience and vehicle electrification. Qualcomm believes it is on track to become the largest smartphone RF front-end supplier by revenues in the near future.  The company intends to harness artificial intelligence to meet increased demands for essential products and services that are the building blocks of digital transformation in a cloud economy. Qualcomm envisions solid growth opportunities within the mobile space, driven by the strength of its Snapdragon portfolio. Amid this backdrop, the sponsorship deal with the Red Devils is expected to be conducive to long-term growth.Shares of the company have lost 12.8% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 13.7%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQualcomm currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chief Operating Officer, Frank St. John, for US$3.2m worth of shares, at about US$474 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$421. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.All up, insiders sold more shares in Lockheed Martin than they bought, over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Lockheed Martin Have Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider buying at Lockheed Martin. insider John Donovan spent US$250k on stock, and there wasn't any selling. That shows some optimism about the company's future.Insider Ownership Of Lockheed MartinMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Insiders own 0.09% of Lockheed Martin shares, worth about US$90m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Lockheed Martin Insiders?It is good to see the recent insider purchase. On the other hand the transaction history, over the last year, isn't so positive. The more recent transactions are a positive, but Lockheed Martin insiders haven't shown the sustained enthusiasm that we look for, although they do own a decent number of shares, overall. Overall they seem reasonably aligned. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Lockheed Martin. You'd be interested to know, that we found 1 warning sign for Lockheed Martin and we suggest you have a look.But note: Lockheed Martin may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Given rising mortgage interest rates over the past year, the survey sought to better understand first-time homebuyer motivations and the considerations they faced. Specific findings include:When asked why they purchased their first home recently, the answer was simple: because they wanted to. Either the desire to stop renting or recognition that homeownership is a smart financial investment was the main motivator for 72 percent of respondents.""Overall value"" was the primary reason for choosing new construction over resale for 75 percent of respondents, whereas only five percent indicated low resale inventory as the reason.Higher mortgage interest rates did not deter their purchase, but 55 percent of respondents said it did impact certain decisions. For example, 35 percent of that group said they bought a smaller home than they originally planned, 27 percent said they included fewer options and upgrades and 26 percent said they bought in a different location.With 95 percent of respondents using mortgage financing to purchase their home, 72 percent said they paid for their down payment through savings, with 10 percent saying they were able to use a gift from family members, and five percent used government down payment assistance. Of the 11 percent who indicated they used other sources, respondents cited sources such as VA loans or borrowings against 401k savings.Story continues""First-time homebuyers can be more severely impacted by higher mortgage rates, so ongoing strong demand among this buyer group has been a positive development as 2023 has progressed,"" said Matthew Koart, PulteGroup Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.

That is because the Oct 20, 2023 $3 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Goodyear shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Goodyear is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Rubber - Tires industry that ranks in the Bottom 17% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 23 cents per share to 21 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Goodyear right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

163,a2df5ea1-a42c-3d04-83fd-7b9c43d39980,BA,2023-09-14,Orders for freighter aircraft slow ‘to a trickle’,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/orders-freighter-aircraft-slow-trickle-110000781.html,1694689200,STORY,"['BA', 'EADSY', 'ATSG']","[Boeing 767 freighters operated by FedEx Express and Star Airlines (now named Maersk Air Cargo) and a DHL 757 freighter are parked at the cargo terminal at Cologne Bonn Airport in Germany on March 2, 2018. The supply of older 757 and 767 passenger jets that can be transformed to carry main-deck cargo is running out. (Photo: Shutterstock/Tobias Arhelger)WASHINGTON — Aerospace companies that specialize in converting passenger planes to freighters are expected to crank out a record number of units this year, but deteriorating international freight and e-commerce volumes have chilled orders for new and aftermarket aircraft.Although more cargo aircraft are being produced than currently needed, airlines and lessors are mostly sticking with aircraft commitments to take advantage of forecast growth in e-commerce and international trade, and to modernize their fleets.Warnings about a looming glut of narrowbody cargo jets serving short- and medium-haul express routes are tempered by the fact that, while some conversions have been postponed, few have been canceled so far.There are 270 factory-built cargo aircraft on back order, according to London-based aviation analytics and appraisal firm IBA. Data provided by U.S. consultancy AeroDynamic Advisory shows more than double that number (600) of passenger planes in queue for retrofits.Meanwhile, aftermarket airframers are adding more production lines around the world by partnering with repair and overhaul shops that tear down the passenger compartment and install features such as a wide cargo door, heavy-duty floor beams and a container loading system. Boeing this year announced plans to establish conversion centers in the Middle East and India.The lag in time from when airlines place orders in response to demand and manufacturers’ ability to fulfill them is impacting the supply balance. Analysts say freighter deliveries typically peak two to four years after strong demand growth, which means conversion activity could stay strong through 2024.Overhaul specialists completed about 130 freighter conversions last year, up from the previous record of 116 in 2021, according to various industry databases. During the 30 years prior to the COVID crisis, by comparison, cargo changeovers of used passenger jets averaged 60 to 70 per year.At the same time, IBA estimates deliveries of new factory freighters will increase to 52 units next year from 35 in 2023.Story continues“The assumption is there is massive overcapacity in the freighter market, but it’s more nuanced,” said Tom Crabtree, managing director at consultancy Trade and Transport and former chief editor of Boeing’s biennial World Cargo Forecast, on the Aug. 24 edition of the “Time on Wing” podcast.“What’s not widely appreciated in the air cargo sector is that e-commerce has a lot of runway for growth ahead of it in the developing world. And that is a segment of the market that is often served by medium widebody freighters or narrowbody freighters,” he said.Air transport market hits bottom Airfreight demand has dropped 8% to 10% since the spring of 2022 due to a slowing global economy, inflation, high retail inventories and the end of ocean shipping backlogs. Meanwhile, available shipping space on aircraft is about 10% higher than a year ago and 4% more than before the COVID crisis. Growth in cargo capacity associated with the comeback of international passenger flights, combined with weak demand, has led to a 45% fall in freight rates and similar declines in airlines’ cargo revenue. With less stuff to haul, flight activity for dedicated cargo aircraft is down 4.5% on average over the past 12 months, according to BMO Capital Markets.The reduction in operating efficiency is compounded by the presence of more freighters. Cirium data shows there are nearly 2,200 dedicated cargo jets in service now, 5.6% higher than at the end of 2022 as the number of new entrants outpaces retirements.The air cargo sector is likely to stay near the bottom of the freight cycle for another year, but Boeing projects robust demand for dedicated cargo jets will continue due to e-commerce growth and changing supply chain networks.Boeing’s commercial market outlook, released in June, shows the global freighter fleet growing by 65% to more than 3,700 in 2042. The increase will require more than 2,825 production and converted freighter deliveries, including about 1,300 standard-body conversions, such as the 737-800, and 555 widebody conversions. The number of deliveries inched up from 2,795 in Boeing’s previous cargo forecast in November.The fleet outlook is partly based on a projection that world trade will more than double over the next 20 years. Boeing also revised its annual growth rate for cargo traffic to 4.5% from 4.1% because the 2022 decline lowered the forecast’s baseline.Conversion slowdown Most concerns about freighter oversupply focus on standard-size jets like the 737-800 and the Airbus A321. The number of conversions for small, standard-size jets exploded during the past three years to unprecedented levels.Many planes are going to startup airlines or freighter operations born out of the high demand for freighter capacity during the pandemic, when e-commerce sales shot through the roof and passenger belly capacity evaporated. Brazil-based Gol, for example, launched a 737-800 freighter division last year to fly packages for an e-commerce retailer. Pure leasing companies made more speculative investments in conversions than usual when airlines were bleeding money and eager to reduce their fleets.In April of 2020 there were 12 737-800 converted freighter operators with a total fleet of 30 aircraft. Three years later, the number of operators had more than quadrupled to 51 with 147 converted planes added to the global fleet, according to research by freighter consultant Stephen Fortune.And more companies have moved into that space since the spring. Mexico-based startup Awesome Cargo, for example, plans to add two 737-800 by the end of the year, according to trade publication and consulting firm Cargo Facts.Retrofit shops are busy working through existing order books, but the soft market is taking a toll on new orders for aircraft conversions. Aftermarket programs received 251 orders last year, but activity began to decelerate in the second half, Cargo Facts reported.“Demand for 737-800 conversions has slowed to a trickle and is mainly coming from operators. Lessors continue to have a difficult time placing converted -800s, which is causing them to pause their programs until the market returns. To complicate matters the [narrowbody] engine market is red hot. Prices have gone up 30% from a year ago, which makes finding a freighter engine almost impossible,” said Robert Convey, senior vice president for sales and marketing at Aeronautical Engineers Inc. (AEI), an independent firm that offers aftermarket conversion kits.A large air cargo pallet gets moved into place on a Boeing 747-8 freighter. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)AEI only booked a handful of orders in the first half of 2023 compared to more than 30 last year. “Customers are either trying to cancel or at least push out the start date in hopes the market will return,” Convey told FreightWaves.Orders for factory freighters have also dried up. Boeing recorded 43 net orders in 2022 (minus two cancellations from bankrupt Western Global Airlines) versus six 777s so far this year, according to the company’s online database.So far more conversion commitments have been deferred than canceled. The only publicly announced cancellation has been from all-cargo operator Cargojet, which is in the process of selling three used Boeing 777-300 passenger jets, originally purchased for conversion, to maintain financial flexibility and align fleet size with demand. A planned fourth aircraft was never purchased.The airline is holding on to reservations for production slots at Israel Aerospace Industries so it can quickly resume expansion plans if demand improves. Executives said they are still proceeding with U.S. startup Mammoth Freighters for four Boeing 777-200 passenger-to-freighter conversions.FreightWaves also reported that Vietnam Airlines quietly pulled out of a deal with Air Transport Services Group for two A321 converted freighters. ATSG’s management said on a recent earnings call that the company is purchasing two fewer A321s than anticipated.An April report by Fortune, whose long background in aircraft acquisition and management includes stints at FedEx and the former Gemini Air Cargo, showed that lessors had placed less than half of their 737-800 and A321 conversion orders for 2023 with customers, leaving 49 aircraft without a home.It can take four to eight months to reconfigure an aircraft for cargo, depending on size and the number of available repair bays for particular aircraft types. And conversion shops are having difficulty completing jobs because of supply chain backlogs, personnel shortages and slow regulatory approval of new modification designs, which actually works in favor of buyers that don’t need aircraft right away.AerSale, an aftermarket aircraft services company, in June downgraded its full-year outlook for passenger-to-freighter (P2F) conversions to three sales and three leases, compared to its prior forecast of six sales because of the soft cargo market.“Cargo operators currently suffering from reduced demand and an associated lack of liquidity has tempered the sale of our P2F converted 757s and will likely result in a heavier mix of leases versus sales in the near term,” said CEO Nicolas Finazzo on the company’s Aug. 8 earnings call.The 757 is a large narrowbody plane admired for hitting the economic sweet spot in terms of capacity, efficiency, ease of loading and reliability. It is nearing the end of its conversion life because there are few qualified passenger aircraft left.Mike Stengel, principal at AeroDynamic Advisory, projected the number of conversions will top out at 136 this year before starting to decline in 2025 and 2026 — but still above pre-COVID levels. Activity will be bolstered by the addition of more production lines, especially in the widebody segment, as two overhaul specialists, including Mammoth, launch first-ever programs for turning large 777 jets into freighters, he said.Narrowbody glut?IBA recently estimated that up to 60 737-800 converted freighters could be produced this year, up from 56 in 2022, creating a risk for a large oversupply if the trend continues. The forecast doesn’t extend beyond this year.Fortune has warned of a short-term glut in standard freighters since early 2022.There are seven 737-800 freighters available for lease or purchase on MyAirTrade.com, which suggests the planes aren’t being placed as quickly as they once were.IBA’s analysis notably shows that the 737-800 has been converted at a faster rate than other cargo retrofit programs. The global fleet of 737-800 converted freighters has rapidly grown to 200 aircraft since the first modification by Boeing six years ago — about 50 of them by AEI. By contrast, it took the 757 and 767-300 conversion programs 15 years to reach the same size. The 737-400 took 20 years to reach 200 units.The total 737-800 fleet is on track to surpass the 757-200 freighter fleet of 311 aircraft.Meanwhile, IBA projects Airbus will deliver 20 A321 passenger-to-freighter aircraft this year. The A321 conversion program is trying to catch up with the 737-800, which had a three-year head start and the advantage of Boeing’s extensive cargo history compared to the new focus at Airbus. A positive factor is a large potential feedstock of relatively late-model A321s for cargo as passenger airlines seek out more efficient A321neos.A drop in lease rates, especially for older variants, illustrates the caution being exhibited by cargo operators.A321 leases have fallen below $200,000 per month this year after a couple of years well above that market, but aircraft with only about 15 years of age can command tens of thousands of dollars more, depending on the perceived risk of the operator and country location, IBA said. Monthly lease rates for the 737-800 have contracted to about $160,000.The situation is different in the widebody freighter sector, where Crabtree said there is under capacity because some combination carriers pulled back from investment more than a decade ago when the air cargo market stagnated for several years.767-300 conversions continue to lead in the widebody category, but the pipeline of available passenger jets is getting thinner. That is why Air Transport Services Group, which operates two cargo airlines and passenger charters in addition to being a major lessor, has branched out to acquire and convert the Airbus A330. Airbus resuscitated its A330 modification program about three years ago and ATSG reserved 29 production slots. The first plane is scheduled to begin remodeling in October.IBA estimates 18 to 20 A330s will eventually be converted per year between Airbus affiliate EFW and Israel Aerospace Industries, overtaking the 767s. Lease rates have ticked up to about $450,000 as the programs gain traction, especially for younger A330-300s with extra volume suited for express parcel business. A 767-300 lease costs between $220,000 and $300,000, with the higher range reserved for aircraft under 20 years of age.No replacement aircraft are available until Airbus and Boeing start delivering the large A350 and 777-8F, respectively, in 2026 and 2027. Boeing must stop production of the legacy 767 and 777 freighters at the end of 2027 to comply with international noise and emissions standards, although executives have said they will appeal to the U.N.’s civil aviation administration for an exemption.But Kristian Lindberg, head of finance at aviation investment firm Stratos, during a June webinar hosted by Cirium’s consulting arm, suggested that even widebody freighters might not make the best short-term investment because the rental spread versus a passenger jet has narrowed by more than two-thirds to a mere $100,000, notwithstanding the $20 million, or more, cost to convert a large plane for cargo.Challenges sourcing aircraftBy the time cargo demand improves again, conversions could be constrained by limited feedstock related to the gyrating passenger sector.Passenger airlines are coveting standard-size aircraft, such as the 737-800 and Airbus A320/321, because manufacturers Boeing and Airbus have severe production issues that are slowing delivery of aircraft the carriers want to grow their fleets during a travel boom.Boeing, for example, recently discovered a supplier defect on bulkheads that will potentially delay delivery of hundreds of top-selling 737 MAX jets. It’s the latest in a series of quality flaws Boeing has disclosed on the MAX and other programs as it gears up production capacity. And current delays follow three years when more than 2,500 aircraft were not delivered because of COVID and MAX safety problems.High passenger demand is leading airlines to extend leases, or enter into new lease deals, for several years, reducing the available supply of used jets for conversion and driving up aircraft values on the secondary market. That  helps lessors because aircraft that otherwise might have been removed from service, or seen diminished value, are more marketable. At the same time lease rates for freighters are coming down. Aviation experts say it makes more financial sense for leasing companies to rent their planes in the passenger market because they can make more money without incurring the cost to convert an aircraft.“Lessors may now opt for a cabin refresh and put the plane back in service for another six or seven years with a second-tier operator, or it may even be a first-tier operator,” said Crabtree. “Why cut a cargo door if you can repeddle the asset for another five to eight years?”Some lessors may be better off canceling cargo overhauls until production issues are resolved, Lindberg concurred.“It’s potentially not worth converting the 737-800 and incurring the additional cost — $5 million to $6 million for conversion — because the passenger demand is so strong that lease rates have been coming up more than $10,000 in the past year,” he said.E-commerce upsideThe strongest tailwind for long-term air cargo growth is e-commerce, which has more than doubled its share of retail sales over the past seven years and is projected to account for a fifth of total sales by the end of this year, according to eMarketer. By 2026, e-commerce, which heavily relies on air express delivery networks to fulfill orders, is estimated to grow to 23% of all retail sales.Growth of online sales is decelerating from its peak of 17% early in the pandemic to 8.2% in 2026, eMarketer predicts. But that is three times global GDP growth and twice the expected growth rate for general air cargo.Over the next two decades, express fleets are expected to grow 58%, according to Boeing.Manufacturers and lessors say online shopping has fundamentally improved growth prospects for air cargo, with much of the demand coming from new express networks in Southeast Asia, Latin America and other developing economies. The e-commerce share of total retail sales is less than 4% in India and 5% in Brazil – both massive markets. Airbus, for example, projects air volumes for the express sector will grow 4.9% annually, significantly higher than its projection for general air cargo.“Those [parcel carriers] need a certain amount of critical mass — routes and aircraft into the hubs to support these overnight or second-day air networks. So the emergence of e-commerce in these economies is a structural driver of demand, not just a cyclical one,” said Darren Hulst, Boeing’s vice president of marketing for commercial airplanes, on a recent episode of the “Time on Wing” podcast.Executives at ATSG, which operates two cargo airlines in addition to being a major lessor, are steadfast in believing that rapid fulfillment of e-commerce purchases via air express networks will persist for the long term and drive demand for converted freighters.Michael Steen, the chief executive of all-cargo operator Atlas Air, said e-commerce will continue to turbocharge interest in freighter aircraft because online sellers need to quickly adjust their distribution activity in response to customer preferences.“The supply chain is changing to cater more to the end consumer, which means that it’s very hard to predict where you keep your inventories, and how much, depending on what the purchase cycles look like. New companies are popping up in fast fashion that are not selling through stores,” he said in an onstage interview Tuesday at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Global Aerospace Summit here. “And the majority of that is airfreight based, even for low cost products. That is a significant change from what we have seen in the past.”Meanwhile, many companies are geographically diversifying their supply chains to increase resiliency after the pandemic upended economic activity and shipping capacity, resulting in factory stoppages and retail shelves that were out of stock. It’s unclear how new sourcing and logistics requirements will play out. Some believe they increase the need for air cargo, especially at the start while businesses are still establishing their full complement of new suppliers, warehouses and surface transportation networks. Others say pressure to decouple from global trade, nearshoring and rising geopolitical tensions pose a risk for air cargo growth.Fleet renewalEven if the cargo market doesn’t grow, aging fleets need to be replaced. Airlines pulled freighters out of long-term storage and delayed retiring other planes to meet soaring demand during the pandemic, with many aircraft flying 20% to 30% more hours than normal per day. Only 15 planes per year were retired during the three years of the pandemic compared to a normal average of about 70, according to Cirium.Last year, 38 cargo jets were retired compared to 131 at the peak in 2010, IBA said.With the market back to equilibrium, carriers are beginning to sideline older, expensive-to-operate cargo jets, especially as they come up against major maintenance checks.Steen said there are about 650 widebody freighters currently in service and 125 of them are older than 30 years. Many more are nearing retirement age, while more than 700 older technology standard aircraft with an average age of 30 years are still in service, Cirium recently reported.UPS, for example, has begun phasing out 41 legacy MD-11 freighters that will be replaced by 28 new Boeing 767-300s. FedEx Express retired 18 aircraft in the just-completed fiscal year: 12 MD-11s, four Boeing 757-200s and two Airbus A300-600s.“I think that we will see a faster decline in supply than we will see an ability to replace that capacity” in the widebody segment, Steen said.Changes in belly capacityStructural changes in the passenger market, beyond the short-term dynamics, could also increase interest in freighters. Market share for single-aisle aircraft, which provide less room for cargo, has increased with the growth of low-cost and ultra-low cost passenger carriers. In the past 20 years, the narrowbody fleet has increased from 9,000 to 16,200 aircraft, more than a third of which are operated by low-cost carriers. Boeing’s forecast anticipates the low-cost share rising to 41% of the single-aisle fleet by 2041.As aircraft become more fuel efficient and smaller aircraft can fly longer distances, airlines are beginning to fill some trans-Atlantic and other international routes with extended-range planes such as the 737 MAX and Airbus A321LR instead of widebody aircraft.Dedicated freighters and passenger aircraft carried an even split of cargo prior to the pandemic, but the balance now tilts 60% toward cargo aircraft because they  offer guaranteed capacity for logistics and airfreight companies that want greater control over shipments without being constrained by passenger requirements.Less than 50% of the available belly capacity worldwide is actually used for freight because many new routes go to leisure destinations instead of industrial centers and more deployment of capable narrowbody aircraft, Steen noted.“So, I think we’re looking at the scenario where we will see demand coming back and supplies [of aircraft] can be challenged,” he said.Click here for more FreightWaves stories by Eric Kulisch.RECOMMENDED READING:Boeing adds 737-800 freighter conversion line in IndiaMalaysian cargo airline Raya leases ATSG’s 1st Airbus freightersThe post Orders for freighter aircraft slow ‘to a trickle’  appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

The symposium will delve into the cancer journey, emphasizing the value of CGP in everyday clinical practice and the importance of early testing and treatment for optimal patient care. CGP represents a next-generation sequencing method that employs a single test to evaluate numerous genes, including important cancer biomarkers, which can have implications for patient care. It provides insights into various genetic alterations, including gene fusions, which are a central focus of this year's symposium.Dr. Nicole Pfarr, head of the Molecular Pathology Diagnostic Unit at the Technical University of Munich's Institute of Pathology, is speaking about cancer biomarker identification within a patient's genomic profile during the seminar Evaluation and Reporting of Complex Biomarkers with Extensive Panels. Pfarr and her team are involved in establishing a national database for genetic information sourced from various molecular tumor boards. She says they have already amassed data from approximately 1500 patients within her university's database, and they could include 10,000 to 20,000 more records from other molecular tumor boards. This ambitious endeavor is set to make a significant impact on the field of oncology by serving as a substantial dataset to guide treatment decisions.One crucial aspect of Pfarr's research is homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) testing, particularly in entities like pancreatic cancer and sarcomas, where her team has discovered high HRD scores. Identifying HRD can be vital in tailoring treatment strategies for patients. Sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy drugs plays a pivotal role in deciding whether a patient should undergo HRD testing.Story continuesAhead of ECP, we spoke with Pfarr about the challenge of evaluating complex biomarkers. ""It's always very difficult to find out which is the right one to target,"" she says. ""Sometimes we have two mutations or amplification, and then we have the BRCA mutation. We have to figure out which one we should target first."" In two-hour molecular tumor board meetings, Pfarr and her colleagues will discuss anywhere from 10 to 30 cases.In Germany, she adds, physicians perform many tests up front. Labs that are part of the German Network for Personalized Medicine are about to begin implementing exome and whole-genome sequencing as part of their routine diagnostic, and Pfarr is looking forward to taking on the challenge of finding and interpreting variants. At ECP, she hopes to learn how other health care systems are handling and analyzing a similar volume and type of data.The task is both immense and critical, but Pfarr always keeps the success stories in mind. She remembers a patient with a polymerase epsilon mutation who had initially been given only a few weeks to live. The patient's team of specialists found that he had a very high tumor mutational burden and they were able to prescribe a checkpoint inhibitor. ""And now, a couple of years later, he's still alive-and he has small children,"" she says. ""When the patient is treated with a targeted therapy and he responds very well, and his life is improved, this is what keeps me going. I believe that we can do a lot more for patients to improve their lives.""Insights from ECP in Dublin will offer a glimpse into the promising future of oncology, where genetic information takes center stage in personalized treatment decisions, and health care professionals are driven by the relentless pursuit of positive patient outcomes.The Illumina team and booth at ECP 2023 | Photo: Michael RowlandView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Illumina on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IlluminaWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/illuminaEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IlluminaView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/783782/insights-from-dublin-fostering-precision-oncology-for-better-patient-outcomes]"

170,26ebcf8a-7a63-36ac-a786-04b1b0dd0334,SO,2023-09-14,"Insiders At Southern Sold US$7.2m In Stock, Alluding To Potential Weakness",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-southern-sold-us-7-110056858.html,1694689256,STORY,['SO'],"[The fact that multiple The Southern Company (NYSE:SO) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Southern Southern Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Chairman, Kimberly Greene, for US$3.3m worth of shares, at about US$69.78 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$69.50. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Southern insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Southern Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Southern shares. Specifically, insiders ditched US$2.5m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Insider Ownership Of SouthernFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Southern insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$177m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Southern Tell Us?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. When we did our research, we found 4 warning signs for Southern (2 don't sit too well with us!) that we believe deserve your full attention.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly. Top 5 Upgrades:UBS upgraded General Motors (GM) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $44, up from $41, as a new analyst took over coverage of the stock. Assuming a strike does not occur, the firm see second half earnings upside compared to consensus and argues that the current ""negativity"" priced into the shares creates an attractive risk/reward.Piper Sandler upgraded UMB Financial (UMBF) to Overweight from Neutral with a $74 price target. The firm cites its relatively discounted valuation compared to shares' historical premium over peers.BofA upgraded Southern Company (SO) to Neutral from Underperform with a price target of $68, up from $67. The shares have re-rated and now trade at a premium to most utility peers, notes the firm, which sees pending updates, including specifically an update on generation capital, helping to support the stock at current levels.Credit Suisse upgraded Sealed Air (SEE) to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $47, down from $59. The firm views Sealed Air as a major beneficiary of a soft-landing economic scenario in 2024 and sees the stock being priced for recession currently.Daiwa upgraded Cognex (CGNX) to Buy from Outperform with an unchanged price target of $57. An acceleration in battery investments as well as bottoming logistics and electronics spend will drive the company's growth in 2024, the analyst tells investors in a research note.Top 5 Downgrades:JPMorgan downgraded Oracle (ORCL) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $100, down from $112. The company's cloud growth may be peaking as the Cerner transition and date center buildout ""pose new hurdles,"" the analyst tells investors in a research note.Goldman Sachs downgraded Ultrapar (UGP) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $4, down from $4.50. The analyst cites valuation for the downgrade following the stock's outperformance.Credit Suisse downgraded Ball Corp. (BALL) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $58, down from $65, on more concerns about the mass beer category going forward given shifts in consumer spending away from the category as well as Ball's exposure to Anheuser-Busch (BUD).Citi analyst Andres Cardona downgraded Ecopetrol (EC) to Neutral from Buy with an unchanged price target of $12.50 after the company hosted its investor day meeting. The company made ""relatively small changes to the 2022 update,"" with perhaps some incremental emphasis on the energy transition agenda, but in practice the hydrocarbon business will remain the main business at least until the end of this decade and the ""big change"" will come after 2030, the analyst tells investors.Credit Suisse downgraded O-I Glass (OI) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $22, up from $21. While destocking is playing a role, the firm does have concerns that premium substrates like glass will see continued volume pressure ahead and as new glass capacity comes online, pricing pressure will likely intensify.Story continuesTop 5 Initiations:UBS assumed coverage of Ford (F) with a Buy rating and $15 price target as part of a broader research note on U.S. Autos, Auto Parts, and Auto-Tech names. The group at large has sold off owing in part to uncertainty around the UAW-D3 labor negotiations, but the firm's analysis suggests that on average, about 4 weeks of a strike at each of the D3 companies has been priced in, and if a strike occurs, it too will pass, the analyst tells investors in a research note.TD Cowen initiated coverage of J.M. Smucker (SJM) with an Outperform rating and $158 price target. After bolstering its management team, reshaping the portfolio, and sharpening its marketing, the company has created an advantaged commercial model that exceeds food peers, says the analyst.Citi initiated coverage of SQM (SQM) with a Buy rating and $85 price target. SQM has been an underperformer in the local market and current valuations ""seem to be on the bottom,"" the analyst tells investors.UBS initiated coverage of Tesla (TSLA) with a Neutral rating and $290 price target as part of a broader research note on U.S. Autos, Auto Parts, and Auto-Tech names. Tesla is well positioned for the long-term, but the firm prefers to await a better entry point with 2024 seen as a below trend growth year, says UBS.JPMorgan initiated coverage of Cactus (WHD) with a Neutral rating and $60 price target. The firm starts the stock at Neutral as it thinks Street expectations will need to be reset slightly lower given the greater than expected pullback in the U.S. rig count.]"
173,eac6b76e-6ff2-31c7-8944-3b2f31d98aa5,MAA,2023-09-14,Is Now A Good Time To Buy Mid-America Apartment Communities?,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-good-time-buy-mid-183825475.html,1694630305,STORY,['MAA'],"[Investors looking for solid, long-term stocks have to consider not only what stocks to buy, but also when to buy them. For example, many quality real estate investment trusts (REITs) purchased at the beginning of 2022 have not fared well since then, challenged by rising interest rates.Those same REITs, having lost a good chunk of their previous values, should be assessed with a forward view, rather than looking in the rearview mirror of the last 20 months.Take a look at one stalwart REIT with a long history of success that has not performed well throughout 2022-2023, although it now could be at a level that would make for a formidable investment into the future.Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc. (NYSE:MAA) is a self-administered residential REIT that specializes in purchasing and leasing apartment complexes. It owns just under 102,000 units in 300 communities across 16 states and Washington, D.C. Most of Mid-America Apartment Communities' properties are in the Southeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic states.Mid-America Apartment Communities is a member of the S&amp;P 500 and has been a public company for 28 years. The Atlanta and Dallas areas comprise over 22% of its same-store net operating income.Recent operating results were positive. On July 26, Mid-America Apartment Communities reported second-quarter funds from operations (FFO) of $2.28 per share, beating estimates for $2.25 per share and providing a 12.87% increase over FFO of $2.02 per share in the second quarter of 2022. Revenue of $535.15 million was slightly above the estimate of $533.57 million and was an 8.1% increase over revenue of $495.04 million in the second quarter of 2022.Mid-America Apartment Communities recently announced a 12% quarterly dividend increase from $1.25 to $1.40 per share. This followed last summer's dividend hike from $1.088 to $1.25 and shows the ongoing strength of the FFO, along with management's faith in its future. The annual dividend of $5.60 per share now yields 4.09%.Story continuesDespite these positives, Mid-America has been underperforming in 2023, with a total return year-to-date of negative 9.34%. However, its five-year total return is 52.76% and the 10-year total return is 179.46%.Analysts have been somewhat neutral to positive on Mid-America. On Sept. 5, Bank of America Securities analyst Joshua Dennerlein initiated coverage on Mid-America Apartment with a Neutral rating and announced a price target of $158, about 21% above its recent closing price of $136.70. On Sept. 12, Wells Fargo analyst James Feldman maintained Mid-America Apartment with an Equal-Weight rating but lowered the price target from $156.50 to $148.50.Another positive for Mid-America was a recent insider stock purchase. On Aug. 7, Director William Reid Sanders purchased 3,000 shares of Mid-America Apartment Communities stock with an average price of $146.84, for a total purchase of $440,513. Insiders don't generally buy shares of company stock unless they believe the price will eventually move higher.But Wall Street seems to believe that apartment rents have peaked, and there is recent evidence that the large rent hikes of 2022 may have come to an end. Another concern is that 460,000 new apartment units, already under construction, will be completed by the end of 2023, leading some to conclude that supply will begin to outstrip demand.But in mid-August, the national average for a 30-year fixed mortgage rose to 7.48%, the highest level in the U.S. since November 2000. Rates have since backed down to 7.13%, but 30-year loan applications have declined and are now at 28-year lows. With mortgage rates remaining high and home inventories still low, many tenants will be forced to continue renting, and the demand should continue to keep rental prices strong.In addition, a recent survey found that 18% of millennials and 12% of Generation Z in large cities said they will never buy a home because prices are too high, and they can't afford the downpayment and/or monthly payments.While that sort of sentiment could change as young people age, get married and land better jobs, it still suggests that the American dream of owning a home may not be as pervasive as it was in previous decades.It’s also unlikely that tenants renting in Mid-America's apartment units would move into newly constructed apartments that, because of high materials and labor costs, are likely to charge higher rents than older buildings.With mortgage rates remaining high, demand for mortgages declining and less interest in owning than there once was, there is every reason to believe in the continued success of residential REITs. With Mid-America Apartment Communities now 37% off its high of $219.57 in January 2022, it could be a good opportunity to pick up shares for the long term. And it's comforting for investors to know that they will be buying shares approximately $10 below the price recently paid by company Director Sanders.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it's too late.

That is because the Jan 19, 2024 $185.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Northrop Grumman shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Northrop Grumman is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Aerospace - Defense industry that ranks in the Top 33% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none has revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $5.72 per share to $5.73 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Northrop Grumman right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Biggest Web3.0 Companies In The World.Demystifying Web3.0Web3.0, a cutting-edge technology that could redefine the digital frontiers, has gained massive popularity over time. The rising concerns about privacy and the centralization of the internet have fuelled the Web3.0 hype. Web3.0 is basically a vision for the future of the internet that is decentralized and based on blockchain technology. Web3.0 offers more ownership to the users while enabling them to perform all tasks they can currently perform on the current version of the internet, Web2. Web3.0 refers to a change in the nature of the internet where ownership by corporate networks is substituted by users. It represents the idea where blockchain technology and decentralized systems take center stage, and the users would be empowered in ways they never deemed possible. The shift in ownership and decentralization is the primary distinguishing feature between Web2 and Web3.0.Web3.0 is also closely linked with metaverse. Metaverse is envisioned as a decentralized space that users can access through extended reality tech such as AR and VR. Metaverse enables users to trade various digital products and assets which requires the use of blockchains. Blockchains and immersive technology are significant central features of Web3.0.Even though the vision of Web3.0 sounds promising, influential figures like Elon Musk have dismissed the possibility of its existence. Although a complete transformation to Web3.0 seems far-fetched, it is undeniable that Web3.0 is stirring some form of transformation.According to a report by Grand View Research, the global Web3.0 market was valued at $2.25 billion in 2023 and has been estimated to grow to $33.53 billion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate of 47.1%. Increased use of the latest technologies like 5G and enhanced consciousness about privacy are expected to contribute to this growth.Story continuesIn 2022, North America dominated the Web3.0 market, accounting for a global revenue share of over 37.0%. However, the Asia Pacific region has been estimated to have the highest projected growth rate during the forecast period. Incorporating Web3.0 into industries like finance and retail, along with rising traction around blockchain, has been estimated to contribute greatly to this growth.Web3.0 Revolution: Disrupting IndustriesWeb3.0 is often touted as the future of the internet. The internet interwinds with almost all industries and businesses today. The introduction and adoption of Web3.0 would cause a fundamental shift in how businesses operate. One of the defining features of Web3.0 is decentralization, it would bring blockchains to the mainstream.Web3.0 could revolutionize how the finance industry operates. On July 26, CNBC reported that banking giants like JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Citi want to put Wall Street on blockchain, where they can tokenize various assets. Blockchains can be used to maintain a decentralized and distributed ledger. If Wall Street is shifted to blockchain, it will make the role of third parties like market makers and brokers redundant, changing the fundamental structure of the financial sector.Payment giant Visa Inc (NYSE:V) is also embracing this change. It started testing stablecoin settlement on the issuance side in 2021. It has since expanded to other blockchains that can send and receive stablecoins faster and lower costs. On September 5, Visa Inc (NYSE:V) announced that it has expanded its stablecoin capabilities to the Solana network as it was previously limited to the Ethereum blockchain network. Visa Inc (NYSE:V) has transacted millions of USDC, the second largest stablecoin since 2021, between its partners to settle fiat-denominated payments authorized over VisaNet.The clothing industry is likewise benefiting from this new technology, using it to advance marketing and branding. Many brands have been exploring immersive reality experiences to interact with their customers. More than 50 brands were a part of the Decentraland Metaverse Fashion Week that was held in March including Adidas, Coach, and Diesel. The fashion week was for brands to showcase their digital fashion items and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The Metaverse fashion show operated in a similar way to regular fashion weeks.Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX), primarily a gaming platform, facilitates the creation of decentralized virtual worlds. Users can interact with each other and trade NFTs. Gucci has a dedicated Gucci Garden in the Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) universe. Players can trade special Gucci NFTs in this metaverse. Similarly, Nikeland in the Roblox Metraverse enables users to dress their avatars in Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) products.Metaverse has gained massive popularity over the past few years. The rebranding of Facebook as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) contributed greatly to this popularity. Metaverse is an online space where instead of being a passive viewer the user is an active part of the virtual reality. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is investing heavily in mixed reality technology influencing how users interact with tech today. On June 1, the company announced that it will be releasing its new VR headset, Meta Quest 3, this year. The headset would enable users to perform a variety of activities including access to various immersive worlds.Many companies are entering the mixed reality space, including the iPhone maker Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). On June 5, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced its spatial computing headset, Apple Vision Pro. The headset enables users to interact seamlessly with virtual objects in augmented reality. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) also launched an AI-assisted avatar creator tool enabling users to create photorealistic avatars. The avatars resemble closely to the users and can even match their body types. Users can browse their favorite designer items and try them on their avatars before buying.We have made a list of the biggest Web3.0 companies in the world which include big tech companies such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).25 Biggest Web3.0 Companies In The WorldHalfpoint/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology To make our list of the 25 biggest Web3.0 companies in the world, we initially made a list of prominent companies in the Web3.0 arena. Since Web3.0 is more of a concept and vision than a distinct product, we have considered companies that either work on it directly or develop technologies essential to Web3.0.

To skip our detailed analysis of current stock market news, you can go directly to see the 5 Good Stocks To Invest In Right Now.The year 2023 has been quite eventful so far, with the rise of generative artificial intelligence, the banking crisis, regulatory crackdowns on crypto, rising interest rates, and much more. Despite all this, businesses and investors alike are continuing to hold on in the hope of turning the tide in their favor. Some professionals believe that such hopes are not ill-founded, as there may very well be significant potential for the market to reach new highs in the near future. For example, Katie Stockton, the founder and managing partner for Fairlead Strategies, joined CNBC's 'Halftime Report' on September 12 to highlight how major stock indices can still expect to see some upside momentum at this point in time. Here are some of her comments about the market:""I would say it's still a cyclical bull trend. We obviously have a corrective phase underway that's impacted our intermediate term momentum gauges, but not the long-term ones. So we still have long-term upside momentum behind the major indices, and that's promising.""At the same time, other professionals have been weighing in on the possibility of further Fed rate hikes. David Bahnsen, the chief investment officer at Bahnsen Group, joined CNBC's 'The Exchange' on September 12 to comment on this:""I think the Fed is following markets - markets are not following the Fed, and I think it is a fait accompli that they're going to pause again at the end of September.""The Election Year Holds Back The FedBahnsen added that he believes the Fed will refrain from raising rates because the US is heading into an election year. He drew a comparison between this election year and the one in 2016 when the Fed didn't ""touch rates"" despite the fact that there were four rate hikes on the schedule. According to Bahnsen, the Fed has been following a policy of staying separate from the country's politics since 1994, which is why he believes it is unlikely that we will see another rate hike during this election year.Story continuesIn the midst of these market trends, among talks of a new tech bull market also being on the way, consumers and investors alike have been adopting more optimistic viewpoints toward the market and what they can gain from it. As such, many investors are looking for the best stocks to invest in for the long term alongside good stocks to invest in right now for the short term.

Intuitive Surgical, Inc. manufactures and markets the da Vinci Surgical System, a robotic system used for minimally invasive procedures. Shares increased after Intuitive reported strong first quarter financial results highlighted by a 26% increase in procedures and raised guidance for 2023.

(NYSE:SHOP) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP): Shopify shares were a top contributor in the quarter following strong 1Q results and the announced divestiture of its logistics business. Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) grew 15% year over year as e-commerce sales broadly rebounded and Shopify continued to take market share. Revenue grew 25% driven by increased merchant adoption of multiple products, especially Shop Pay. The company generated $86 million of free cash flow, up from a $46 million loss last year, and announced expectations to be free cash flow positive for each quarter for the rest of the year. The company had previously announced several cost savings plans, which are driving margin and free cash flow improvement, and now plans to divest its capital-intensive logistics arm. Faster growing revenue, lower operating expenses, and a less capital-intensive future were all cheered on by the market.Last year, 10% of US retail e-commerce sales flowed through SHOP, second only to Amazon, and the company is still enjoying significant tailwinds as retail merchants of all sizes adopt SHOP’s software tools to display, manage and sell their products across a dozen different sales channels. We believe that the overall growth of e-commerce, combined with the development of new products and services, such as its digital wallet Shop Pay, should continue to drive revenue growth of more than 20% per year over the next several years, accompanied by re-acceleration of operating margin growth and FCF generation.”10.

The company offers a comprehensive suite of services, including an online marketplace for buyers and sellers, payment solutions through Mercado Pago, merchant and buyer financing through Mercado Credito, shipping services through Mercado Envios, and asset management through Mercado Fondo, among other services. We believe the e-commerce market within Latin America remains underpenetrated, creating a favorable backdrop for MercadoLibre, as they have been growing and investing heavily to expand its first mover advantage. Moreover, the company’s growing fintech payments business. Mercado Pago. is well-positioned to potentially emerge as a leader in Latin America, as well as an emerging online advertising presence which offers attractive margin expansion potential, in our view. While the company posted strong quarterly results, shares fell on fears that their exposure to Argentina, which saw its currency devalued, would impact company revenues in the near-term.”8. Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 78Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) had 78 hedge funds long its stock in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $2.4 billion.A Buy rating was maintained on shares of Datadog, Inc.

The company operates an observability and security platform for cloud applications in North America and internationally.RiverPark Advisors said the following about Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG): DDOG was a top detractor in the quarter. The company reported strong 4Q results including 44% revenue growth and 30% earnings growth but gave cautious revenue guidance for 2023. Macroeconomic headwinds have caused clients to slow the transition of workloads to the cloud and instead to optimize current capacity. Despite this temporary slowdown, DDOG still expects revenue to grow nearly 25% in 2023.As businesses have transitioned to cloud software infrastructure, much of which is in isolated data silos, it has become increasingly difficult for data engineers to monitor and analyze system performance. Datadog provides a SaaS software platform to monitor and analyze the system performance of software applications and IT infrastructure by giving users a single page view to observe their company’s technology stack. The company has quickly grown its revenue from $100 million in 2017 to $1.7 billion in 2022 and, we believe, should continue to grow revenue at more than 20% annually as it penetrates its $40 billion and fast-growing market. Less than 10% of software applications are currently monitored. The company’s dollar-based net retention rate has been 130%+ as existing customers continue to use an increasing number of products and the company continues to add new features. As of 4Q22, 81% of customers used 2+ products, while only 18% of customers used 6+ products (up from less than 1% two years ago). As an extremely capex light software business, DDOG already has significant free-cash-flow ($350m in 2022) and free-cash-flow margins (21% in 2022).”Like The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), and Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) is a highly popular stock today.7. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a communication services company based in Burbank, California. The company operates entertainment businesses worldwide through its Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution, and Disney Parks, Experiences, and Products segments.A total of 92 hedge funds were long The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $2.2 billion.Rosenblatt's Barton Crockett reiterated a Buy rating and a $104 price target on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shares on September 12.RiverPark Advisors made the following statements about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS): DIS was a top detractor in the quarter following mixed FY2Q results. Revenue of $22 billion was up 13% year over year, although EPS, at $0.93, was down 14% year over year. Disney Plus, part of the company’s direct-to-consumer business (DTC), had better subscriber numbers than anticipated despite a price increase, although losses at the DTC business as a whole are growing. The linear TV business also continues to suffer secular headwinds with – 10% revenue growth, and the company faced inflationary cost pressures at its theme parks.DIS is nevertheless blessed with a deep library of unique content that includes both live sports (providing large, non-time shifted audiences) and incomparable brands including Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm, as well as the ABC network. The company also has a wealth of upcoming new content, with a plan to release over 100 original titles per year on a $30 billion annual content production budget. Now that the disruption in its theme park, cruise and theatrical businesses has come to an end, we believe that Disney is among the best-positioned media companies in the new landscape to combine multi-channel and DTC distribution.We think the return of long-time CEO Bob Iger will lead to higher and more consistent profitability at the theme parks, better value realization in the linear assets, and consolidation of the company’s DTC assets leading to higher profitability sooner. We therefore expect DIS to grow its free cash flow significantly over the next 3-4 years, from its depressed $1 billion last year, returning to and exceeding its previous $10 billion peak in 2018.”6. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust was the largest shareholder in Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) at the end of the second quarter, holding 25.1 million shares in the company.Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) is a financial company based in Omaha, Nebraska.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance this year, and go directly to read 5 Worst Performing Dividend Stocks YTD. In 2023, dividend-paying stocks have not performed as well as other types of investments because many investors are showing a stronger preference for technology stocks. However, investment patterns change over time due to shifts in market sentiment and various economic factors. The US economy is uncertain this year due to unpredictable inflation. The latest CPI report showed that inflation increased in August from the same period last year, reversing the recent trend of slowing inflation. Compared to a year ago, it went up by 4.3%, which is in line with expectations and represents the smallest increase in almost two years.Because of the continuing economic uncertainty, the growth of dividends in the US slowed down during the second quarter of 2023. This deceleration in the country’s dividend growth resulted in a total of $148 billion worth of payouts, up modestly by 4.6% year-on-year when considering the core performance after accounting for lower one-time special dividends, according to the latest report by Janus Henderson. In general, dividend stocks haven’t performed that well this year. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, gained 2.33% this year so far, underperforming the tech-heavy NASDAQ, which delivered a 33.06% return to shareholders since the start of 2023.Also read: 15 Worst Performing Growth Stocks in 2023As the ongoing inflationary period continues to extend its course, dividend stocks can be a reassuring choice for concerned investors. Historical analysis also shows that dividend stocks have given a solid performance during periods of economic downturns. This is because dividend stocks are a defensive investment choice these equities tend to raise their dividend payments over time, which can help offset the effects of rising prices. In one of our previous articles, we cited Fidelity Investments’ data and mentioned that dividends accounted for more than half of the market's returns in periods of high inflation. The report also noted that in the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s, dividends made up 67%, 44%, and 73% of market returns, respectively. In those decades, when inflation averaged over 5%, total returns were below 10%.Story continuesAs mentioned above, tech stocks have dominated the market this year, surpassing dividend-paying companies. Even some of the biggest dividend companies such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) have also reported negative returns in 2023 so far. In this view, we will discuss some of the worst performing dividend stocks this year.15 Worst Performing Dividend Stocks YTDPhoto by Jp Valery on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we examined the worst-performing stocks of 2023 and selected dividend-paying stocks that have experienced substantial declines in their share prices so far this year.

Our civilization is clearly more on the dark side of growth with technology advancing but not with our wellbeing in mind as everything seems to be thriving, besides our soul. By not taking the soul along for the growth journey, the lack of growth in consciousness sinks to the body which shows us what is all really about. Perhaps this is why science has been struggling to find a way out of cancer for decades and without success. But today, Mainz Biomed N.V. (NASDAQ: MYNZ), a molecular genetics diagnostic company specializing in the early detection of cancer, reported beyond positive study findings regarding its mRNA markers that pave the way for colorectal cancer prevention and early diagnosis.Mainz’s Study Exceeded ExpectationsMainz Biomed reported better than expected results from its ColoFuture study that included subjects aged 40-85 from participating centers in Germany, Norway and Denmark. The goal of the trial was to assess the potential of integrating a portfolio of novel gene expression (mRNA) biomarkers into its highly efficacious, and easy-to-use screening test for colorectal cancer, ColoAlert®, which is currently on the European market. The ground-breaking study found the sensitivity of 94% for colorectal cancer with a specificity of 97% and a sensitivity for advanced adenoma of 81%. Mainz Biomed looks forward to publishing and presenting these results on its forthcoming medical conference, with the outcome from its eAArly DETECT clinical trial being set to be reported along with the fourth quarter results, as specified by Guido Baechler, Mainz Biomed CEO.Why Are These Results Ground-breaking?The evaluated mRNA bis were acquired from the Université de Sherbrooke (January 2022) to potentially enhance ColoAlert®’s technical profile by expanding its range to identify advanced adenomas (AA), a type of pre-cancerous polyp often attributed to CRC, as well as to increase the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity rates for CRC. By detecting polyps before they progress to a cancerous stage, CRC can be prevented as detecting lesions in advanced adenomas early means being able to cure them. Therefore, these findings literally have the potential to change the CRC diagnostic and treatment landscape.Story continuesMeanwhile, Moderna Continues Pursuing Its Cancer mRNA Vaccine DreamBack in May, Moderna Inc (NASDAQ: MRNA) and Merck &amp; Co Inc (NYSE: MRK) kicked off stage three trials of their first mRNA cancer treatment vaccine upon finding it lowers the risk of death or recurrence in serious skin cancer patients by 44%. Moderna chief medical officer Paul Burton also announced vaccines for lung cancer, colon cancer, rare diseases in children and cardiovascular diseases, while adding that preventative vaccines were also a possibility, after gaining approval for prevention. At the end of July, they began enrolling patients in a late-stage study testing their personalized mRNA-based skin cancer vaccine in combination with the immunotherapy Keytruda. The power of mRNA technology is that it literally teaches the immune system to target cells damaged by the certain disease: be it COVID-19 or cancer. In the case of cancer, it provides the industry with the ability to personalize treatments and rapidly scale them. With this potential in mind, Moderna made another bet on Monday as it joined forces with a German drug developer Immatics to boost its cancer vaccine development. Under the agreement, Moderna will be using Immatics’ drug discovery platform to develop mRNA vaccines while also studying its own cancer vaccine in combination with Immatics’ cancer therapy IMA203.Pfizer Is Still Not Managing To Pull Off Its COVID-19 Success With CancerBy committing to battle cancer at the speed of science, Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) is not going as fast towards the big breakthrough compared to the speed it showed in battling COVID-19. But, Pfizer did gain the approval of US FDA for the use of its blood cancer therapy in August. Together with Arvinas, Pfizer was awarded the Innovation Passport designation for treating advanced or metastatic breast cancer. But the Phase III monotherapy trial VERITAC-2 (NCT05654623) won’t complete enrolment before 2024 and Pfizer is still testing the drug in combination therapy.A Dream That Scientists Have Been Unsuccessfully Chasing For Decades Is Getting Shape...As Moderna Chief Medical Officer, Paul Burton, put it, the next decade is expected to bring a foundational shift in cancer treatment. At the very least, it is optimistic to see that cancer treatments are evolving and with Merz’s recent test results, there is massive potential for improving outcomes for patients with cancer as today, Merz offered a groundbreaking opportunity to even prevent CRC by successfuly detecting polyps before they progress to a cancerous stage.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

The research examines how customers engage with the digital world and how banks invest in embedded finance to become part of the financial journey consumers experience on their platforms of choice.IBM Corporation logo. (PRNewsfoto/IBM)Embedded Finance: Creating the Everywhere, Everyday Bank details findings from the responses of over 1,000 banking industry leaders and more than 12,000 consumers across five continents.Embedded finance is the integration of financial products and solutions within the customer journey of non-financial services organizations in ways that help eliminate friction, and consequently, enrich the customer experience. Over 70% of the industry executives surveyed indicate that embedded finance is either core or complementary to their business strategies. Yet only 20% said they currently offer embedded finance solutions.""Banks are facing a double whammy of challenges with pressure coming from non-traditional competitors such as the big techfins that have set new standards for customer expectations and are eager to deepen those relationships and from regulators pushing for open banking standards to level the playing field and drive more competition,"" said Shanker Ramamurthy, Global Managing Partner Banking &amp; Financial Markets, IBM Consulting. ""Establishing a modern hybrid cloud architecture that enables easy access to data across the enterprise, the ability to leverage the potential of emerging technologies such as generative AI, and participation in a robust ecosystem of partners is paramount to a successful banking strategy in today's industry.""Story continuesWhile 80% of all consumers surveyed currently prefer to deposit their salary and keep their savings in traditional banks, 16% of respondents globally are already comfortable embracing the full digital experience with branchless institutions. Many consumers are seeking a higher level of engagement from their financial institutions with 79% of younger respondents being open to receiving insights on their better ways to save and 75% being open to guidance on investing.Both banking leaders and consumers cited security as their most important priorities but banking leaders overestimated the importance of peer-to-peer payments and buy now pay later (BNPL) compared to priorities cited by consumers who designated good customer experience as their second highest preference, followed by mobile wallet functionality and rewards respectively.Based on the study, gaps in technology infrastructure modernization, lack of application programming interface (API) standards and the portion of resources devoted to privacy and security are slowing progress toward realizing the business opportunities associated with embedded finance platforms and stand to impede the potential of exponential technologies, such as generative AI.""It has never been more critical for banks to focus on how financial institutions can increase their competitive edge and improve the experience they provide their customers. The findings from the research show just how much work banks have to do before they can achieve this,"" said Hans Tesselaar, Executive Director, BIAN. ""We know from the work we're doing with our members, however, that before they implement real changes to their service offerings, they must first overcome the obstacles caused by a lack of technical standards and adopt a coreless banking approach to transformation.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Hewlett Packard Enterprise and IBM are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that HPE is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.HPE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 8.02, while IBM has a forward P/E of 15.51. We also note that HPE has a PEG ratio of 2.02. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. IBM currently has a PEG ratio of 3.71.Another notable valuation metric for HPE is its P/B ratio of 1.06. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, IBM has a P/B of 5.98.Story continuesBased on these metrics and many more, HPE holds a Value grade of A, while IBM has a Value grade of C.HPE has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than IBM, so it seems like value investors will conclude that HPE is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this technology and consulting company have returned +3.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which IBM falls in, has gained 1.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.IBM is expected to post earnings of $2.13 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.43 points to a change of +3.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.86 indicates a change of +4.5% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for IBM.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of IBM, the consensus sales estimate of $14.82 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +5%. The $61.49 billion and $64.08 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.6% and +4.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIBM reported revenues of $15.48 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.4%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $2.31 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.54 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.42%. The EPS surprise was +9%.Over the last four quarters, IBM surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.IBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's 0.12% gain on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.2%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.29%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the refiner had gained 9.26% over the past month. This has outpaced the Oils-Energy sector's gain of 3.12% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 0.09% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Marathon Petroleum as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be October 31, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Marathon Petroleum to post earnings of $6.45 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 17.41%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $34.48 billion, down 27.01% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $21.81 per share and revenue of $140.85 billion. These totals would mark changes of -16.63% and -21.73%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Marathon Petroleum should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 7.32% higher within the past month. Marathon Petroleum is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Story continuesValuation is also important, so investors should note that Marathon Petroleum has a Forward P/E ratio of 7.15 right now. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 7.5.Meanwhile, MPC's PEG ratio is currently 1.19. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. The Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.05 at yesterday's closing price.The Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry is part of the Oils-Energy sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 82, which puts it in the top 33% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at Molson Coors Canada (TSE:TPX.B) so let's look a bit deeper.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Molson Coors Canada, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.058 = US$1.3b ÷ (US$27b - US$3.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Thus, Molson Coors Canada has an ROCE of 5.8%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Beverage industry average of 11%. View our latest analysis for Molson Coors Canada roceWhile the past is not representative of the future, it can be helpful to know how a company has performed historically, which is why we have this chart above. If you want to delve into the historical earnings, revenue and cash flow of Molson Coors Canada, check out these free graphs here.The Trend Of ROCEWhile in absolute terms it isn't a high ROCE, it's promising to see that it has been moving in the right direction. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 5.8%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 134%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.Story continuesOur Take On Molson Coors Canada's ROCEIn summary, it's great to see that Molson Coors Canada can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. Considering the stock has delivered 7.5% to its stockholders over the last five years, it may be fair to think that investors aren't fully aware of the promising trends yet. So with that in mind, we think the stock deserves further research.If you want to continue researching Molson Coors Canada, you might be interested to know about the 4 warning signs that our analysis has discovered.While Molson Coors Canada isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance this year, and go directly to read 5 Worst Performing Dividend Stocks YTD. In 2023, dividend-paying stocks have not performed as well as other types of investments because many investors are showing a stronger preference for technology stocks. However, investment patterns change over time due to shifts in market sentiment and various economic factors. The US economy is uncertain this year due to unpredictable inflation. The latest CPI report showed that inflation increased in August from the same period last year, reversing the recent trend of slowing inflation. Compared to a year ago, it went up by 4.3%, which is in line with expectations and represents the smallest increase in almost two years.Because of the continuing economic uncertainty, the growth of dividends in the US slowed down during the second quarter of 2023. This deceleration in the country’s dividend growth resulted in a total of $148 billion worth of payouts, up modestly by 4.6% year-on-year when considering the core performance after accounting for lower one-time special dividends, according to the latest report by Janus Henderson. In general, dividend stocks haven’t performed that well this year. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, gained 2.33% this year so far, underperforming the tech-heavy NASDAQ, which delivered a 33.06% return to shareholders since the start of 2023.Also read: 15 Worst Performing Growth Stocks in 2023As the ongoing inflationary period continues to extend its course, dividend stocks can be a reassuring choice for concerned investors. Historical analysis also shows that dividend stocks have given a solid performance during periods of economic downturns. This is because dividend stocks are a defensive investment choice these equities tend to raise their dividend payments over time, which can help offset the effects of rising prices. In one of our previous articles, we cited Fidelity Investments’ data and mentioned that dividends accounted for more than half of the market's returns in periods of high inflation. The report also noted that in the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s, dividends made up 67%, 44%, and 73% of market returns, respectively. In those decades, when inflation averaged over 5%, total returns were below 10%.Story continuesAs mentioned above, tech stocks have dominated the market this year, surpassing dividend-paying companies. Even some of the biggest dividend companies such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) have also reported negative returns in 2023 so far. In this view, we will discuss some of the worst performing dividend stocks this year.15 Worst Performing Dividend Stocks YTDPhoto by Jp Valery on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we examined the worst-performing stocks of 2023 and selected dividend-paying stocks that have experienced substantial declines in their share prices so far this year.

This is our kind of company – despite the disparate parts, UGI grows earnings at a relatively steady high single digit rate over the long term while distributing excess cash through dividends.25 Shares are down due to a collection of short-term issues – driver shortages at the US propane business, losses from fixed priced contracts at the European energy marketing business, lower propane volumes in Europe and warmer weather.

Although used car prices are falling, the strike calls into question the broader economic impact on auto pricing as the strikes threaten to disrupt productions for the Big Three automakers — Ford (F), General Motors (GM) and Stellantis (STLA). Referencing this morning’s CPI report, Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer explains how ""simple supply and demand"" will control pricing and sway the Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision.Video TranscriptALEXANDRA CANAL: Welcome back to ""Yahoo Finance Live"". I'm Alexandra Canal, joined with Josh Schaeffer, Pras Subramanian. And like I said earlier, guys, it's been a very busy day here at Yahoo Finance. We had the inflation report, and, Pras, I know that you had your eyes very closely focused on those new and used car prices.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, watch those car prices. Usually every month you get that report out. Noticing that car prices are still moderating. New car prices are rising, but not as fast as they were before, and used car prices are falling continuously, down 6.6% month or year over year in August. So that's a big deal there for used cars.But there could be one thing that might trip that up, and that's, like, Josh, you mentioned, the possible UAW strike potentially in a day and a half here. We're seeing that big three make about half the cars in the US. If that goes offline, you might see less inventory at dealerships and higher prices for buyers.JOSH SCHAEFFER: Yeah, Pras, I was working on a story today just about the overall economic impact we could expect if that strike does happen. Again, that might happen tomorrow at midnight, and it's interesting to just think about sort of the key levers that will be touched there and how far it could go if there were to be a strike. You're talking about maybe a little bit of a drag on gross domestic product for the quarter, just overall production again. You're talking about half of the cars made in America likely not being made at all.Story continuesBut the most interesting part and what economists are most concerned about, actually, would be car prices going back up, because it's kind of simple supply and demand at some point, right? If we don't make any cars for an extended period of time, if this strike were to go on for, say, a month and you don't have a lot of supply coming in, prices probably go up, as we're talking about right now.What are car prices a big part of? Inflation. Who cares about inflation? The Federal Reserve. So we care about it because we care about the stock market. Like, it could really extrapolate to some extent if it were to go that far. The strike hasn't even started yet, but if it were to go that far, it's interesting to think about what car prices going up because of the strike could do.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, that was a nice little lesson on the economy there, Professor Josh.JOSH SCHAEFFER: Supply and demand.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Supply and demand.JOSH SCHAEFFER: I took econ 101.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I love it. I love it.JOSH SCHAEFFER: I won't tell you my grade.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I can tell. But in terms of that supply, you know, I know we have somewhat recovered since COVID, but it still feels like that supply is very squeezed. I was recently looking at used car prices, and the pricing is still very high, and I think about the affordability of it all, especially with, you know, interest rates still high. Federal Reserve, they could very well hike again before the end of the year, so I think that's a factor in all of this as well. How much are people even willing to pay on these cars?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: You know, it's funny you mentioned that, because we see these used car prices coming down for the last few months, but they're still so elevated from pre-pandemic, so they have a long way to go to come back down. Interest rates are extremely high. I think Edmunds said yesterday that they're at the highest they've ever seen them from 7.4%, something like that for your auto loan. I mean, that's massive, right? So you're absolutely right. The car sort of market is still in a weird spot post-pandemic, and you throw in this wrinkle of a UAW strike, it might just be skyrocketing prices again, and then again, what does the Fed do, right?JOSH SCHAEFFER: Right.]"

UAW President Shawn Fain has said the union is prepared to strike if a new contract agreement with the Big Three automakers isn't reached by Thursday at midnight. (AP Photo). (ASSOCIATED PRESS)A strike would cut motor vehicle output by about 30% as long as it were to last, per Oxford, which would provide a drag on quarterly economic growth. The workers' temporary exit from their jobs could also impact the monthly payroll report for October just as the Hollywood strikes dragged down payroll additions in the month of August. Additionally, if fewer cars are made, that could send vehicle prices higher, which in turn would have an upside risk to inflation overall.In a note titled the ""Q4 pot hole"" economists at Goldman Sachs highlighted the strike as one of three reasons US economic growth is primed to slow down in the final quarter of 2023. The Big Three automakers account for nearly half of domestically assembled auto vehicles, according to Goldman Sachs, and a strike would likely eliminate all of that production. That would negatively impact quarterly annualized GDP growth by 0.05 to 0.10 percentage points for each week the strikes lasts, per Goldman Sachs.Story continuesResearch from the firm projects that on the eve of the potential strike it's hard to predict the full economic impact.""The cumulative impact on GDP growth from a UAW strike is uncertain because a strike is not a foregone conclusion and its duration is uncertain,"" Goldman Sachs economists Alec Philips and Ronnie Walker wrote in the note on Tuesday night.Goldman Sachs points out that in 2007, a UAW strike at GM lasted three days. But in 1998, a UAW strike at GM lasted 54 days. Oxford economists used projections for a strike that lasts somewhere in the middle, about four to six weeks. They estimate that a UAW strike would directly reduce GDP by 0.2% to 0.3%. But that decline could be reversed in the following weeks.""Assuming the strike ended within 4-6 weeks, there would probably be enough time for output to rebound before the end of the quarter, meaning the impact on Q4 GDP would be negligible,"" Oxford's economists wrote.The most meaningful impact could be on car prices, which have been falling since a post-pandemic boom combined with a chip shortage sent prices skyrocketing in 2021.Read more: Buying a car?

Oxford Economics found in 1998 it took four months to rebuild auto inventories after the more than 50 day strike.The 2023 recovery could take even longer.""Given the starting point, and the wider number of automakers potentially affected, the recovery in auto inventory could be set back a year or more,"" Oxford Economics economists wrote. ""This would be an upside risk to our inflation forecasts, which assume further gradual goods disinflation.""Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest economic news and indicators to help inform your investing decisions.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

To skip our detailed analysis of the EV charging sector, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest EV Charging Companies in the US.The higher the demand and supply for electric vehicles, the faster the electric vehicle charging market will grow. According to a report by Global Market Insights, the US electric vehicle market was valued at $49.1 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 15.5% over the forecast years of 2023-2032. The market is projected to reach $215.7 billion by 2032. Such indicates that the future of the electric vehicle charging industry has a positive outlook.According to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global electric vehicle charging station market was valued at $12 billion in 2022. The market is expected to grow to $141.08 billion in 2030 from $16.43 billion in 2023 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36%. More and more countries have begun to adopt electric vehicles and charging systems. As of now, companies in North America and Europe dominate the market. However, Asia Pacific holds the largest consumer base.Nevertheless, the United States holds a large electric vehicle (EV) charging market. According to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the US electric vehicle charging equipment market was valued at $4.2 billion in 2022. The market is expected to grow to $11.73 billion by 2028 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.8%. Increasing awareness of climate hazards and a shift towards clean energy has prompted the adoption of electric vehicles in the country. With that, the demand for EV charging solutions is expected to grow to unprecedented levels.The Functionality of EV Stations May Actually Be GloomyWhile the EV charging industry is growing and is expected to experience an exponential upward trajectory, it is important for companies and authorities to maintain these systems.Story continuesOn September 13, the Wall Street Journal reported a recent event on EV charging stations that came to light. Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary of the United States, failed to find a functional Electric Vehicle (EV) Charger. The US Secretary of Transportation owns a hybrid minivan and was looking for an EV charger in his vicinity. He said that most EV chargers in the vicinity were dysfunctional and how other EV owners faced similar experiences in the past.This one instance sheds light on the workings and functionality of the EV charging business in the United States. According to the report, there are almost 100,000 public EV stations in the United States. However, most are reportedly dysfunctional. On the one hand, the Biden Administration is investing heavily in the EV charging industry, and on the other, the functionality of the existing EV charging stations tells us a different yet alarming story. According to the report, the government is set to establish 500,000 new EV charging stations by 2030. However, the US Secretary of Transportation, Pete Buttigieg, seems skeptical about the initiative. The Biden Administration has allocated $7.5 billion to developing EV charging solutions in the US.Notable Names in the EV Charging IndustrySome of the top companies that are working on developing EV charging networks and solutions include Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), EVgo Inc. (NASDAQ:EVGO), and ChargePoint Holdings Inc. (NYSE:CHPT). These companies are also some of the best EV stocks to buy.Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a large multinational automotive company based in Texas, United States. The company specializes in designing and manufacturing electric vehicles, stationary battery energy storage devices, and solar panels. The company is known to dominate the electric vehicle and EV charging market with its innovative technology and strategic decision-making. On June 8, Forbes reported that General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) joined the EV charging network of Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). This happened two weeks after Tesla Inc.

LW is on track with boosting offerings and expanding capacity. The provider of value-added frozen potato products has been benefiting from strategic pricing efforts amid an inflationary cost landscape.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Lamb Weston’s first-quarter fiscal 2024 sales and earnings per share (EPS) suggests 41.2% and 44% growth, respectively, from the year-ago quarter’s reported numbers. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 9.2% year to date against the industry’s 9.2% decline.Let’s discuss further.Pricing Actions Drive GrowthLamb Weston’s net sales have benefited from robust price/mix, as witnessed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The price/mix rose 24%, reflecting gains from pricing actions in every core business unit to counter input and manufacturing cost inflation. In the Global, Foodservice and Retail segment, price/mix grew 28%, 13% and 35%, respectively. Efficient pricing is likely to protect margins.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchExpansions on TrackLamb Weston’s sturdy balance sheet and capacity to generate cash keep it well-placed to boost production capacity and fuel long-term growth. Capital expenditures totaled $736 million during fiscal 2023 on construction costs as the company is on track to expand its processing capacity. In its last earnings call, management highlighted that it broke ground on a 250 million-pound capacity expansion. The expansion will enhance the company’s ability to cater to the growing South American market. Management also stated that it made progress on its expansion projects across China and the Netherlands, which are expected to come online in the next 18 months.Cost Woes: A ConcernAlthough Lamb Weston’s quarterly gross profit increased year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter, the metric was hurt by escalated costs. Increased costs per pound and reduced sales volumes were hurdles for the metric. Increased costs per pound reflect high-single-digit cost inflation for critical inputs like raw potatoes, energy, labor, edible oils and ingredients, including grains and starches.The inflationary environment and other macro pressures on consumers continue to hamper traffic in specific restaurant channels. The company anticipates the near-term demand to be somewhat hampered owing to dynamic restaurant traffic trends and persistent macro pressures on the consumer. That said, management is on track with strategies like pricing actions and enhancing business and product mix to counter input cost inflation.Story continuesAppetizing Food PicksMGP Ingredients MGPI, which produces and markets ingredients and distillery products, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

CHD boasts a portfolio of solid brands, fueled by consumer-friendly product innovations and acquisitions. The well-known specialty products company benefits from strategic pricing efforts amid an inflationary cost landscape. These factors drove CHD’s second-quarter 2023 results, with net sales and earnings increasing year over year.Management anticipates sales and gross margin strength to be sustained in the second half of 2023. Constant brand investments, product innovation and successful execution will likely drive results. For 2023, it expects reported sales growth of nearly 8% and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increase of 6%.Factors Driving Church &amp; Dwight’s GrowthChurch &amp; Dwight resorted to incremental pricing across its portfolio to counter rising costs. Favorable pricing was an upside to the company’s organic sales in the second quarter of 2023. The company’s organic sales growth was backed by a favorable product mix and pricing of 5.8%.The company boasts power brands, representing most of its consumer sales. In the second quarter, the company’s U.S. portfolio saw consumption growth in 11 of 17 categories. CHD is focused on product innovation for further development. Management is on track to differentiate its brands to consumers through innovative products, packaging and forms.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchManagement strategically increased its presence through acquisitions to grow its portfolio. It recently completed its latest buyout of the Hero Mighty Patch brand (or Hero) and other acne treatment products. In December 2021, CHD concluded the buyout of TheraBreath, a leading brand in the mouthwash category, which marks its 14th power brand.We note that the FLAWLESS and WATERPIK buyouts have also been prudent additions to Church &amp; Dwight’s portfolio. Another noteworthy acquisition of the company includes Batiste. In December 2020, the company took over Matrixx Initiatives that owns the ZICAM brand.

In the second quarter, as a percentage of sales, marketing expenses rose 130 basis points (bps) to 9.1%.

MO stands in a favorable position to benefit from its range of smoke-free products and competitive pricing strategy. Management’s Enterprise Goals for 2028 reflect its confidence in ongoing prospects. These upsides have been working well for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company amid cost inflation and soft cigarette volumes.Shares of this tobacco giant have rallied 14.5% in the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 5.5%. The company also outpaced the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector’s growth of 1.6% in the same period.Factors Working WellConsumers have been increasingly moving toward reduced-risk products (RRPs) or smoke-free alternatives, driven by the growing awareness of the health risks associated with traditional cigarette smoking. MO has been proactive in adapting to this evolving market landscape by offering a range of oral tobacco, e-vapor and heated tobacco products. In the second quarter of 2023, the company's net revenues in the Oral Tobacco Products segment witnessed a 2.3% year-over-year increase, reaching $680 million.Altria, through its subsidiary Helix Innovations, holds full global ownership of on!, a popular tobacco-derived nicotine (TDN) pouch product. This product has been gaining traction in the United States, primarily due to its low-risk claims. Altria is actively expanding both its manufacturing capacity and the availability of on! in the market, resulting in notable 50% growth in shipment volumes in the second quarter.Within smoke-free alternatives, management is exploring strategies to effectively compete in the significant e-vapor category. E-vapor products continue to dominate the smoke-free category in the United States as they have proven to be the most successful in encouraging smokers to transition away from traditional cigarettes. Altria's acquisition of NJOY Holdings (concluded in June 2023) is particularly noteworthy in this context.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesAltria's pricing power has been instrumental in maintaining its stability, even in the face of declining cigarette shipments. While raising prices could potentially result in reduced cigarette consumption, smokers often tolerate these price hikes due to the addictive nature of cigarettes.In the second quarter of 2023, increased pricing provided relief to revenue streams in the Smokeable Products and Oral Tobacco categories, mitigating the impact of lower sales volumes. The higher pricing strategy also positively influenced the adjusted operating company income (OCI) in both of these segments.Volume ConcernsThe overall cigarette industry has been bearing the brunt of the inflationary environment, which has affected Adult Tobacco Consumers’ (“ATC”) spending patterns. As the external landscape remains dynamic, Altria continues assessing economic factors like elevated inflation, higher interest rates, global supply-chain hurdles and ATC dynamics, such as purchasing patterns, the adoption of smoke-free products and disposable income.Cigarette volumes, in general, have also been affected by consumers’ rising health consciousness and a shift to low-risk tobacco alternatives. In the second quarter of 2023, net revenues in the Smokeable Products segment declined 30.9% year over year to $5,820 million due to the reduced shipment volume and increased promotional investments, partly compensated by greater pricing. Domestic cigarette shipment volumes tumbled 8.7%, mainly due to the industry’s decline rate and retail share losses, partly countered by trade inventory movements.Final Thoughts &amp; 2028 GoalsAltria remains well-positioned to thrive due to its smoke-free product portfolio and effective pricing strategies. For the full-year 2023, the company envisions the adjusted EPS in the range of $4.89-$5.03, suggesting growth of 1-4% from the $4.84 recorded in 2022.Altria also highlighted its 2028 Enterprise Goals at its 2023 Investor Day. Altria targets generating mid-single-digit adjusted EPS growth through 2028 (on a compounded annual basis). Further, Altria plans to maintain a total adjusted OCI margin of at least 60% in the next five years. MO intends to maintain its leadership position in the U.S. tobacco space. Moreover, management targets nearly doubling its smoke-free net revenues to $5 billion from the 2022 level.Solid Consumer Staple BetsInter Parfums IPAR, which manufactures, markets and distributes a range of fragrances and fragrance-related products, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseFlowers Foods, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Flowers Foods, Inc. QuotePricing Helps Offset Cost InflationFlowers Foods is battling hurdles due to cost inflation. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, materials, supplies, labor and other production costs (excluding depreciation and amortization) were partly affected by input cost inflation, reduced production volumes, higher product returns and elevated maintenance costs. Management expects inflation to persist in 2024.However, Flowers Foods’ pricing efforts have been helping it battle cost inflation and generate improved margins. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the pricing/mix increased 13.3%.

Neither admitted wrongdoing.The lawsuit began in 2015 after the U.S. Department of Justice started investigating airlines for potential anticompetitive practices, and continued even though no charges were brought.Passengers said that a conspiracy beginning in 2009 to enforce what the carriers called ""capacity discipline"" artificially inflated ticket prices and reduced flight choice.Delta and United called their seating capacity reductions a legitimate response to reduced demand, rising fuel prices and the 2008 global financial crisis. United called it ""perfectly rational Economics 101.""Both carriers went through bankruptcy not long before the purported conspiracy began, with United emerging in 2006 and Delta emerging in 2007.Delta on Wednesday said it would continue defending against the lawsuit, and has ""always independently determined its capacity based on market demand.""United said it was disappointed with the judge's decision, and will seek to have it reconsidered or file an appeal.The American and Southwest settlements won final court approval in 2019.

Neither admitted wrongdoing.The lawsuit began in 2015 after the U.S. Department of Justice started investigating airlines for potential anticompetitive practices, and continued even though no charges were brought.Passengers said that a conspiracy beginning in 2009 to enforce what the carriers called ""capacity discipline"" artificially inflated ticket prices and reduced flight choice.Delta and United called their seating capacity reductions a legitimate response to reduced demand, rising fuel prices and the 2008 global financial crisis. United called it ""perfectly rational Economics 101.""Both carriers went through bankruptcy not long before the purported conspiracy began, with United emerging in 2006 and Delta emerging in 2007.Delta on Wednesday said it would continue defending against the lawsuit, and has ""always independently determined its capacity based on market demand.""United said it was disappointed with the judge's decision, and will seek to have it reconsidered or file an appeal.The American and Southwest settlements won final court approval in 2019.

To skip our detailed analysis of current stock market news, you can go directly to see the 5 Good Stocks To Invest In Right Now.The year 2023 has been quite eventful so far, with the rise of generative artificial intelligence, the banking crisis, regulatory crackdowns on crypto, rising interest rates, and much more. Despite all this, businesses and investors alike are continuing to hold on in the hope of turning the tide in their favor. Some professionals believe that such hopes are not ill-founded, as there may very well be significant potential for the market to reach new highs in the near future. For example, Katie Stockton, the founder and managing partner for Fairlead Strategies, joined CNBC's 'Halftime Report' on September 12 to highlight how major stock indices can still expect to see some upside momentum at this point in time. Here are some of her comments about the market:""I would say it's still a cyclical bull trend. We obviously have a corrective phase underway that's impacted our intermediate term momentum gauges, but not the long-term ones. So we still have long-term upside momentum behind the major indices, and that's promising.""At the same time, other professionals have been weighing in on the possibility of further Fed rate hikes. David Bahnsen, the chief investment officer at Bahnsen Group, joined CNBC's 'The Exchange' on September 12 to comment on this:""I think the Fed is following markets - markets are not following the Fed, and I think it is a fait accompli that they're going to pause again at the end of September.""The Election Year Holds Back The FedBahnsen added that he believes the Fed will refrain from raising rates because the US is heading into an election year. He drew a comparison between this election year and the one in 2016 when the Fed didn't ""touch rates"" despite the fact that there were four rate hikes on the schedule. According to Bahnsen, the Fed has been following a policy of staying separate from the country's politics since 1994, which is why he believes it is unlikely that we will see another rate hike during this election year.Story continuesIn the midst of these market trends, among talks of a new tech bull market also being on the way, consumers and investors alike have been adopting more optimistic viewpoints toward the market and what they can gain from it. As such, many investors are looking for the best stocks to invest in for the long term alongside good stocks to invest in right now for the short term.

(NASDAQ:ISRG) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Strength in health care equipment was largely due to the outperformance of sleep apnea device company Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. and robotic surgery system pioneer Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG). Intuitive Surgical, Inc. manufactures and markets the da Vinci Surgical System, a robotic system used for minimally invasive procedures. Shares increased after Intuitive reported strong first quarter financial results highlighted by a 26% increase in procedures and raised guidance for 2023. These results, which came in well above Street estimates, were driven by strength in general surgery procedures in the U.S. and non-urology procedures outside the U.S. We continue to believe Intuitive has a large opportunity to expand the use of robotic surgery over time.”12. General Electric Company (NYSE:GE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71As of August 10, Josh Sullivan, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, maintains an Overweight rating on shares of General Electric Company (NYSE:GE).

(NYSE:SHOP) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP): Shopify shares were a top contributor in the quarter following strong 1Q results and the announced divestiture of its logistics business. Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) grew 15% year over year as e-commerce sales broadly rebounded and Shopify continued to take market share. Revenue grew 25% driven by increased merchant adoption of multiple products, especially Shop Pay. The company generated $86 million of free cash flow, up from a $46 million loss last year, and announced expectations to be free cash flow positive for each quarter for the rest of the year. The company had previously announced several cost savings plans, which are driving margin and free cash flow improvement, and now plans to divest its capital-intensive logistics arm. Faster growing revenue, lower operating expenses, and a less capital-intensive future were all cheered on by the market.Last year, 10% of US retail e-commerce sales flowed through SHOP, second only to Amazon, and the company is still enjoying significant tailwinds as retail merchants of all sizes adopt SHOP’s software tools to display, manage and sell their products across a dozen different sales channels. We believe that the overall growth of e-commerce, combined with the development of new products and services, such as its digital wallet Shop Pay, should continue to drive revenue growth of more than 20% per year over the next several years, accompanied by re-acceleration of operating margin growth and FCF generation.”10. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75Morgan Stanley's Betsy Graseck maintains an Overweight rating on shares of Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) as of August 1.

The company offers a comprehensive suite of services, including an online marketplace for buyers and sellers, payment solutions through Mercado Pago, merchant and buyer financing through Mercado Credito, shipping services through Mercado Envios, and asset management through Mercado Fondo, among other services. We believe the e-commerce market within Latin America remains underpenetrated, creating a favorable backdrop for MercadoLibre, as they have been growing and investing heavily to expand its first mover advantage. Moreover, the company’s growing fintech payments business. Mercado Pago. is well-positioned to potentially emerge as a leader in Latin America, as well as an emerging online advertising presence which offers attractive margin expansion potential, in our view. While the company posted strong quarterly results, shares fell on fears that their exposure to Argentina, which saw its currency devalued, would impact company revenues in the near-term.”8. Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 78Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) had 78 hedge funds long its stock in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $2.4 billion.A Buy rating was maintained on shares of Datadog, Inc.

The company operates an observability and security platform for cloud applications in North America and internationally.RiverPark Advisors said the following about Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG): DDOG was a top detractor in the quarter. The company reported strong 4Q results including 44% revenue growth and 30% earnings growth but gave cautious revenue guidance for 2023. Macroeconomic headwinds have caused clients to slow the transition of workloads to the cloud and instead to optimize current capacity. Despite this temporary slowdown, DDOG still expects revenue to grow nearly 25% in 2023.As businesses have transitioned to cloud software infrastructure, much of which is in isolated data silos, it has become increasingly difficult for data engineers to monitor and analyze system performance. Datadog provides a SaaS software platform to monitor and analyze the system performance of software applications and IT infrastructure by giving users a single page view to observe their company’s technology stack. The company has quickly grown its revenue from $100 million in 2017 to $1.7 billion in 2022 and, we believe, should continue to grow revenue at more than 20% annually as it penetrates its $40 billion and fast-growing market. Less than 10% of software applications are currently monitored. The company’s dollar-based net retention rate has been 130%+ as existing customers continue to use an increasing number of products and the company continues to add new features. As of 4Q22, 81% of customers used 2+ products, while only 18% of customers used 6+ products (up from less than 1% two years ago). As an extremely capex light software business, DDOG already has significant free-cash-flow ($350m in 2022) and free-cash-flow margins (21% in 2022).”Like The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), and Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) is a highly popular stock today.7. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a communication services company based in Burbank, California. The company operates entertainment businesses worldwide through its Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution, and Disney Parks, Experiences, and Products segments.A total of 92 hedge funds were long The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $2.2 billion.Rosenblatt's Barton Crockett reiterated a Buy rating and a $104 price target on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shares on September 12.RiverPark Advisors made the following statements about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS): DIS was a top detractor in the quarter following mixed FY2Q results. Revenue of $22 billion was up 13% year over year, although EPS, at $0.93, was down 14% year over year. Disney Plus, part of the company’s direct-to-consumer business (DTC), had better subscriber numbers than anticipated despite a price increase, although losses at the DTC business as a whole are growing. The linear TV business also continues to suffer secular headwinds with – 10% revenue growth, and the company faced inflationary cost pressures at its theme parks.DIS is nevertheless blessed with a deep library of unique content that includes both live sports (providing large, non-time shifted audiences) and incomparable brands including Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm, as well as the ABC network. The company also has a wealth of upcoming new content, with a plan to release over 100 original titles per year on a $30 billion annual content production budget. Now that the disruption in its theme park, cruise and theatrical businesses has come to an end, we believe that Disney is among the best-positioned media companies in the new landscape to combine multi-channel and DTC distribution.We think the return of long-time CEO Bob Iger will lead to higher and more consistent profitability at the theme parks, better value realization in the linear assets, and consolidation of the company’s DTC assets leading to higher profitability sooner. We therefore expect DIS to grow its free cash flow significantly over the next 3-4 years, from its depressed $1 billion last year, returning to and exceeding its previous $10 billion peak in 2018.”6. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust was the largest shareholder in Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) at the end of the second quarter, holding 25.1 million shares in the company.Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) is a financial company based in Omaha, Nebraska. It engages in the insurance, freight rail transportation, and utility businesses worldwide.In the second quarter, 109 hedge funds were long Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B). Their total stake value was $15.5 billion.A Buy rating and a $414 price target were maintained on shares of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

AI is going to improve healthcare overall. The benefits are expected to be myriad and powerful.AI is helping physicians identify issues with greater accuracy, ease and speed. The technology can better identify issues for greater scrutiny in scans, as one example. AI is also useful for creating prosthetics and improving healthcare data overall. Further, AI is enhancing visualization during surgery, aiding medical personnel with patients on the table. The list of benefits goes on and on.The conclusion is clear: AI is likely to propel med-tech stock valuations higher as advances continue.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIntuitive Surgical (ISRG)Source: michelmond / Shutterstock.comDa Vinci manufacturer Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is a strong stock to consider overall. The firm is headed in the right direction after pandemic closures and fear, decreased elective surgical procedure volumes. That affected the firm negatively, but it has rebounded nicely and continues to offer strong upside for investors moving forward.AI is only increasing the potential for Intuitive Surgical and its stock. To date, da Vinci systems have been utilized in over 10 million procedures. Those procedures provided a lot of data for the company. Intuitive Surgical is applying AI/ML methods to that information to provide insights that promise to improve future outcomes. AI is especially relevant to anomalous, complex cases for which a given surgeon may have very little prior experience. AI can guide those surgeons to make better decisions.Artificial intelligence is also helping surgeons determine the optimal amount of tissue when stapling tissue together. That prevents damage that could otherwise occur through the more traditional method of teaching a surgeon through trial and error.GE HealthCare Technologies (GEHC)GE Healthcare (GEHC) sign. GE Healthcare is an American company founded in 2014 and spun off from GE in 2023.Source: testing / Shutterstock.comStory continuesGE HealthCare Technologies (NASDAQ:GEHC) is a stock spun out of a parent company. It began trading early this year. The shares are well regarded by Wall Street and offer good upside for investors. They also include a modest dividend. Overall, GEHC stock is an interesting investment because it came from General Electric (NYSE:GE), which decided to split certain sectors into other companies.GE HealthCare Technologies has a very clear opportunity to utilize AI. The company manufactures and distributes diagnostic imaging and radiopharmaceuticals for the imaging needed in certain medical procedures. The company aims to improve patient outcomes by merging leading medical technologies, digital platforms and services. GEHC hired an ex-Amazon machine learning executive to help align research and development segments to technology in order to drive new research and products. Those potential AI advances should lead to growth.It makes perfect sense as a next step for GE Healthcare, which counts on MRIs and medical equipment for the bulk of revenues. The idea is to provide more personalized care from diagnosis to treatment and AI could help the company reach new heights.Exscientia (EXAI)medicine research, pharmaceutical background, LJPC stockSource: Sisacorn / Shutterstock.comExscientia (NASDAQ:EXAI) is a good example of a pharmaceutical stock that the AI boom is helping. The firm, like many other pharma firms, is leveraging AI to increase the speed with which it commercializes therapeutics.One of the biggest opportunities is the drug discovery portion of development. Drug discovery is one of the first stages in bringing a new therapeutic toward commercialization. It is a labor-intensive task in which researchers screen compounds for potential efficacy. The process requires a lot of time and labor and, thus, substantial capital. AI solves that issue. It simply does the task much faster and more efficiently than a human can.Exscientia is one of the pioneering firms in the sector. The firm opened its automation laboratory during the most recent quarter. It is staffed by leading scientists from top institutions and is in the early stages of development. Revenues are relatively insignificant at this point but Exscientia’s clinical programs are progressing. It has clear potential to carve out a position within the sector.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

COF, Credit Acceptance Corp. CACC and Navient Corp. NAVI.Industry: Consumer LoansLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2148203/3-consumer-loan-stocks-to-gain-from-a-prospering-industryThe Zacks Consumer Loans industry continues to bear the brunt of high inflation and expectations of economic slowdown. Deteriorating asset quality is a major near-term headwind too.Nonetheless, easing lending standards, which have increased the number of clients eligible for consumer loans, and digitization of operations will keep benefiting industry players. Further, steady spending on non-discretionary categories will result in decent consumer loan demand, thereby supporting revenue growth. Hence, industry players like Capital One Financial Corp., Credit Acceptance Corp. and Navient Corp. are worth keeping an eye on.About the IndustryThe Zacks Consumer Loans industry comprises companies that provide mortgages, refinancing, home equity lines of credit, credit card loans, automobile loans, education/student loans and personal loans, among others. These help the industry players generate net interest income (NII), which forms the most important part of total revenues. Prospects of the companies in this industry are highly sensitive to the nation’s overall economic condition and consumer sentiments.In addition to offering the above-mentioned products and services, many consumer loan providers are involved in other businesses like commercial lending, insurance, loan servicing and asset recovery. These support the companies in generating fee revenues. Furthermore, this helps the firms diversify revenue sources and be less dependent on the vagaries of the economy.3 Key Themes Shaping Consumer Loan Industry's ProspectsDecent Loan Demand: The persistent inflation (though cooling now) and other ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds continue to weigh heavily on consumer sentiments. Further, the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index and the Expectations Index (which shows a six-month outlook) declined in August. Nonetheless, consumer fears of an imminent recession continued to ebb.Story continuesDana Peterson, Chief Economist at The Conference Board, added “On a six-month moving average basis, plans to purchase autos and appliances continued to trend upward but plans to buy homes—more in line with rising interest rates—continued to trend downward. The dip in overall confidence notwithstanding, consumer plans to go on vacation, especially abroad, leapt upward in the month and slightly exceeded August 2022 readings, suggesting a continued penchant for spending on services.”This will thereby result in decent demand for consumer loans in the future. Thus, growth in net interest margin (NIM) and NII for consumer loan companies is likely to be stable.Easing Lending Standards: With the nation’s big credit reporting agencies removing all tax liens from consumer credit reports since 2018, several consumers' credit scores have improved. This has raised the number of consumers for the industry participants. Further, easing credit lending standards are helping consumer loan providers to meet loan demand.Worsening Credit Quality: For most of 2020, consumer loan providers built extra provisions to tide over unexpected defaults and payment delays due to the economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 mayhem. This considerably hurt their financials. But with solid economic growth and support from government stimulus packages, industry players began to release these reserves back into the income statement.The current macroeconomic headwinds may curtail consumers’ ability to pay back loans. Thus, consumer loan providers are building additional reserves to counter any adverse fallout from unexpected defaults and payment delays. This is leading to a deterioration in industry players’ asset quality and several credit quality metrics are slowly creeping up toward pre-pandemic levels.Zacks Industry Rank Reflects Bright PictureThe Zacks Consumer Loans industry is a 16-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #83, which places it in the top 33% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates outperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to keep on your radar, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry vs. Broader MarketThe Zacks Consumer Loans industry has outperformed both the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and its own sector over the past three years.The stocks in this industry have collectively gained 35.1% over this period while the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and Zacks Finance sector have rallied 33.2% and 28.6%, respectively.Industry's ValuationOne might get a good sense of the industry’s relative valuation by looking at its price-to-tangible book ratio (P/TBV), commonly used for valuing consumer loan stocks because of significant variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/TBV of 0.88X, below the median level of 1.15X, over the past five years. This compares with the highest level of 1.56X and the lowest level of 0.48X over this period. The industry is trading at a considerable discount when compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/TBV ratio for the S&amp;P 500 is 10.23X and the median level is 10.07X.As finance stocks typically have a lower P/TBV, comparing consumer loan providers with the S&amp;P 500 may not make sense to many investors. But a comparison of the group’s P/TBV ratio with that of its broader sector ensures that the group is trading at a decent discount. The Zacks Finance sector’s trailing 12-month P/TBV of 4.32X for the same period is way above the Zacks Consumer Loan industry’s ratio.3 Consumer Loan Stocks on the RadarCapital One: Headquartered in McLean, VA, the company is primarily focused on consumer and commercial lending as well as deposit origination. Strength in credit card and online banking operations, decent loan growth, robust balance sheet position and strategic inorganic expansion initiatives will support Capital One’s financials.With the Federal Reserve likely to keep interest rates high in the near term to control inflation, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s NII and NIM are expected to witness improvements, though rising funding costs will weigh on both. Revenue prospects look encouraging on the back of the company’s solid credit card and online banking businesses as well as decent loan demand. Strong growth opportunities in card loans and purchase volumes are expected despite an intensely competitive environment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for 2023 and 2024 has remained unchanged over the past seven days. Also, COF’s shares have risen 5.2% over the past six months.Credit Acceptance: Headquartered in Southfield, MI, CACC offers financing programs and related products and services to automobile dealers across the United States, enabling them to sell vehicles to consumers irrespective of their credit history. Further, it is engaged in the business of reinsuring coverage under vehicle service contracts sold to consumers by dealers on vehicles financed by the company.Revenue growth remains a major positive for Credit Acceptance, witnessing a six-year (2016-2022) CAGR of 11.2%. Growth is primarily attributable to a steady rise in finance charges, which is also the main revenue component. While finance charges are likely to witness headwinds from macroeconomic factors in the near term, the same will rebound once the operating backdrop improves. A decent rise in dealer enrolments and active dealers is also expected to support the company’s top-line growth.Over the past week, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has remained unchanged for both 2023 and 2024. Shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have rallied 22.9% over the past six months. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Navient: This Zacks Rank #3 stock is a leading provider of education loan management and business processing solutions. Headquartered in Wilmington, DE, the company is one of the leading servicers to the U.S. Department of Education under its Direct Student Loan Program.NAVI is growing its in-school originations. However, with the increase in overall interest rates, the extension of the federal loan payment holiday, loan forgiveness proposals and programs are anticipated to create uncertainty and limit refinance loan origination volume in the near term. Yet, over the long term, demand for refinancing loans should rebound once direct federal loan repayments begin.Focus on introducing new products leveraged with technology and cost control efforts will continue supporting Navient in the quarters ahead. Additionally, the company focuses on delivering operating efficiency and improving customer experience by building technology-enabled solutions.Navient’s shares have rallied 7.6% over the past six months.

221,8a8c2566-1b72-3e09-aa97-777984121b2e,NAVI,2023-09-14,3 Consumer Loan Stocks to Gain From a Prospering Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-consumer-loan-stocks-gain-121200008.html,1694607120,STORY,"['CACC', 'NAVI', '^GSPC', 'COF']","[The Zacks Consumer Loans industry continues to bear the brunt of high inflation and expectations of economic slowdown. Deteriorating asset quality is a major near-term headwind too.Nonetheless, easing lending standards, which have increased the number of clients eligible for consumer loans, and digitization of operations will keep benefiting industry players. Further, steady spending on non-discretionary categories will result in decent consumer loan demand, thereby supporting revenue growth. Hence, industry players like Capital One Financial Corporation COF, Credit Acceptance Corporation CACC and Navient Corporation NAVI are worth keeping an eye.About the IndustryThe Zacks Consumer Loans industry comprises companies that provide mortgages, refinancing, home equity lines of credit, credit card loans, automobile loans, education/student loans and personal loans, among others. These help the industry players generate net interest income (NII), which forms the most important part of total revenues. Prospects of the companies in this industry are highly sensitive to the nation’s overall economic condition and consumer sentiments. In addition to offering the above-mentioned products and services, many consumer loan providers are involved in other businesses like commercial lending, insurance, loan servicing and asset recovery. These support the companies in generating fee revenues. Furthermore, this helps the firms diversify revenue sources and be less dependent on the vagaries of the economy.3 Key Themes Shaping Consumer Loan Industry's ProspectsDecent Loan Demand: The persistent inflation (though cooling now) and other ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds continue to weigh heavily on consumer sentiments. Further, the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index and the Expectations Index (which shows a six-month outlook) declined in August. Nonetheless, consumer fears of an imminent recession continued to ebb.Dana Peterson, Chief Economist at The Conference Board, added “On a six-month moving average basis, plans to purchase autos and appliances continued to trend upward but plans to buy homes—more in line with rising interest rates—continued to trend downward. The dip in overall confidence notwithstanding, consumer plans to go on vacation, especially abroad, leapt upward in the month and slightly exceeded August 2022 readings, suggesting a continued penchant for spending on services.”This will thereby result in decent demand for consumer loans in the future. Thus, growth in net interest margin (NIM) and NII for consumer loan companies is likely to be stable.Easing Lending Standards: With the nation’s big credit reporting agencies removing all tax liens from consumer credit reports since 2018, several consumers' credit scores have improved. This has raised the number of consumers for the industry participants. Further, easing credit lending standards are helping consumer loan providers to meet loan demand.Worsening Credit Quality: For most of 2020, consumer loan providers built extra provisions to tide over unexpected defaults and payment delays due to the economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 mayhem. This considerably hurt their financials. But with solid economic growth and support from government stimulus packages, industry players began to release these reserves back into the income statement.The current macroeconomic headwinds may curtail consumers’ ability to pay back loans. Thus, consumer loan providers are building additional reserves to counter any adverse fallout from unexpected defaults and payment delays. This is leading to a deterioration in industry players’ asset quality and several credit quality metrics are slowly creeping up toward pre-pandemic levels.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Reflects Bright PictureThe Zacks Consumer Loans industry is a 16-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance sector.

ROST has been a lucrative investment option due to its business momentum, which is reflected in its strong quarterly performance. The company reported the second consecutive quarter of top and bottom-line beat in second-quarter fiscal 2023.ROST has been gaining from positive consumer responses to its merchandise. The company has been witnessing positive trends at its dd’s DISCOUNTS chain, driven by better merchandise and moderating inflation. However, low to moderate-income customers continue to reel under higher costs.The company’s off-price model offers a strong value proposition and micro-merchandising that drive better product allocation and margins. Overall, gains at the core business demonstrated consumers' continued focus on value and ROST’s ability to deliver value bargains to customers.Driven by the continued business momentum, management raised its second-half sales and earnings guidance. Comparable store sales for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2023 are expected to be up 2-3% and 1-2% year over year, respectively. Total sales are anticipated to grow 4-6% year over year.For the fiscal third quarter, earnings per share are envisioned to be $1.16-$1.21, suggesting a rise from the last-year quarter’s reported figure of $1.00. The operating margin for the fiscal third quarter is expected to be 10.3-10.5%, whereas it reported 9.8% in the last-year quarter, driven by gains from lower ocean and domestic freight costs, which more than offset increased incentive compensation and store wages.For fiscal 2023, comparable store sales are anticipated to be up 2-3% year over year. Earnings are forecast to be $5.15-$5.26, whereas it reported $4.38 in the prior year.The positive sentiment from the strong business momentum and an upbeat view is well-reflected in the company’s share performance.

By expanding its store network, ROST strengthens brand visibility, captures new customer segments and unlocks potential sales growth.The expansion strategy, combined with its strong brand reputation and off-price retail model, positions Ross Stores for success in the dynamic retail landscape.

The National Retail Federation predicts that K-12 back-to-school spending will increase to a record high this year, with an average family spending close to $900. With the many other inflationary price increases for goods and services, this can be a real burden for many in our community.Regions Bank associates are pitching in to help ease this financial pressure for families and ensure students and teachers across the bank's footprint are equipped and ready for a fresh start to the new school year.Here are a few highlights:NashvilleRegions associates worked with the United Way of Greater Nashville on their annual Stuff the Bus campaign. For this popular program, volunteers collect school supplies and fill backpacks so local students can be well equipped and ready to learn on the first day of school. According to Community Relations Officer Yolanda Hollingsworth, the team hoped to gather enough supplies to fill 500 backpacks, but they crushed that goal by assembling a whopping 702 backpacks.The top-performing Harpeth Village branch contributed 30 backpacks, and the winning team - Private Wealth - stuffed 116 backpacks, which earned them a free lunch. ""I'm so happy we had another a successful campaign this year,"" Hollingsworth said. ""This program helps prevent struggling families from having to choose between buying school supplies or putting food on the table."" All backpacks collected will go toward nine counties around Middle Tennessee.Middle TennesseeOther Middle Tennessee teams also did their part for the Stuff the Bus school supply drive. The five Murfreesboro branches, along with Smyrna, Woodbury, Tullahoma and Shelbyville, collected 70 backpacks. Additionally, the McMinnville North branch team collected a total of 45 backpacks to support schools in Warren County.Story continuesBirminghamAs part of the recent Regions DEI Symposium in Regions' headquarters city, 115 associates from 26 markets packed 200 school supply bags to help students in Blount County, Alabama, start the school year off right. ""The supply drive was a welcome addition to this important company event that celebrated inclusion and belonging,"" said Gina Sian, Community Affairs manager of execution and operations, who helped coordinate the drive. ""Our associates helped lessen the stress of back-to-school expenses by providing not only basic school supplies but also critical learning tools like a scientific calculator and geometry kit."" The supply bags also included an unexpected and thoughtful treat: Volunteers wrote notes for teachers and students wishing them a successful school year.Regions South and North Consumer Teams who were in town for the DEI Symposium also had an opportunity to support local schools. As part of their Volunteer Extravaganza, Regions teams set up a school supply shop at the East Lake Initiative. Consumer Bank teams and other associates performed gardening and clean-up tasks on a super-hot day at Jones Valley Teaching Farm's Woodlawn High School facility.Steve Nivet, Regions Consumer Banking regional executive, was pleased with the participation and the results of the Volunteer Extravaganza. ""We fostered teamwork, collaboration and reinforced our commitment to giving back to the communities we serve,"" he said.The Birmingham-based Women in Finance group led a back-to-school shoe drive that resulted in 142 pairs of brand-new sneakers being donated to The United Way of Central Alabama. ""These shoes will provide local students with a sense of pride and confidence and ensure they have a great start to the new school year,"" said Amanda Saint, Business Unit Controller for Credit and Corporate Administration and chair of the Women in Finance community service working group. ""We're so grateful to our Finance teammates who participated in this important effort.""Another Birmingham-area effort benefited the Shelby County Schools Education Foundation. Several teams working at the Regions Riverchase North and South locations recently relocated to the nearby Riverchase Operations Center, which required a significant workspace clean-out. Patricia Day, an administrative assistant in Technology, Operations, Digital and Data organization, served as coordinator for the project and organized a large office-supply donation to the foundation. Day was on hand when the ""Regions Resource Room"" was unveiled on the first day of orientation and training for new teachers. ""To see the reactions of the new teachers of what was available to them at no cost was extremely rewarding,"" Day said. ""The teachers were so appreciative of the supplies donated by Regions.""The Regions Procurement department is also doing their part in the back-to-school effort. They are donating printers to schools throughout the footprint, including the Tupelo, Fort Myers, Shreveport and Columbus, Georgia, markets.TallahasseeThe Regions Centerville Road branch team connected with local customers for a two-week back-to-school drive in early August. School supplies were collected and delivered to the Pace Center for Girls Leon - just in time for the first day of school. ""We were pleased to provide supplies for students and families to reduce the additional financial burden,"" said Felicia Richardson, Tallahassee market executive and branch manager.MemphisLike Nashville and Middle Tennessee, the Memphis market team also participated in a United Way ""Stuff the Bus"" And these Regions associates took the assignment literally. Count them - more than 1,300 binders, glue sticks, folders, notebooks, dry erasers and more valued at almost $5,000 - were collected and contributed by bank team members to benefit the annual United Way of the Mid-South project assisting Shelby County schools in need.""Ensuring students have essential classroom supplies creates a solid foundation for them to achieve a successful school year,"" said David May, leader of Regions' Mid-America Commercial Banking group and market executive for Memphis. ""Whether it's the Stuff the Bus project, Driving the Dream initiative or our annual workplace giving campaign, our Memphis associates have a proud history of helping United Way and their partner agencies. Once again, our team members were incredibly generous in lending their support.""CharlotteBluetiful, Inchworm and Razzmatazz: they're names that may not mean much to you but soon will for young budding artists around Charlotte, North Carolina. That's because nonprofit Classroom Central is putting a full palette of art supplies in the hands of 150,000-plus students attending under-resourced schools. Regions Bank has worked with Classroom Central for many years, including supporting this year's Color a Brighter Future for Students in Need campaign focused on drawing in items like crayons, markers, colored pencils and more. Charlotte team members personally donated supplies for the drive. A group of associates also participated in the Kits for a Cause kick-off pizza party earlier this month, assembling school supply packets filled with essentials pencils, pens, erasers and more - 336 to be exact.""The average teacher spends hundreds of dollars out of their own pocket every year just to cover basic school supplies,"" said Pamela Anderson-Rudd, Regions Community Mortgage loan officer and this year's Classroom Central associate collection drive chair. ""Arts and craft supplies, which can be more expensive, are often thought of as &amp;lsquo;extras' and not always included on supply drive wish lists. Encouraging our associates to collect these items allows us to fuel the creativity of thousands of students all year long.""MiamiAssociates in South Florida helped fill backpacks with classroom essentials during a school-supply drive benefitting Kristi House, an agency that supports families who have experienced physical abuse, child sexual abuse, sex trafficking, substance abuse, and other traumas. ""Several leaders and associates from different Miami markets donated to this amazing cause to provide children with school supplies and gift cards for the new school year,"" said Chris Cruzpino, market executive for Miami-Dade County.MontgomeryMarket Executive Robert Birmingham, Consumer Banking Manager Edward Lubembe and the Montgomery, Ala. market team donated 200 Regions-logoed backpacks that will be provided to Montgomery public schools. The Regions team helped fill the bags with pens, notebooks, crayons and other goodies supplied from community members as part of the local Tie and Doll Stuff the Truck campaign.Community Relations Officer Floresha Watkins summed up the event well, saying, ""Education is so important to us at Regions and we are happy to support local students and make sure they get a good foundation for learning.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Biggest Web3.0 Companies In The World.Demystifying Web3.0Web3.0, a cutting-edge technology that could redefine the digital frontiers, has gained massive popularity over time. The rising concerns about privacy and the centralization of the internet have fuelled the Web3.0 hype. Web3.0 is basically a vision for the future of the internet that is decentralized and based on blockchain technology. Web3.0 offers more ownership to the users while enabling them to perform all tasks they can currently perform on the current version of the internet, Web2. Web3.0 refers to a change in the nature of the internet where ownership by corporate networks is substituted by users. It represents the idea where blockchain technology and decentralized systems take center stage, and the users would be empowered in ways they never deemed possible. The shift in ownership and decentralization is the primary distinguishing feature between Web2 and Web3.0.Web3.0 is also closely linked with metaverse. Metaverse is envisioned as a decentralized space that users can access through extended reality tech such as AR and VR. Metaverse enables users to trade various digital products and assets which requires the use of blockchains. Blockchains and immersive technology are significant central features of Web3.0.Even though the vision of Web3.0 sounds promising, influential figures like Elon Musk have dismissed the possibility of its existence. Although a complete transformation to Web3.0 seems far-fetched, it is undeniable that Web3.0 is stirring some form of transformation.According to a report by Grand View Research, the global Web3.0 market was valued at $2.25 billion in 2023 and has been estimated to grow to $33.53 billion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate of 47.1%. Increased use of the latest technologies like 5G and enhanced consciousness about privacy are expected to contribute to this growth.Story continuesIn 2022, North America dominated the Web3.0 market, accounting for a global revenue share of over 37.0%. However, the Asia Pacific region has been estimated to have the highest projected growth rate during the forecast period. Incorporating Web3.0 into industries like finance and retail, along with rising traction around blockchain, has been estimated to contribute greatly to this growth.Web3.0 Revolution: Disrupting IndustriesWeb3.0 is often touted as the future of the internet. The internet interwinds with almost all industries and businesses today. The introduction and adoption of Web3.0 would cause a fundamental shift in how businesses operate. One of the defining features of Web3.0 is decentralization, it would bring blockchains to the mainstream.Web3.0 could revolutionize how the finance industry operates. On July 26, CNBC reported that banking giants like JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Citi want to put Wall Street on blockchain, where they can tokenize various assets. Blockchains can be used to maintain a decentralized and distributed ledger. If Wall Street is shifted to blockchain, it will make the role of third parties like market makers and brokers redundant, changing the fundamental structure of the financial sector.Payment giant Visa Inc (NYSE:V) is also embracing this change. It started testing stablecoin settlement on the issuance side in 2021. It has since expanded to other blockchains that can send and receive stablecoins faster and lower costs. On September 5, Visa Inc (NYSE:V) announced that it has expanded its stablecoin capabilities to the Solana network as it was previously limited to the Ethereum blockchain network. Visa Inc (NYSE:V) has transacted millions of USDC, the second largest stablecoin since 2021, between its partners to settle fiat-denominated payments authorized over VisaNet.The clothing industry is likewise benefiting from this new technology, using it to advance marketing and branding. Many brands have been exploring immersive reality experiences to interact with their customers. More than 50 brands were a part of the Decentraland Metaverse Fashion Week that was held in March including Adidas, Coach, and Diesel. The fashion week was for brands to showcase their digital fashion items and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The Metaverse fashion show operated in a similar way to regular fashion weeks.Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX), primarily a gaming platform, facilitates the creation of decentralized virtual worlds. Users can interact with each other and trade NFTs. Gucci has a dedicated Gucci Garden in the Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) universe. Players can trade special Gucci NFTs in this metaverse. Similarly, Nikeland in the Roblox Metraverse enables users to dress their avatars in Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) products.Metaverse has gained massive popularity over the past few years. The rebranding of Facebook as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) contributed greatly to this popularity. Metaverse is an online space where instead of being a passive viewer the user is an active part of the virtual reality. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is investing heavily in mixed reality technology influencing how users interact with tech today. On June 1, the company announced that it will be releasing its new VR headset, Meta Quest 3, this year. The headset would enable users to perform a variety of activities including access to various immersive worlds.Many companies are entering the mixed reality space, including the iPhone maker Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). On June 5, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced its spatial computing headset, Apple Vision Pro. The headset enables users to interact seamlessly with virtual objects in augmented reality. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) also launched an AI-assisted avatar creator tool enabling users to create photorealistic avatars.

This transformation includes its development of a Kubernetes-based Webscale Cloud platform for all core network functions, cloud-native architecture, extensive orchestration and automation, and end-to-end virtualization. With these technological advancements, as application upgrades come in, Verizon engineers are now able to deliver improvements to customers on a frequent basis, leveraging continuous delivery techniques and automation. Changes that once took weeks, now take only a few hours to implement, with zero downtime. These upgrades can be as varied as those designed to improve mobility handovers, reduce call drops, improve network resiliency security, introduce new fixed wireless access (FWA) features, improve latency, or any other customer experience improvement. The transformation also provides greater flexibility, improved scalability and improved cost efficiency in networks.“This has been one of the biggest transformations in our company’s history and our goal through the entire process has been to introduce the most advanced technologies available while making the changes as transparent as possible for our customers,” said Adam Koeppe, SVP of Network and Technology Planning at Verizon. “With the changes we’ve made to the bedrock of our networks, we are able to very efficiently manage our network and rapidly deploy enhancements for our customers without interrupting their services, leading to greater reliability, enhanced services, and higher customer satisfaction.”In a non-virtualized, hardware dependent world, it could have taken months to physically touch every router and server with these software changes, and often the network had to be taken out of service for a period of time, leaving customers without connectivity while upgrades were made. With Verizon’s extensive and largely invisible network transformation, what once would have taken months, now can be delivered to Verizon customers in a matter of hours or days across the network. Introducing new features, functions and upgrades is being done while the network is fully functional and managing traffic, which means customers’ connectivity is never interrupted while receiving the benefits of these software changes.Story continuesTransforming the networkThese advancements are a result of the multi-year transformation which involved introducing significant changes in the core architecture of the network, building the Verizon Cloud Platform, subsequently introducing Webscale cloud-native based architecture, driving orchestration to enable the coordination of these technologies, and making virtualization prolific throughout the core.The Verizon Cloud Platform has been enhanced with native container-based infrastructure optimized for Telco workloads to meet performance, scale and unique regulatory requirements. It provides tighter integration with Verizon’s operations systems. This gives Verizon technology parity with modern hyperscale cloud platforms to drive service agility and efficiency and allows functionality to be distributed throughout the network. Verizon’s native telco workloads (Core, RAN, signaling, and user plane) run more efficiently and with better performance and resiliency when deployed on this optimized cloud platform.This distributed platform supports edge services, private cloud services, Network Function Virtualization tools, Cloud Native Functions, Web applications, mapping and spatial analysis tools, orchestration tools, service assurance tools, auto-remediation, and compute offerings. In addition to current improvements in efficiency, reliability, service-assurance and performance for current customers, this Webscale architecture will also host the Verizon 5G core which will be able to achieve new levels of operational automation and adaptability to create differentiated customer experiences. This directional technology platform will support the stand alone core, the non-stand alone core, network slicing and VoNR services.MEDIA CONTACT:Karen Schulz864.561.1527Karen.schulz@verizonwireless.com]"

A big problem for the index constituents is the higher interest expenses that are eating into corporate profits. This has generated a longer list of S&amp;P 500 stocks to sell. Interestingly, the average S&amp;P 500 company generated $7.60 of operating profits for every dollar of interest expense in Q2. That’s down from more than $10 in the post-pandemic peak, as Barron’s reported Ned Davis Research’s findings in late August. S&amp;P 500 companies are hoping that interest rates slow down. They also expect the economy will keep chugging along so operating profits increase and higher interest expenses don’t consume profits. If rates stay elevated well into 2024 or even 2025, and debt burdens remain high, stocks and bonds could get hit. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLet’s examine three debt-ridden S&amp;P 500 stocks you want to sell before it’s too late.Catalent (CTLT)Catalent (CTLT) sign at its headquarters in Somerset, NJ, USA. Catalent, Inc. is an American multinational corporation.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comYou wouldn’t know it from Catalent’s (NYSE:CTLT) year-to-date (YTD) returns, which are up more than 9%. In reality, it’s on a serious downer, losing 27% of its value over the past six months. Catalent, for those unfamiliar, is a Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO). It helps drug companies manufacture products at more than 50 sites worldwide. In 2022, it had nearly $5 billion in revenue.Manufacturing pharmaceuticals isn’t cheap. It takes precise manufacturing equipment. That’s the reason the company finished Q4 2023 with $4.58 billion in net debt, resulting in $184 million in interest expenses in the fiscal year. Its earnings before interest and taxes in 2023 were $73 million. CTLT doesn’t have much leeway in the future should interest rates remain high. The one positive is that almost 90% of its debt matures in 2028 or later, when interest rates could be much lower. Surprisingly, and probably because of the healthcare connection, analysts remain optimistic about its stock. Of the 19 analysts rating CTLT, seven rate it “overweight” or “buy”. However, that doesn’t mean you should buy it. The median target price is $50,  or 30 cents above where it’s currently trading. Story continuesStanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK)Stanley Black and Decker (SWK) is a manufacturer of industrial tools and household hardware and provider of security productsSource: ricochet64 / Shutterstock.comStanley Black &amp; Decker (NYSE:SWK) has seen better days. First, a brief backstory.My wife runs a construction company with her business partner. He’s been a carpenter for nearly 40 years. He loves DeWalt tools. That’s all he uses. Black &amp; Decker originally bought DeWalt in 1960 and then sold the product line in 1989 but hung onto the name. It slapped the DeWalt name on its professional line of tools three years later, and DeWalt was reborn.The company got quite a bit larger in 2010 when The Stanley Works acquired it for $4.5 billion, a 22% premium. The merged entity became Stanley Black &amp; Decker, with Stanley shareholders owning 50.5% and Black &amp; Decker owning 49.5%.When the deal was announced, Stanley shares were trading at $49. We’re coming up to the 14th anniversary. SWK shares have increased by 91%. That sounds good until you realize the S&amp;P 500 is up 309% over the same period.  In addition, SWK debt ballooned from $1.09 billion in 2009 to $5.35 billion in 2022, a compound annual growth rate of 12.0%. Thus, the company ranks as one to sell now.     International Flavors &amp; Fragrances (IFF)Source: Lost_in_the_Midwest / Shutterstock.comInternational Flavors &amp; Fragrances (NYSE:IFF) has the ability to create flavors and fragrances for other people’s products. This is a genius, seemingly profitable business idea.And yet, IFF is down 33% YTD and 44% over the past five years. What’s the problem? The total debt stands at $11.3 billion, and the $190.5 million in net interest expense has ostensibly doubled over the past year. The debt levels jumped in February 2021 when it merged with DuPont’s Nutrition &amp; Biosciences business. “The combination of IFF and N&amp;B creates a global leader in high-value ingredients and solutions for the Food &amp; Beverage, Home &amp; Personal Care and Health &amp; Wellness markets, with estimated 2020 pro forma revenue of more than $11 billion and EBITDA of approximately $2.5 billion, excluding synergies,” stated the Feb. 1, 2021, press release announcing the completion of the merger. It cost International Flavors &amp; Fragrances dearly, paying DuPont $7.3 billion in cash. However, DuPont shareholders owned 55.4% of the merged entity, with IFF shareholders owning 44.6%.Today, it has $11.9 billion in sales and -$424 million in EBITDA.

The Dow ended down fractionally.Investors thinking ahead to next week's Federal Reserve meeting might be forgiven for looking through the headline print to the core number, which the Fed prefers. Core inflation excludes volatile food and energy and just dropped to 4.3% — the lowest since September 2021. And with good news out of core inflation, why should investors think the Fed should react to high gas prices, which, if anything, suppress spending on non-gasoline items?But those higher gasoline prices come as WTI crude oil (CL=F) has rallied 28% over the last three months, with technicals pointing to huge potential upside. In early September, WTI broke to new highs on the year, and now $90 per barrel is only minor potential resistance on the path to last year's highs around $120.To those who would laugh at $120 crude, we point to the recent words of JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. Only days ago — and to little fanfare — he raised the possibility of an eyewatering $150 handle.Speaking at a Barclays conference, Dimon said his general bearishness last year is based on ""huge, semi-tectonic shifts"" that he's seeing in the economy — signs that point to potentially higher prices across the board one year from now.Story continuesDimon said he wouldn't be surprised to see the US 10-year Treasury note (^TNX) yielding 5.5% (over 100 basis points higher than the current 4.3% rate) and crude oil landing between $120 and $150.""These things are tectonic differences from what you've experienced since 1945,"" he added. When the chairman of the world's biggest bank says we haven't seen the likes of this environment since the end of World War II, investors might well listen.Looking at the historical reaction of stocks on CPI release dates reveals a tight correlation to the overall direction of the market.While the correlation isn't perfect, the big drops in the orange line (shown above) reflect just how sudden and dramatic changes in critical data can lead to a major repricing of risk.Should headline CPI continue to accelerate to the upside, it will eventually force a reckoning with the bullish pricing of stocks. For those looking to time an exit to the substantial bull market rally off last year's October lows, this event could well be that catalyst.If Jamie Dimon is correct, then the time frame is sometime in the next year.morning brief imageClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"
248,b8236f81-49c3-3b21-9ebe-6031737b2b13,MCK,2023-09-14,Add These 4 Stocks With Remarkable Interest Coverage Ratio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/add-4-stocks-remarkable-interest-144700257.html,1694616420,STORY,"['MCK', 'MOH', 'SFM']","[Given the current economic scenario, investors should gauge the changing market dynamics and accordingly chalk out a sturdy investment strategy. Well, you can simply arrive at a decision to buy or sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers. But such a strategy does not always warrant superior returns when the market is facing myriad issues. A critical analysis of the company’s financial background is always required for a better investment decision.Well, a company should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations. This can be judged with coverage ratios — the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations. Here we have discussed one such ratio called the interest coverage ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest &amp; Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. STRL, Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. SFM, Molina Healthcare, Inc. MOH and McKesson Corporation MCK are four stocks with an impressive interest coverage ratio.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest coverage ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profits of a company. The company’s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, the interest coverage ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.The interest coverage ratio suggests the number of times interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.Story continuesWhat’s the Strategy?Apart from having an interest coverage ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest coverage ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:Sterling Infrastructure, which is engaged in e-infrastructure, transportation, and building solutions, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a VGM Score of B. The expected EPS growth rate for three-five years is 20%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Sterling Infrastructure’s current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 3.8% and 29.4%, respectively, from the year-ago period. Sterling Infrastructure has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 14.9%, on average. The stock has skyrocketed 218.8% in the past year.Sprouts Farmers, which offers fresh, natural, and organic food products in the United States, carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of A. Its expected EPS growth rate for three to five years is 9.3%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Sprouts Farmers’ current financial year sales and EPS suggests growth of 5.7% and 14.6%, respectively, from the year-ago period.

TRV has been favored by investors on the back of strong net earned premiums, high levels of retention, improved pricing, higher average levels of invested assets and sufficient liquidity.Growth ProjectionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Travelers’ 2024 earnings is pegged at $16.41 per share, indicating a 36.6% increase from the year-ago reported figure on 10.2% higher revenues of $45.29 billion.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceTRV currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Year to date, the stock has lost 13.2% against the industry’s rise of 12.4%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBusiness TailwindsRiding on strong net earned premiums and an aggregate underlying combined ratio for Business Insurance and Bond &amp; Specialty Insurance, strong underwriting results continued in the commercial businesses. Strong retention rates, positive renewal premium changes, higher new business premium in both Domestic Automobile and Domestic Homeowners and other across all the business segments should continue to drive Travelers.The company’s commercial businesses continue to perform well on the back of stability in the markets where it operates as well as the execution of its strategies. For 2023, the insurer expects renewal premium change to be modestly at a higher level throughout the remainder of 2023. In domestic homeowners and other, TRV expects renewal premium change to remain at an elevated level through the end of the year.Higher average levels of invested assets, reliable results from the fixed-income portfolio and strong returns from the non-fixed income portfolio are likely to drive net investment income (NII) higher. Given improved rate environment, Travelers raised outlook for fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities by $35 million for the second half of the year, to an estimated $570 million in the third quarter and then to around $590 million in the fourth quarter.TRV aims to generate increased earnings and capital, maintain a balanced approach to rightsizing capital and growing book value per share over time as part of its long-term financial strategy. Balance sheet strength driven by scale, profitability and cash flow support it to invest more than $1 billion annually on technology.The property &amp; casualty insurer has an impressive dividend history, increasing its dividend for the last 18 years. Its current dividend yield of 2.4% is better than the industry average of 0.3%. This makes TRV an attractive pick for yield-seeking investors.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the property and casualty insurance industry are Arch Capital Group Ltd.

It all started with an investment in Wendy's in 2004, whereby he took a significant stake in the fast food chain and pressured management to spin off its Tim Horton's brand. His proxy battle would result in a substantial profit once he exited the position.However, it is not always rosy for Ackman, despite being one of the most prolific hedge fund managers. His biggest miss has to be his conviction for a $1 billion short position on the health supplement company Herbalife. His argument that the company was a pyramid scheme would put him at a crossroads with another ferocious activist investor, Carl Icahn. He exited the position in 2018, insisting that the capital could be better deployed in other better opportunities.Long-Term Returns of Bill Ackman's Activist TargetsIn recent years, Ackman has clarified that he is no longer interested in vocal short-selling campaigns.

Robinson Worldwide, Inc. CHRW has opened a new facility  to speed up trade across the Mexico border, in a bid to meet buoyant demand for border logistics facilities owing to  nearshoring expansion.

Since its IPO in 1957, the stock price has risen by over 5,800%. However, since its high of $197 per share in March 2021, the stock price has been cut in half. More recently a dispute with Charter, put further downward pressure on the stock and it now sits at its lowest share price since 2014.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with DIS. Click here to check it out. DIS 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of DISIn this post Im going to break down the business model of The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS), the dispute with Charter and its financials, to understand if this volatility could be an opportunity, lets dive in.Iconic Business ModelThe Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) is most known for its 11 popular theme parks, located in Florida, Paris, Tokyo and even China. The company also has a thriving movie business and of course its streaming service Disney plus, which saw huge growth during the lockdown of 2020.The common thread between all of The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)s ventures is its iconic portfolio of characters and brands.Disney's Diverse PortfolioThis includes classic franchises such as Cinderella, The Lion King, The Little Mermaid and many more. Now you may think The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) only makes content for kids, but the business also owns a variety of popular movie studios which make content for all ages.A prime example is LucasFilms, the creator of Star Wars, that The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) acquired in 2012. Then of course, we have Pixar (Finding Nemo, Toy Story etc) which was acquired in 2006.The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) even owns Marvel, the home of the Hulk as well as 20th Century Fox, which owns X Men, Fantastic 4 and even Avatar.The beauty of The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)s business mode is every couple of years the company and revamp its movies, which makes it an ongoing cash cow.Story continuesCharter DisputeOn August 31st, The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)s channels including ESPN and Fox, disappeared from Charters cable service. This blackout occurred right before the U.S Open tennis tournament which left nearly 15 million fans in uproar. This was caused by a dispute over channel fees between the two companies.Recently the two companies reached a deal which will enable Charter to offer some of its ad supported streaming services such as Disney+ and ESPN+ to its customers. This deal was done just hours before the Monday Night Football season, which was shown on ESPN.Charter will pay The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) market based rates, which is estimated to be around $2.2 billion. Although this dispute wasnt ideal, I believe it was actually not too bad for The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) as it shows the disruption of its streaming service and in the end the businesses made a deal.Financial TurnaroundThe Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) reported mixed financial results for the third quarter of the fiscal year 2023. Its revenue was $22.33 billion, which missed analyst forecasts by $201.4 million and rose by just 3.84% year over year.Its Disney+ subscribers rose by a staggering 800,000 in the quarter. This was a positive sign given the company is focusing on business economics as opposed to pure subscribers growth.Disney+ ARPU (average revenue per user) rose by $0.11, which was driven by higher advertising revenue. Over 40% of its new sub additions, adopted the ad tier during the quarter.Continued Growth in Parks and Cruise LineIts Parks continued to grow solid and the business announced new themes such as Frozen and Avatar moving forward, which should help to drive new guests.Its Cruise line also showed surprisingly strong revenue growth, and in Q4, its booked occupancy is 98%. The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) is planning to add two more ships to its fleet in the fiscal year of 2025 and 2026, doubling its global capacity.Aggressive Cost CuttingThe Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) has been criticized for its cash burn, especially in the streaming business. A positive is the new CEO Bob Iger (who has returned to The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)) is on track to execute $5.5 billion in cost savings.Its direct to consumer (DTC) operating income rose by $1 billion in the past three quarters and The Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) plans this business to be profitable by the end of the fiscal year 2024.In the quarter its overall operating income was $2.7 billion, up 11.57% year over year.Its balance sheet contains $11.5 billion in cash and short term investments. Although the business does have fairly high debt of $47 billion.ValuationThe Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) trades at a price to sales (P/S) ratio = 1.7, which is 47% cheaper than its 5 year average.Its price to earnings (P/E) ratio is fairly high still at 45, although on a non-GAAP basis its P/E ratio = 25, which is 10% cheaper than its 5 year average.Its price to cash flow = 20, which is 45% cheaper than its 5 year average.The GF value calculator indicates a fair value of $161 per share thus the stock is classed as significantly undervalued at the time of writing.Final ThoughtsThe Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) is a tremendous company which owns a number of iconic brands. Its business model is diversified across its traditional parks, while its streaming service is benefiting from cord cutting globally. For a company of this size, one would expect greater profitability and thus I am glad to see the respected CEO focusing on this.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

Shares of DIS have fallen 3.9% year to date against the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector's rise of 8.5%.  The theme park segment has been the only bright spot among Disney’s businesses. It recently provided updates about its theme park business at Destination D23 event. The expo announced the release of the Zootopia show, which will replace It's Tough to be a Bug performance at Disney's Animal Kingdom Theme Park's Tree of Life Theatre.New introduction like a Pirates of the Caribbean-themed lounge is coming to Adventureland at Magic Kingdom Park in Florida, and a brand-new world-jumping vehicle is coming to Avengers Campus.Disney also announced that its imagineers are reimagining the Test Track of EPCOT and Dinoland U.S.A. at Disney’s Animal Kingdom. The inspiration for Disney Land’s new Animal Kingdom design is taken from Encanto and Indiana Jones. The Walt Disney Company Price and Consensus The Walt Disney Company price-consensus-chart | The Walt Disney Company Quote Disney's Theme Park Business to Aid GrowthDisney’s theme park business is benefiting from higher footfall at Shanghai Disney as well as other popular international destinations, including Frozen-themed Hong Kong Disneyland, Walt Disney Studios Park in Paris and Zootopia-themed Shanghai Disney Resort.However, DIS has suffered from the underwhelming performance of its streaming business, Disney+ and the disappointing theatrical presentation of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantum Mania and Elemental.Disney shares have underperformed its closest peers like Netflix NFLX, Amazon AMZN and Comcast CMCSA. Shares of Netflix, Amazon and Comcast returned 46.8%, 70.2% and 28.6%, respectively.Additionally, stiff competition from Comcast in the theme park as well as streaming business is hurting Disney’s prospects. Challenging economic conditions are expected to hurt footfall, impacting theme park segment revenues.Nonetheless, DIS expects its revenues and operating income to grow at a high single-digit percentage rate from the prior year.Moreover, Disney’s focus on sports streaming, particularly Live Sports in ESPN+, is expected to attract more subscribers. The renewal of MLB sports rights deal through 2028 and agreement with Spanish club football’s first division, La Liga, further strengthen the portfolio of the company’s sports content. These factors will be a tailwind in DIS’ international success regardless of facing stiff competition from Netflix and Amazon.For the current quarter, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company estimates revenues between $21.15 billion and $21.53 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $21.3 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 5.5%.

""Overall, we believe that going forward in the long term, we'll be able to moderate the growth in content costs for consumers based on what happened in the arrangement with Disney.""The two companies had hit a stalemate in contract negotiations over whether Disney should give Charter subscribers free access to its ad-supported streaming services as part of the telecom giant's cable packages. The blackout impacted a slew of high-profile sporting events including the US Open and arrived on the heels of the NFL's debut — upping the pressure for both sides to make a deal.On Monday, the companies announced that they had reached an agreement to end the media blackout. As part of the deal, Charter will offer some Disney streaming services — the ad-supported version of Disney+, ESPN+, and ESPN's yet-to-be-launched direct-to-consumer offering — as part of select cable packages at no additional cost to the consumer.""[Disney] had the linchpin asset in ESPN,"" Fischer said. ""You couldn't move to a new transformational model without ESPN. So because of that, we needed [Disney] to lead, which I think we said often, and it was true.""In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro indicated Disney was able to secure ""very strong"" rate increases for ESPN — something Fischer said Charter was willing to accept given the value of the sports network.Charter has focused on offering more bundles amid the cord-cutting phenomenon, hence its desire to include more streaming plans in packages. Fisher said the new deal will help ""stabilize the linear video ecosystem"" while also providing ""a glide path that gets us to the new direct-to-consumer environment.""Story continuesCharter said ESPN was the 'linchpin' in its negotiations with Disney (AP Photo/Jenny Kane, File)Wall Street analysts have called the agreement a win for both sides as Charter nabbed more flexibility within the traditional cable bundle while Disney's streaming platforms will benefit from more visibility as Charter subscribers sign up for the services.Still, Disney did give up a host of networks in exchange for the strong ESPN rates. Networks that will no longer be included in Spectrum TV video packages are Baby TV, Disney Junior, Disney XD, Freeform, FXM, FXX, Nat Geo Wild, and Nat Geo Mundo.Spectrum will continue to carry ABC Owned Television Stations, Disney Channel, FX, and the Nat Geo Channel, in addition to the full suite of ESPN networks.""Like much of this deal, we anticipate this setting a precedent for similar surgical culling in all future renegotiations across the industry,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson wrote in a note on Monday.Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Biggest Web3.0 Companies In The World.Demystifying Web3.0Web3.0, a cutting-edge technology that could redefine the digital frontiers, has gained massive popularity over time. The rising concerns about privacy and the centralization of the internet have fuelled the Web3.0 hype. Web3.0 is basically a vision for the future of the internet that is decentralized and based on blockchain technology. Web3.0 offers more ownership to the users while enabling them to perform all tasks they can currently perform on the current version of the internet, Web2. Web3.0 refers to a change in the nature of the internet where ownership by corporate networks is substituted by users. It represents the idea where blockchain technology and decentralized systems take center stage, and the users would be empowered in ways they never deemed possible. The shift in ownership and decentralization is the primary distinguishing feature between Web2 and Web3.0.Web3.0 is also closely linked with metaverse. Metaverse is envisioned as a decentralized space that users can access through extended reality tech such as AR and VR. Metaverse enables users to trade various digital products and assets which requires the use of blockchains. Blockchains and immersive technology are significant central features of Web3.0.Even though the vision of Web3.0 sounds promising, influential figures like Elon Musk have dismissed the possibility of its existence. Although a complete transformation to Web3.0 seems far-fetched, it is undeniable that Web3.0 is stirring some form of transformation.According to a report by Grand View Research, the global Web3.0 market was valued at $2.25 billion in 2023 and has been estimated to grow to $33.53 billion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate of 47.1%. Increased use of the latest technologies like 5G and enhanced consciousness about privacy are expected to contribute to this growth.Story continuesIn 2022, North America dominated the Web3.0 market, accounting for a global revenue share of over 37.0%. However, the Asia Pacific region has been estimated to have the highest projected growth rate during the forecast period. Incorporating Web3.0 into industries like finance and retail, along with rising traction around blockchain, has been estimated to contribute greatly to this growth.Web3.0 Revolution: Disrupting IndustriesWeb3.0 is often touted as the future of the internet. The internet interwinds with almost all industries and businesses today. The introduction and adoption of Web3.0 would cause a fundamental shift in how businesses operate. One of the defining features of Web3.0 is decentralization, it would bring blockchains to the mainstream.Web3.0 could revolutionize how the finance industry operates. On July 26, CNBC reported that banking giants like JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Citi want to put Wall Street on blockchain, where they can tokenize various assets. Blockchains can be used to maintain a decentralized and distributed ledger. If Wall Street is shifted to blockchain, it will make the role of third parties like market makers and brokers redundant, changing the fundamental structure of the financial sector.Payment giant Visa Inc (NYSE:V) is also embracing this change. It started testing stablecoin settlement on the issuance side in 2021. It has since expanded to other blockchains that can send and receive stablecoins faster and lower costs. On September 5, Visa Inc (NYSE:V) announced that it has expanded its stablecoin capabilities to the Solana network as it was previously limited to the Ethereum blockchain network. Visa Inc (NYSE:V) has transacted millions of USDC, the second largest stablecoin since 2021, between its partners to settle fiat-denominated payments authorized over VisaNet.The clothing industry is likewise benefiting from this new technology, using it to advance marketing and branding. Many brands have been exploring immersive reality experiences to interact with their customers. More than 50 brands were a part of the Decentraland Metaverse Fashion Week that was held in March including Adidas, Coach, and Diesel. The fashion week was for brands to showcase their digital fashion items and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The Metaverse fashion show operated in a similar way to regular fashion weeks.Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX), primarily a gaming platform, facilitates the creation of decentralized virtual worlds. Users can interact with each other and trade NFTs. Gucci has a dedicated Gucci Garden in the Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) universe. Players can trade special Gucci NFTs in this metaverse. Similarly, Nikeland in the Roblox Metraverse enables users to dress their avatars in Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) products.Metaverse has gained massive popularity over the past few years. The rebranding of Facebook as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) contributed greatly to this popularity. Metaverse is an online space where instead of being a passive viewer the user is an active part of the virtual reality. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is investing heavily in mixed reality technology influencing how users interact with tech today. On June 1, the company announced that it will be releasing its new VR headset, Meta Quest 3, this year. The headset would enable users to perform a variety of activities including access to various immersive worlds.Many companies are entering the mixed reality space, including the iPhone maker Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). On June 5, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced its spatial computing headset, Apple Vision Pro. The headset enables users to interact seamlessly with virtual objects in augmented reality. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) also launched an AI-assisted avatar creator tool enabling users to create photorealistic avatars.

Users can browse their favorite designer items and try them on their avatars before buying.We have made a list of the biggest Web3.0 companies in the world which include big tech companies such as Meta Platforms, Inc.

The report was produced in partnership with the ValueExchange.The landmark study reveals that 78% of Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI) investment budgets are dominated by maintaining and upgrading legacy technology platforms. Simply keeping the lights on is taking up 44% of infrastructures’ investment capacity, whilst a further 34% is allocated to the transition and replacement of these systems. Alongside intense regulatory oversight and mandated change, operating models are being pulled in multiple directions. This is leaving very little scope for spending on growth initiatives and highlights an ever-increasing risk for the industry.Roland Chai, Executive Vice President and Head of Marketplace Technology at Nasdaq, said: “Over decades technology debt has built up amongst infrastructure providers across financial markets. With more than a third of firms planning a major system overhaul over the next five years, alongside responding to an unprecedented wave of regulation, the need for refreshing core technology is a challenge that is core to most industry participants. As the backbone of the industry and global economy, operators must differentiate themselves and remain relevant for the next generation of investors.”This spending constraint is leading to a substantial difference in investment allocations between FMIs and their participants. For example, for over ten years Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has been proving highly effective in facilitating the quick and tactical automation of core processes and yet today only 4% of FMI spend is on RPA and AI initiatives, compared with over 28% by market participants.Story continuesAgeing platforms require major system overhauls A third of firms surveyed operate with legacy platforms more than ten years old, with 37% of respondents planning a major system overhaul in the next five years. The need to undertake significant projects is particularly prevalent in the post-trade space where 47% of clearing firms expect to trigger an upgrade, while in settlements 44% of firms see a transition as imminent. This comes at the same time as they look to remove time from their processing and increase their settlement efficiency, meaning an inevitable ‘distraction effect’ at a critical time.Regulatory change is the central concern for FMIsThe study finds the reach of mandatory regulatory change is the central concern for 64% of our respondents. As the global securities industry continues to contend with the impact of the Shareholder Rights Directive II and Central Securities Depositories Regulation, project teams are now faced with the added complexities of the transition to T+1 settlement cycles in North America in May 2024.In parallel, The UK Securities Financing Transactions Regulation has forced the securities finance firms to profoundly rationalize and accelerate their data reporting capabilities – as will the Securities Lending Transparency: Rule 10c-1 in the USA. Considered in the context of multiple local market regulations centered on client asset segregation, client monies and other areas, the regulatory agenda is increasingly requiring significant, enterprise-wide change across the entire trade cycle.“Across our client base there is an increasing recognition of the need to undertake major change programs, having adopted a patchwork approach for decades,” said Magnus Haglind, Senior Vice President and Head of Products, Marketplace Technology at Nasdaq. “The need to respond to regulatory change is also seen as significant factor, which increasingly demands re-engineering entire platforms, rather than tactical initiatives. This underscores the importance of modernization initiatives across infrastructure operators, where growth should form a key part of legacy upgrades.”To review the report in full, please use the following link: https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/mt/nasdaq-post-trade-reportAbout Nasdaq Nasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ) is a global technology company serving the capital markets and other industries.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance this year, and go directly to read 5 Worst Performing Dividend Stocks YTD. In 2023, dividend-paying stocks have not performed as well as other types of investments because many investors are showing a stronger preference for technology stocks. However, investment patterns change over time due to shifts in market sentiment and various economic factors. The US economy is uncertain this year due to unpredictable inflation. The latest CPI report showed that inflation increased in August from the same period last year, reversing the recent trend of slowing inflation. Compared to a year ago, it went up by 4.3%, which is in line with expectations and represents the smallest increase in almost two years.Because of the continuing economic uncertainty, the growth of dividends in the US slowed down during the second quarter of 2023. This deceleration in the country’s dividend growth resulted in a total of $148 billion worth of payouts, up modestly by 4.6% year-on-year when considering the core performance after accounting for lower one-time special dividends, according to the latest report by Janus Henderson. In general, dividend stocks haven’t performed that well this year. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, gained 2.33% this year so far, underperforming the tech-heavy NASDAQ, which delivered a 33.06% return to shareholders since the start of 2023.Also read: 15 Worst Performing Growth Stocks in 2023As the ongoing inflationary period continues to extend its course, dividend stocks can be a reassuring choice for concerned investors. Historical analysis also shows that dividend stocks have given a solid performance during periods of economic downturns. This is because dividend stocks are a defensive investment choice these equities tend to raise their dividend payments over time, which can help offset the effects of rising prices. In one of our previous articles, we cited Fidelity Investments’ data and mentioned that dividends accounted for more than half of the market's returns in periods of high inflation. The report also noted that in the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s, dividends made up 67%, 44%, and 73% of market returns, respectively. In those decades, when inflation averaged over 5%, total returns were below 10%.Story continuesAs mentioned above, tech stocks have dominated the market this year, surpassing dividend-paying companies. Even some of the biggest dividend companies such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) have also reported negative returns in 2023 so far. In this view, we will discuss some of the worst performing dividend stocks this year.15 Worst Performing Dividend Stocks YTDPhoto by Jp Valery on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we examined the worst-performing stocks of 2023 and selected dividend-paying stocks that have experienced substantial declines in their share prices so far this year.

This is our kind of company – despite the disparate parts, UGI grows earnings at a relatively steady high single digit rate over the long term while distributing excess cash through dividends.25 Shares are down due to a collection of short-term issues – driver shortages at the US propane business, losses from fixed priced contracts at the European energy marketing business, lower propane volumes in Europe and warmer weather.

Analysts tracked by Investing.com had expected a crude drawdown of 2.481M barrels instead for last week to add to the 6.307M deficit in the prior week to Sept. 1.On the fuels side, the EIA reported a gasoline inventory increase of 5.561M. The forecast consensus had been for a gasoline draw of 0.85M barrels that would have added to the prior week’s decline of 2.666M. Automotive fuel gasoline is the No. 1 U.S. fuel product.With distillate stockpiles, there was an official build of 3.931M barrels versus the expected gain of 1.4M and the prior week’s rise of 0.679M. Distillates are refined into heating oil, diesel for trucks, buses, trains and ships and fuel for jets.Fuel Demand Collapses The growth in both crude and fuel supplies coincided with the official end of the summer driving period in the United States last week, marked by the September 4 Labor Day holiday. Prior to that, refiners had drawn nearly 20 million barrels of crude from inventory over a period of four weeks as they maxed out fuel processing for the summer driving period. Refiners had maintained an extraordinarily high run rate of more than 93% of their capacity during the period.As of last week, the EIA said although refiners were still running at almost optimum levels, they refined less crude oil for fuel than the prior week.“Refineries operated at 93.7% of their operable capacity last week,” the agency said in the latest Weekly Petroleum Status Report. “Gasoline production decreased last week, averaging 9.2 million barrels per day. Distillate fuel production decreased last week, averaging 5.0 million barrels per day.”Story continuesDemand for fuels also fell as the peak summer driving bowed out, the EIA market summary showed. Total gasoline supplied to the marketplace — a key indicator of consumption — fell to a daily average of 8.307M from the prior week’s 9.321M. Gasoline consumption below the daily mark of 9M is often a red flag for demand, and such usage levels are typical in off-peak periods of demand like now.Domestic demand for fuels wasn’t the only bearish element of the EIA report.Exports Down Too, Production at New 3-Year HighThe agency also raised its estimate of U.S. oil production for last week to a new 3-year high of 12.9M barrels per day. Until a couple of months ago, crude output from the world’s largest producer of the commodity ranged between 12.1M and 12.2M a day. The current revision means daily production is just 400,000 short of the record high of 13.1M per day averaged in March 2020, just before the coronavirus outbreak which temporarily decimated oil demand.Alongside domestic demand, exports of U.S. crude — one of the bright spots of the weekly EIA report for months now — fell last week to 3.090M barrels per day from the previous week’s 4.932M.But imports of crude grew last week as refiners appeared to pull more oil into the country in anticipation of demand. According to the EIA. U.S. crude imports averaged 7.6M barrels per day last week, up 0.812M from the prior week. Such imports, ostensibly done at competitive pricing, raises questions about the so-called aggressive supply cuts by Saudi Arabia, which has been deliberately trying to channel less crude towards the United States in its bid to skew the EIA’s weekly reporting into a more bullish picture for oil.Joined by the Russians, who announced a 300,000 barrels per day cut from this month, the Saudis’ voluntary reduction of 1.0M barrels daily has had an exaggerated impact on oil prices, sending both global benchmark Brent and U.S. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude to 10-month highs.Related ArticlesU.S. crude oil stocks up 4M Bbls, first climb in 5 weeks; fuels surge too - EIAGold prices dip as dollar, Treasuries firm before CPI dataOil prices rise on tighter supply bets; CPI, US inventories in focus]"

Students today rely on the Internet to complete much of their homework - from researching and submitting papers, to completing worksheets, to interacting virtually with their teachers. Yet millions of students and families still lack a home Internet connection.To help address this, I recently traveled to four cities across the U.S. to meet with local partners and government officials, to advocate for, and support connectivity, initiatives, and to raise awareness for the federal government's Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), which provides families with a $30/month benefit ($75/month on Tribal lands) toward their Internet bill. Across Portland, Tacoma, Fort Wayne, and Houston, Comcast announced nearly $700,000 in investments, we gave away more than 500 laptops, and we opened two Lift Zones to increase community connectivity. Many of these resources will directly support students as they begin the 2023-2024 school year.$700K Investments in local organizations in Portland, Tacoma, Fort Wayne, and HoustonSince the ACP 's launch nearly two years ago, Comcast has been committed to raising awareness about this ambitious funding program, which, when applied to Comcast's Internet Essentials or Internet Essentials Plus tiers, makes home Internet effectively free. Recently, the ACP passed the tremendous milestone of 20 million households enrolled, a remarkable achievement that we were excited to celebrate. But that leaves nearly 30 million qualified households who are not yet taking advantage of this important benefit.With millions of college students also headed back to school and moving into dorm rooms and apartments with their roommates, Comcast is offering exclusive deals and spreading the word about ACP eligibility - which includes Pell Grant recipients. The benefit could save students up to $360 a year, making it easier to pay for other necessities like text books and meal plans. We're also taking this effort on the road with our 2023 Xfinity HBCU Tour, including stops at colleges like Delaware State University and Howard University.Story continuesThrough Project UP, Comcast's $1 billion commitment to reach tens of millions of people to advance digital equity and economic mobility, my colleagues and I are working all across the country with community partners and local officials to continue to raise awareness about the ACP and empower individuals with the digital skills they need to succeed and thrive.$1B Commitment to reach tens of millions of people to advance digital equity and economic mobilityBy partnering with nonprofit organizations and government at every level, we can support the next generation of students, entrepreneurs, and storytellers, and thereby help pave the way for them to achieve their highest potential and reach unlimited possibilities.The start of a new school year can be both an exhilarating and stressful time. And, as was made so abundantly clear during the COVID-19 pandemic, unless we help ensure all students are equipped with a home Internet connection, along with devices and digital literacy skills, the digital divide will remain a formidable barrier to achieving educational equity.Broderick D.

As for the technology sector, COVID-19 induced a number of disruptions, while presenting plenty of opportunities as well. For instance, while the pandemic caused major supply chain issues for the semiconductor industry leading to massive shortages and delays, it also influenced a global need for remote work-spaces, online retail, telehealth, and EdTech. According to a report by Deloitte, the technology sector has not just endured these challenges, it has thrived. In 2023, while the slowing economy continues to put pressure on the industry, along with ongoing disruptions in supply chain and workforce, the industry is paving its path towards innovation. Don't Miss: 10 Best Silver ETFsAccording to Gartner, the global spending in IT is forecasted to be roughly $4.6 trillion in 2023, increasing 5.5% since the previous year. Regardless of the concerns about the macroeconomic pressures, the IT sector is expected to expand, even in regions with flat GDP growth rates. Although the devices segment is estimated to decline by 5% during 2023, the software segment seems set for a double-digit growth rate. John-David Lovelock, VP Analyst at Gartner, stated: “The macroeconomic headwinds are not slowing digital transformation. Prioritization will be critical as CIOs look to optimize spend while using digital technology to transform the company’s value proposition, revenue and client interactions.” As per McKinsey, generative artificial intelligence is set to spearhead the need for innovation in the technology sector. While the potential for a framework based on artificial intelligence is endless, the business applications for the tech are expected to reduce development times, empower non-technical staff, and enable businesses to explore avenues for value addition through assistive technology. As per an estimate, innovation in generative artificial intelligence is expected to add $4.4 trillion in economic value by increasing productivity for businesses and consumers. Furthermore, investors seem confident about the potential for the tech sector, as investments worth nearly $1 trillion were made in the sector during 2022.Story continuesAlso Read: 10 Best Dividend ETFsIn addition to artificial intelligence, another major focus for the tech sector is cybersecurity. According to a report by Fortune Business Insights, in 2022, the total market for cybersecurity was valued in excess of $172 billion and this is expected to increase to nearly $425 billion by 2030. As the number of data breaches continues to rise, businesses look towards improving safety measures. Data breaches affect everyone – consumers, businesses, and governments. The sensitive nature of data highlights a growing requirement for safety for all stakeholders involved. As the world continues to take steps towards digitization, the risk for such breaches only multiplies. According to McKinsey, the market opportunity for cybersecurity solutions can be valued in excess of $2 trillion. By 2025, the damage from cyber attacks is projected to cost $10.5 trillion annually. With numerous companies underfunded to improve their security measures, the opportunity lies in four major areas – cloud technologies, pricing mechanisms, artificial intelligence, and other managing services. With developments in artificial intelligence, companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are working on combining the two in products such as Microsoft Security Copilot. Similarly, investments in private cybersecurity companies continue to increase as well. Recently, cloud-based security firm Wiz managed to raise $300 million at a $10 billion valuation.  While inflation still remains high, sectors such as technology, healthcare, and industrials are expected to outperform the market and provide a cover for investors in 2023. Additionally, more than 75% of tech leaders expect a better performance for the tech sector during the year.

While third quarter revenue and profit beat consensus expectations, billings–a forward growth indicator based on contracts–decelerated slightly as the tough macro environment caused deal scrutiny, longer sales cycles among new customers, and a slower productivity ramp-up for newly hired sales reps.

They have strong management teams who are focused on maximizing the long-term value of their businesses through sensible and disciplined capital allocation. However both enjoyed a period of overearning through the pandemic, with CDW benefitting from abnormally high IT spend and Ulta seeing demand spike for beauty products as consumers emerged from their lockdown cocoons. As the normalization of these trends produced an air pocket in demand management adjusted full year expectations and both shares sold off sharply; Ulta fell almost 30% in May, from $560 to $400, while CDW fell 25% between February and May, from $215 to $160.”9. iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (BATS:IGV)5 Year Performance as of September 12: 78.44%Introduced in July 2001, the objective for the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (BATS:IGV) is to track the performance of the S&amp;P North American Expanded Technology Software Index, which consists of tech companies involved in software development, home entertainment, and computing solutions.

This number remained unchanged since the previous quarter.Artisan Partners said this about Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Among our bottom contributors were Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM), SVB Financial Group and Catalent. The tougher macro environment caught up with Atlassian in the quarter as the company is seeing slower software user additions as customers of all sizes moderate hiring and spending. However, the company still expects to grow sales at a mid-20s rate in Q4 and grow its strategically important cloud revenues 40%–45%. These are slower rates than we expected, and could slow further, but Atlassian’s growth metrics remain solid in light of the environment. In the short term, slower revenue growth will likely pressure margins and profitability given the company’s rapid hiring expansion in recent periods. But we detect a meaningful shift in tone from management on expense growth and margins now that top-line growth is slowing. While we fully expect Atlassian to keep investing in its large growth opportunities, we think a prudent reprioritization of this spending will lead to margin tailwinds in the medium term. We are sensitive to the slowing near-term growth dynamics but believe remaining invested is appropriate given the longer term profit growth potential.”7.

All three stocks benefited from a renewed interest in growth stocks by investors in the first half of the year.Amazon had an impressive first half of the year as well with growth out of its retail segment but slightly slower growth in its cloud business. Customers optimized workloads for existing capacity they were already paying for rather than adding incremental capacity in the current environment. We remain very excited about the opportunity for the company to reduce the labor needs of its retail segment through the use of technology and automation in the future.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Technology ETFs To Buy.    Suggested articles:15 Worst Performing Dividend Stocks YTD25 Biggest Web3 Companies In The World10 Biggest EV Charging Companies in the US Disclosure: None. 12 Best Technology ETFs To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly. Top 5 Upgrades:UBS upgraded General Motors (GM) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $44, up from $41, as a new analyst took over coverage of the stock. Assuming a strike does not occur, the firm see second half earnings upside compared to consensus and argues that the current ""negativity"" priced into the shares creates an attractive risk/reward.Piper Sandler upgraded UMB Financial (UMBF) to Overweight from Neutral with a $74 price target. The firm cites its relatively discounted valuation compared to shares' historical premium over peers.BofA upgraded Southern Company (SO) to Neutral from Underperform with a price target of $68, up from $67. The shares have re-rated and now trade at a premium to most utility peers, notes the firm, which sees pending updates, including specifically an update on generation capital, helping to support the stock at current levels.Credit Suisse upgraded Sealed Air (SEE) to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $47, down from $59. The firm views Sealed Air as a major beneficiary of a soft-landing economic scenario in 2024 and sees the stock being priced for recession currently.Daiwa upgraded Cognex (CGNX) to Buy from Outperform with an unchanged price target of $57. An acceleration in battery investments as well as bottoming logistics and electronics spend will drive the company's growth in 2024, the analyst tells investors in a research note.Top 5 Downgrades:JPMorgan downgraded Oracle (ORCL) to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $100, down from $112. The company's cloud growth may be peaking as the Cerner transition and date center buildout ""pose new hurdles,"" the analyst tells investors in a research note.Goldman Sachs downgraded Ultrapar (UGP) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $4, down from $4.50. The analyst cites valuation for the downgrade following the stock's outperformance.Credit Suisse downgraded Ball Corp.

The company made ""relatively small changes to the 2022 update,"" with perhaps some incremental emphasis on the energy transition agenda, but in practice the hydrocarbon business will remain the main business at least until the end of this decade and the ""big change"" will come after 2030, the analyst tells investors.Credit Suisse downgraded O-I Glass (OI) to Neutral from Outperform with a price target of $22, up from $21. While destocking is playing a role, the firm does have concerns that premium substrates like glass will see continued volume pressure ahead and as new glass capacity comes online, pricing pressure will likely intensify.Story continuesTop 5 Initiations:UBS assumed coverage of Ford (F) with a Buy rating and $15 price target as part of a broader research note on U.S. Autos, Auto Parts, and Auto-Tech names. The group at large has sold off owing in part to uncertainty around the UAW-D3 labor negotiations, but the firm's analysis suggests that on average, about 4 weeks of a strike at each of the D3 companies has been priced in, and if a strike occurs, it too will pass, the analyst tells investors in a research note.TD Cowen initiated coverage of J.M. Smucker (SJM) with an Outperform rating and $158 price target. After bolstering its management team, reshaping the portfolio, and sharpening its marketing, the company has created an advantaged commercial model that exceeds food peers, says the analyst.Citi initiated coverage of SQM (SQM) with a Buy rating and $85 price target. SQM has been an underperformer in the local market and current valuations ""seem to be on the bottom,"" the analyst tells investors.UBS initiated coverage of Tesla (TSLA) with a Neutral rating and $290 price target as part of a broader research note on U.S. Autos, Auto Parts, and Auto-Tech names. Tesla is well positioned for the long-term, but the firm prefers to await a better entry point with 2024 seen as a below trend growth year, says UBS.JPMorgan initiated coverage of Cactus (WHD) with a Neutral rating and $60 price target. The firm starts the stock at Neutral as it thinks Street expectations will need to be reset slightly lower given the greater than expected pullback in the U.S. rig count.]"

This comes after difficulties during the pandemic when sales tumbled as people almost stopped eating out. The lingering effects of the pandemic continued till early 2022 before the rebound.The rebound came despite rising price pressures. Although consumers have been spending cautiously over the past year and cutting down on unnecessary expenses, sales at restaurants haven’t been hampered.Given this situation, stocks like Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. ARCO, BJ's Restaurants, Inc. BJRI, Domino's Pizza, Inc. DPZ, McDonald's Corporation MCD and Chuy's Holdings, Inc. CHUY are likely to benefit in the near term.Restaurant Sales Make Solid ReboundAccording to the National Restaurant Association (NRA), sales at restaurants and bars grew a solid 1.4% month over month in July, totaling $91.1 billion. This follows a 1.6% rise in sales in May and 0.8% in June, marking the third straight month of increase.On a year-over-year basis, restaurant sales grew 4.4% in July.The retail sector has been under tremendous pressure as sky-high inflation has been impacting sales. However, the sector is still trying to hold its ground as higher demand for goods and services is making people spend more.Restaurants are the only service sector included in the monthly retail sales report. Restaurants have also largely been responsible for saving the retail sector during these trying times as consumers have continued to shell out unhesitatingly on eating out despite high prices.In the retail sector, the Zacks Defined Restaurant Industry is presently ranked in the upper 19% among all industries, boasting a year-to-date return of 5%.Inflation has been cooling over the past year, having declined by more than half from its peak of 9.1% in June 2022. In order to combat multi-decade high inflation, the Federal Reserve has implemented a series of interest rate hikes, totaling 525 basis points since March 2022, which has taken its benchmark rate to the range of 5.25% to 5.5%.Story continuesThe Federal Reserve's monetary tightening policy has played a significant role in reducing inflation, raising expectations that the Fed might consider ending its interest rate hike campaign. Lower cost of borrowing provides consumers with increased purchasing power, which can benefit various sectors, including the restaurant industry, as it can lead to higher consumer spending.Moreover, a combination of factors is helping drive sales at restaurants. These include fundamental changes in operational methods, workforce dynamics, improvements in layout and design, and advancements in technology. Restaurant owners are increasingly prioritizing digital innovations, strategies to boost sales, and cost-effective measures to stay competitive. The pervasive influence of the Internet has made digital evolution essential for success.Moreover, prominent restaurant chains are consistently partnering with delivery services and digital platforms to generate additional revenue streams, capitalizing on the trend of customers ordering food online and having it delivered. This adaptation to changing consumer preferences and technological trends is crucial for staying competitive in the modern restaurant landscape.Our ChoicesGiven this situation, it would be ideal to invest in these five restaurant stocks.Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. operates as a franchisee of McDonald's, with its operations divided in Brazil, the North Latin America division, South Latin America and the Caribbean division.

Rowe Price Group Inc's dividend performance and assess its sustainability.What Does T. Rowe Price Group Inc Do?Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with TROW. Click here to check it out. High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' PortfolioThis Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 YearsHow to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?T.

Rowe Price Group Inc (TROW)The Sustainability Question: Payout Ratio and ProfitabilityTo assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-06-30, T. Rowe Price Group Inc's dividend payout ratio is 0.72. And this may suggest that the company's dividend may not be sustainable.T.

T. Rowe Price Group Inc's growth rank of 10 out of 10 suggests that the company's growth trajectory is good relative to its competitors.Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and T. Rowe Price Group Inc's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. T. Rowe Price Group Inc's revenue has increased by approximately 6.70% per year on average, a rate that outperforms than approximately 53.07% of global competitors.The company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, T. Rowe Price Group Inc's earnings increased by approximately -8.30% per year on average, a rate that outperforms than approximately 33.96% of global competitors.Lastly, the company's 5-year EBITDA growth rate of 7.40%, which outperforms than approximately 48.94% of global competitors.Next StepsGiven T. Rowe Price Group Inc's consistent dividend payments, robust dividend growth rate, and strong profitability, it presents a compelling case for dividend-focused investors. However, the company's high payout ratio raises questions about the sustainability of its dividends in the long term. Additionally, the company's impressive growth metrics suggest a positive outlook for future earnings, which could support ongoing dividend payments. As always, investors should conduct their own thorough research before making investment decisions.GuruFocus Premium users can screen for high-dividend yield stocks using the High Dividend Yield Screener.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

297,0e783240-a1bf-3859-93da-a51d4aff17df,UPS,2023-09-14,Column: Why an auto workers strike should have your support,LA Times,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/column-why-auto-workers-strike-211222480.html,1694639542,STORY,"['UPS', 'STLAM.MI']","[United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain attends a union rally held near a Stellantis factory. Without a new contract by Thursday night, a strike may be called against Stellantis, Ford, and General Motors. (Mike Householder / Associated Press)A few aspects of the ongoing labor-management dispute in the automobile industry are different from previous negotiations.Under the leadership of President Shawn Fain, the United Auto Workers union is negotiating simultaneously with all of the Big Three automakers — General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, maker of Chryslers and Jeeps, among other brands — instead of choosing one as the principal counterparty and letting it set the standard for the other two to follow.Then there's the underlying issue of the industry's transition from gas-fueled to electric vehicles, and its clear intention to base the factories for the latter in nonunion states, posing a real threat to union membership.We have been absolutely clear that the switch to electric engine jobs, battery production and other EV manufacturing cannot become a race to the bottom.UAW President Shawn FainBut a few things haven't changed. For one thing, economic issues — wages, health and pension benefits, job security and so on — are at the center of the contract negotiations.For another, the framing in the media and among politicians treats this contract negotiation as one in which the union is making outrageous demands and management is trying desperately to hold the line.This is the oldest of chestnuts in the depiction of labor-management relations. The New Yorker's great press critic, A.J. Liebling, observed during a New York newspaper strike in 1963 that ""the employer, in strike stories, always 'offers,' and the union 'demands.'""The stories never say that the employer ""'demands' that the union men agree to work for a two-bit raise; the union never 'offers' to accept more."" The reason, Liebling conjectured, is that ""'demand,' in English, is an arrogant word; 'offer,' a large, generous one.""The same slant has crept into coverage of the current talks, possibly because of a long-ingrained reflex among reporters and editors. ""The United Auto Workers union is bending on its pay-increase demands,"" the Wall Street Journal wrote Monday, referring to what it might otherwise have referred to as a change in the union's offer to accept a 30% pay increase over four years, down from 40%.Story continuesBy the same token, a strike is consistently described as a unilateral action threatened by the union. Here's the Detroit Free Press, reporting on the possible economic toll of $5.6 billion over 10 days in the case of ""a strike against the three Detroit automakers by 143,000 United Auto Workers members.""Read more: Column: Employers and governments aren't protecting workers from extreme heat. Unions mightYet of course there are two sides of the table in this negotiation. The strike could just as easily be described as one provoked by the Big Three auto manufacturers by their refusing to meet the UAW's, er, offer.Adam Johnson of the Lever pinpoints an especially egregious example of media slant from NBC News, which reported that a strike ""could mean car prices will soar even higher.” Never mind that the most direct impact of the contract talks will be on 146,000 workers, who could end up with better wages, benefits and job security, even if they might have to sacrifice pay while off the job. (A UAW strike fund provides $500 a week after the eighth day of a strike.).It's proper to note that the negotiation deadline of Thursday at 11:59 p.m. is not arbitrary, but marks the expiration of the current contract. The companies are in effect demanding that their workers stay on the job after expiration, and the union has — as is its right — refused the demand.This framing is a PR gift to the automakers. That's especially so because the inconvenience and economic pain from a strike will be localized, concentrated in the Midwest, where most of the 146,000 unionized workers of the Big Three live and work. Most Americans won't feel it and probably haven't paid much attention.That's different from the case of the United Parcel Service contract talks earlier this summer. Millions of Americans from coast to coast had regular contact with UPS drivers, relied on them for deliveries, had a feel for how hard they worked amid the stifling heat inside their non-air-conditioned trucks, and thus had reason to examine management's position critically. UPS as a company couldn't depend on public support for taking a hard line against the workers.The situation may be different for the auto industry. The $5.6-billion impact estimated from a 10-day strike wouldn't count for much — just over two hundredths of a percent of a national economy estimated at $23.32 trillion. Even if it lasted a whole year, that metric would work out to a drag of less than 1% on national gross domestic product.The main reason is that the auto industry and the U.S. economy have come a long way from the 1950s, when GM President Charles E. Wilson could say, ""For years I thought what was good for our country was good for General Motors, and vice versa.” (The quote is typically reduced, inaccurately to a rather more arrogant-sounding: “What’s good for GM is good for America.”)The U.S. economy has diversified beyond raw manufacturing since then, and the footprint of the auto industry itself as a component of the manufacturing sector has shrunk. Domestic production peaked in 1999 at more than 13 million vehicles, compared with 10.1 million last year.Read more: Column: A Teamsters strike against UPS could remake the union movement for the betterAs economist Joseph Brusuelas points out, since the 1950s the U.S. has seen ""the growing economic importance of the service sector, the rise of the technology industry and the financialization of the broader American economy,"" all factors in reducing the economic impact of an automotive stoppage.In the most notable auto strike of the postwar years, the 113-day strike against GM in 1945-46, some 320,000 autoworkers downed tools when the U.S. labor force comprised more than 40 million workers. Today it's 166 million. Union membership overall has struggled with a long-term decline — down from a peak of 33.4% of the workforce in 1945 to about 10% now, composed of 33% in the public sector and only about 6% in the private sector.In the 1945-46 strike, the UAW sought a raise of 30% and obtained an increase of 17.5%. That was also the strike that established the UAW strategy, crafted by its president, Walter Reuther, of maximizing pressure on a single company (in that case, GM) to establish a benchmark contract.It's true that an extended strike would have significant local and sector effects. It might push Michigan, an auto manufacturing hub, into recession, and could force layoffs of workers in the steel, glass and electronics industries.What's seldom mentioned in coverage of the contract talks — except by the UAW — is their corporate financial context. The Big Three as a group have not been this financially flush in nearly a decade. GM and Stellantis notched combined profits of $25.7 billion last year (Ford booked a nearly $2-billion loss, largely from writing down its investments in EV and autonomous vehicle firms). The three companies have reported combined profits of about $20 billion in the first half of this year, which ended June 30.The three have been generous in passing profits on to shareholders through stock buybacks. GM has repurchased more than $3 billion in shares since mid-2022 and issued dividends to shareholders of $397 million last year. Ford made buybacks of nearly $500 million and paid dividends of about $2 billion last year, and Stellantis paid out about $4.36 billion to shareholders last year and has announced a $1.6-billion buyback program for this year.Yet the idea persists that the UAW's contract stance is the governing factor in the effect of a work stoppage. An op-ed a few days ago in Politico by the editor of an automotive magazine took the UAW to task for resisting the industry's transition to EVs and therefore, he implied, exacerbating the climate crisis.Read more: Column: Julie Su would be a perfect Labor secretary. That's why Big Business hates herThe author paid lip service to the UAW's concern that the automakers are conniving to use the EV transition to undermine union membership, but the trend deserves more than lip service. The automakers have taken steps to site their EV battery plants in Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee. All three are right-to-work (that is, anti-union) states.The UAW is also painfully aware that building an EV requires only two-thirds as much labor as does a conventional gas-fueled car, largely because it has fewer moving parts to forge and assemble.But that doesn't mean it's against electric vehicles. As labor historian Erik Loomis observes, the reason the UAW is concerned about the EV transition ""is not an antipathy to electric cars. The union doesn’t care what kind of cars it makes. It wants union-made cars.""By that token, the transition isn't being hobbled by the UAW, but by auto managements that think they can create a nonunion workforce on the EV side without the union catching on.As it happens, the UAW successfully organized a plant that manufactures batteries for GM vehicles in Ohio (not a right-to-work state), and obtained a 25% raise for 1,100 workers there just a couple weeks ago. But the prospect of further flight of manufacturing facilities to southern anti-union states has motivated the union's drive for safeguards against plant closings in the North and Midwest.“We have been absolutely clear that the switch to electric engine jobs, battery production and other EV manufacturing cannot become a race to the bottom,"" Fain said in June, after the Biden administration granted Ford a generous $9.2-billion loan to build the battery plants in Kentucky and Tennessee.Fain flayed the White House for failing to attach to the loan safeguards to protect existing jobs. ""These companies are extremely profitable and will continue to make money hand over fist whether they’re selling combustion engines or EVs,"" he said. ""Yet the workers get a smaller and smaller piece of the pie.""Fain pointed out that in recent years, GM closed its Lordstown, Ohio, plant and replaced those jobs in a battery plant in Indiana ""with jobs that pay half of what workers made at the previous Lordstown plant.""We know how this story will unfold, at least in the next day or two. The companies, sitting on increased profits, will plead poverty and maintain that the UAW's demands will have vast, harmful effects on the economy and the environment. The union will press for better wages and working conditions for members who have seen their numbers, wages and benefits whittled away for years, just like those of millions of others in the American job force.Meanwhile, the managerial class and its shills in the political elite will wring their hands about how uppity the workers have become since the outset of the pandemic, and how undeserving they are of a living wage.

The downside declined 2.69% on Sep 12 to $156.57 per share. The downside followed the management’s revelation of financial impact of the labor deal with International Brotherhood of Teamsters. The five-year deal aimed at bettering pay and working conditions for the unionized workers was approved last monthPer management, due to this deal wage and benefit costs will increase at a 3.3% compound annual growth rate for the next five years. A high proportion of the cost is likely to be booked in the first year of the contract, which expires in August 2028. Following the deal, contract-related costs in the second half of the current year are anticipated to be about $500 million more than UPS’ expectation. Per UPS’ Chief Financial Officer Brian Newman, the deal will cost less than the $30 billion.To combat the lackluster demand scenario and an uptick in labor costs, UPS is looking to cut total expenses through various avenues.

A record 86% of the rank-and-file UPS Teamsters voted late last month to approve the provisional deal negotiated on their behalf by the union.“It’s not a $30 billion deal,” UPS chief executive Carol Tome told CNBC in an interview on Monday, refusing however to put a number on it herself.She went on to call the 3.3% wage increase compounded annually “a deal we’ll take any every day”. Furthermore, management retained the ability to dispatch drivers during the weekend, “which is really important for our customers.”In addition to UPS workers remaining the nation's highest paid delivery drivers, the Teamsters union also won concessions that MLK Day would be treated as a full holiday and every vehicle comes equipped with air conditioning as the nation struggles through its hottest summer on record.Whether added costs such as these from other negotiated benefits were included in its $30 billion estimate is unclear, and the union could not immediately be reached by Fortune for comment.""Our math was certainly lower,"" UPS finance chief Brian Newman told Reuters on Tuesday.Interest in driving for UPS surgesFinding out the UPS delivery man may not be as blue collar as the aughties sitcom King of Queens suggests has had many people question their life choices. Jobs site Indeed reported a 50% surge in searches for “UPS” or “United Parcel Service” within a week of the new contract.Story continuesThe deal is emblematic of Bidenomics, the White House’s economic agenda aimed at helping Main Street rather than Wall Street.Whereas Donald Trump celebrated record stock market highs and the rise of a handful of trillion-dollar corporations as proof his administration’s signature tax cuts worked, Biden is rebuilding ties with blue-collar workers in an attempt to end an era of stagnating middle-class wages.Emboldened by the “most pro-union president in U.S. history”, labor leaders like SAG-AFTRA’s Fran Drescher and the UAW’s Shawn Fain have either taken to the picket line already or plan to on behalf of their members.For both UPS and the U.S. economy, however, the stakes were high. Averted at the last moment, a Teamsters strike threatened to be the “costliest in a century”, according to a widely-cited estimate from the Anderson Economic Group.Financial publication Bloomberg called the UPS Teamsters deal a “testament to the newfound leverage of organized labor at a time when wage growth is outpacing inflation.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeWant more for your money?

Those holding the Platinum Card will be allowed six visits per year, while the Delta Reserve Card holders will get 10 annual visits.Those who book a basic economy ticket will no longer be allowed in Delta's lounges starting Jan. 1, 2024, regardless if they carry a Platinum Card or any other premium credit card.The news originally was leaked on a Portuguese-language website and was confirmed by a Delta spokesman.The news may not come as a surprise to Delta customers who have visited a Sky Club at Delta's major hubs like JFK Airport or Atlanta, where lines to access Sky Clubs have been a common occurrence. Delta is poised to open a second lounge in Terminal 4 at JFK to relieve some of the original club's overcrowding.The Platinum Card has become American Express’ most popular product, despite its high annual fee, among Millennials and Gen-Z partially due to its travel perks. Free lounge access to Delta's Sky Clubs has long been one of the biggest selling features for American Express to justify its high annual fee to card members, and it's likely to result in AmEx’s customers potentially reevaluating paying for the card each year.Without a premium AmEx card, the lounge was only available to those traveling on business or first-class flights or those willing to pay $695 a year for a membership.The news does not impact access to AmEx's 15 Centurion-branded airport lounges, which American Express owns and operates. In a statement, AmEx said they expect despite the changes “the vast majority” of card members will continue to have access to the Sky Clubs based on how much they fly. AmEx customers who spend $75,000 on their card annually — which is far higher than the median AmEx card member spends on their cards — will also get unlimited access to lounges.Along with the lounge cut backs, Delta is also making it increasingly more difficult for its customers to qualify for status on its SkyMiles program. Passengers will no longer earn status based on the number of miles they fly with Delta, but instead will earn status based exclusively on the amount of money they spend with the airline.]"

With Wall Street unsure how to digest various macroeconomic news, the utilities space brings some predictability to your portfolio.No, no one can guarantee upside, irrespective of whether we’re discussing the best utilities stocks or the merely good enough. However, the fundamental narrative is a dependable one. First, utilities benefit from natural monopolies. Basically, would-be competitors don’t even bother because of the steep barriers to entry.Second, the best utilities stocks are tied to critical services. And that means customers have to pay up, regardless of whatever’s going on with the economy. You’re not going to get this kind of dependency from, say a discretionary retailer.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTo further target the most viable opportunities, all of these ideas feature positive endorsement from Wall Street analysts. In addition, I’ll be leaning heavily into options market dynamics. Please refer to this article for a breakdown of the terminologies I’ll be using. With that, let’s dive into the best utilities stocks to buy now.NRG Energy (NRG)Close up of NRG logo on website against blurred background.Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comBased in Houston, Texas, NRG Energy (NYSE:NRG) focuses on energy generation and retail electricity. Per its public profile, NRG’s portfolio includes natural gas, coal, oil, nuclear, wind and distributed solar generation. Since the beginning of this year, shares gained a bit over 19%, closing at $38.02 in the midweek session.Looking at the NRG’s options chain, its volatility smile presents an intriguing backdrop. From the strike price of $39 where implied volatility sits at a low of 0.24, this metric rises to 0.57 at the $50 strike. Based on the perspective of the call holder, as NRG options move out of the money (OTM), the underlying IV rises. Possibly, this dynamic suggests that at least some traders anticipate a bullish price move over the long run.Story continuesTo be fair, traders appear to be hedging against significant downside risk, with IV shooting up to 1.15 at the $20 strike. However, volatility appears muted between $30 and $40, suggesting a general confidence in price stability. Finally, analysts peg NRG as a strong buy with a $44.25 average price target, indicating over 16% upside. Thus, it’s one of the best utilities stocks to consider.NiSource (NI)Image of a gas burner with a blue flameSource: ShutterstockHeadquartered in Merrillville, Indiana, NiSource (NYSE:NI) is one of the largest fully regulated utility companies in the U.S. Per its corporate profile, NiSource serves approximately 3.5 million natural gas customers and half a million electric customers across six states. Since the start of the year, NI slipped about 4%. On Wednesday, it closed at $26.31.Turning to the options market, NI’s IV sits at a low of 0.23 at the $25 strike price. Steadily moving toward the OTM prices, IV rises to 0.85 at the $40 strike. This framework may indicate rising confidence that NI may move up in price over the long run. However, traders are also cognizant of the downside risk. Specifically, IV jumps to 2.33 at the $17.50 strike.However, the deep in-the-money (ITM) lift in IV suggests a mitigation of “tail risk.” Basically, IV spiked perhaps based on traders fear of a sharp crash in NI. However, the more realistic probability points to gradual positive returns. As evidence, analysts peg NI as a unanimous strong buy. Their average price target comes in at $30.67, implying almost 17% upside, making it one of the best utilities stocks.American Electric Power (AEP)the American Electric Power logo is magnified on a websiteSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comHailing from Columbus, Ohio, American Electric Power (NASDAQ:AEP) is a major investor-owned electric utility. Based on its public profile, the company delivers electricity to more than five million customers in 11 states. It also ranks as one of the largest generators of electricity in the U.S. Since the start of the year, AEP lost more than 19% of equity value. Recently, AEP closed at $77.34.While the red ink in the open market isn’t exactly pretty, it appears that options traders sense the worst may be over. From its volatility smile, IV sits at a low of roughly 0.18 at the $80 strike price. However, it gradually scoots higher to a blistering IV of 1.28 at the $130 strike. This backdrop indicates strong enthusiasm among the smart money that AEP will make a robust comeback.Even better, while traders are also protecting against downside risk – with IV rising to 0.62 at the $45 strike – the magnitude of volatility is relatively low for deep ITM calls versus far-off OTM calls. Therefore, AEP appears to benefit from bullish leanings. Plus, analysts peg AEP a consensus strong buy with a $94.64 price target, implying nearly 24% upside.NextEra Energy (NEE)The NextEra Energy (NEE) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comA popular idea among the best utilities stocks to buy, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) specializes in renewable energy, particularly wind and solar. Per its corporate profile, NextEra represents the largest electric utility holding firm by market capitalization. However, NEE has been off to a rough outing in 2023, shedding almost 22% since the January opener. On Wednesday, NEE closed at $65.69.Although disappointing for the time being, NEE’s volatility smile suggests a powerfully robust bullish backdrop. At the strike price of $71, IV printed a low of approximately 0.19. However, as NEE calls move toward the far OTM direction, IV rises dramatically. At the strike price of $85, IV stands at 0.62. This framework may indicate long-term optimism for NextEra.On the other side, the deep ITM strike prices don’t see a wild increase in IV. For example, at $55, IV comes in at only 0.30. Thus, the smart money doesn’t anticipate much movement toward the lower price points. Encouragingly, analysts peg NEE as a strong buy with an $85 price target, implying over 29% upside potential.TransAlta (TAC)Numerous electric lines are seen at sunset.Source: Pand P Studio / Shutterstock.comBased in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, TransAlta (NYSE:TAC) is an electricity power generator and wholesale marketing company. Per its public profile, TransAlta operates wind, hydro, natural gas and coal power generation facilities. It also focuses on sustainability initiatives. Since the start of the year, TAC gained nearly 6% of equity value. On the midweek session, TAC closed at $9.41.One of the apparently riskier ideas based on options dynamics, TAC’s IV sits at a low of 0.35 at the $10 strike. From there, IV rises to 2.40 at the $17.50 strike before dipping conspicuously to 1.11 at $20. Still, the overall takeaway is that the smart money anticipates TAC could possibly more than double in value.On the other side, IV stands at 5.69 at the $2.50 strike, which indicates risk mitigation. It’s possible that traders – while recognizing the upside opportunity – also see tail risk.However, analysts peg TAC as a consensus strong buy. Moreover, their average price target stands at $13.87, implying over 47% upside potential. Thus, it still makes a case for best utilities stocks to buy now.AES (AES)A concept image of electricity flowing between two disconnected electric cables.Source: ESB Professional / Shutterstock.comDiving into the higher-risk, higher-reward ideas for best utilities stocks, AES (NYSE:AES) is a utility and power generation firm. Headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, AES owns and operates power plants, which it uses to generate and sell electricity to end users and intermediaries. While a relevant business, AEP has struggled in the market this year. Since the January opener, shares fell 38%.On Wednesday, AES closed at $17.43. Turning to its volatility smile, IV sits at a trough of 0.28 at the $18 strike. Moving in the OTM direction, IV steadily rises, almost in a linear fashion. At the apex, IV clocks in at 1.72 at the $32 strike. This suggests brewing sentiment for a bounce back among traders despite the open market’s crimson-stained sessions.Still, traders are accounting for downside risk. IV also rises rather acutely from the $16 strike moving deeper ITM. At $10, IV comes in at 1.37. Still, for the dice rollers, AES might be intriguing. First, it carries a strong buy consensus among analysts. Second, their average price target lands at $26.29, implying nearly 51% growth.Ameresco (AMRC)Ameresco building in Canada, AMRC stock.Source: JHVEPhoto / ShutterstockBased in Framingham, Massachusetts, Ameresco (NYSE:AMRC) specializes in comprehensive energy efficiency and renewable energy solutions. In addition to conducting energy audits for the purposes of infrastructural improvements, Ameresco provides myriad other services, including energy storage, microgrids and asset sustainability and maintenance. However, since the January opener, AMRC fell nearly 24%. On Wednesday, shares closed at $42.49.Though risky, traders appear to see upside potential, at least for the short to intermediate term. At the $45 strike price, IV sits at 0.46. From there, it shoots up to 1.38 at the $55 strike. Subsequently in the OTM direction, IV becomes choppy, peaking at 1.50 at $80. It then falls to 0.89 at $90. Again, traders may see short-to-intermediate-term profitability potential while waiting out the long term.As for risks, IV stands at a peak of 1.64 at the $25 strike. However, deep ITM IV doesn’t get elevated until $35. Thus, traders may anticipate relative predictability at the current open market price. For the gamblers, analysts peg AMRC as a unanimous strong buy. Their price target hits $65, implying 53% upside. If you’re seeking big gains, this could be one of the best utilities stocks.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

307,e05b9a53-7284-36db-87cf-60450e5755a9,RMD,2023-09-14,ResMed Inc.'s (NYSE:RMD) Stock Has Been Sliding But Fundamentals Look Strong: Is The Market Wrong?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/resmed-inc-nyse-rmd-stock-150100731.html,1694617260,STORY,['RMD'],"[ResMed (NYSE:RMD) has had a rough three months with its share price down 31%. However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Particularly, we will be paying attention to ResMed's  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for ResMed How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for ResMed is:22% = US$898m ÷ US$4.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.22 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of ResMed's Earnings Growth And 22% ROEAt first glance, ResMed seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 9.2%. This probably laid the ground for ResMed's moderate 18% net income growth seen over the past five years.We then compared ResMed's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 9.3% in the same 5-year period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is RMD worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether RMD is currently mispriced by the market.Is ResMed Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?With a three-year median payout ratio of 32% (implying that the company retains 68% of its profits), it seems that ResMed is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered.Moreover, ResMed is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 26%. As a result, ResMed's ROE is not expected to change by much either, which we inferred from the analyst estimate of 22% for future ROE.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with ResMed's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration and production company have returned +4.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +0.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, which Occidental falls in, has gained 3.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Occidental is expected to post earnings of $0.92 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -62.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -8.4%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.81 points to a change of -59.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.44 indicates a change of +42.8% from what Occidental is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +4.6%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Occidental is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Occidental, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.13 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -24.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $28.39 billion and $30.62 billion estimates indicate -23.5% and +7.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOccidental reported revenues of $6.73 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -37.3%. EPS of $0.68 for the same period compares with $3.16 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.8 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.95%. The EPS surprise was -2.86%.The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Occidental is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Occidental. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

COF, Credit Acceptance Corp. CACC and Navient Corp. NAVI.Industry: Consumer LoansLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2148203/3-consumer-loan-stocks-to-gain-from-a-prospering-industryThe Zacks Consumer Loans industry continues to bear the brunt of high inflation and expectations of economic slowdown. Deteriorating asset quality is a major near-term headwind too.Nonetheless, easing lending standards, which have increased the number of clients eligible for consumer loans, and digitization of operations will keep benefiting industry players. Further, steady spending on non-discretionary categories will result in decent consumer loan demand, thereby supporting revenue growth. Hence, industry players like Capital One Financial Corp., Credit Acceptance Corp. and Navient Corp. are worth keeping an eye on.About the IndustryThe Zacks Consumer Loans industry comprises companies that provide mortgages, refinancing, home equity lines of credit, credit card loans, automobile loans, education/student loans and personal loans, among others. These help the industry players generate net interest income (NII), which forms the most important part of total revenues. Prospects of the companies in this industry are highly sensitive to the nation’s overall economic condition and consumer sentiments.In addition to offering the above-mentioned products and services, many consumer loan providers are involved in other businesses like commercial lending, insurance, loan servicing and asset recovery. These support the companies in generating fee revenues. Furthermore, this helps the firms diversify revenue sources and be less dependent on the vagaries of the economy.3 Key Themes Shaping Consumer Loan Industry's ProspectsDecent Loan Demand: The persistent inflation (though cooling now) and other ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds continue to weigh heavily on consumer sentiments. Further, the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index and the Expectations Index (which shows a six-month outlook) declined in August. Nonetheless, consumer fears of an imminent recession continued to ebb.Story continuesDana Peterson, Chief Economist at The Conference Board, added “On a six-month moving average basis, plans to purchase autos and appliances continued to trend upward but plans to buy homes—more in line with rising interest rates—continued to trend downward. The dip in overall confidence notwithstanding, consumer plans to go on vacation, especially abroad, leapt upward in the month and slightly exceeded August 2022 readings, suggesting a continued penchant for spending on services.”This will thereby result in decent demand for consumer loans in the future. Thus, growth in net interest margin (NIM) and NII for consumer loan companies is likely to be stable.Easing Lending Standards: With the nation’s big credit reporting agencies removing all tax liens from consumer credit reports since 2018, several consumers' credit scores have improved. This has raised the number of consumers for the industry participants. Further, easing credit lending standards are helping consumer loan providers to meet loan demand.Worsening Credit Quality: For most of 2020, consumer loan providers built extra provisions to tide over unexpected defaults and payment delays due to the economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 mayhem. This considerably hurt their financials. But with solid economic growth and support from government stimulus packages, industry players began to release these reserves back into the income statement.The current macroeconomic headwinds may curtail consumers’ ability to pay back loans. Thus, consumer loan providers are building additional reserves to counter any adverse fallout from unexpected defaults and payment delays. This is leading to a deterioration in industry players’ asset quality and several credit quality metrics are slowly creeping up toward pre-pandemic levels.Zacks Industry Rank Reflects Bright PictureThe Zacks Consumer Loans industry is a 16-stock group within the broader Zacks Finance sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #83, which places it in the top 33% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates outperformance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to keep on your radar, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry vs. Broader MarketThe Zacks Consumer Loans industry has outperformed both the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and its own sector over the past three years.The stocks in this industry have collectively gained 35.1% over this period while the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and Zacks Finance sector have rallied 33.2% and 28.6%, respectively.Industry's ValuationOne might get a good sense of the industry’s relative valuation by looking at its price-to-tangible book ratio (P/TBV), commonly used for valuing consumer loan stocks because of significant variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/TBV of 0.88X, below the median level of 1.15X, over the past five years. This compares with the highest level of 1.56X and the lowest level of 0.48X over this period. The industry is trading at a considerable discount when compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/TBV ratio for the S&amp;P 500 is 10.23X and the median level is 10.07X.As finance stocks typically have a lower P/TBV, comparing consumer loan providers with the S&amp;P 500 may not make sense to many investors. But a comparison of the group’s P/TBV ratio with that of its broader sector ensures that the group is trading at a decent discount. The Zacks Finance sector’s trailing 12-month P/TBV of 4.32X for the same period is way above the Zacks Consumer Loan industry’s ratio.3 Consumer Loan Stocks on the RadarCapital One: Headquartered in McLean, VA, the company is primarily focused on consumer and commercial lending as well as deposit origination. Strength in credit card and online banking operations, decent loan growth, robust balance sheet position and strategic inorganic expansion initiatives will support Capital One’s financials.With the Federal Reserve likely to keep interest rates high in the near term to control inflation, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s NII and NIM are expected to witness improvements, though rising funding costs will weigh on both. Revenue prospects look encouraging on the back of the company’s solid credit card and online banking businesses as well as decent loan demand. Strong growth opportunities in card loans and purchase volumes are expected despite an intensely competitive environment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for 2023 and 2024 has remained unchanged over the past seven days. Also, COF’s shares have risen 5.2% over the past six months.Credit Acceptance: Headquartered in Southfield, MI, CACC offers financing programs and related products and services to automobile dealers across the United States, enabling them to sell vehicles to consumers irrespective of their credit history. Further, it is engaged in the business of reinsuring coverage under vehicle service contracts sold to consumers by dealers on vehicles financed by the company.Revenue growth remains a major positive for Credit Acceptance, witnessing a six-year (2016-2022) CAGR of 11.2%. Growth is primarily attributable to a steady rise in finance charges, which is also the main revenue component. While finance charges are likely to witness headwinds from macroeconomic factors in the near term, the same will rebound once the operating backdrop improves. A decent rise in dealer enrolments and active dealers is also expected to support the company’s top-line growth.Over the past week, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has remained unchanged for both 2023 and 2024. Shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have rallied 22.9% over the past six months. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Navient: This Zacks Rank #3 stock is a leading provider of education loan management and business processing solutions. Headquartered in Wilmington, DE, the company is one of the leading servicers to the U.S. Department of Education under its Direct Student Loan Program.NAVI is growing its in-school originations. However, with the increase in overall interest rates, the extension of the federal loan payment holiday, loan forgiveness proposals and programs are anticipated to create uncertainty and limit refinance loan origination volume in the near term. Yet, over the long term, demand for refinancing loans should rebound once direct federal loan repayments begin.Focus on introducing new products leveraged with technology and cost control efforts will continue supporting Navient in the quarters ahead. Additionally, the company focuses on delivering operating efficiency and improving customer experience by building technology-enabled solutions.Navient’s shares have rallied 7.6% over the past six months. Over the past week, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has remained unchanged for both 2023 and 2024.See Stocks Free &gt;&gt;Join us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ZacksInvestmentResearch/Zacks Investment Research is under common control with affiliated entities (including a broker-dealer and an investment adviser), which may engage in transactions involving the foregoing securities for the clients of such affiliates.Media ContactZacks Investment Research800-767-3771 ext. 9339support@zacks.comhttps://www.zacks.comPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

As investors look forward to this upcoming payment, the spotlight also shines on the company's dividend history, yield, and growth rates. Using the data from GuruFocus, let's deep dive into Coca-Cola Co's dividend performance and assess its sustainability.What Does Coca-Cola Co Do?Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with KO. Click here to check it out. High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' PortfolioThis Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 YearsHow to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?Founded in 1886, Atlanta-headquartered Coca-Cola is the world's largest nonalcoholic beverage company, with a strong portfolio of 200 brands covering key categories including carbonated soft drinks, water, sports, energy, juice, and coffee. Together with bottlers and distribution partners, the company sells finished beverage products bearing Coca-Cola and licensed brands through retailers and food-service locations in more than 200 countries and regions globally. Coca-Cola generates around two thirds of its total revenues overseas, with a significant portion from emerging economies in Latin America and Asia.Deep Dive into Coca-Cola Co's Dividend Performance and SustainabilityA Glimpse at Coca-Cola Co's Dividend HistoryCoca-Cola Co has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 1963. Dividends are currently distributed on a quarterly basis. Coca-Cola Co has increased its dividend each year since 1963. The stock is thus listed as a dividend king, an honor that is given to companies that have increased their dividend each year for at least the past 60 years.Below is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share for tracking historical trends.Deep Dive into Coca-Cola Co's Dividend Performance and SustainabilityBreaking Down Coca-Cola Co's Dividend Yield and GrowthAs of today, Coca-Cola Co currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.09% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 3.16%. This suggests an expectation of increased dividend payments over the next 12 months.Story continuesOver the past three years, Coca-Cola Co's annual dividend growth rate was 3.20%. Extended to a five-year horizon, this rate stayed the same. And over the past decade, Coca-Cola Co's annual dividends per share growth rate stands at 5.40%.Based on Coca-Cola Co's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost of Coca-Cola Co stock as of today is approximately 3.62%.Deep Dive into Coca-Cola Co's Dividend Performance and SustainabilityThe Sustainability Question: Payout Ratio and ProfitabilityTo assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-06-30, Coca-Cola Co's dividend payout ratio is 0.75. This may suggest that the company's dividend may not be sustainable.Coca-Cola Co's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks Coca-Cola Co's profitability 8 out of 10 as of 2023-06-30, suggesting good profitability prospects. The company has reported positive net income for each of year over the past decade, further solidifying its high profitability.Growth Metrics: The Future OutlookTo ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. Coca-Cola Co's growth rank of 8 out of 10 suggests that the company's growth trajectory is good relative to its competitors.Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and Coca-Cola Co's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. Coca-Cola Co's revenue has increased by approximately 4.60% per year on average, a rate that underperforms than approximately 54.17% of global competitors.The company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, Coca-Cola Co's earnings increased by approximately 1.90% per year on average, a rate that underperforms than approximately 60.23% of global competitors.Lastly, the company's 5-year EBITDA growth rate of 37.60%, which underperforms than approximately 7.69% of global competitors.Next StepsIn conclusion, while Coca-Cola Co's dividend payments and growth rate are impressive, the sustainability of these dividends is a concern due to the high payout ratio. However, the company's strong profitability and growth metrics suggest a positive outlook. Investors should consider these factors while making informed decisions about investing in Coca-Cola Co.GuruFocus Premium users can screen for high-dividend yield stocks using the High Dividend Yield Screener.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance this year, and go directly to read 5 Worst Performing Dividend Stocks YTD. In 2023, dividend-paying stocks have not performed as well as other types of investments because many investors are showing a stronger preference for technology stocks. However, investment patterns change over time due to shifts in market sentiment and various economic factors. The US economy is uncertain this year due to unpredictable inflation. The latest CPI report showed that inflation increased in August from the same period last year, reversing the recent trend of slowing inflation. Compared to a year ago, it went up by 4.3%, which is in line with expectations and represents the smallest increase in almost two years.Because of the continuing economic uncertainty, the growth of dividends in the US slowed down during the second quarter of 2023. This deceleration in the country’s dividend growth resulted in a total of $148 billion worth of payouts, up modestly by 4.6% year-on-year when considering the core performance after accounting for lower one-time special dividends, according to the latest report by Janus Henderson. In general, dividend stocks haven’t performed that well this year. The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, gained 2.33% this year so far, underperforming the tech-heavy NASDAQ, which delivered a 33.06% return to shareholders since the start of 2023.Also read: 15 Worst Performing Growth Stocks in 2023As the ongoing inflationary period continues to extend its course, dividend stocks can be a reassuring choice for concerned investors. Historical analysis also shows that dividend stocks have given a solid performance during periods of economic downturns. This is because dividend stocks are a defensive investment choice these equities tend to raise their dividend payments over time, which can help offset the effects of rising prices. In one of our previous articles, we cited Fidelity Investments’ data and mentioned that dividends accounted for more than half of the market's returns in periods of high inflation. The report also noted that in the 1940s, 1960s, and 1970s, dividends made up 67%, 44%, and 73% of market returns, respectively. In those decades, when inflation averaged over 5%, total returns were below 10%.Story continuesAs mentioned above, tech stocks have dominated the market this year, surpassing dividend-paying companies. Even some of the biggest dividend companies such as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) have also reported negative returns in 2023 so far. In this view, we will discuss some of the worst performing dividend stocks this year.15 Worst Performing Dividend Stocks YTDPhoto by Jp Valery on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we examined the worst-performing stocks of 2023 and selected dividend-paying stocks that have experienced substantial declines in their share prices so far this year.

That is because the Dec 15, 2023 $60.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Mohawk shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Mohawk is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Textile - Home Furnishing industry that ranks in the Top 12% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimate for the current quarter, while five have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $2.95 per share to $2.69 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Mohawk right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

331,344f02e0-b9be-34e3-a505-c78831fc9bfa,DVA,2023-09-14,OPKO Health (OPK) Ties Up for Oral Peptide Tablet Formulations,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/opko-health-opk-ties-oral-171800834.html,1694625480,STORY,"['OPK', 'DVA', 'HQY', 'ENTX']","[OPKO Health, Inc.’s OPK subsidiary, OPKO Biologics, Inc., recently entered into a Research Collaboration Agreement with Entera Bio Ltd. ENTX. Under the terms of the agreement, OPKO Health will supply its proprietary long-acting Glucagon-Like Peptide-2 (GLP-2) peptide and certain Oxyntomodulin (OXM) analogs for the development of oral tablet formulations using Entera’s proprietary oral delivery technology.Per the agreement terms, both companies will be responsible for specific phases of development of the two oral peptides to the point of demonstrated in vivo feasibility. However, further details of the agreement were not available.The latest partnership is expected to significantly strengthen OPKO Health’s business on a global scale.Rationale Behind the CollaborationAdministering peptides orally is challenging due to their rapid degradation in the gastrointestinal tract and negligible permeability. However, treatment with GLP-2 analogs has been shown to improve the absorption of nutrients in patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS) and reduce parenteral support requirements. In SBS patients, oral drug delivery is more challenging because the site of absorption, the intestine, is short and less functional.OPKO Health has developed several proprietary, modified OXM analogs as potential candidates for treating obesity, including an injectable pegylated peptide. This demonstrated significant reductions in weight loss and decreased plasma triglyceride levels in a 420-patient phase 2B study.OPKO Health’s management believes that the collaboration will likely fit with its strategy to expand its pipeline to develop orally administered tablet presentations of long-acting peptides. Management also feels that working with Entera and its unique oral delivery platform will complement its previous experience in the development of NGENLA and enhance the diversity and strength of its development portfolio.Entera’s management feels that the partnership with OPKO Health is significant as it enables the company to expand its oral delivery technology across additional high-value peptides.Story continuesIndustry ProspectsPer a report by Allied Market Research, the global peptide therapeutics market was valued at $33.3 billion in 2021 and is anticipated to reach $64.3 billion by 2031 at a CAGR of 6.8%. Factors like the increase in number of elderly people, an increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases and growing patient awareness about peptide therapeutics advancements are likely to drive the market.Given the market potential, the latest association is expected to significantly strengthen OPKO Health’s business.Notable DevelopmentsLast month, OPKO Health reported its second-quarter 2023 results, wherein it registered robust results from the Pharmaceuticals segment, with solid sales of RAYALDEE. Management also confirmed that NGENLA (somatrogon) had been approved in 44 markets, including the United States, Japan, EU Member States, Canada and Australia. Also, its continued sales by Pfizer in more than 18 countries, with expectations to launch in all priority international markets by the year-end, looks promising.In June, OPKO Health, along with Pfizer, confirmed that the FDA had approved NGENLA (somatrogon-ghla), a once-weekly human growth hormone analog indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients aged three years and older having growth failure due to inadequate secretion of endogenous growth hormone.Price PerformanceShares of the company have lost 19.6% in the past year compared with the industry’s 2.9% decline.

The optimism led by a solid second-quarter 2023 performance and its continued spending on research and development (R&amp;D) are expected to contribute further. However, headwinds due to data security threats and overdependence on diagnostic tests persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 11.5% compared with a 4.7% decline of the industry. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 13.3% growth in the said time frame.The renowned rapid diagnostic testing solutions provider has a market capitalization of $4.92 billion. QuidelOrtho projects 9.4% growth for 2024 and expects to maintain its strong performance. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 66.7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Product Portfolio: We are upbeat about QuidelOrtho’s current product clientele. It sells its products directly to end users and distributors for professional use in physician offices and hospitals, among others, as well as for individual, non-professional, over-the-counter use. QuidelOrtho’s diagnostic testing solutions include the Sofia and Sofia 2 Analyzers, QuickVue, and InflammaDry and AdenoPlus products.On the second quarter of 2023 earnings call in August, QuidelOrtho’s management confirmed that Sofia’s non COVID-19 pull-through continued to increase.Continued Spend on R&amp;D: QuidelOrtho’s long-term growth and profitability will depend, in part, on its ability to retain and grow its current customers and attract new customers by developing and delivering new and improved products and services that meet customers’ needs and expectations. As a result, QuidelOrtho’s management expects to continue to maintain its emphasis on R&amp;D investments for longer-term growth, including its next-generation platforms and assays, as well as additional assays to be launched on its current platforms.Story continuesStrong Q2 Results: QuidelOrtho’s robust second-quarter 2023 results buoy optimism. The company recorded an uptick in its overall top line and Non-Respiratory revenues. Robust revenues from its Labs segment and Other region were also recorded. The company also saw solid revenues from its Instrument revenue category. QuidelOrtho also witnessed a growth in its integrated installed base and automation during the quarter.DownsidesData Security Threats: QuidelOrtho utilizes complex information technology systems to transmit and store information, including proprietary information, to support its business and process. In future, these systems may prove inadequate to its business needs and necessary upgrades may not operate as designed, resulting in high costs or disruptions in portions of the company’s business.Overdependence on Diagnostic Tests: A significant percentage of QuidelOrtho’s revenues comes from the sale of COVID-19 and influenza tests and these are expected to remain a significant portion of the company’s total revenues for at least in the near future. As a result, if sales or revenues of COVID-19 or influenza tests fall for any reason, the company’s operating results will be affected.Estimate TrendQuidelOrtho is witnessing a negative estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 4.8% south to $5.01.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $650.1 million, suggesting a 17.1% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are DaVita Inc.

To skip our detailed analysis of current stock market news, you can go directly to see the 5 Good Stocks To Invest In Right Now.The year 2023 has been quite eventful so far, with the rise of generative artificial intelligence, the banking crisis, regulatory crackdowns on crypto, rising interest rates, and much more. Despite all this, businesses and investors alike are continuing to hold on in the hope of turning the tide in their favor. Some professionals believe that such hopes are not ill-founded, as there may very well be significant potential for the market to reach new highs in the near future. For example, Katie Stockton, the founder and managing partner for Fairlead Strategies, joined CNBC's 'Halftime Report' on September 12 to highlight how major stock indices can still expect to see some upside momentum at this point in time. Here are some of her comments about the market:""I would say it's still a cyclical bull trend. We obviously have a corrective phase underway that's impacted our intermediate term momentum gauges, but not the long-term ones. So we still have long-term upside momentum behind the major indices, and that's promising.""At the same time, other professionals have been weighing in on the possibility of further Fed rate hikes. David Bahnsen, the chief investment officer at Bahnsen Group, joined CNBC's 'The Exchange' on September 12 to comment on this:""I think the Fed is following markets - markets are not following the Fed, and I think it is a fait accompli that they're going to pause again at the end of September.""The Election Year Holds Back The FedBahnsen added that he believes the Fed will refrain from raising rates because the US is heading into an election year. He drew a comparison between this election year and the one in 2016 when the Fed didn't ""touch rates"" despite the fact that there were four rate hikes on the schedule. According to Bahnsen, the Fed has been following a policy of staying separate from the country's politics since 1994, which is why he believes it is unlikely that we will see another rate hike during this election year.Story continuesIn the midst of these market trends, among talks of a new tech bull market also being on the way, consumers and investors alike have been adopting more optimistic viewpoints toward the market and what they can gain from it. As such, many investors are looking for the best stocks to invest in for the long term alongside good stocks to invest in right now for the short term.

Intuitive Surgical, Inc. manufactures and markets the da Vinci Surgical System, a robotic system used for minimally invasive procedures. Shares increased after Intuitive reported strong first quarter financial results highlighted by a 26% increase in procedures and raised guidance for 2023. These results, which came in well above Street estimates, were driven by strength in general surgery procedures in the U.S. and non-urology procedures outside the U.S. We continue to believe Intuitive has a large opportunity to expand the use of robotic surgery over time.”12.

(NYSE:SHOP) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Shopify Inc. (NYSE:SHOP): Shopify shares were a top contributor in the quarter following strong 1Q results and the announced divestiture of its logistics business. Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) grew 15% year over year as e-commerce sales broadly rebounded and Shopify continued to take market share. Revenue grew 25% driven by increased merchant adoption of multiple products, especially Shop Pay. The company generated $86 million of free cash flow, up from a $46 million loss last year, and announced expectations to be free cash flow positive for each quarter for the rest of the year. The company had previously announced several cost savings plans, which are driving margin and free cash flow improvement, and now plans to divest its capital-intensive logistics arm. Faster growing revenue, lower operating expenses, and a less capital-intensive future were all cheered on by the market.Last year, 10% of US retail e-commerce sales flowed through SHOP, second only to Amazon, and the company is still enjoying significant tailwinds as retail merchants of all sizes adopt SHOP’s software tools to display, manage and sell their products across a dozen different sales channels. We believe that the overall growth of e-commerce, combined with the development of new products and services, such as its digital wallet Shop Pay, should continue to drive revenue growth of more than 20% per year over the next several years, accompanied by re-acceleration of operating margin growth and FCF generation.”10.

The company offers a comprehensive suite of services, including an online marketplace for buyers and sellers, payment solutions through Mercado Pago, merchant and buyer financing through Mercado Credito, shipping services through Mercado Envios, and asset management through Mercado Fondo, among other services. We believe the e-commerce market within Latin America remains underpenetrated, creating a favorable backdrop for MercadoLibre, as they have been growing and investing heavily to expand its first mover advantage. Moreover, the company’s growing fintech payments business. Mercado Pago. is well-positioned to potentially emerge as a leader in Latin America, as well as an emerging online advertising presence which offers attractive margin expansion potential, in our view. While the company posted strong quarterly results, shares fell on fears that their exposure to Argentina, which saw its currency devalued, would impact company revenues in the near-term.”8. Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 78Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) had 78 hedge funds long its stock in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $2.4 billion.A Buy rating was maintained on shares of Datadog, Inc.

The company operates an observability and security platform for cloud applications in North America and internationally.RiverPark Advisors said the following about Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:“Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG): DDOG was a top detractor in the quarter. The company reported strong 4Q results including 44% revenue growth and 30% earnings growth but gave cautious revenue guidance for 2023. Macroeconomic headwinds have caused clients to slow the transition of workloads to the cloud and instead to optimize current capacity. Despite this temporary slowdown, DDOG still expects revenue to grow nearly 25% in 2023.As businesses have transitioned to cloud software infrastructure, much of which is in isolated data silos, it has become increasingly difficult for data engineers to monitor and analyze system performance. Datadog provides a SaaS software platform to monitor and analyze the system performance of software applications and IT infrastructure by giving users a single page view to observe their company’s technology stack. The company has quickly grown its revenue from $100 million in 2017 to $1.7 billion in 2022 and, we believe, should continue to grow revenue at more than 20% annually as it penetrates its $40 billion and fast-growing market. Less than 10% of software applications are currently monitored. The company’s dollar-based net retention rate has been 130%+ as existing customers continue to use an increasing number of products and the company continues to add new features. As of 4Q22, 81% of customers used 2+ products, while only 18% of customers used 6+ products (up from less than 1% two years ago). As an extremely capex light software business, DDOG already has significant free-cash-flow ($350m in 2022) and free-cash-flow margins (21% in 2022).”Like The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), and Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) is a highly popular stock today.7. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a communication services company based in Burbank, California. The company operates entertainment businesses worldwide through its Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution, and Disney Parks, Experiences, and Products segments.A total of 92 hedge funds were long The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $2.2 billion.Rosenblatt's Barton Crockett reiterated a Buy rating and a $104 price target on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) shares on September 12.RiverPark Advisors made the following statements about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:“The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS): DIS was a top detractor in the quarter following mixed FY2Q results. Revenue of $22 billion was up 13% year over year, although EPS, at $0.93, was down 14% year over year. Disney Plus, part of the company’s direct-to-consumer business (DTC), had better subscriber numbers than anticipated despite a price increase, although losses at the DTC business as a whole are growing. The linear TV business also continues to suffer secular headwinds with – 10% revenue growth, and the company faced inflationary cost pressures at its theme parks.DIS is nevertheless blessed with a deep library of unique content that includes both live sports (providing large, non-time shifted audiences) and incomparable brands including Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm, as well as the ABC network. The company also has a wealth of upcoming new content, with a plan to release over 100 original titles per year on a $30 billion annual content production budget. Now that the disruption in its theme park, cruise and theatrical businesses has come to an end, we believe that Disney is among the best-positioned media companies in the new landscape to combine multi-channel and DTC distribution.We think the return of long-time CEO Bob Iger will lead to higher and more consistent profitability at the theme parks, better value realization in the linear assets, and consolidation of the company’s DTC assets leading to higher profitability sooner. We therefore expect DIS to grow its free cash flow significantly over the next 3-4 years, from its depressed $1 billion last year, returning to and exceeding its previous $10 billion peak in 2018.”6. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 109Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust was the largest shareholder in Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) at the end of the second quarter, holding 25.1 million shares in the company.Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) is a financial company based in Omaha, Nebraska. It engages in the insurance, freight rail transportation, and utility businesses worldwide.In the second quarter, 109 hedge funds were long Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B). Their total stake value was $15.5 billion.A Buy rating and a $414 price target were maintained on shares of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $21.61 billion, up 4.83% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $6.38 per share and revenue of $85.57 billion, which would represent changes of +8.14% and +4.34%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Procter &amp; Gamble.

The move boosts the company’s liquidity position by $125 million and enhances flexibility to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.The new facility, maturing on Feb 1, 2028, includes an extension option of a year. Also, the facility bears an interest rate that varies according to a pricing grid ranging from 2.10-2.60% plus a secured overnight financing rate (SOFR), which is based on a company debt yield covenant. The closing interest rate remains unchanged from the SOFR plus 2.35% rate for the existing credit facility.Macerich’s liquidity now aggregates $660 million, which includes $498 million of availability on its newly expanded credit facility.Per Scott Kingsmore, senior executive vice president and CFO of Macerich, “We are extremely pleased to secure this new credit facility, especially in today’s turbulent banking market. This new facility provides an important $125 million boost to our liquidity with a fresh 4 1/2 years of extended term.”This retail real estate investment trust’s (REIT) latest move comes after it announced record leasing volumes of 2.4 million square feet of space signed from the beginning of 2023 through Aug 21. This represented a 34% increase in square footage signed from the prior-year period.Moreover, it is quite evident that solid retail demand has boosted occupancy levels at the company’s shopping centers post the pandemic. As of the end of the second quarter of 2023, portfolio-wide occupancy was 92.6%, up 410 basis points compared with the pandemic-induced occupancy low of 88.5% as of Mar 31, 2021.Further, MAC’s encouraging leasing pipeline of new store openings is expected to yield around $66 million of incremental rent in aggregate over 2023, 2024 and 2025. The company also anticipates approving new deals and signing new leases in the upcoming period, especially with those in large formats, aiming to boost traffic and sales at its Regional Town Centers.Hence, with a portfolio of premium assets in the vibrant markets of the United States, robust retail demand and enhanced financial flexibility, Macerich seems well-poised to ride the growth curve.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 5.4% in the quarter-to-date period against the industry’s decline of 1.7%.Nonetheless, higher e-commerce adoption and limited consumers’ willingness to spend amid macroeconomic uncertainty and a high-interest rate environment remain key concerns for the company.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are Phillips Edison &amp; Company PECO, Essential Properties Realty Trust EPRT and Tanger Factory Outlet Centers SKT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

342,27453400-0493-3882-a298-f430956cfbc0,DHI,2023-09-14,Can D.R. Horton (DHI) Survive Rising Rate and Inflation?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/d-r-horton-dhi-survive-172200640.html,1694625720,STORY,"['DHI', 'KBH']","[The current sales activity in the U.S. homebuilding industry is being affected by two primary factors: a lack of available inventory and elevated mortgage rates. Prospective homebuyers are encountering a limited supply of pre-owned homes on the market, prompting them to shift their focus toward builders who have ramped up their construction efforts to meet this growing demand. Many homebuilding stocks have been riding high on this tailwind despite the continuous challenges.Among the industry bellwethers, D.R. Horton, Inc. DHI, an Arlington, TX-based prominent homebuilder, has been benefiting from the above-mentioned tailwind, along with its solid acquisition strategies, increased homebuilding lots, decreasing cycle times and diverse product offerings across multiple brands and price points.Shares of DHI have gained 66.2% over the past year compared with the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry’s 76.7% rise. Although DHI shares have underperformed the industry over the said time, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has a long-term earnings growth rate of 18.5%, which highlights its inherent strength.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Zacks Consensus Estimate has witnessed an uptrend over the past 30 days as analysts raised their estimates. Over the said time frame, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2023 and 2024 earnings of $13.24 per share and $14.04 per share has increased 18.1% and 19%, respectively.Yet, high mortgage rates and lingering inflationary pressures remain headwinds.Let’s Take a Look at the Growth Drivers.Acquisitions &amp; Prudent Land Investment: Acquisitions have played a pivotal role in D.R. Horton's expansion strategy. The company is rapidly acquiring homebuilding firms situated in sought-after markets. In June 2023, D.R. Horton completed the acquisition of Truland Homes' homebuilding operations, operating in Baldwin County, Alabama, and Northwest Florida, for an approximate cash amount of $100 million. This acquisition includes nearly 155 homes in inventory, 620 lots, and a sales order backlog of 55 homes, in addition to approximately 660 more lots through land purchase agreements.During the fiscal third quarter of 2023, the company's investments in lots, land, and development totaled $2.2 billion, marking a 25% year-over-year increase and a 27% sequential increase. D.R. Horton's substantial inventory of land, plots, and homes positions it strongly to meet future demand, thus driving sales and home closings in the upcoming quarters.With 555,100 lots (25% were owned and 75% controlled through purchase contracts) in inventory at the end of third-quarter fiscal 2023, D.R. Horton is well-poised for the future. With sequentially higher homebuilding lots, the company is actively managing lot and land pipelines and investments in lots, land and development to meet needs during this transition in the housing market.Focus on Higher Returns: The company strategically manages the pricing, incentives and sales pace across its markets to optimize the returns on inventory investments. DHI’s ROE was 24.3% for the trailing 12-month period that ended Jun 30, 2023, and homebuilding ROI was 31.8% for the same period.Affordable Homes: The company’s strategic shift toward more entry-level affordable homes has been paying off, with the segment experiencing strong demand and limited supply. First-time homebuyers represented 56% of its closings in third-quarter fiscal 2023.Value Stock: Given the uncertainty, it will be wise for investors to dedicate their funds to value stocks. Value investing has always been a common strategy. D.R. Horton currently carries a Value Score of A. Its forward 12-month P/E ratio is 8.2 versus industry’s 8.6.Story continuesHeadwindsAccelerating Rates: As of Sep 7, 2023, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hovered above 7% for the fourth consecutive week. The robust economy continues to uplift consumer confidence. However, the strengthening economic indicators have led to an increase in mortgage rates, placing added strain on prospective homebuyers. As of Sep 7, 2023, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stands at an average of 7.12%, showing a slight dip from the previous week when it was at 7.18%. In comparison, one year ago, on the same date, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.89%, the latest Freddie Mac mortgage survey shows.Inflationary Pressure: Per the media reports, a noteworthy rise in energy prices is expected to push inflation higher in August 2023. Inflation has consistently exceeded the Federal Reserve's 2% target, and when combined with upward pressure in the oil market and a tight labor market, it indicates that the Federal Reserve is likely to proceed with further interest rate hikes later in the year.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are:Beazer Homes USA BZH designs, builds and sells single-family homes.

353,d65be384-f516-3d3d-acd3-7fdd35375c4d,AFL,2023-09-14,Are You Looking for a High-Growth Dividend Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-high-growth-dividend-stock-154509793.html,1694619909,STORY,['AFL'],"[Whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities, all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Aflac in FocusBased in Columbus, Aflac (AFL) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 6.02%. The insurer is paying out a dividend of $0.42 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.2% compared to the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield of 2.66% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.65%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.68 is up 5% from last year. In the past five-year period, Aflac has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 12.36%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Aflac's current payout ratio is 30%, meaning it paid out 30% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.AFL is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $5.98 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 12.20%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Story continuesHigh-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that AFL is not only an attractive dividend play, but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.American Water Works in FocusHeadquartered in Camden, American Water Works (AWK) is a Utilities stock that has seen a price change of -9.75% so far this year. The water utility is paying out a dividend of $0.71 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.06% compared to the Utility - Water Supply industry's yield of 2.12% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.65%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $2.83 is up 10.2% from last year. In the past five-year period, American Water Works has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 9.52%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. American Water Works's current payout ratio is 59%. This means it paid out 59% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, AWK expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $4.80 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 6.43%.Bottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that AWK is not only an attractive dividend play, but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

356,c96fffb5-bec3-35e7-b0b8-7c23f7ab1399,FCX,2023-09-14,The Returns On Capital At Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) Don't Inspire Confidence,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-capital-freeport-mcmoran-nyse-120041552.html,1694692841,STORY,['FCX'],"[To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Freeport-McMoRan is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.12 = US$5.5b ÷ (US$51b - US$4.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).Thus, Freeport-McMoRan has an ROCE of 12%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Metals and Mining industry average of 10%. See our latest analysis for Freeport-McMoRan roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Freeport-McMoRan compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is Freeport-McMoRan's ROCE Trending?When we looked at the ROCE trend at Freeport-McMoRan, we didn't gain much confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 17% over the last five years. Meanwhile, the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months, so this could reflect longer term investments. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.Story continuesIn Conclusion...Bringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Freeport-McMoRan's reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. Yet to long term shareholders the stock has gifted them an incredible 195% return in the last five years, so the market appears to be rosy about its future. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.On a final note, we've found   1 warning sign for Freeport-McMoRan  that we think you should be aware of.While Freeport-McMoRan isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

After a new round of meetings last month, Le Maire said Unilever, Nestle and PepsiCo were among companies not toeing the line on prices.Since Monday, Carrefour has marked 26 products in its stores in France with labels reading, ""This product has seen its volume or weight fall and the effective price by the supplier rise.""For example, Carrefour said a bottle of sugar-free peach-flavoured Lipton Ice Tea, produced by PepsiCo, shrank to 1.25 litres (0.33 gallon) from 1.5 litres, resulting in a 40% effective increase in the price per litre.Guigoz infant formula produced by Nestle went from 900 grams (31.75 oz) to 830 grams, while Unilever's Viennetta ice-cream cake shrank to 320 grams from 350 grams.Lindt's ""chocolat au lait extra fin"" was one of three of the Swiss chocolatier's products named in the list.Story continues""Lindt &amp; Sprüngli increased its prices group wide on average by 9.3% in line with local cost structures,"" a company spokesperson told Reuters.

(Photo: JIm Allen/FreightWaves)Inflation and higher labor costs are two concerns for Union Pacific in the second half of this year, but company executives said improved service offerings, such as a reduction in transit time for the Falcon Premium intermodal service, will help it and other railroads win volumes back from trucks.“We need to bring new business in. … We need to cover what inflation gave us and the extra cost that we have, both from an employee base and structurally,” UP CEO Jim Vena said at Morgan Stanley’s investor conference Tuesday. “I’m comfortable that we have the mechanisms in place [to get there].”Vena, an industry veteran who has held leadership positions at both UP and CN, has been UP’s CEO for about a month, replacing Lance Fritz.One way to bring in additional business is through expanded service offerings. UP (NYSE: UNP), along with Canadian railway CN (NYSE: CNI), announced Tuesday at the conference that their Eagle and Falcon Premium intermodal services have been able to shave off a day in transit time.Grupo Mexico’s Ferromex is also a partner in the Falcon Premium service, which provides customers shipping goods such as automotive parts, food, freight all kinds, home appliances and temperature-controlled products with access to Canada, Mexico and the U.S. The three railways have interchange points in Mexico, Chicago, major West Coast cities and such U.S. cities east of the Mississippi River as Detroit and Louisville, Kentucky.In announcing the reduction in transit time, UP noted that the services run seven days a week between GMXT terminals in Mexico — Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, and Silao, Guanajuato — and Texas at UP’s interchange with GMXT at Eagle Pass and UP’s Port Laredo intermodal terminal.Customers can also use the UP from Texas to Chicago, where shipments then connect to CN’s line to connect to all points in Canada.“To take 24 hours on a service that runs from Monterrey, Mexico, up to Chicago is a big deal. It really is — people that want speed, people that want reliability,” Vena said.Story continues“So, we want to leverage that network,” he continued. “[But] it’s more than just that. It’s not the one lane. … Do you want to go to Seattle? Do you want to go to Portland? Do you want to go to the Bay Area? Do you want to go to California?”Shaving off one day of transit time for the Falcon Premium intermodal service could bode well for UP and CN’s customers, executives said. This is especially so as UP is facing a number of third-quarter headwinds that make year-over-year comparisons “tough,” according to UP CFO Jennifer Hamann.She said those headwinds include Inflationary pressures, new sick leave agreements that are expected to cost around $50 million in the back half of 2023, the implementation of new work-rest agreements and higher purchased services and fuel costs.“Normally, you’d see some seasonal growth from the second quarter to the third quarter, and that just hasn’t materialized here in 2023. Our volumes are flattish going from Q2 to Q3, and if you look on a year-over-year basis, we’re down about 3%, so continued softness in the transportation demand side of the equation,” Hamann said.But despite those headwinds, car velocity — a key metric that reflects asset utilization — is higher, reaching as high as 200 miles per day, according to Vena.Vena also discussed his views on operating ratio, a metric that investors sometimes use to gauge the financial health of a company. OR is a term that the freight rail industry has avoided mentioning lately because of its association with precision scheduled railroading (PSR), which itself has garnered negative connotations in the broader public. PSR was a tool that the Class I railroads used to streamline operations and cut costs, but some have argued that PSR was a way to reduce head count levels in order to cut costs.But Vena said OR improvements merely reflect the initiatives that a railroad has undertaken successfully to improve service and make operations more efficient.“I’m good talking about OR. That’s a good metric that just sort of tells you where the heck your railroad is. I think we can be the best margin railroad in North America. My story hasn’t changed from the last time I was here. Nothing changed and we delivered good OR before and we’re going to get there [again],” Vena said.UP has gotten flak recently from the rail unions and Federal Railroad Administration Administrator Amit Bose over recent furloughs of 94 craft employees. Bose also raised concerns last week over whether the furloughs were having any impact on UP’s safety programs. UP has said the furloughs occurred because of lower rail volumes.Vena didn’t mention the furloughs in his responses to questions fielded at the investor conference, but he stressed that safety is a core goal of the company.“I’ll promise you this. We’re going to be the best. We’re going to have the best margin. We’re going to have the best service and we’re going to have the best safety record. And if we do that, customers will want to come with us. They’ll see what we can do and we’ll win,” Vena said.Subscribe to FreightWaves’ e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.Related links:Union Pacific defends rail safety programUnion Pacific expects to respond quickly to safety concerns raised by FRAUnion Pacific furloughs workers due to lower volumesUP still working to restore tracks in Yuma subdivisionHilary disrupts Union Pacific’s Southern California networkAll eyes on Vena as he takes helm at Union PacificNew labor agreements expected to cost Union Pacific millionsThe post UP touts faster Falcon Premium service as ‘a big deal’ appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

While the industry faces macroeconomic uncertainties, investors should take a look at the best railroad stocks to buy. Railroads are one of the most safe and efficient ways to transport goods across state lines and through country borders. The global railroad market was last valued at $281.24 billion and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.6% from 2023 to 2030.While it’s true that the railroad sector, like many others, grapples with macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties, it’s crucial for discerning investors to recognize the potential that lies within and consider diversifying their portfolios with some of the top-performing railroad stocks.With global freight, high-speed, and passenger rail activity on the rise, these 3 railroad stocks should be on investors’ radar. Below are my top three railroad stocks to buy now.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsUnion Pacific (UNP)Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) stock is currently the largest publicly traded railroad stock in the United States. The company is a staple to the U.S. economy, covering more than 32,000 miles of track across 23 states.  After reporting its Q2 2023 financial results, the company saw a decline in revenue and EPS (Earnings Per Share). Total net revenues were $5.96 billion, down 5% year-over-year. EPS came in at $2.57 per share, down 12% year-over-year. The company also saw a management shakeup, parting ways with its former CEO, Lance Fritz. Despite rising inventory pressures and slower demand in 2023, UNP saw strong year-over-year growth in 2022.  UNP’s total revenue in 2022 was $24.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year. EPS (Earnings Per Share) rose to $11.21, up 13% year-over-year. Union Pacific is well-positioned to benefit from the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act.  Road and bridge commodities such as private tank cars, asphalt, cement, rods, beams, and other key metals will fuel growth. They are expanding their reach into new markets with key intermodal terminals in California and Minnesota. Story continuesUNP also holds a 26% stake in Ferromex, the largest railway in Mexico.  While 2023 will serve as a minor bump in the road, investors should buy Union Pacific stock to unlock long-term shareholder value. Canadian National Railway (CNI)A photo of a Canadian National (CNI) train coming down the tracks toward the photographer.Source: Eric Buermeyer / Shutterstock.comCanadian National Railway (NYSE:CNI) stock is a strong buy despite the company’s underperformance in 2023. The railroad industry has seen a lackluster in 2023 thus far due to recession fears and higher interest rates.CN stock has seen a number of challenges including slowing intermodal demand, lower inventories, and sluggish traffic volumes.  After reporting their Q2 2023 earnings results, CN now projects negative year-over-year growth in EPS (Earnings Per Share). CN’s Q2 2023 revenues were $4.06 billion, a decrease of 7% year-over-year.  EPS (Earnings Per Share) was $1.76, down 8% year-over-year.  While key financial metrics saw declines, CN still saw improvements in its free cash flow, up 8% in the quarter.CEO, Tracy Robinson remains optimistic about the company’s outlook to accelerate profitable growth and drive sustainability initiatives.  The stock has also delivered a 13% CAGR in its dividend over the last decade. Furthermore, management expects EPS (Earnings Per Share) growth in the 10-15% range from 2024-2026. As the company improves operating efficiencies and recession fears subside, Canadian National Railway is one of the top railroad stocks for 2023. Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CP)Source: https://www.cpr.ca/en/media/photosCanadian Pacific Kansas City (NYSE:CP) is one of the best-performing railroad stocks in 2023, thanks to its recent merger with the U.S. Kansas City Southern. The combination created the first railway connection between the United States, Canada, and Mexico.With unrivaled port access, the railway merger connects to Atlantic Canada, the Gulf of Mexico, and Mexico’s Pacific Coast. CPKS has also committed to the expansion of Amtrak’s passenger rail network in the United States. Amtrak’s 15-year plan will expand passenger rail service in 20 new states, and improve existing corridor rail service in 16 states. Canadian Pacific will indirectly benefit from the $66 billion in new federal funding dedicated to passenger rail infrastructure in the Northeast. For Q1 2023, total revenue grew to $2.27 billion, up 22% year-over-year. EPS (Earnings Per Share) was $0.86 cents, compared to $0.63 cents in the year prior. Despite poor performance in 2023, CP has strong growth tailwinds in front of it over the next decade.  CP is currently strengthening its commodity supply chain, with investments in new hopper cars to service the grain, coal, and fertilizer markets. The company has also committed $275 million over the next 3 years to improve freight rail safety and capacity in the Upper Midwest states and Louisiana.  With increased investment in passenger and freight rail infrastructure, CP stock is one of the best railroad stocks to buy for 2023. On the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

GPS has been gaining from lower airfreight, improved promotions and cost-cutting actions. It is on track with the execution of its Power Plan 2023 plan.Analysts also seem optimistic about the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GPS’s fiscal 2023 earnings inched up a penny in the past seven days. It has a decent history of delivering earnings surprises, with an average beat of 1,001.6% in the trailing four quarters.Consequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have risen 16.8% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 3.5%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Let’s delve deeper.Growth Factors Aiding GPSGap has been on track with its aggressively undertaking cost-management actions in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The company has been making efforts to simplify and optimize its operating model and structure. These include increasing spans of control and decreasing management layers to improve the quality and speed of decision-making, as well as creating a consistent organizational structure across all four brands. These actions are expected to generate $300 million in annualized savings, of which half is expected to be realized in the latter half of fiscal 2023.Apart from these efforts, the company is expected to realize $250 million in annualized savings, as announced in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Gap revealed plans to further optimize its marketing spend and rationalize its technology investments over the next few years.The company is on track with the execution of its Power Plan 2023, which focuses on opening highly-profitable Old Navy and Athleta stores, while closing the underperforming Gap and Banana Republic stores. As part of the plan, it expects the Old Navy and Athleta brands to contribute about 70% of sales by 2023.As part of its 350-store closure plan, the company expects to close 50-55 Gap and Banana Republic stores this year. Gap is likely to fulfill its 350-store closure plan by the end of 2023. It has already achieved 90% of the target in 2022. With the closing of underperforming Gap and Banana Republic stores, the company expects to realize $100 million in EBITDA savings on an annualized basis by the end of 2023.Further, GPS expects to leverage its powerful platform to deliver competitive omni capabilities to meet customers’ needs, all fueled by its scaled operations. The company targets the e-commerce business to contribute 50% to sales by the end of 2023. Through the plan, it expects to deliver consistent sales growth, margin expansion and a strong operating cash flow.Also, expansion in merchandise margins stemming from lower airfreight contributed to margins in second-quarter fiscal 2023. Gap’s gross margin of 37.6% expanded 310 basis points (bps) and 160 bps, respectively, from the prior-year period’s reported and adjusted gross margins. Adjusted operating income was $119 million compared with $65 million in the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the adjusted operating margin expanded 170 bps to 3.4%, driven by an improved gross margin and adjusted SG&amp;A leverage.Also, adjusted SG&amp;A expenses declined 8% year over year. Adjusted SG&amp;A, as a percentage of sales, leveraged 10 bps to 36.6% due to lower advertising expenses, payroll and technology investments resulting from cost-saving actions. Owing to these factors, adjusted earnings of 34 cents per share in the fiscal second quarter also significantly improved from the 8 cents reported in the second quarter of fiscal 2022.Going ahead, management expects continued margin expansion and improved cash flow. The gross margin is likely to expand in fiscal 2023. This is likely to result from a 200-bps leverage due to the lapping of elevated airfreight costs in the prior year and a 100-bps margin gain from improved inventory position and promotional activity, offset by a 10-bps deleverage from inflationary costs.Additionally, the company expects inflationary deleverage to turn into leverage in the second half of fiscal 2023 due to gains from improved commodity costs and ocean freight rates. ROD, as a percentage of sales, is expected to deleverage 70 bps year over year. For third-quarter fiscal 2023, Gap anticipates the gross margin to be in line with the 38.7% reported last year. It envisions lower inflation and airfreight costs to be offset by 150 bps of ROD deleverage.Story continuesHurdles on the PathHowever, Gap has been reeling under uncertain macro and consumer environments. This resulted in a dismal top line in the fiscal second quarter. Net sales dipped 8% year over year to $3,548 million and slightly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,597 million. This includes a currency headwind of 1 percentage point and adverse impacts of 2 percentage points from the sale of Gap China. Comparable sales (comps) fell 6% in the fiscal second quarter.Going ahead, management anticipates fiscal 2023 sales to decline in the mid-single digits compared with the low to mid-single-digit decline mentioned earlier. The company reported net sales of $15.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. It expects sales for fiscal 2023 to include an impact of $300 million from the sale of Gap China and a positive effect of $150 million from the 53rd week.For third-quarter fiscal 2023, Gap expects a sales decline in the low-double digits, whereas it reported $4.04 billion last year. This can be attributed to the sale of Gap China, which is expected to impact net sales by $70 million in the fiscal third quarter.ConclusionAlthough uncertain macro and consumer environments are likely to linger in the near term, solid merchandise margins, cost-saving efforts and reduced air freight expenses are likely to help GPS drive growth ahead. Topping it, a VGM Score of A and a long-term earnings growth rate of 12% raise optimism in the stock.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks are BJ's Restaurants BJRI, Urban Outfitters URBN and Walmart WMT.BJ's Restaurants, which operates a chain of high-end casual dining restaurants in the United States, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Familiarity with due diligence made the stock-picking process faster and more manageable. And, helped me to avoid investing into stocks to sell. However, knowing the company name alone isn’t the only deciding factor to invest in stocks and keep them long-term.Technology is making it easier for investors to look at their investments and study their financials. The information helps investors do their due diligence by identifying potential risks and helps them spot where assets have exposure to potentially massive losses. These may be risks from government legislation, poor financial performance or even legal action. Whatever the reason, anything that increases portfolio risk is worth a closer look.To that end, here are three stocks to sell before the companies’ situations worsen.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThe Gap (GPS)GPS stock: a close up of a Gap logo on a buildingSource: ShutterstockThe Gap (NYSE:GPS) is an apparel and retail company with brands like Gap, Old Navy, Athleta and Banana Republic. The company offers clothing, footwear and accessories via its stores, franchise channels and website. GPS also operates its stores in several countries outside the U.S., like Canada, Taiwan, Japan and China.The Gap’s performance could have been better, and its recent quarter showed its net sales are down by 8% compared to the previous year. The company’s guidance also mentioned how it expects its net sales to decline into low double digits in the 3rd quarter and into mid-single digits for the entire year. One thing to note is that The Gap has a new CEO. However, it’s still a little too early to tell if it’ll translate to improved numbers in the coming year. As a result, I think GPS should be one of the stocks to sell if you have it in your portfolio right now.Verizon (VZ)5G stocks, VZ stockSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comVerizon (NYSE:VZ) is an integrated telecommunications conglomerate offering high-quality communications services. The company is part of the “big three” major telecom networks in the U.S. that offer both 4G and 5G data. The company also provides copper-based and fiber-optic networks. At face value, a company of this size may seem an ideal place to grow your hard-earned money. But you might want to step back first.Story continuesOne of the big issues with Verizon is its use of lead-sheathed cables that may contaminate soil and water. This concern came to light when a Wall Street Journal investigative report cited that the major telecoms have some, if not all, of their network cables wrapped in lead, exposing Americans to hidden health hazards. This has put pressure on Verizon as analysts and industry experts are still determining how significant the impact is to the company and how extensive the potential legal battle could be. In addition, its continuous spending on C-Band poses a risk of elevating its debt levels even further. With no clear indication of the depth and scope of the potential impact, its vicarious spending and the company’s struggle with its competition make it a problematic stock to keep in one’s portfolio.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)jnj healthcare stocksSource: Raihana Asral / Shutterstock.comJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a pharmaceuticals and healthcare products company that operates in three key segments, consumer health, pharmaceutical and med-tech. The company is mainly known for its brands like Band-Aid, Johnson’s baby powder and Tylenol. Today, JNJ is also one of the leading developers of pharmaceutical drugs. With a long history and extensive achievements in different fields, JNJ has also had bad days.In 2022, the company reached a settlement of $8.9 Billion in a talc case where the plaintiffs claimed the J&amp;J talc products cause cancer. In July 2022, the company was ordered to pay another $18.8M in damages as the California court ruled in favor of a plaintiff’s claim.Further, the company is losing U.S. exclusivity of one of its biggest-selling drugs, Stelara. Its patent protection is set to expire and other companies are already developing similar drugs. Lastly, the Biden administration’s bid to lower the cost of prescription drugs put JNJ on the spot. Three of its products, Xarelto, Imbruvica and Stelara are included in the list. This puts JNJ at risk of losing revenue in the coming financial quarters, making it one of our stocks to sell.On the date of publication, Rick Orford did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If you want to skip our discussion on the technology market, head directly to 5 Best Technology ETFs To Buy. The pandemic had a profound impact on businesses around the world. As for the technology sector, COVID-19 induced a number of disruptions, while presenting plenty of opportunities as well. For instance, while the pandemic caused major supply chain issues for the semiconductor industry leading to massive shortages and delays, it also influenced a global need for remote work-spaces, online retail, telehealth, and EdTech. According to a report by Deloitte, the technology sector has not just endured these challenges, it has thrived. In 2023, while the slowing economy continues to put pressure on the industry, along with ongoing disruptions in supply chain and workforce, the industry is paving its path towards innovation. Don't Miss: 10 Best Silver ETFsAccording to Gartner, the global spending in IT is forecasted to be roughly $4.6 trillion in 2023, increasing 5.5% since the previous year. Regardless of the concerns about the macroeconomic pressures, the IT sector is expected to expand, even in regions with flat GDP growth rates. Although the devices segment is estimated to decline by 5% during 2023, the software segment seems set for a double-digit growth rate. John-David Lovelock, VP Analyst at Gartner, stated: “The macroeconomic headwinds are not slowing digital transformation. Prioritization will be critical as CIOs look to optimize spend while using digital technology to transform the company’s value proposition, revenue and client interactions.” As per McKinsey, generative artificial intelligence is set to spearhead the need for innovation in the technology sector. While the potential for a framework based on artificial intelligence is endless, the business applications for the tech are expected to reduce development times, empower non-technical staff, and enable businesses to explore avenues for value addition through assistive technology. As per an estimate, innovation in generative artificial intelligence is expected to add $4.4 trillion in economic value by increasing productivity for businesses and consumers. Furthermore, investors seem confident about the potential for the tech sector, as investments worth nearly $1 trillion were made in the sector during 2022.Story continuesAlso Read: 10 Best Dividend ETFsIn addition to artificial intelligence, another major focus for the tech sector is cybersecurity. According to a report by Fortune Business Insights, in 2022, the total market for cybersecurity was valued in excess of $172 billion and this is expected to increase to nearly $425 billion by 2030. As the number of data breaches continues to rise, businesses look towards improving safety measures. Data breaches affect everyone – consumers, businesses, and governments. The sensitive nature of data highlights a growing requirement for safety for all stakeholders involved. As the world continues to take steps towards digitization, the risk for such breaches only multiplies. According to McKinsey, the market opportunity for cybersecurity solutions can be valued in excess of $2 trillion. By 2025, the damage from cyber attacks is projected to cost $10.5 trillion annually. With numerous companies underfunded to improve their security measures, the opportunity lies in four major areas – cloud technologies, pricing mechanisms, artificial intelligence, and other managing services. With developments in artificial intelligence, companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are working on combining the two in products such as Microsoft Security Copilot. Similarly, investments in private cybersecurity companies continue to increase as well. Recently, cloud-based security firm Wiz managed to raise $300 million at a $10 billion valuation.  While inflation still remains high, sectors such as technology, healthcare, and industrials are expected to outperform the market and provide a cover for investors in 2023. Additionally, more than 75% of tech leaders expect a better performance for the tech sector during the year. This article discusses some of the best technology ETFs that provide investors with access to market leaders like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).Our Methodology We used an ETF screener and filtered out the best performing technology ETFs based on 5-year share price performance.

(NASDAQ:QLYS) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Qualys, Inc. (NASDAQ:QLYS), a cloud-based vulnerability management cybersecurity platform, detracted from performance. While third quarter revenue and profit beat consensus expectations, billings–a forward growth indicator based on contracts–decelerated slightly as the tough macro environment caused deal scrutiny, longer sales cycles among new customers, and a slower productivity ramp-up for newly hired sales reps. Despite near-term challenges, we think Qualys can continue compounding revenue and free cash-flow-per-share growth for several reasons.”11. First Trust NASDAQ Cybersecurity ETF (NASDAQ:CIBR)5 Year Performance as of September 12: 62.85%Launched in July 2015, the First Trust NASDAQ Cybersecurity ETF (NASDAQ:CIBR) aims to achieve investment results that mirror the performance of the Nasdaq CTA Cybersecurity Index.

We chose to use the proceeds on more attractive value opportunities as Cisco’s growth has come in below what we had hoped for, and the company is increasingly looking at M&amp;A to augment its growth rate.”10.

They have strong management teams who are focused on maximizing the long-term value of their businesses through sensible and disciplined capital allocation. However both enjoyed a period of overearning through the pandemic, with CDW benefitting from abnormally high IT spend and Ulta seeing demand spike for beauty products as consumers emerged from their lockdown cocoons. As the normalization of these trends produced an air pocket in demand management adjusted full year expectations and both shares sold off sharply; Ulta fell almost 30% in May, from $560 to $400, while CDW fell 25% between February and May, from $215 to $160.”9. iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (BATS:IGV)5 Year Performance as of September 12: 78.44%Introduced in July 2001, the objective for the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (BATS:IGV) is to track the performance of the S&amp;P North American Expanded Technology Software Index, which consists of tech companies involved in software development, home entertainment, and computing solutions.

First Trust NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund (NASDAQ:QTEC)5 Year Performance as of September 12: 91.52%First introduced in April 2006, the First Trust NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund (NASDAQ:QTEC) is an ETF that aims to mimic the performance of the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector Index. As of September 13, the ETF manages a portfolio of 38 stocks with total assets worth nearly $3 billion, while maintaining an expense ratio of 0.57%. It is one of the best technology ETFs to invest in. Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM) is one of the largest investments of First Trust NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund (NASDAQ:QTEC). Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM) offers software solutions for business and project management, such as Jira Software and Jira Work Management. According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, a total of 39 hedge funds were bullish on Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM). This number remained unchanged since the previous quarter.Artisan Partners said this about Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Among our bottom contributors were Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM), SVB Financial Group and Catalent. The tougher macro environment caught up with Atlassian in the quarter as the company is seeing slower software user additions as customers of all sizes moderate hiring and spending. However, the company still expects to grow sales at a mid-20s rate in Q4 and grow its strategically important cloud revenues 40%–45%. These are slower rates than we expected, and could slow further, but Atlassian’s growth metrics remain solid in light of the environment. In the short term, slower revenue growth will likely pressure margins and profitability given the company’s rapid hiring expansion in recent periods. But we detect a meaningful shift in tone from management on expense growth and margins now that top-line growth is slowing. While we fully expect Atlassian to keep investing in its large growth opportunities, we think a prudent reprioritization of this spending will lead to margin tailwinds in the medium term. We are sensitive to the slowing near-term growth dynamics but believe remaining invested is appropriate given the longer term profit growth potential.”7.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Biggest Web3.0 Companies In The World.Demystifying Web3.0Web3.0, a cutting-edge technology that could redefine the digital frontiers, has gained massive popularity over time. The rising concerns about privacy and the centralization of the internet have fuelled the Web3.0 hype. Web3.0 is basically a vision for the future of the internet that is decentralized and based on blockchain technology. Web3.0 offers more ownership to the users while enabling them to perform all tasks they can currently perform on the current version of the internet, Web2. Web3.0 refers to a change in the nature of the internet where ownership by corporate networks is substituted by users. It represents the idea where blockchain technology and decentralized systems take center stage, and the users would be empowered in ways they never deemed possible. The shift in ownership and decentralization is the primary distinguishing feature between Web2 and Web3.0.Web3.0 is also closely linked with metaverse. Metaverse is envisioned as a decentralized space that users can access through extended reality tech such as AR and VR. Metaverse enables users to trade various digital products and assets which requires the use of blockchains. Blockchains and immersive technology are significant central features of Web3.0.Even though the vision of Web3.0 sounds promising, influential figures like Elon Musk have dismissed the possibility of its existence. Although a complete transformation to Web3.0 seems far-fetched, it is undeniable that Web3.0 is stirring some form of transformation.According to a report by Grand View Research, the global Web3.0 market was valued at $2.25 billion in 2023 and has been estimated to grow to $33.53 billion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate of 47.1%. Increased use of the latest technologies like 5G and enhanced consciousness about privacy are expected to contribute to this growth.Story continuesIn 2022, North America dominated the Web3.0 market, accounting for a global revenue share of over 37.0%. However, the Asia Pacific region has been estimated to have the highest projected growth rate during the forecast period. Incorporating Web3.0 into industries like finance and retail, along with rising traction around blockchain, has been estimated to contribute greatly to this growth.Web3.0 Revolution: Disrupting IndustriesWeb3.0 is often touted as the future of the internet. The internet interwinds with almost all industries and businesses today. The introduction and adoption of Web3.0 would cause a fundamental shift in how businesses operate. One of the defining features of Web3.0 is decentralization, it would bring blockchains to the mainstream.Web3.0 could revolutionize how the finance industry operates. On July 26, CNBC reported that banking giants like JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Citi want to put Wall Street on blockchain, where they can tokenize various assets. Blockchains can be used to maintain a decentralized and distributed ledger.

More than 50 brands were a part of the Decentraland Metaverse Fashion Week that was held in March including Adidas, Coach, and Diesel.
