The analysts kept their hold rating on the stock, with a $165 12-month price target. That implies a 4% drop from current levels. The stock was up 0.7% to near $172 in afternoon trading and up 4% so far this year.Templeton, who has been CEO since 2004 with a brief time away from the job in 2018, isn’t leaving entirely. He remains as board chairman, a position he has held since 2008.Stifel credited Templeton for overseeing impressive top-line revenue growth, saying he played a critical role in “defining the company’s strategic transformation and financial discipline over the past two decades.”They also said Ilan is a strong leader with considerable experience at the company, which he joined in 1999.The chip industry has been in a slump after a post-pandemic glut of chips and waning consumer demand for the products that contain them, but it is also investing heavily in building new factories and adding production. The U.S. government is encouraging this by making $50 billion available to build the U.S.’s chip-producing capacity.Stifel said in its note that Texas Instruments could potentially be early to see an eventual upturn, ""something TI is already planning for by rebuilding its depleted inventory levels.""“Ilan will be taking the helm during the current industry wide semis correction,” the Stifel analysts said in their note. “A leadership team with disciplined focus will be crucial to ensure TXN can maintain its best-in-class capital management strategy.”Story continuesRelated ArticlesTexas Instruments turns to long-time veteran in CEO transition amid chip slumpMorgan Stanley lowers CEO Gorman's 2022 compensation to $31.5 millionIntesa reassures on capital distribution after asset risk worries hit shares]"

By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Range Resources Corporation (NYSE:RRC).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Range Resources How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Range Resources is:58% = US$1.3b ÷ US$2.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.58 in profit.Does Range Resources Have A Good Return On Equity?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Range Resources has a higher ROE than the average (32%) in the Oil and Gas industry.roeThat's what we like to see. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining Range Resources' Debt And Its 58% Return On EquityRange Resources does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.09. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.But note: Range Resources may not be the best stock to buy.

STLD is set to release fourth-quarter 2022 results after the closing bell on Jan 25.Steel Dynamics’ earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 6.2%, on average. The company posted an earnings surprise of 9.9% in the last reported quarter.Fourth-quarter results for STLD will likely reflect the benefits of firm demand in most end markets. However, weaker prices and seasonally lower volumes might have impacted its performance. Shares of the company have rallied 104.6% in the past year compared with 20.6% rise of the industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Zacks ModelOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Steel Dynamics this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earning beat.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP for Steel Dynamics is +4.82%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is currently pegged at $3.60. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Steel Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #1.What do the Estimates Say?Steel Dynamics envisions fourth-quarter earnings in the range of $3.34-$3.38 per share. Adjusted earnings have been forecast in the band of $4.10-$4.14 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for Steel Dynamics for the to-be-reported quarter is at $4,732 million, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 10.9%.The consensus estimate for average external product selling price for the company's steel operations is pegged at $1,098 per ton, indicating a year-over-year decline of 33.9% and a decline of 20.5% on a sequential comparison basis.A Few Factors to WatchWeaker sequential profitability in the company’s steel operations might have impacted fourth-quarter results. Steel Dynamics, last month, said that it expects profitability from its steel operations to be considerably lower than third-quarter 2022 levels.Story continuesThe downside will likely be caused by seasonally lower shipments and metal spread compression, especially within the flat roll operations, STLD noted. Metal spread compression was exacerbated by higher raw material costs.The company noted that underlying steel demand and order activities remained intact from automotive, non-residential construction, industrial, and energy sectors with some softness in the residential sector. The non-residential construction sector remained steady as reflected by customer order activity supporting sustained historically strong order backlog.The impacts of weaker prices are also likely to reflect on Steel Dynamics’ performance in the quarter to be reported. Lower realized prices are expected to have weighed on its top line and margins.U.S. steel prices tumbled after surging to roughly $1,500 per short ton in April 2022 due to supply concerns stemming from the Russia-Ukraine war. The benchmark hot-rolled coil (""HRC"") prices cratered to near the $600 per short ton level in November 2022. The downward drift partly reflects weaker demand. Fears of a recession have also impacted HRC prices. Steel Dynamics, Inc. Price and Consensus Steel Dynamics, Inc. Price and ConsensusSteel Dynamics, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Steel Dynamics, Inc.

PPG reported earnings from continuing operations of $1.01 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022, down 9.8% from the prior-year quarter’s earnings of $1.12.PPG posted adjusted earnings of $1.22 per share, reflecting a decline of 3.2% from the year-ago quarter earnings of $1.26. It, however, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14.The bottom line was aided by a recovery of margins across the segments, with a segment earnings growth of more than 20% on a year-over-year basis, driven by selling price increases. However, severe commercial and supply disruptions in China posed a headwind to PPG in the fourth quarter.PPG’s net sales in the fourth quarter were $4,185 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,056.1 million. Net sales declined around 0.1% from $4,190 million reported in the prior-year quarter. PPG’s top line was driven by higher selling prices, offset by lower overall sales volumes from weak manufacturing activities across most regions. It saw lower sales volume in the Asia-Pacific region due to pandemic-related disruptions in China.PPG Industries, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePPG Industries, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePPG Industries, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | PPG Industries, Inc. QuoteSegment HighlightsPerformance Coatings: Net sales in this segment were $2,490 million in the reported quarter, down 0.7% year over year. Higher selling prices, which supported the sales in this segment, were offset by lower sales volume, the adverse impact of divestitures, the exit of business in Russia and unfavorable foreign currency translation.The segment reported income of around $272 million, which reflects a rise of 11.9% from prior-year quarter levels. This increase in segment profit was primarily driven by higher selling prices and cost savings from restructuring. However, adverse impact from currencies and elevated manufacturing costs mitigated the positive impact of prices and cost savings.Industrial Coatings: Net sales from this segment were $1,695 million in the fourth quarter, up 0.7% from the year-ago quarter. Net sales for this segment were driven by higher selling prices across all its business, which were offset by lower sales volumes partly due to weaker industrial activities in China and Europe, the exit of business in Russia and unfavorable foreign currency translations.Story continuesSegment income totaled $155 million, up 47.6% year over year. The upside was driven by increased selling prices and cost savings from restructuring but was mitigated by higher raw materials and energy costs, lower sales volume and unfavorable currency.FY22 ResultsAdjusted earnings for full-year 2022 were $6.05 per share compared with $6.77 a year ago. Net sales increased 5% year over year to $17,652 million.FinancialsPPG Industries ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,099 million, up 9.4% year over year.  The company’s long-term debt was $6,503 million, reflecting a decline of 1%.OutlookMoving ahead, the company sees soft economic activity in Europe and China in the first quarter of 2023. However, the company will prioritize supporting customers by providing superior service and products, optimizing inventory levels and executing several cost savings initiatives. It also expects a rebound in demand for its technology-advantaged aerospace products, moderate raw material costs, stable coatings demand in Europe starting in the second quarter and strong economic recovery in China to act as a positive catalyst that will boost earnings.PPG projects adjusted EPS in the band of $1.10-$1.20 for the first quarter, barring amortization expense of 13 cents and costs related to previously approved and communicated business of 2 cents. It also sees reported EPS for the first quarter between 95 cents and $1.05. The company expects aggregate sales volumes for the quarter to be down a mid-single-digit percentage on a year-over-year basis.Price PerformancePPG’s shares are down 16.5% over a year against 1.7% rise recorded by its industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksPPG currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks to consider in the basic materials space include Nucor Corporation NUE, Agnico Eagle Mines Limited AEM and Franco-Nevada Corporation FNV.

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Of these, perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing, which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.Unum Group (UNM) is a stock many investors are watching right now. UNM is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 6.31. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 11.78. Over the past 52 weeks, UNM's Forward P/E has been as high as 7.46 and as low as 4.97, with a median of 6.47.Investors should also recognize that UNM has a P/B ratio of 0.92. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 1.57. Over the past 12 months, UNM's P/B has been as high as 1.06 and as low as 0.45, with a median of 0.69.Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. UNM has a P/S ratio of 0.66. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.89.Story continuesFinally, investors will want to recognize that UNM has a P/CF ratio of 5.49. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 6.41. Over the past year, UNM's P/CF has been as high as 6.63 and as low as 4.67, with a median of 5.69.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Unum Group is likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, UNM sticks out at as one of the market's strongest value stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The bottom line was 3.5% higher than the prior-year level. Our estimate for adjusted earnings was $1.78 per share.Shares of STT rallied almost 4% in pre-market trading on better-than-expected quarterly performance. Also, the company’s new share repurchase program for this year cheered investors.Results reflected new investment servicing wins (bringing servicing assets to be installed in the future to $3.6 trillion), higher net interest revenues (NIR), a slight fall in expenses and growth in net interest margin. A decline in fee revenues, lower assets balance and higher provisions hurt STT’s results to some extent.After considering non-recurring items, net income available to common shareholders was $696 million or $1.91 per share, up from $662 million or $1.78 per share in the year-ago quarter. We had projected net income available to common shareholders (GAAP basis) to be $648.1 million.In 2022, adjusted earnings per share of $7.44 beat the consensus estimate of $7.35 but fell marginally year over year. Our estimate for adjusted earnings was $7.13 per share. Net income available to common shareholders grew 3.4% to $2.66 billion.Revenues Rise, Expenses DeclineQuarterly total revenues were $3.16 billion, increasing 3.3% year over year. Also, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.06 billion. Our estimate for the metric was $2.97 billion.In 2022, total revenues grew 1% year over year to $12.15. Also, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.06 billion. Our estimate for the metric was $11.97 billion.NIR was $791 million, jumping 63.4% year over year. The rise was largely driven by higher global interest rates and growth in loan balances. The net interest margin (NIM) rose 56 basis points year over year to 1.29%. Our estimates for NIR and NIM were $709.2 million and 1.19%, respectively.The total fee revenues declined 5.9% to $2.36 billion. The fall was due to a decline in servicing fees and management fees. We had projected total fee revenues to be $2.23 billion.Non-interest expenses were $2.26 billion, down 3.2%. This reflected continued productivity and optimization savings and gains from currency translation, largely offset by continued business investments and a rise in wages. Our estimate for the metric was $2.15 billion. Excluding non-recurring items, expenses were $2.2 billion, down marginally.The provision for credit losses was $10 million in the reported quarter against a provision benefit of $7 million in the prior-year quarter.The common equity Tier 1 ratio was 13.6% as of Dec 31, 2022, compared with 14.3% in the corresponding period of 2021. The return on common equity was 11.8% compared with 10.3% in the year-ago quarter.Asset Balances DeclineAs of Dec 31, 2022, total assets under custody and administration (AUC/A) were $36.7 trillion, down 15.9% year over year. The fall was due to lower equity and fixed-income market levels, previously disclosed client transition and unfavorable currency translation partially offset by net new business installations.The assets under management (AUM) were $3.5 trillion, down 15.9%, reflecting lower equity and fixed-income market levels, institutional net outflows and unfavorable currency translation, which were partially offset by ETF net inflows.Share Repurchase UpdateDuring the reported quarter, State Street repurchased shares worth $1.5 billion.Also, the company announced a new authorization to buy back up to shares worth $4.5 billion in 2023.Our TakePersistently rising expenses due to the company’s strategic buyouts and investments in franchise will likely hurt the bottom line to an extent. A tough operating backdrop is another major concern. Nonetheless, higher interest rates and solid business servicing wins are expected to keep supporting State Street’s financials.State Street Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseState Street Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseState Street Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | State Street Corporation QuoteState Street currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The bottom line reflects a rise of 25% from the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for earnings was $1.09.Results have been aided by a rise in net interest revenues. However, asset balances witnessed a decline, which was a negative. Higher expenses and lower fee revenues have hurt BK’s results to some extent.Northern Trust Corporation’s NTRS fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $1.65 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.81. Also, the bottom line declined 14% year over year.Results were adversely impacted by a rising expense base, worsening credit quality, lower fee income and weak capital ratios.

U.S. Bank team members pictured: Zack Boyers, Kristy Carstensen, Greg Cunningham, Troy Remington.Originally published on U.S. Bank company blogCedric Bobo knew from a young age the pride that comes from owning property. He learned it through the family stories that focused on his great-grandfather Tony Edmunds, who was Black and a landowner in the 1890s in northern Mississippi.""My grandmother would tell me how he framed himself as an important member of his community, someone who was an entrepreneur and his participation as an owner,"" said Bobo. ""I was deeply inspired by these stories.""Although the stories from his family history conveyed the importance, Bobo didn't learn how to become a landowner. ""It would have helped a lot if I had a network,"" he added.So, after a 20-year career as an investor, including more than 10 years at The Carlyle Group, he founded Project Destined, a nonprofit focused on teaching real estate to high school and college students of color. The organization's name was inspired by the 2016 movie called ""Destined."" Project Destined exposes students not only to a network of real estate professionals, but they also receive a stipend to attend classes about real estate and access to mentors who guide them during the program. Students learn about financing, property evaluation, market value and how to plan for renovations, among other topics. At the same time, industry professionals get to know a talented pool of young professionals of color.Bobo's mission is to create a new generation of real estate owners, like Jagpar Bhupal, of Indian descent. He was part of the program's 2021 cohort and graduated from the University of North Carolina, in Charlotte, in May 2022.""At Project Destined, I learned the ability to talk about and understand key real estate concepts and how to apply them in real life,"" said Bhupal, who's now a commercial real estate credit analyst at U.S. Bank and continues to mentor Project Destined participants. ""This program gave me the tools I needed to prepare for my job interview and role at U.S. Bank.""Story continuesBobo's partnership with U.S. Bank started in May 2022, when they teamed up with the WNBA to launch She's Invested: Supporting Emerging Female Leaders, the first all-female program for the organization that provides mentorship and financial education to women of color from Historically Black Colleges and Universities and universities in Southern California.Soon after, U.S. Bank's tax credit and community investment subsidiary, U.S. Bancorp Development Corporation (USBCDC) - alongside the Bank's Commercial Real Estate division and their Credit Risk Management partners, worked with Bobo to offer mentorship and internships to 10 undergraduate students in Charlotte, as well as in-person convening and networking opportunities.""When we learned about Project Destined, we knew that we wanted to build a partnership,"" said Claire Schell, vice president of employee experience at USBCDC, who serves as a member of U.S. Bank's Project Destined program steering committee, along with Dhiren Patel, Karla Kirkwood and Sarah Clabaugh. ""We are absolutely aligned in our passion around creating access to opportunities - and the pathways created by this collaborative program are such an important way to demonstrate our commitment to racial equity outside of our four walls.""In October 2022, USBCDC also contributed $25,000 to Project Destined's Affordable Housing Bridge Program, an eight-week fellowship that exposes alumni to potential career paths by connecting them with nonprofit and for-profit affordable housing leaders and practitioners. This program is managed by USBCDC's long term partners Eden Housing, Beacon Communities, and the Housing Partnership Network.""We see enormous potential in this program, and we look forward to seeing it grow and succeed,"" said Lisa Gutierrez, director of business development at USBCDC. ""Programs like these help students find career pathways that enable them to make a difference in their communities.""Thirty-nine student fellows were selected from a pool of over 160 Project Destined alumni. Almost half of the fellows selected have themselves lived in affordable housing at one time. The Bridge program offers more than 40 hours of first-hand exposure to mentors and careers in affordable housing, as well as specialized workshops and career development and coaching sessions.""Project Destined's relationship with U.S. Bank is unprecedented,"" said Bobo. ""I'm proud of where we started and I'm looking forward to where we will go together.""Since 2016, Project Destined has trained more than 4,500 students across the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Bobo's goal is to take the organization to ""new heights"" by focusing on what the students need in their lives and careers to succeed as well as increase their exposure to commercial real estate, an industry that lacks representation of people of color.""It makes me proud to see how this industry is supporting us and helping lots of kids' lives change,"" said Bobo. ""I want the students to see themselves as part of the local economy and as leaders; I want them to have access to the opportunities that will help them achieve what they deeply desire.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from U.S. Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: U.S. BankWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/us-bankEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: U.S. BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/736070/How-Project-Destined-Is-Changing-the-Face-of-Commercial-Real-Estate]"

CEO Eric Nordstrom noting the holiday season was, quote, ""highly promotional,"" and sales were softer than pre-pandemic levels.The company lowered its full year profit outlook from a high-end range of $2.60 down to $1.70.

So it seems like, while we were a little worried about the holiday season, maybe people didn't have that big of expectations for the holiday season either.DAVE BRIGGS: Probably right. What jumped out to me, though, about the Nordstrom number was net sales down about 1.7% at the signature brand Nordstrom, but Nordstrom Rack was down 7.6%. Dramatic spread there, and that's not really markdowns. Nordstrom Rack feeds an entirely different demographic. Always markdowns-- that's what the brand is. I was a little bit surprised by the difference there. Did that strike you as odd?JOSH SCHAFER: Well, it's not the trade-down that we thought we were supposed to see, right? You would think Nordstrom Rack would hold up because people--DAVE BRIGGS: That's what my impression was, yeah.JOSH SCHAFER: You'd normally get a good shoe deal at Nordstrom Rack, Dave.

JWN announced dismal holiday sales results. The company’s sales declined 3.5% year over year in the nine-week period ended Dec 31, 2022. Banner-wise, Nordstrom sales fell 1.7% and sales at Nordstrom Rack decreased 7.6%.This was mainly due to high promotions and sluggish sales compared with the pre-pandemic levels. Reduced consumer spending, stemming from the tough macroeconomic environment, acted as a headwind.In order to end fiscal 2022 with healthy inventory levels, Nordstrom undertook additional markdowns. As a result, it expects year-end inventory levels to decline in the double-digits year over year.Driven by these factors, management lowered its fiscal 2022 guidance. The company anticipates revenue growth, including retail sales and credit card revenues, at the lower end of the prior mentioned 5-7%. The EBIT margin is expected to be 2.8-3.1%, down from the earlier stated 4.1-4.4%. This indicates lower-than-expected gross margins due to additional markdowns. The adjusted EBIT margin is forecast to be 3.1-3.3% compared with the prior mentioned 4.3-4.7%. SG&amp;A expenses are expected to reflect gains from the company's supply-chain optimization initiatives and ongoing cost-saving efforts.Adjusted earnings are likely to be $1.5-$1.7, down from the previously communicated $2.3-$2.6. Reported EPS is predicted to be $1.33-$1.53, which indicates a decline from the last mentioned $2.13-$2.43. The tax rate is expected to be 17%. Meanwhile, the leverage ratio is likely to be slightly above 3.0 times by the year end compared with the prior view of below 2.9 times.Consequently, shares of JWN have declined 10.1% in the past three months against the industry’s growth of 26.4%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research That said, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is committed to enhancing customer experience via its Closer to You strategy, optimized supply chain and better efficiency. Such endeavors are expected to deliver significant benefits in 2023. Also, it noted that fiscal 2023 started on a solid note, driven by clean inventory levels.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderHere are three better-ranked stocks to consider — Capri Holdings CPRI, Tecnoglass TGLS and Ulta Beauty ULTA.Capri Holdings, which operates membership warehouses, presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Nordstrom in the red after the company announced that the 2022 holiday season sales were down 3 and 1/2% year-over-year. The retailer also slashed full-year EPS guidance from $2.30 to $2.60. That was the range previously. It's now down at $1.50 to $1.70 here.And so, you know, you kind of look through what the company had said in tandem with this. Net sales decreased, actually 1.7%. Nordstrom Rack, that decreased 7.6%. And they said that the holiday season was highly promotional. Sales, as well, softer than prepandemic levels.And they're continuing to say at least that there's greater resilience in their higher-income cohorts. But consumers are being more selective with their spending, given the broader macro environment as well. That's quite the acknowledgment from the company.JARED BLIKRE: Yes. And it's an acknowledgment that's being echoed and reverberating through the analyst community. I got some notes here from the Street.And let me just begin with Bloomberg Intelligence. Nordstrom's pre-announcement that it missed on 2022 adjusted EBIT margin due to bigger markdowns, it just shows it needs to up its game. It needs to up its game against Macy's and some of the other retailers.Now, here's Jefferies. They hold the stock with a buy. Recommend it with a buy price cut-- price target cut to $22 from $24. And they say, while Nordstrom's profit reduction for the fourth quarter is, quote, ""disappointing,"" it's based on temporary factors.And they're also noting that promotions weighed on margins. This is a very common theme that we heard over the holiday season. And we're probably gonna hear a lot more of this as retailers report. This is a prereport here.Also, this as Jefferies saying investors should focus on Nordstrom's better inventory position. And I think that's gonna be key for a lot of retailers, which is important for driving sales and margin performance in 2023.Story continuesSo all in all here, I think, last year, I talked about quite a bit about the bifurcated market in retail and how electronic retailers had fallen behind over the last two months. Well, that's kind of-- it looks like that slump is over and we're in this new phase here.And when you get down to the brick-and-mortar shops, if they haven't figured out how they're going to compete in this new environment and they haven't gotten their execution down pat, then they're probably going to be left in the dust because I see this a more challenging year, perhaps. At least equally challenging as last year.BRAD SMITH: Well, this just adds to some of the guidance that we had received ahead of the ICR Conference. You'd seen that come in from Macy's in updating some of the expectations there. And you're seeing Macy's move lower here during today's session by about 7/10 of a percent. And then, additionally, we had seen even some of the guidance revisions from Lululemon and guiding for lower margins.And so with that in mind, even among some of the higher income cohorts of the consumer out there, they are signaling that there's more of a value kind of determination that they're making with every single purchase to figure out exactly whether or not it's going to be beneficial or you need to get, you know, that-- another pair of ABC pants from Lululemon or if you need to get something from, I don't know, Nordstrom at this point in time.But it really does point back to some of the data that we had seen come out earlier this week, as well, within some of the department stores data. That department stores were actually the biggest decliner in the retail sales month-over-month. Led the declines. It was down by about 6.6% from November of 2022.And so that really kind of giving us that tee up to now what we're seeing show up in some of the revised guidance from companies, including Macy's, Lululemon as mentioned. And now, today, Nordstrom as well.]"

31,d2206235-88b6-3fae-abd3-8ceae88b5173,MMC,2023-01-21,5 Insurance Stocks Likely to Zoom Past Q4 Earnings Estimates,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-insurance-stocks-likely-zoom-134001255.html,1674222001,STORY,"['VOYA', 'AIG', 'AFL', 'MMC', 'RE']","[Improved pricing, new products and services, rising interest rates, and accelerated digitalization efforts are expected to have been the highlights of the insurance industry in the fourth quarter of 2022. The insurance players are part of the broader Zacks Finance sector (one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification). Technological improvements and adoptions are expected to have lowered costs and improved efficiency for companies like Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. MMC, American International Group, Inc. AIG, Aflac Incorporated AFL, Everest Re Group, Ltd. RE and Voya Financial, Inc. VOYA.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have identified five companies, MMC, AIG, AFL, REand VOYA, which are poised to outpace the Zacks Consensus Estimate in fourth-quarter earnings. These stocks have the ideal combination of two ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy), #3 (Hold) — to surpass expectations. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Before we get into the details of factors that are anticipated to have influenced the fourth-quarter performance, let’s take a look at the sector projections.Per the latest Earnings Preview, the finance sector’s fourth-quarter 2022 earnings are estimated to decline 9.2%, while revenues are expected to increase 2.7%. Rising interest rates, growing awareness, scaling of businesses and other factors are expected to have supported the industry players’ top-line growth.Factors Shaping Q4 ResultsIn the fourth quarter, the insurance players are expected to have witnessed improved pricing. An active catastrophe environment and growing awareness are likely to have triggered the policy renewal rate and supported pricing growth. Favorable reserve development and robust capital levels are anticipated to have boosted the companies’ underwriting profitability.Story continuesThe significant winter storm of late December resulted in massive catastrophe losses for some insurers, which weighed on their quarterly performances. For example, The Allstate Corporation alone incurred estimated catastrophe losses of $478 million from the Winter Storm Elliott. This can give an idea about how the property and casualty stocks suffered in the quarter.However, auto and home insurance premiums are expected to have increased significantly in the quarter under review, providing some respite to the industry players. The insurers facing increased expenses due to supply-chain woes, the shortage of microchips and auto replacement parts opted for auto rate hikes. This is expected to have boosted fourth-quarter premiums.Inflationary pressures are expected to have triggered households to hedge against inflation and complement public health coverage with health insurances, which aided the health insurers. Insurance brokerage companies are expected to have gained from global expansions, increasing rates, tightening underwriting standards and cost-control efforts.The high interest rate environment is likely to have aided the insurers’ investment yields. Rate-sensitive investments and alternative investments in private equity, hedge funds, and real estate, among others, are expected to have benefited the companies’ investment income.Rising demand for protection products and policies with “living” benefits are likely to have boosted life insurers’ sales figures. Accelerated digitalization efforts are expected to have saved costs, improved operating efficiency and driven margin expansion for the insurance players.Potential Q4 OutperformersBelow we list five insurance stocks that have the right mix of elements to pull off a beat this earnings season.Based in New York, Marsh &amp; McLennan is a globally leading insurance broker. Solid performances of the Risk and Insurance Services, and Consulting businesses are anticipated to have driven its fourth-quarter 2022 earnings, partially offset by higher costs. New business generation and solid retention rates are likely to have aided its performance in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Marsh &amp; McLennan’s fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.40 per share, suggesting an increase of 2.9% from the year-ago reported figure. It beat earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average of 3.2%. MMC has an Earnings ESP of +2.72% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present.

The company reported 36 cents in the comparable period last year.The results benefited from notable increases in net interest income (NII) and a decline in expenses. However, a fall in fee income and higher provision from credit losses were headwinds.Management noted, “We are very pleased with our outstanding financial performance for the fourth quarter which included the fourth consecutive quarter of record PPNR. The year was marked by the successful execution of key strategic initiatives and acquisition synergies which further expanded our capabilities and supported the achievement of our medium-term financial targets.”The company reported a net income applicable to common shares of $617 million in the quarter, up 63.7% year over year.In 2022, earnings per share of $1.45 increased a whopping 61.1% year over year but lagged the consensus estimate of $1.47.  The net income available to common shareholders was $2.12 billion, up from $1.15 billion in 2021.Revenues Rise, Expenses FallTotal revenues (on a fully-taxable equivalent or FTE basis) climbed 19.2% year over year to $1.97 billion in the fourth quarter. Also, the top line surpassed the consensus estimate of $1.95 billion.In 2022, total revenues were up 21.1% from the prior-year level to $7.28 billion. Moreover, the reported figure surpassed the consensus mark of $7.26 billion.NII (FTE basis) was $1.47 billion, up 29.3% from the prior-year quarter. The upside resulted from an increase in the net interest margin (NIM), which rose to 3.52% from 2.85%, and higher average total loans and leases.Non-interest income moved down 3.1% to $499 million. The decline mainly stemmed from lower service charges on deposit accounts, mortgage banking and leasing revenues, partially offset by higher card and payment processing income, and capital market fees.Non-interest expenses were down 11.8% to $1.08 billion. This was due to a fall in primarily almost all components like outside data processing and other service costs, marketing costs, lease financing equipment depreciation and deposit and other insurance expense.The efficiency ratio was 54%, down from the prior-year quarter’s 73%. A decline in the ratio indicates a rise in profitability.As of Dec 31, 2022, average loans and leases at Huntington improved 1.7% on a sequential basis to $118.9 billion. Average total deposits fell marginally to $145.7 billion.Story continuesCredit Quality DeterioratesNet charge-offs were $50 million or an annualized 0.17% of average total loans in the reported quarter, up from $34 million or 0.12% recorded in the prior year. The quarter-end allowance for credit losses increased 7.8% to $2.27 billion. In the fourth quarter, the company recorded a provision from credit losses of $91 million against $64 million of reversal in the prior-year quarter.Nonetheless, total non-performing assets were $594 million as of Dec 31, 2022, down from $750 million in the prior-year quarter.Capital Ratios SolidCommon equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 9.44% in the quarter compared with 9.33% in the year-ago period. Regulatory Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 10.99%, unchanged from the comparable period in 2021. The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio in the fourth quarter was 5.55%, down from 6.88% as of Dec 31, 2021.Our ViewpointHuntington put up a decent performance in the fourth quarter. The momentum in average earning asset growth and higher rates will drive NII in the upcoming quarters.  However, elevated non-interest expenses are likely to keep the bottom line under pressure. Also, declining mortgage banking income is a woe.Huntington Bancshares Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseHuntington Bancshares Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseHuntington Bancshares Incorporated price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Huntington Bancshares Incorporated QuoteCurrently, Huntington carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

And let's start with Netflix. We're looking at gains of just about 8 and 1/2%, the move higher coming after the company reported quarterly subscriber growth nearly double what the Street had been expecting. Netflix's positive number there outshining the streaming giant shakeup in the C-suite. Co-founder Reed Hastings stepping away from his co-CEO role. It is important to point out, though, he is staying on as chairman, so he's not totally stepping aside here when it comes to Netflix.But Dave, taking a look at the reaction in the stock today, that subscriber number much bigger than I was anticipating, shares hitting the highest level that we've seen since April. The stock has now more than doubled from the low back in May. Safe to say that its new ad tier seems to be working. And then, of course, that strong slate of content is paying off for now.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, literally every hit that you see in the streaming space has been Netflix this year, with the exception of, really, ""Yellowstone."" And that's more of a traditional legacy media. But you look at ""Glass Onion"" has been huge, and ""Wednesday's"" been massive.And they just continue to roll them out, but I was really surprised by the reaction to Reed Hastings because just about every analyst said one of the best CEOs in this country today, and yet they applauded the transition and how they handled it and seem to be very optimistic about them not falling off one bit. So you thought with the applauds would be some more fears that Netflix might lose their way, but that was not the case.SEANA SMITH: No, it doesn't certainly seem to be the case. JPMorgan was out with a note saying that Reed's exit, it does mark the end of an era clearly, but they're expecting a smooth transition. And Hastings saying in that blog post that they have been preparing for this. He's been preparing for it with the board for years. So it seems at least for right now, Wall Street is pretty confident in the direction of the company.Story continuesThis is totally different reaction than what we've seen to Netflix's earnings recently. Evercore was out with the note saying that the new ad tier, the crackdown on password sharing, that those are major catalysts here. And they're very confident that's going to drive a material reacceleration in revenue and EPS growth, something that the Street has been waiting for when it comes to Netflix.DAVE BRIGGS: Really curious to ask a guest coming up here, the author of ""Binge Times,"" what it is about Netflix that might teach other companies in this space that co-CEOS work because they are staying in that co-CEO lane. I do want to mention other streamers seem to gain off of Netflix as well. Warner Brothers Discovery up more than 4% and up 36% this year. Disney is up more than 4% and up 16% this year. And lastly, Paramount is up 4% today as well, all three of them, and up 19% this year. So, yes, they were all beaten down names last year, but a lot of optimism in the streaming space right now.Not so much the case in tech, of course. Tech layoffs this week causing varying reaction to stocks. Microsoft laid off 10,000 workers and saw shares tumble roughly 3%. Meanwhile, Google's layoffs appear to have had the opposite impact with the shares climbing today. And why that's, I think, really notable is that they're both making layoffs for exactly the same reason. They overhired during the pandemic, which demand was skyrocketing. And now they're simply cutting back because it's a different economy moving forward. Why do you think the stocks reacted so differently?SEANA SMITH: I think in Microsoft's regard, I think it was expected from the Street. Maybe that's why we didn't really see the reaction. A lot of that had already been priced in. But I think Google's cuts really did surprise the Street. When you take a look at the gains that we saw today, significant move to the upside.And when you take a look at some of the analyst commentary that we have gotten out so far, Morgan Stanley was out saying that they do expect the job cuts to save between 3 and 5 billion. They called them a welcome surprise. They say it speaks to Google's ability to really make difficult decisions on how to better manage cash flow.So I think analysts, many analysts weren't necessarily expecting Google to have to come out and slash 12,000 jobs. So I think that's why we're seeing such a bounce up in the stock today, given the cost cuts that the company will get from this.DAVE BRIGGS: Big picture, some wondering if this is a positive Fed story in terms of moving the unemployment rate up. We are still at a 50-year low of 3 and 1/2. And you've got to consider, although these get a lot of headlines, these big tech firms, such a small slice of our employment. You're talking about 10% of the economy in terms of what they make up, but not in terms of the share of the employment in the United States, only about 2%. So really a small slice. Not going to move the needle in terms of what Jerome Powell wants and needs to see. That's the heartless side of the story.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly important to bring up, though. We also want to talk about some of the big banks because Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley both reported on Tuesday. Goldman reporting profits were down nearly 70% on a yearly basis in its most recent quarter. Shares, though, down another 2 and 1/2% today, falling on the news on a Journal report that the Federal Reserve is investigating Goldman's consumer lending business.Of course, this adds to some of the woes facing Goldman right now. I mentioned that 70% drop in profit. Goldman also cutting over 3,000 jobs earlier this month. We know many of that-- many of those jobs coming from its trading and investment banking division, something that Goldman is going to be relying on more so going forward when you take into account it's moving away from that consumer side of its business. But certainly this probe here from the Federal Reserve, what the Journal is reporting, another challenge facing the bank, Dave.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, and that consumer facing the markets, as it's called, really has been the rough, rough go, repeatedly struggling in that area. It'll be-- a sports reference here-- interesting how they make half-time adjustments because now they're going to have to react to what others around them have done. They have led for so long. Now we're going to have to see, with deal-making continually flat lining, how do they adjust to what others are doing, the only one of the big banks to make layoffs. David Solomon said trying to do too much too quickly. Again, that was their largest quarterly miss in more than a decade.On the other hand, Morgan Stanley rising after exceeding earnings expectations this week. The company's wealth management business posted record net revenue of $6.3 billion. That was the difference maker. Wealth Management, they pivoted. They perhaps saw the lack of M&amp;A, the lack of dealmaking ahead, made a move, and it paid off big-time. How will Goldman Sachs follow and react?SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly UBS have called their results, fourth quarter results encouraging. And also what struck me from Morgan Stanley, comparing it to what we've heard from the other banks, was the comments from CEO James Gorman. He was pretty upbeat just in terms of saying that he is very positive with the outlook of Morgan Stanley right now, saying that a Fed pause will boost dealmaking and underwriting activity, really seeing maybe a green light here at the end of this tunnel, some light at the end of the tunnel.But Morgan Stanley clearly the outperformers, especially when you put it up against Goldman Sachs in terms of the numbers that they reported. But like you were saying, almost all that had to do with the wealth management arm.DAVE BRIGGS: All right, and rounding things out with Tesla, seeing positive action this week to its vehicle price cuts after the stock initially dropped on the news last Friday. Wall Street analyst out this week, highlighting that while the move may hurt margins, Teslas are now more affordable and the company should see increased demand moving forward. Piper Sandler writing in a note to clients earlier this week, Tesla can now, quote, ""easily achieve at least 50% delivery growth in 2023.""Now these very same analysts were very critical of the move initially because of the impact on margins and now they've really kind of flipped to applaud the move because it opens up a whole new audience to Teslas that can now afford the car. It'll be interesting to see-- we won't get a look at it in next week's earnings because this is really a Q1 next quarter story. It will be really interesting to see how much those margins are trimmed.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, exactly. And I think that's a key issue here because, yes, they are more optimistic in terms of demand, in terms of Tesla being able to reach some of those delivery targets, but the pressure it's going to have on margins, I think that's still a huge question out there. When you take a look at some of the analyst action, we have seen a number of the price targets lowered on Tesla, at least for right now, with Citi lowering their price target to 137 from 140. Piper Sandler, even though they were optimistic about those deliveries, they did mention the margin pressure here, at least in the short-term.And the average price target on the Street now is just around 192, so substantially higher from where we are today. But that's off more than 30% from the average price target just in November. So really putting that in perspective. And I think analysts still have some questions about that margin pressure and also what demand, even with the price cuts, might look like if we do get a deeper recession than maybe many are expecting.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah. As for the price cuts in China, which preceded ours initially, we thought really adverse reaction, a lot of protests to Tesla factories from people that just bought a Tesla. Dan Ives and Wedbush, though, took a survey, and in China, found nearly 70% responded these recent price cuts have positively influenced their decision to more likely purchase a Tesla Model Y. So it looks like a win in China.]"

Employees across industries have gotten used to remote work, and they want to hold onto it, fighting back against efforts to bring them back into the office, with experts warning that if companies don’t welcome remote work, they risk losing talent.Some companies have fully embraced remote work, going so far as to let go of their office spaces. But many others, including Disney, NewsCorp, and Starbucks have recently put their foot down and demanded that workers come back into the office. Now, the CEO of Morgan Stanley is sharing his own thoughts as well, making clear that working remotely is “not an employee choice.”“They don’t get to choose their compensation, they don’t get to choose their promotion, they don't get to choose to stay home five days a week,” said James Gorman, CEO of Morgan Stanley, in an interview with Bloomberg Thursday in Davos. “I want them with other employees at least three or four days.”However, despite promoting the return to office, Gorman acknowledged that the decision has a lot to do with the specific role of the employee. “There are different kinds of jobs,” he said. “Five days in the office for everybody is not going to happen again.”The investment bank CEO has been vocal about wanting his employees back in the office since the summer of 2021, when he said at a conference that it was time bank employees in New York made it back to the office. He also said he would be “very disappointed” if employees didn’t return in person by September of that year. Then came the Omicron variant, throwing many companies’ well-laid plans out of balance. It forced many banks to adopt a softer stance on when they wanted employees to come back to working in person, especially in their New York offices, including Morgan Stanley. ""I thought we would be out of it by Labor day, past Labor Day. We're not,"" Gorman told CNBC in an interview in December 2021.Gorman has continued to push this year for employees to start returning back to the office. During an event in March 2022, he noted that many people had adopted a mindset of “Jobland” where employees just showed up to work to do the job, versus “Careerland,” in which employees learned and developed skills from in-person interactions.Banks have been among the most aggressive in pushing for in-person work. Last January, Goldman Sachs asked employees to start making their way back into offices per usual, but one year on, the progress hasn’t been great. The investment bank’s U.S. office attendance was between 75% and 80% before the pandemic, and was hovering at about 65% in October 2022.Jan. 20, 3:53 p.m.: This story has been updated with an additional quote from Gorman's interview with Bloomberg.

Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds‘God have mercy on us all’: Robert Kiyosaki warned that the economy is the ‘biggest bubble’ in history and urged investors to dump paper assets — here are 3 real assets he likes instead“I believe economy is the biggest bubble in world history,” he said in a tweet. “God have mercy on us all.”Since a lot of financial assets have gotten cheaper in this market downturn, it might be tempting to buy the dip. But that’s not what Kiyosaki is doing.“Many of you know I do not invest in equities, bonds, ETS or MFs. Please DO NOT listen to what I’m going to say next: ‘I would get out of paper assets’,” he says, adding that the world economy “is not a ‘market.’”Instead, Kiyosaki likes three real assets for protection. Here’s a look at each one of them.Gold and silverPrecious metals — particularly gold and silver — have been a popular hedge against inflation and uncertainty. They can’t be printed out of thin air like fiat money and their value is largely unaffected by economic events around the world.Kiyosaki has long been a fan of gold — he first purchased the yellow metal in 1972.“I’m not buying gold because I like gold, I’m buying gold because I don’t trust the Fed,” he said in an interview last year.Kiyosaki likes silver, too. In fact, he tweeted “Silver best investment in Oct 2022” and “Everyone can afford $20 silver.”To be sure, precious metals weren’t immune to the sell-off that was happening in 2022. That being said, both metals are showing promise so far in 2023 with gold and silver both up around 5% over the past three months.Story continuesWhile there are many ways to gain exposure to gold and silver, Kiyosaki prefers to just buy the metal directly. Earlier in 2022, he tweeted that he only wants “real gold or silver coins” and not ETFs.The author also called silver “a bargain” recently. So it might be time to visit your local bullion shop.BitcoinBitcoin investors have learned the hard way just how volatile it can be.In November 2021, bitcoin reached a high of $68,990. As of Thursday, it was hovering around $32,015.17.But Kiyosaki doesn’t seem bothered by the cryptocurrency’s downturn.“BITCOIN? WORRIED? No,” he writes in a November tweet. “I am a Bitcoin investor as I am an investor in physical gold, silver, &amp; real estate.”In fact, he sees the crypto mayhem as an opportunity.“When BITCOIN hits new bottom, $10 to $12 k? I will get EXCITED, not worried.”Kiyosaki believes in bitcoin for the same reason he loves precious metals: a distrust in our fiat money system and the government.“I bet against the Fed, Treasury, Biden, &amp; bet on [gold], [silver], &amp; Bitcoin,” he explained.In December 2022, he tweeted another reason for his continued interest in the crypto coin.""Bitcoin is classified as a commodity much like gold, silver, and oil. Most crypto tokens are classifed as a security and SEC regulations will crush most of them. I am buying more BC""These days, it’s very easy to tap into bitcoin: you can buy bitcoin directly.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.In a first-day motion in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, Islim provided a breakdown of Genesis’ financial state heading into its restructuring. Genesis became the latest crypto firm caught up in the immediate fallout of FTX’s implosion, with three of its entities – Genesis HoldCo, Genesis Global Capital LLC and Genesis Asia Pacific PTE. LTD – filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection late Thursday.Those entities were perhaps less affected by direct losses to FTX and sister company Alameda than by the “run on the bank” that Islim said their collapse sparked. Customers demanded Genesis repay $827 million in loans, forcing its lending units to freeze withdrawals.“At the same time, Holdco’s corporate parent, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and its various subsidiaries, including DCG International Investments Ltd., were also impacted by the market turmoil and did not have the liquidity to pay back the Company on certain loans, adding pressure to the Debtors’ balance sheets,” Islim said. (DCG is also the parent of CoinDesk.)At least part of the liquidity crunch began months earlier thanks to Genesis’ $1.2 billion loss to crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), which collapsed in the summer of 2022. That loss came out of the Genesis Asia Pacific unit (that also filed for bankruptcy), which managed Genesis’ lending relationship with 3AC. At the time of 3AC going under, Genesis had $2.4 billion in outstanding loans to the fund, of which Genesis was able to recover just half, according to the filing.DCG last year assumed much of that exposure, swapping a 10-year promissory note in exchange for Genesis’ $1.2 billion in claims against 3AC. That note is now at the center of DCG’s public spat with crypto exchange Gemini over the exchange’s yield product Earn, with Gemini being Genesis’ largest creditor at more than $700 million.Story continuesToken Roundup(CoinDesk Research)Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH): The largest cryptocurrency by market value surged above $22,000, and was recently trading as high as $22,419 Friday, its highest level since mid-September.

Also weighing on prices, more traders believed Freeport LNG's liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant in Texas would not return to service until February or later after another vessel turned away from the plant this week. Freeport LNG has said the plant is on track to restart in the second half of January, pending regulatory approvals. Demand for U.S. natural gas should jump once Freeport returns to service after shutting down in June due to a fire. When operating at full power, the facility can pull in around 2.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of gas and turn it into LNG, about 2% of U.S. daily production. U.S. gas stockpiles are about 1% above the five-year (2018-2022) average for this time of year. Analysts expect that will rise to about 5% above normal after this week. Front-month gas futures for February delivery fell 10.1 cents, or 3.1%, to settle at $3.174 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), their lowest since June 10. The weekly decline was about 7%, giving the contract five straight weekly losses for the first time since late October. During those five weeks, the contract has lost over 50%. Meanwhile, recent increases in crude futures to a seven-week high boosted oil's premium over gas to its highest since March 2022. Over the last several years that premium has prompted U.S. energy firms to focus drilling activity on finding more oil instead of gas. The oil-to-gas ratio, or level at which oil trades compared with gas, jumped to 26-to-1 on Friday. So far in 2023, crude has traded about 21 times over gas, much higher than crude's average premium of 15 times gas in 2022 and a five-year average (2018-2022) of 20 times. On an energy equivalent basis, oil should trade only six times over gas. In another sign of fading hopes that extreme cold will eventually supercharge gas prices this winter, the premium on March futures over April , which the industry calls the widow maker, fell to a record low of zero. Gas futures charts were close to falling into contango, with forward prices higher than earlier contracts. Analysts have said that March, the last month of winter when demand for heating fuel is high, should never trade below April, the first month of spring when demand is lower. ""Incredibly, March/April is in danger of trading in contango, which would imply the storage situation is so bloated that the last month of the winter strip March would be trading below the first month of the summer strip April,"" said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho, a bank. The industry calls the March-April spread the ""widow maker"" because rapid price moves resulting from changing weather forecasts have forced some speculators out of business. The Amaranth hedge fund, for instance, lost more than $6 billion on gas futures in 2006.

There's hope that Big Tech is set up for a better year in 2023, but high interest rates, inflation, a hawkish Fed, and spending slowdowns among both advertisers and consumers have created a storm that's not passing just yet.Spotify (SPOT) is the latest of Big Tech's sector leaders to lay off workers in droves. To date, tech's biggest names have slashed more than 50,000 jobs. Here's a roundup of major layoffs that have rattled the sector just a few weeks into the new year.SpotifySpotify announced Monday that it would lay off 6% of its workforce, which shakes out to about 600 affected employees. Additionally, the music streaming giant said that it would reshuffle executives at its highest levels, as Gustav Söderström and Alex Norström move to the position of co-presidents.""In a challenging economic environment, efficiency takes on greater importance,"" Spotify CEO Daniel Ek wrote in a blog post on Monday. ""So, in an effort to drive more efficiency, control costs, and speed up decision-making, I have decided to restructure our organization.""This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.AlphabetGoogle parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) announced recently that it's slashing 12,000 jobs—the company's largest-ever round of layoffs. The layoffs are set to affect the company across the board, but are likely to focus outside the company's core businesses. Layoffs have already affected areas like health-centric group Verily, which Google re-branded from its Life Sciences Division in 2015. Yahoo Finance reported in December that Alphabet was likely to conduct layoffs.Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai told employees in a memo that these layoffs are a byproduct of the massive growth Google was preparing for amid the pandemic – an expansion that never fully materialized.Story continues""Over the past two years we’ve seen periods of dramatic growth,"" he wrote. ""To match and fuel that growth, we hired for a different economic reality than the one we face today,"" he said.Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google Inc. speaks during an event in New Delhi on December 19, 2022. (Photo by Sajjad HUSSAIN / AFP) (Photo by SAJJAD HUSSAIN/AFP via Getty Images)MicrosoftMicrosoft (MSFT) said on Jan. 18 that it's laying off 10,000 workers as it seeks to cut costs. These cuts affect about 4.5% of Microsoft's total corporate workforce of 221,000. The Redmond-based giant reportedly also shed jobs in October, according to Axios, and did a small number of layoffs over the summer.""We’re also seeing organizations in every industry and geography exercise caution as some parts of the world are in a recession and other parts are anticipating one,"" said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in a statement.AmazonThough Amazon began its layoffs last year, CEO Andy Jassy wrote on Jan. 4 that the e-commerce giant plans to lay off 18,000 employees in its corporate workforce. It's an even higher number than company watchers were perhaps expecting, as The New York Times reported that Amazon was laying off 10,000 employees. The company began its cuts back in November, and then as now, it's all about cutting costs.""Amazon has weathered uncertain and difficult economies in the past, and we will continue to do so,"" Jassy told employees in a statement. ""These changes will help us pursue our long-term opportunities with a stronger cost structure.""SalesforceSalesforce (CRM) is laying off about 8,000 workers, or about 10% of its workforce, and the company's simultaneously planning to cut office space.

This marked the crypto company's second major set of layoffs within the last few months, as it also cut jobs back in June. At that time, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said that the company was adjusting to a ""crypto winter"" and preparing for a possible recession.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this customer-management software developer have returned +13.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Salesforce.com falls in, has gained 0.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.36 per share, indicating a change of +61.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.93 points to a change of +3.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.77 indicates a change of +17.2% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Salesforce.com is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for CRM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.99 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $30.92 billion and $34.17 billion estimates indicate +16.7% and +10.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $7.84 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.2%. EPS of $1.40 for the same period compares with $1.27 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.81 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.39%. The EPS surprise was +15.7%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Generally, the benchmark is the S&amp;P 500, which has a beta of 1.0.Historically, stocks with a beta higher than 1.0 are more sensitive to the market’s movements, while those with a beta less than 1.0 are less susceptible.Three low-beta technology stocks – Motorola Solutions Inc. MSI, MongoDB MDB, and Zscaler ZS – could all be considered.Let’s take a closer look at each one.Motorola Solutions Inc. Motorola Solutions is a leader in mission-critical communications products, solutions, and services for communities and businesses. MSI is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).MSI shares provide exposure to technology paired with an income stream; Motorola Solutions’ annual dividend currently yields 1.4%, nicely above its Zacks sector average.Certainly a positive, the company has been committed to increasingly rewarding its shareholders, growing its payout by more than 11% over the last five years.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, MSI’s growth trajectory shouldn’t be ignored; earnings are forecasted to climb nearly 12% in its current fiscal year (FY22) and a further 9% in FY23.The projected earnings growth comes on top of forecasted Y/Y revenue upticks of 9% in FY22 and 6.3% in FY23.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMongoDBMongoDB provides a developer data platform that offers services and tools necessary to build distributed applications at the performance and scale that users demand.Story continuesMDB’s earnings outlook has shifted notably higher over the last several months, helping land the stock into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFurther, MDB carries a strong growth profile; earnings are forecasted to soar more than 150% in its current fiscal year (FY23) and a further 80% in FY24.MDB’s top line is also healthy, with estimates suggesting Y/Y growth of 44% in FY23 and 23% in FY24.And for the cherry on top, MongoDB has a stellar earnings track record; MDB has exceeded earnings and revenue estimates in ten consecutive quarters.Impressively, two of the company’s last three bottom line beats have been by triple-digit percentages.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZscalerZscaler is one of the world's leading providers of cloud-based security solutions, offering a full range of enterprise network security services.Like the stocks above, the company’s earnings outlook has recently improved, helping land ZS into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIncreasing demand for cyber-security solutions has benefitted the company significantly, helping it exceed earnings and revenue estimates in each quarter dating back to 2018.Just in its latest release, Zscaler registered an 11.5% EPS surprise and reported revenue 4.3% above expectations.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineAs we’re all aware, 2022 was packed with volatility, with violent price swings occurring regularly.However, targeting low-beta stocks can help shield investors against volatility, as these stocks are less susceptible to the market’s movements.For those who seek exposure to tech, all three low-beta stocks above – Motorola Solutions Inc. MSI, MongoDB MDB, and Zscaler ZS – fit the criteria.In addition, all three have seen their earnings estimates drift higher as of late, indicating favorable business outlooks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

IDCC has issued preliminary results for the fourth quarter of 2022.Net IncomeInterDigital expects net income for the fourth quarter of 2022 to be approximately $28 million. The company anticipates earnings per share (EPS) to be 93 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and 23 cents higher than the prior-year quarter’s levels. IDCC projects net non-operating income at $1 million.RevenuesThe company expects fourth-quarter revenues to be approximately $114 million, higher than the previous expectation of $98-$102 million.  It includes recurring revenues of $101 million. The higher revenue expectations are mainly induced by new agreements signed in the second half of the quarter. The revenue expectation is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $101 million.Other DetailsUpdating its earlier estimate of $76-$79 million, the company now anticipates operating expenses to be roughly $79 million.

On Tuesday, we get second quarter earnings from Microsoft. Wednesday, we get Q4 reports from Tesla and IBM. And on Thursday, Intel reports its fourth quarter results. So let's go through them one at a time and start with Microsoft. What jumps out to you?SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Dave, it's going to be an interesting quarter here for Microsoft. We know the company just announced 10,000 job cuts. I'm sure the Street will want to hear a little bit more from Satya Nadella just in terms of those cuts, what he thinks that's going to mean for the company here going forward. Revenue growth is expected to be the slowest pace that we have seen in about six years.Also, the company got its first sell rating in more than three years this week. So the Street kind of taking a second look at Microsoft over the past year. We're looking at a one-year chart right now. The stock off just about 20%. So Microsoft, I think a lot of the emphasis is going to be on the earnings call and what we hear from executives there.DAVE BRIGGS: And you know all eyes are on ChatGPT. Interesting to have a conversation earlier about this in terms of you saw Larry Page and Sergey Brin come back, according to the ""New York Times,"" because of the threat that ChatGPT poses to the AI business over there at Alphabet. And we still haven't seen how they're going to monetize ChatGPT. But the theory is, it poses a real threat to Google's search business. Many don't buy that because they don't think there's a realistic challenge from Bing. I happen to agree with that. I think the monetization is going to come elsewhere. And those practical use applications are, quite frankly, endless. All right, to Tesla.SEANA SMITH: To Tesla. Tesla, I think a lot of it's going to be on the call as well. We know that delivery number missed estimates when it-- coming into fourth quarter. That was a huge disappointment for the Street. The price cuts, I think we're going to want to hear a lot more about that, what it has done for demand. It's only been, what, about a week or so far, but what they think it could do for demand going forward. And then, of course, on the negative side, the pressure might be on margins. But again, Tesla still off about 60% in the last year.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: And margins we won't really know. They're probably not going to tell us, and it's more of a Q1 story for the next report. Now, also on Tesla, Elon Musk did take the stand today in California. This is all related to that 2018 tweet claiming that he had lined up the financing to take Tesla private. And Alexis Keenan reporting that he did say this on the stand, ""Difficult to say that the stock price is linked to the tweet.""Asked whether he's aware that Tesla's price stock sometimes goes up or down following his posts, Musk rejected the idea that his tweets could be directly correlated to the stock's behavior. Really? I think he's well aware of the impact his tweets have on stock's behavior.SEANA SMITH: I think so too.DAVE BRIGGS: Not just his own. Look at what he's done with Dogecoin and others.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, I think so too. And will be interesting more of the headlines that come out from that today. Also, Intel is going to be an important one to watch. We talk about the slowdown. And we have certainly seen in the chip sector, that has been reflected in shares, off nearly 30% in the last six months. Some of that contraction, though, in the industry, I think, is expected to pressure the top line here for Intel.Bank of America saying that their estimates, they think it's going to drop about 9%, well below the consensus of a 3% drop. Weaker performance here being flagged by management. But I don't know how much of that has already been priced into the stock. Certainly, some of that rebound might be further out than we had anticipated. Maybe second half of 2023 is a safer bet.DAVE BRIGGS: Pat Gelsinger in Davos telling CNN, ""Where the technology supply chains are and where semiconductors are built is the most important question for the next five decades."" He said it's more important than even oil reserves for the future. So a massive statement on the future for the space from Pat Gelsinger.]"
82,2c95003e-6473-3aec-82ab-a0f2affcd34a,MSFT,2023-01-21,"Stocks moving this week: Netflix, Microsoft, Google, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Tesla",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/stocks-moving-week-netflix-microsoft-213509514.html,1674250509,VIDEO,"['NFLX', 'GOOG', 'GOOGL', 'MS', 'MS-PO', 'MS-PP', 'TSLA', 'GS', 'MSFT']","[Yahoo Finance Live anchors discuss the top stories of the week affecting stocks such as Google, Tesla, Netflix, among others.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: All right, we want to dive a little bit deeper on some of the biggest stories, the biggest stock stories of the week also today. And let's start with Netflix. We're looking at gains of just about 8 and 1/2%, the move higher coming after the company reported quarterly subscriber growth nearly double what the Street had been expecting. Netflix's positive number there outshining the streaming giant shakeup in the C-suite. Co-founder Reed Hastings stepping away from his co-CEO role. It is important to point out, though, he is staying on as chairman, so he's not totally stepping aside here when it comes to Netflix.But Dave, taking a look at the reaction in the stock today, that subscriber number much bigger than I was anticipating, shares hitting the highest level that we've seen since April. The stock has now more than doubled from the low back in May. Safe to say that its new ad tier seems to be working. And then, of course, that strong slate of content is paying off for now.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, literally every hit that you see in the streaming space has been Netflix this year, with the exception of, really, ""Yellowstone."" And that's more of a traditional legacy media. But you look at ""Glass Onion"" has been huge, and ""Wednesday's"" been massive.And they just continue to roll them out, but I was really surprised by the reaction to Reed Hastings because just about every analyst said one of the best CEOs in this country today, and yet they applauded the transition and how they handled it and seem to be very optimistic about them not falling off one bit. So you thought with the applauds would be some more fears that Netflix might lose their way, but that was not the case.SEANA SMITH: No, it doesn't certainly seem to be the case. JPMorgan was out with a note saying that Reed's exit, it does mark the end of an era clearly, but they're expecting a smooth transition. And Hastings saying in that blog post that they have been preparing for this. He's been preparing for it with the board for years. So it seems at least for right now, Wall Street is pretty confident in the direction of the company.Story continuesThis is totally different reaction than what we've seen to Netflix's earnings recently. Evercore was out with the note saying that the new ad tier, the crackdown on password sharing, that those are major catalysts here. And they're very confident that's going to drive a material reacceleration in revenue and EPS growth, something that the Street has been waiting for when it comes to Netflix.DAVE BRIGGS: Really curious to ask a guest coming up here, the author of ""Binge Times,"" what it is about Netflix that might teach other companies in this space that co-CEOS work because they are staying in that co-CEO lane. I do want to mention other streamers seem to gain off of Netflix as well. Warner Brothers Discovery up more than 4% and up 36% this year. Disney is up more than 4% and up 16% this year. And lastly, Paramount is up 4% today as well, all three of them, and up 19% this year. So, yes, they were all beaten down names last year, but a lot of optimism in the streaming space right now.Not so much the case in tech, of course. Tech layoffs this week causing varying reaction to stocks. Microsoft laid off 10,000 workers and saw shares tumble roughly 3%. Meanwhile, Google's layoffs appear to have had the opposite impact with the shares climbing today. And why that's, I think, really notable is that they're both making layoffs for exactly the same reason. They overhired during the pandemic, which demand was skyrocketing. And now they're simply cutting back because it's a different economy moving forward. Why do you think the stocks reacted so differently?SEANA SMITH: I think in Microsoft's regard, I think it was expected from the Street. Maybe that's why we didn't really see the reaction. A lot of that had already been priced in. But I think Google's cuts really did surprise the Street. When you take a look at the gains that we saw today, significant move to the upside.And when you take a look at some of the analyst commentary that we have gotten out so far, Morgan Stanley was out saying that they do expect the job cuts to save between 3 and 5 billion. They called them a welcome surprise. They say it speaks to Google's ability to really make difficult decisions on how to better manage cash flow.So I think analysts, many analysts weren't necessarily expecting Google to have to come out and slash 12,000 jobs. So I think that's why we're seeing such a bounce up in the stock today, given the cost cuts that the company will get from this.DAVE BRIGGS: Big picture, some wondering if this is a positive Fed story in terms of moving the unemployment rate up. We are still at a 50-year low of 3 and 1/2. And you've got to consider, although these get a lot of headlines, these big tech firms, such a small slice of our employment. You're talking about 10% of the economy in terms of what they make up, but not in terms of the share of the employment in the United States, only about 2%. So really a small slice. Not going to move the needle in terms of what Jerome Powell wants and needs to see. That's the heartless side of the story.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly important to bring up, though. We also want to talk about some of the big banks because Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley both reported on Tuesday. Goldman reporting profits were down nearly 70% on a yearly basis in its most recent quarter. Shares, though, down another 2 and 1/2% today, falling on the news on a Journal report that the Federal Reserve is investigating Goldman's consumer lending business.Of course, this adds to some of the woes facing Goldman right now. I mentioned that 70% drop in profit. Goldman also cutting over 3,000 jobs earlier this month. We know many of that-- many of those jobs coming from its trading and investment banking division, something that Goldman is going to be relying on more so going forward when you take into account it's moving away from that consumer side of its business. But certainly this probe here from the Federal Reserve, what the Journal is reporting, another challenge facing the bank, Dave.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, and that consumer facing the markets, as it's called, really has been the rough, rough go, repeatedly struggling in that area. It'll be-- a sports reference here-- interesting how they make half-time adjustments because now they're going to have to react to what others around them have done. They have led for so long. Now we're going to have to see, with deal-making continually flat lining, how do they adjust to what others are doing, the only one of the big banks to make layoffs. David Solomon said trying to do too much too quickly. Again, that was their largest quarterly miss in more than a decade.On the other hand, Morgan Stanley rising after exceeding earnings expectations this week. The company's wealth management business posted record net revenue of $6.3 billion. That was the difference maker. Wealth Management, they pivoted. They perhaps saw the lack of M&amp;A, the lack of dealmaking ahead, made a move, and it paid off big-time. How will Goldman Sachs follow and react?SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly UBS have called their results, fourth quarter results encouraging. And also what struck me from Morgan Stanley, comparing it to what we've heard from the other banks, was the comments from CEO James Gorman. He was pretty upbeat just in terms of saying that he is very positive with the outlook of Morgan Stanley right now, saying that a Fed pause will boost dealmaking and underwriting activity, really seeing maybe a green light here at the end of this tunnel, some light at the end of the tunnel.But Morgan Stanley clearly the outperformers, especially when you put it up against Goldman Sachs in terms of the numbers that they reported. But like you were saying, almost all that had to do with the wealth management arm.DAVE BRIGGS: All right, and rounding things out with Tesla, seeing positive action this week to its vehicle price cuts after the stock initially dropped on the news last Friday. Wall Street analyst out this week, highlighting that while the move may hurt margins, Teslas are now more affordable and the company should see increased demand moving forward. Piper Sandler writing in a note to clients earlier this week, Tesla can now, quote, ""easily achieve at least 50% delivery growth in 2023.""Now these very same analysts were very critical of the move initially because of the impact on margins and now they've really kind of flipped to applaud the move because it opens up a whole new audience to Teslas that can now afford the car. It'll be interesting to see-- we won't get a look at it in next week's earnings because this is really a Q1 next quarter story. It will be really interesting to see how much those margins are trimmed.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, exactly. And I think that's a key issue here because, yes, they are more optimistic in terms of demand, in terms of Tesla being able to reach some of those delivery targets, but the pressure it's going to have on margins, I think that's still a huge question out there. When you take a look at some of the analyst action, we have seen a number of the price targets lowered on Tesla, at least for right now, with Citi lowering their price target to 137 from 140. Piper Sandler, even though they were optimistic about those deliveries, they did mention the margin pressure here, at least in the short-term.And the average price target on the Street now is just around 192, so substantially higher from where we are today. But that's off more than 30% from the average price target just in November. So really putting that in perspective. And I think analysts still have some questions about that margin pressure and also what demand, even with the price cuts, might look like if we do get a deeper recession than maybe many are expecting.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah. As for the price cuts in China, which preceded ours initially, we thought really adverse reaction, a lot of protests to Tesla factories from people that just bought a Tesla. Dan Ives and Wedbush, though, took a survey, and in China, found nearly 70% responded these recent price cuts have positively influenced their decision to more likely purchase a Tesla Model Y. So it looks like a win in China.]"

A new report from ""Business Insider"" says employees in five states have said that the lids, they're not fitting on the cups, which is causing them to fall off when handed to customers here. OK, well, this is, of course, a sticky situation or just one that not as an employee or a customer you want to be in because, God forbid, you're the customer side and you make it all the way out the store, and the lid just falls off. So, I mean, at the end of the day, that's-- I don't know, that's a serious quality issue--JARED BLIKRE: Well, I mean, the cup is supposed to do one thing. It's supposed to hold the liquids. And the lid is supposed to prevent that from spilling. If it's not affixed, then I think this is quality control growing out the window with all the inflation that we had over the last year, year and a half. I think that's going to ameliorate. But also, too, the green movement also propels companies to invest in different technologies. Some of these new materials or different materials don't hold up as well. And it is a sticky situation.BRAD SMITH: No, it's a considerable, I think, quality control measure. And that's some anec data that we've continued to hear from customers out there, too, that seems like quality has deteriorated--JARED BLIKRE: Not job one.BRAD SMITH: Yeah.]"
85,d0e4d9a3-b01b-3684-8b45-98f9c8a50f70,SYY,2023-01-21,Sysco's (NYSE:SYY) Returns Have Hit A Wall,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/syscos-nyse-syy-returns-hit-130019437.html,1674219619,STORY,['SYY'],"[What trends should we look for it we want to identify stocks that can multiply in value over the long term? Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Looking at Sysco (NYSE:SYY), it does have a high ROCE right now, but lets see how returns are trending.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Sysco is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.20 = US$2.6b ÷ (US$22b - US$9.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).So, Sysco has an ROCE of 20%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 11% earned by companies in a similar industry. See our latest analysis for Sysco roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Sysco compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Sysco.The Trend Of ROCEThere hasn't been much to report for Sysco's returns and its level of capital employed because both metrics have been steady for the past five years. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. So while the current operations are delivering respectable returns, unless capital employed increases we'd be hard-pressed to believe it's a multi-bagger going forward. This probably explains why Sysco is paying out 46% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Unless businesses have highly compelling growth opportunities, they'll typically return some money to shareholders.Story continuesOn a side note, Sysco's current liabilities are still rather high at 40% of total assets. This effectively means that suppliers (or short-term creditors) are funding a large portion of the business, so just be aware that this can introduce some elements of risk. Ideally we'd like to see this reduce as that would mean fewer obligations bearing risks.What We Can Learn From Sysco's ROCEIn summary, Sysco isn't compounding its earnings but is generating decent returns on the same amount of capital employed. And with the stock having returned a mere 36% in the last five years to shareholders, you could argue that they're aware of these lackluster trends. As a result, if you're hunting for a multi-bagger, we think you'd have more luck elsewhere.If you'd like to know about the risks facing Sysco, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

The company has been benefiting from the recovery in consumer demand across markets and market share gains. DEO is anticipated to have retained the strength in its business on constant premiumization efforts and favorable industry trends, particularly in the spirits category. However, Diageo has been suffering from persistent inflationary pressures, induced by higher commodity costs, particularly agave, energy expenses and supply disruptions.Notably, the alcoholic beverage company, which reports on a half-yearly basis, posted strong top-line growth, gross margin expansion and productivity savings in fiscal 2022. Effective marketing and exceptional commercial execution further aided the results.We expect the company’s first-half fiscal 2023 total revenues to increase 21.4% year over year in local currency and the bottom line in U.S. dollars to increase 27.4% to $8.05 per share.Diageo plc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Diageo plc Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseDiageo plc price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Diageo plc QuoteKey Factors to NoteStrong consumer demand in the off-trade channel and recovery of the on-trade channel in key markets are likely to have aided Diageo’s top and bottom lines in the first half of fiscal 2022. Recovery in the on-trade channel in North America and Europe, and the partial recovery in Travel Retail have been aiding the price/mix for a while. The robust performance of its super-premium-plus brands, particularly scotch, tequila and Chinese white spirits, is expected to have led to a continued positive mix for Diageo in the first half.Diageo has been well-poised for growth from effective marketing and exceptional commercial execution. It has been investing strongly in marketing and innovation, and leveraging its revenue growth management capabilities, including strategic pricing actions. This is likely to support DEO’s top and bottom-line growth in the to-be-reported period’s results.Moreover, DEO’s margin trends have been favorable, owing to its premiumization efforts, rebound in markets, pricing actions and supply productivity savings, which have been offsetting the cost inflation. Productivity savings, driven by COGS productivity and marketing effectiveness, are expected to aid margin in the first half of fiscal 2023.Although Diageo expects the operating environment to be challenging in fiscal 2023, it remains confident about its business resilience and ability to navigate the headwinds. In the fiscal 2022 earnings call, the company anticipated market growth across North America, Europe and the Asia Pacific in fiscal 2023 to aid the top line. This is likely to get reflected in the first-half performance. It anticipates continued organic operating margin growth for fiscal 2023, aided by strong premiumization trends and operating leverage despite constant.However, the company has been witnessing inflationary pressures, induced by higher commodity costs, particularly agave, energy expenses and supply disruptions. As a substantial portion of Diageo’s business comes from international operations, exchange rate fluctuations have been hampering its sales for a while.While the weakening of sterling against the U.S. dollar and some impacts of emerging market currencies look favorable, Diageo expects adverse currency impacts from hyperinflationary economies, primarily Turkey.Story continuesLooking for Lucrative Picks?

91,2962e52a-04fe-3a50-8c24-8084f948c385,LUV,2023-01-21,Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Will Be Hoping To Turn Its Returns On Capital Around,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/southwest-airlines-nyse-luv-hoping-171549895.html,1674234949,STORY,['LUV'],"[There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Southwest Airlines:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.064 = US$1.6b ÷ (US$36b - US$10b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, Southwest Airlines has an ROCE of 6.4%.  Even though it's in line with the industry average of 6.4%, it's still a low return by itself. See our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Southwest Airlines compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is Southwest Airlines' ROCE Trending?When we looked at the ROCE trend at Southwest Airlines, we didn't gain much confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 20% over the last five years. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. And if the increased capital generates additional returns, the business, and thus shareholders, will benefit in the long run.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Southwest Airlines' ROCEIn summary, despite lower returns in the short term, we're encouraged to see that Southwest Airlines is reinvesting for growth and has higher sales as a result. These growth trends haven't led to growth returns though, since the stock has fallen 38% over the last five years. So we think it'd be worthwhile to look further into this stock given the trends look encouraging.On a final note, we've found   1 warning sign for Southwest Airlines  that we think you should be aware of.While Southwest Airlines isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

This Atlanta-based carrier reported better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues. However, investors were disappointed with the tepid guidance for first-quarter 2023. The downbeat first-quarter 2023 guidance was due to the expectation of high costs.United Airlines UAL, like Delta, surpassed earnings and revenue estimates for fourth-quarter 2022. Riding on upbeat air-travel demand, UAL expects earnings per share in 2023 to increase massively from 2022 actuals.Southwest Airlines LUV was also a news-maker in the past week, courtesy of the pay-related deals inked with two labor groups. Allegiant Travel Company ALGT reported rosy traffic numbers driven by buoyant air traffic.Recap of the Latest Top Stories1 Delta’s fourth-quarter 2022 earnings (excluding 19 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.48 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.29 per share. DAL reported earnings of 22 cents per share a year ago, dull in comparison to the current scenario, as air-travel demand was not so buoyant then. Delta, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), reported revenues of $13,435 million, which also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,030.3 million. Driven by the high air-travel demand, total revenues increased more than 41.87% on a year-over-year basis. Management expects first-quarter 2023 earnings per share in the band of 15-40 cents.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here2. United Airlines reported fourth-quarter 2022 earnings of $2.46 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.07. In the year-ago quarter, UAL had incurred a loss of $1.60 per share when air-travel demand was not as buoyant as in the current scenario. Operating revenues of $12,400 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12,230 million. UAL’s revenues increased 51.37% year over year owing to upbeat air-travel demand. The optimistic air-travel demand scenario is also evident from the fact that total operating revenues increased 13.9% from fourth-quarter 2019 (pre-coronavirus) levels. For the first quarter of 2023, United Airlines expects capacity to improve by around 20% from the year-ago reported figure. Revenues for the March quarter are anticipated to grow almost 50% year over year. Total unit revenues are anticipated to grow almost 25% year over year. UAL expects first-quarter earnings per share in the 50 cents-$1.00 band. UAL forecasts the average aircraft fuel price per gallon to be $3.19 in the first quarter. The adjusted pre-tax margin is expected to be roughly 3% in the March quarter.Story continuesFor 2023, United Airlines expects total unit revenues to remain flat year over year. CASM, excluding fuel, third-party business expenses, profit-sharing and special charges, is expected to remain flat year over year. UAL forecasts the average aircraft fuel price per gallon in the $2.85-$2.90 band for 2023. The adjusted pre-tax margin is expected to be 9%. Adjusted capital expenditures are expected to be around $8.5 billion. Total revenues are anticipated to grow in the high teens versus 2022 actuals. UAL expects 2023 earnings per share in the $10-$12 band.3. Southwest Airlines’ management announced that while its flight instructors approved a new contract, its facilities maintenance technicians inked a provisional deal. Southwest Airlines has 200 plus flight instructors who provide classroom instruction for flight operations and simulator training to pilots (current as well as newly hired ones). The flight instructors are represented by Transport Workers Union Local 557. They reached a tentative agreement with LUV last month. On being put to a vote, a high majority of the instructors voted in favor of the deal. The other positive labor-related update at LUV came when the union (Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association or AMFA), representing its facilities maintenance technicians, reached a tentative pay-related agreement with LUV.Recently, another carrier, Spirit Airlines SAVE received encouraging tidings on the labor front when the union covering its pilots ratified a pay-related deal. That story was covered in detail in last week’s write-up.4. At Allegiant Air, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) for scheduled service increased 5.9 points year over year to 84.7% in December 2022 as the traffic increase was more than the capacity expansion. Moreover, departures improved 2.3% from the December 2021 actuals for scheduled service as well as for total system. In December 2022, Allegiant carried 9.9% more passengers (system-wide) than in December 2021. Capacity (system-wide) increased 2.6% from the year-ago reading. Across the total system, ALGT carried 10.8% more passengers in December 2022 from December 2019 actuals. Departures (system-wide) increased 5.6% from the December 2019 actuals.5. Pilots at Hawaiian Airlines, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Hawaiian Holdings HA, reached a tentative pay-related four-year deal with the company. HA’s pilots are represented by the union, Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA). The agreement, if ratified, will make the pilots eligible for a 32.9% (on an average) pay hike during the tenure of the deal. This includes an average 16.6% pay hike on the date of signing. Other facilities like signing bonus and retirement facilities are also there. The deal, on materialization, would go a long way in improving pilots’ quality of life. However, the new contract still has a long way to go before it becomes effective. The tentative agreement does not necessarily mean that the deal will be operational. The provisional deal will now be put to a vote. The voting procedure will commence on Jan 27 and last for two weeks. The deal will be effective from Mar 2 if the outcome of the voting procedure is favorable.PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe table above shows that almost most airline stocks traded in the red over the past week.

We expect Application Software revenues to increase nearly 1% from the sequential quarter’s reported figure and 7.2% from the year-ago reported number.The Network Software segment is expected to reflect higher revenues on the back of strong performance of the U.S. and Canadian freight matching businesses, as well as strength across the Foundry business, owing to solid innovation capability. For the fourth quarter, ROP expects segmental organic growth of 8-10%.The consensus mark for Network Software segment revenues in the fourth quarter suggests a 1.4% increase from the previous quarter’s reported figure. We expect segmental revenues to inch up 0.8% from the third-quarter reported number and 8.3% from the fourth quarter of 2021 reported figure.The Frontline acquisition, which builds on Roper’s Horizon software business, expanding its presence in the K-12 education market, is expected to have boosted the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter. For the fourth quarter, the company anticipates earnings per share of $3.72-$3.76.However, raw material cost inflation and supply-chain constraints are likely to have dented Roper’s bottom-line performance. Supply-chain disruptions are weighing on demand and ordering activity at the Verathon and Northern Digital business within the Technology Enabled Products segment. This is likely to have affected segmental revenues in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Technology Enabled Products segment revenues in the fourth quarter hints at a 31.1% drop from the sequential quarter’s reported figure.Given Roper’s considerable exposure to overseas markets, adverse foreign currency movements might have impacted the top line.Story continuesWhat Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Roper this time around.

McNulty had an Outperform on PPG Industries, Inc (NYSE: PPG) with a $151.00 price target.PPG posted a solid 4Q beat, exceeding most expectations with stronger-than-expected pricing and volume that, while down, was likely to be modestly better than feared.The 1Q guide was modestly below consensus owing primarily to higher pension exp (noncash) and seems like a low bar set for the new CEO.Expectations were low going into the print, with fears that China and Europe would trip up 4Q and drive an adamant 1Q guide.The analyst believes the results exceeded, the guide was as expected, and the stock should push higher.RBC Capital analyst Arun Viswanathan had a Sector Perform rating and a $129.00 price target.Viswanathan views PPG's guidance as consistent with peers who provided earnings guidance 10-15% below the Street.The analyst views the report as consistent with his recent rating downgrade on PPG due to limited implied upside and volume headwinds in FY'23.KeyBanc analyst Aleksey Yefremov had an Overweight rating and a price target of $144.Higher corporate expenses (due to noncash pension expense) and interest contributed to the 1Q EPS miss vs. the analyst's estimate.The segments' results (ex. corporate expense) appear to be slightly ahead of the analyst's forecast, compelling to encourage investors to look through the ""messy"" accounting in 1Q and focus on the critical trends of improving margins, more resilient than expected volumes, and overall EBITDA growth in 2023.However, pension, interest, and taxes will affect 1Q apart from weak demand in Europe and a higher impact on China business due to COVID. The analyst believes the latter is a short-term issue.PPG continues to see tailwinds from a price and cost perspective and expects margins to track toward normalized levels in 2023.Additionally, the company highlighted strength in its auto refinish and auto OEM businesses, which the analyst view as a positive read-through for competitor AXT Inc (NASDAQ: AXTI).Morgan Stanley analyst Vincent Andrews had an Equal Weight with a $120.00 price target.Andrews expected a mixed response as expectations moved lower for quite some time now, with the buy-side already below the sell-side consensus for 2023.The analyst does not expect the lack of full-year guidance to surprise much, though full-year street numbers will likely continue to move lower in a wide range.The visibility is limited in terms of the entire year 2023 outcome in both China and Europe.Mizuho analyst Christopher Parkinson reiterated Buy with a $142.00 price target.The analyst views the results as Neutral as 1Q guidance is weak on the higher corporate expense, with underlying fundamentals in line and baking-in LSD inflation. The analyst believes the buy-side was also aware that the 1Q consensus is ridiculously stale.Performance Coatings slightly beat expectations but still navigates macro challenges.Parkinson highlighted solid industrial execution with '23 auto expectations still in focus.Price Action: PPG shares traded higher by 6.51% at $131.65 on the last check Friday.Photo Via CompanyStory continuesLatest Ratings for PPGDateFirmActionFromToMar 2022JefferiesMaintainsHoldJan 2022BarclaysMaintainsEqual-WeightJan 2022Deutsche BankMaintainsBuyView More Analyst Ratings for PPGView the Latest Analyst RatingsDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

The trend of subscriber growth is likely continued, led by the streaming giant’s new advertising tier.“The important takeaway is that the new ad-supported tier resulted in retention of subscribers,” Wedbush said in a note, following Netflix’s results. “We expect this phenomenon to repeat itself in the coming year, with the result that we expect Netflix to return to subscriber growth of 17M new users per year.”Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) also racked up gains to help tech advance as investors cheered news the tech giant will cut costs by axing about 12,000 jobs.The move in tech stocks has the runway to continue, some say, as investors are expected to continue rotating away from defensive positions.“These short-term developments suggest investors are rotating away from the defensives- and that a 'risk-on' bias can continue to return even as we move through earnings season and the threat of recession weighs on investors,” Janney Montgomery Scott said.Financials were also in the ascendency powered by a 16% rise in SVB Financial Group (NASDAQ:SIVB) as Wells Fargo talked up the Silicon Valley bank saying it “remains the trusted partner of the innovation economy.Ally Financial (NYSE:ALLY), meanwhile, reported quarterly results that beat on both the top and bottom lines, sending its shares 19% higher.Elsewhere on the earnings front, PPG Industries Inc (NYSE:PPG) reported in-line earnings and revenue that topped estimates as the paint and coatings maker benefited from price hikes.Story continuesTreasury yields, meanwhile, continued to rise even as Federal Reserve officials continued to support further slowing rate hikes ahead of a meeting next month.In other news, the Federal Reserve is reportedly probing Goldman Sachs’ consumer business, Marcus, amid concerns the bank may have failed to implement proper monitoring and safety frameworks to protect customers.Related ArticlesMusk to jury: just because I tweet something, doesn't mean people believe itBrazilian lender Santander's Chairman Rial resigns]"

PPG reported earnings from continuing operations of $1.01 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022, down 9.8% from the prior-year quarter’s earnings of $1.12.PPG posted adjusted earnings of $1.22 per share, reflecting a decline of 3.2% from the year-ago quarter earnings of $1.26. It, however, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14.The bottom line was aided by a recovery of margins across the segments, with a segment earnings growth of more than 20% on a year-over-year basis, driven by selling price increases. However, severe commercial and supply disruptions in China posed a headwind to PPG in the fourth quarter.PPG’s net sales in the fourth quarter were $4,185 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,056.1 million. Net sales declined around 0.1% from $4,190 million reported in the prior-year quarter.

QuoteSegment HighlightsPerformance Coatings: Net sales in this segment were $2,490 million in the reported quarter, down 0.7% year over year. Higher selling prices, which supported the sales in this segment, were offset by lower sales volume, the adverse impact of divestitures, the exit of business in Russia and unfavorable foreign currency translation.The segment reported income of around $272 million, which reflects a rise of 11.9% from prior-year quarter levels. This increase in segment profit was primarily driven by higher selling prices and cost savings from restructuring. However, adverse impact from currencies and elevated manufacturing costs mitigated the positive impact of prices and cost savings.Industrial Coatings: Net sales from this segment were $1,695 million in the fourth quarter, up 0.7% from the year-ago quarter. Net sales for this segment were driven by higher selling prices across all its business, which were offset by lower sales volumes partly due to weaker industrial activities in China and Europe, the exit of business in Russia and unfavorable foreign currency translations.Story continuesSegment income totaled $155 million, up 47.6% year over year. The upside was driven by increased selling prices and cost savings from restructuring but was mitigated by higher raw materials and energy costs, lower sales volume and unfavorable currency.FY22 ResultsAdjusted earnings for full-year 2022 were $6.05 per share compared with $6.77 a year ago. Net sales increased 5% year over year to $17,652 million.FinancialsPPG Industries ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,099 million, up 9.4% year over year.  The company’s long-term debt was $6,503 million, reflecting a decline of 1%.OutlookMoving ahead, the company sees soft economic activity in Europe and China in the first quarter of 2023. However, the company will prioritize supporting customers by providing superior service and products, optimizing inventory levels and executing several cost savings initiatives. It also expects a rebound in demand for its technology-advantaged aerospace products, moderate raw material costs, stable coatings demand in Europe starting in the second quarter and strong economic recovery in China to act as a positive catalyst that will boost earnings.PPG projects adjusted EPS in the band of $1.10-$1.20 for the first quarter, barring amortization expense of 13 cents and costs related to previously approved and communicated business of 2 cents. It also sees reported EPS for the first quarter between 95 cents and $1.05.

(NYSE:GS) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 30th of March to $2.50. This takes the annual payment to 2.9% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Goldman Sachs Group Goldman Sachs Group's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. However, Goldman Sachs Group's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 28.3% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 29% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.historic-dividendGoldman Sachs Group Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.84 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $10.00. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 18% a year over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. It's encouraging to see that Goldman Sachs Group has been growing its earnings per share at 27% a year over the past five years. A low payout ratio gives the company a lot of flexibility, and growing earnings also make it very easy for it to grow the dividend.We Really Like Goldman Sachs Group's DividendIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All of these factors considered, we think this has solid potential as a dividend stock.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Taking the debate a bit further, we've identified 3 warning signs for Goldman Sachs Group that investors need to be conscious of moving forward.

And let's start with Netflix. We're looking at gains of just about 8 and 1/2%, the move higher coming after the company reported quarterly subscriber growth nearly double what the Street had been expecting. Netflix's positive number there outshining the streaming giant shakeup in the C-suite. Co-founder Reed Hastings stepping away from his co-CEO role. It is important to point out, though, he is staying on as chairman, so he's not totally stepping aside here when it comes to Netflix.But Dave, taking a look at the reaction in the stock today, that subscriber number much bigger than I was anticipating, shares hitting the highest level that we've seen since April. The stock has now more than doubled from the low back in May. Safe to say that its new ad tier seems to be working. And then, of course, that strong slate of content is paying off for now.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, literally every hit that you see in the streaming space has been Netflix this year, with the exception of, really, ""Yellowstone."" And that's more of a traditional legacy media. But you look at ""Glass Onion"" has been huge, and ""Wednesday's"" been massive.And they just continue to roll them out, but I was really surprised by the reaction to Reed Hastings because just about every analyst said one of the best CEOs in this country today, and yet they applauded the transition and how they handled it and seem to be very optimistic about them not falling off one bit. So you thought with the applauds would be some more fears that Netflix might lose their way, but that was not the case.SEANA SMITH: No, it doesn't certainly seem to be the case. JPMorgan was out with a note saying that Reed's exit, it does mark the end of an era clearly, but they're expecting a smooth transition. And Hastings saying in that blog post that they have been preparing for this. He's been preparing for it with the board for years. So it seems at least for right now, Wall Street is pretty confident in the direction of the company.Story continuesThis is totally different reaction than what we've seen to Netflix's earnings recently. Evercore was out with the note saying that the new ad tier, the crackdown on password sharing, that those are major catalysts here. And they're very confident that's going to drive a material reacceleration in revenue and EPS growth, something that the Street has been waiting for when it comes to Netflix.DAVE BRIGGS: Really curious to ask a guest coming up here, the author of ""Binge Times,"" what it is about Netflix that might teach other companies in this space that co-CEOS work because they are staying in that co-CEO lane. I do want to mention other streamers seem to gain off of Netflix as well. Warner Brothers Discovery up more than 4% and up 36% this year. Disney is up more than 4% and up 16% this year. And lastly, Paramount is up 4% today as well, all three of them, and up 19% this year. So, yes, they were all beaten down names last year, but a lot of optimism in the streaming space right now.Not so much the case in tech, of course. Tech layoffs this week causing varying reaction to stocks. Microsoft laid off 10,000 workers and saw shares tumble roughly 3%. Meanwhile, Google's layoffs appear to have had the opposite impact with the shares climbing today. And why that's, I think, really notable is that they're both making layoffs for exactly the same reason. They overhired during the pandemic, which demand was skyrocketing. And now they're simply cutting back because it's a different economy moving forward. Why do you think the stocks reacted so differently?SEANA SMITH: I think in Microsoft's regard, I think it was expected from the Street. Maybe that's why we didn't really see the reaction. A lot of that had already been priced in. But I think Google's cuts really did surprise the Street. When you take a look at the gains that we saw today, significant move to the upside.And when you take a look at some of the analyst commentary that we have gotten out so far, Morgan Stanley was out saying that they do expect the job cuts to save between 3 and 5 billion. They called them a welcome surprise. They say it speaks to Google's ability to really make difficult decisions on how to better manage cash flow.So I think analysts, many analysts weren't necessarily expecting Google to have to come out and slash 12,000 jobs. So I think that's why we're seeing such a bounce up in the stock today, given the cost cuts that the company will get from this.DAVE BRIGGS: Big picture, some wondering if this is a positive Fed story in terms of moving the unemployment rate up. We are still at a 50-year low of 3 and 1/2. And you've got to consider, although these get a lot of headlines, these big tech firms, such a small slice of our employment. You're talking about 10% of the economy in terms of what they make up, but not in terms of the share of the employment in the United States, only about 2%. So really a small slice. Not going to move the needle in terms of what Jerome Powell wants and needs to see. That's the heartless side of the story.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly important to bring up, though. We also want to talk about some of the big banks because Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley both reported on Tuesday. Goldman reporting profits were down nearly 70% on a yearly basis in its most recent quarter. Shares, though, down another 2 and 1/2% today, falling on the news on a Journal report that the Federal Reserve is investigating Goldman's consumer lending business.Of course, this adds to some of the woes facing Goldman right now. I mentioned that 70% drop in profit. Goldman also cutting over 3,000 jobs earlier this month. We know many of that-- many of those jobs coming from its trading and investment banking division, something that Goldman is going to be relying on more so going forward when you take into account it's moving away from that consumer side of its business. But certainly this probe here from the Federal Reserve, what the Journal is reporting, another challenge facing the bank, Dave.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, and that consumer facing the markets, as it's called, really has been the rough, rough go, repeatedly struggling in that area. It'll be-- a sports reference here-- interesting how they make half-time adjustments because now they're going to have to react to what others around them have done. They have led for so long. Now we're going to have to see, with deal-making continually flat lining, how do they adjust to what others are doing, the only one of the big banks to make layoffs. David Solomon said trying to do too much too quickly. Again, that was their largest quarterly miss in more than a decade.On the other hand, Morgan Stanley rising after exceeding earnings expectations this week. The company's wealth management business posted record net revenue of $6.3 billion. That was the difference maker. Wealth Management, they pivoted. They perhaps saw the lack of M&amp;A, the lack of dealmaking ahead, made a move, and it paid off big-time. How will Goldman Sachs follow and react?SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly UBS have called their results, fourth quarter results encouraging. And also what struck me from Morgan Stanley, comparing it to what we've heard from the other banks, was the comments from CEO James Gorman. He was pretty upbeat just in terms of saying that he is very positive with the outlook of Morgan Stanley right now, saying that a Fed pause will boost dealmaking and underwriting activity, really seeing maybe a green light here at the end of this tunnel, some light at the end of the tunnel.But Morgan Stanley clearly the outperformers, especially when you put it up against Goldman Sachs in terms of the numbers that they reported. But like you were saying, almost all that had to do with the wealth management arm.DAVE BRIGGS: All right, and rounding things out with Tesla, seeing positive action this week to its vehicle price cuts after the stock initially dropped on the news last Friday. Wall Street analyst out this week, highlighting that while the move may hurt margins, Teslas are now more affordable and the company should see increased demand moving forward. Piper Sandler writing in a note to clients earlier this week, Tesla can now, quote, ""easily achieve at least 50% delivery growth in 2023.""Now these very same analysts were very critical of the move initially because of the impact on margins and now they've really kind of flipped to applaud the move because it opens up a whole new audience to Teslas that can now afford the car. It'll be interesting to see-- we won't get a look at it in next week's earnings because this is really a Q1 next quarter story. It will be really interesting to see how much those margins are trimmed.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, exactly. And I think that's a key issue here because, yes, they are more optimistic in terms of demand, in terms of Tesla being able to reach some of those delivery targets, but the pressure it's going to have on margins, I think that's still a huge question out there. When you take a look at some of the analyst action, we have seen a number of the price targets lowered on Tesla, at least for right now, with Citi lowering their price target to 137 from 140. Piper Sandler, even though they were optimistic about those deliveries, they did mention the margin pressure here, at least in the short-term.And the average price target on the Street now is just around 192, so substantially higher from where we are today. But that's off more than 30% from the average price target just in November. So really putting that in perspective. And I think analysts still have some questions about that margin pressure and also what demand, even with the price cuts, might look like if we do get a deeper recession than maybe many are expecting.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah. As for the price cuts in China, which preceded ours initially, we thought really adverse reaction, a lot of protests to Tesla factories from people that just bought a Tesla. Dan Ives and Wedbush, though, took a survey, and in China, found nearly 70% responded these recent price cuts have positively influenced their decision to more likely purchase a Tesla Model Y. So it looks like a win in China.]"

Let me turn the call over to Mike O'Grady.Photo by Sean Pollock on UnsplashMichael O'Grady: Thank you Jennifer. Let me join in welcoming you to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. I'd like to start by thanking our teams across the company for their strong execution throughout the year in the face of significant global, political and market turmoil. It is our partners' unwavering focus on supporting our clients in uncertain and volatile times like these that truly differentiates Northern Trust. For the full year, revenue was up 5%, including trust fee growth of 2% and our return on average common equity was 12.7%. Excluding the impact of $303 million in charges detailed in the presentation, revenue for the full year grew 8% and our return on equity was 14.9%. Fourth quarter results reflected trends that were consistent with those we saw through the first three quarters of the year, namely on a year-over-year basis weaker markets pressured our trust fees, but this was more than offset by strong increases in net interest income.Story continuesWithin our wealth management business, assets under management and advisory fees grew sequentially in the fourth quarter. Total fees declined, however, due to the lag affect of markets, strategic price reductions in our index funds, and shifts in client allocations out of liquidity products. Overall, new business generation in wealth management was healthy in 2022; however, we did see some deceleration in the second half of the year as market activity waned. We continued to execute on our growth strategy in wealth management, including increasing the size and effectiveness of our sales force, expanding our digital marketing efforts, and leveraging the differentiated capabilities of the Northern Trust Institute. In asset management, assets under management were up sequentially but fees declined due to the outflows we experienced in our liquidity and indexed products as a result of the impact of both weaker markets and clients seeking alternatives.We did see solid increases in alternative funds throughout the year, including year-over-year growth of more than 20% in the fourth quarter. Our ETF complex also continued to perform well with year-over-year organic growth of 12%. Our product launches during the year focused on ESG capabilities, including three new ESG funds in the fourth quarter. Within asset servicing, we delivered a solid finish to the year. We saw healthy momentum throughout the year with our whole office offering as investment managers are increasingly considering outsourced solutions in the face of continued margin pressure and the challenging macroeconomic environment. Whole office integrates our global asset servicing platform with innovative partners facilitating access to new technologies, services and solutions.One recent client win offers an insight into what differentiates us in the marketplace. After an exhaustive RFP process during which we conducted a complete review of a large U.K.-based asset manager's front to back operating model, we were selected to provide a holistic full suite of core asset servicing, capital markets and data, and analytics products and services. This client was particularly impressed with our ability to digitalize their investment process to maximize the value of their data. We learned that this client chose us because of our combination of market-leading tools and first rate client service. We also saw continued strong demand for our integrated trading solutions offering throughout both the quarter and the year. In 2022, the number of clients on the platform increased 20% year-over-year to nearly 100.Our transition backlog that we spoke to you about last quarter started to transition in during the fourth quarter and our pipeline remains strong. Expense growth continued to be elevated in the quarter, reflecting investments in people and technology to strengthen our resiliency, advance our digital modernization efforts, and drive growth in the business, all critical initiatives but the level of growth is too high. Some of the charges we announced today reflect early steps we are taking to bring down the trajectory to better align with the current operating environment and create capacity for profitable growth. To underscore our commitment, we recently launched a dedicated office of productivity to reinforce our approach to driving efficiencies throughout the company.Jason will provide more color on this in his prepared remarks. In closing, as we begin 2023, we remain well positioned to navigate the ongoing macroeconomic and market uncertainty from a position of strength. Our focus is on driving organic growth, improving our productivity, and continuing to bolster our foundations. I'll now turn the call over to Jason.See also 15 Largest Plastic Manufacturing Companies in the World and 14 Countries Where Official Language is English.Jason Tyler: Thank you Mike, and let me join Jennifer and Mike in welcoming you to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. Let's dive into the financial results of the quarter, starting on Page 2. This morning, we reported fourth quarter net income of $155.7 million. Earnings per share were $0.71 and our return on average common equity was 5.9%. Our results were unfortunately impacted by the inclusion of $266 million in pre-tax charges which reflect $199 million in net income impact and $0.94 in earnings per share impact. These charges included the following on a pre-tax basis: $213 million of investment security losses related to the intent to sell certain available for sale debt securities, which were subsequently sold in early January; $32 million of severance-related charges; $14 million of occupancy charges related to early lease exits, and $6.8 million of pension settlement charges.Also recall that in the first quarter of this year, we implemented an accounting reclassification of certain fees which continues to impact the year-over-year comparisons, as noted on this page. Let's move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the quarter. Including the charges previously mentioned, year-over-year revenue was down 8%. Expenses increased 13% and net income was down 62%. In the sequential comparison, revenue was down 13%, expenses were up 8%, while net income was down 61%. Excluding the charges previously mentioned, year-over-year revenue was up 5% and expenses increased 9%. Excluding the charges previously mentioned, on a sequential basis revenue was down 1% and expenses were up 5%. Let's look at the results in greater detail, starting with revenue on Page 4.Year-over-year unfavorable currency translation reduced our revenue growth by approximately 200 basis points. Trust, investment and other servicing fees representing the largest component of our revenue totaled $1 billion and were down 6% from last year and down 3% sequentially. Our trust fees continued to be unfavorably impacted by the weaker equity and fixed income markets and unfavorable currency movements. As a reminder, a significant portion of our trust fees are recorded on a month or quarter lag basis, so this quarter's performance is largely reflective of the third quarter's market performance as well as the months of October and November. The year-over-year and sequential declines in all other remaining non-interest income are primarily driven by the $213 million pre-tax investment security loss due to the intent to sell certain available for sale debt securities.These securities were subsequently sold in early January 2023, which I'll describe in more detail in a few minutes. Net interest income on an FTE basis, which I'll also discuss in more detail later, was $550 million and was up 48% from a year ago and up 5% sequentially. Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our asset servicing business, fees totaled $588 million and were down 6% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. Within asset servicing, custody and fund administration fees were $406 million, down 11% year-over-year but importantly they were flat sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees decreased from the prior year quarter primarily due to unfavorable markets and unfavorable currency translations, partially offset by new business.Assets under custody and administration for asset servicing clients were $13 trillion at quarter end, down 16% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by unfavorable markets and currency translation. The sequential increase was primarily driven by favorable markets and currency translation. Investment management fees within asset servicing were $124 million, up 9% year-over-year and down 9% sequentially. Investment management fees decreased sequentially primarily due to asset outflows and unfavorable markets. Investment management fees increased from the prior year quarter primarily due to lower money market fund fee waivers partially offset by asset outflows and unfavorable markets. Assets under management for asset servicing clients were $898 billion, down 25% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially.The year-over-year decline was driven by asset outflows, weaker equity and fixed income markets, and unfavorable currency translation. The sequential growth was driven by favorable markets and currency translation partially offset by asset outflows. Moving to our wealth management business, trust, investment and other servicing fees were $454 million, down 7% compared to the prior year and down 5% from the prior quarter. Within the regions, the year-over-year declines were primarily driven by unfavorable market impacts and asset outflows partially offset by the elimination of money market fund fee waivers. Sequentially the decline within the regions was primarily driven by unfavorable markets, asset outflows, and a strategic re-pricing initiative.With global family office, the year-over-year growth was driven by lower fee waivers and new business, partially offset by unfavorable markets. The sequential decrease was mainly related to asset outflows, unfavorable markets, and the re-pricing initiative. Assets under management for our wealth management clients were $351 billion at quarter end, down 16% year-over-year and up 5% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year decline was driven by primarily by unfavorable markets and asset outflows. The sequential increase was primarily due to favorable markets. Moving to Page 6, net interest income was $550 million in the quarter and was up 48% from the prior year. Earnings assets averaged $134 billion in the quarter, down 10% versus the prior year.Average deposits were $116 billion and were down 14% versus the prior year, while loan balances averaged $42 billion, up 6% compared to the prior year. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income grew 5%. Average earnings assets were up 1%. Average deposits declined 2% while average loan balances were up 2%. The net interest margin was 1.63% in the quarter, up 64 basis points from a year ago and up 5 basis points from the prior quarter. The prior year quarter increase is primarily due to higher average interest rates. The sequential increase is primarily due to higher average interest rates partially offset by an unfavorable balance sheet mix. Turning to Page 7, on a year-over-year basis expense growth benefited by approximately 300 basis points due to currency translation.As reported, expenses were $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter, 13% higher than the prior year and 8% higher than the prior quarter. The current quarter's expenses included $53 million in charges. These charges in part reflect steps we're taking in conjunction with the launch of our office of productivity. To shift away, we approach and manage our expenses. Through this initiative, we expect to leverage data and analytics to help us better understand the efficacy of our spending so as to optimize our cost base and drive greater efficiencies throughout the organization. We'll update you on our progress in the coming quarters as appropriate. Excluding charges in both periods, expenses in the fourth quarter were up 10% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially.Also, recall that the current quarter includes the impact of the previously mentioned accounting reclassification, which increased other operating expense by $8.6 million compared to the prior year. Compensation expense was up 15% compared to the prior year and up 6% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by higher salary expense in part due to inflationary pressures, and the previously mentioned severance-related charges partially offset by favorable currency translation. The sequential increase is primarily due to the aforementioned severance-related charges and higher salary expense, partially offset by lower incentives. Employee benefits expense was down 4% compared to the prior quarter and down 6% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by lower ongoing pension expense partially offset by higher medical costs.The sequential decrease was primarily due to lower pension costs, including the lower pension settlement charge relative to the prior period partially offset by higher medical costs. Outside services expense was $233 million and was up 4% from a year ago and up 5% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher technical services costs, legal services and consulting services, partially offset by lower third party advisory fees and sub-custodian expense. The sequential increase was primarily due to higher technical services costs and legal services, partially offset by lower sub-custodian expense and consulting costs. Equipment and software expense of $229 million was up 17% from a year ago and up 8% sequentially. The year-over-year and sequential growth are both primarily driven by higher software costs due to continued investments in technology as well as inflationary pressures, and higher amortization.We also recognized a $3.8 million termination charge associated with our mainframe strategy. Occupancy expense of $66 million was up 27% from a year ago and up 28% sequentially. The year-over-year and sequential growth were both primarily driven by the previously mentioned $14 million of charges related to early lease exits. Other operating expense of $108 million was up 37% from a year ago and up 31% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher staff-related expense, business promotion, and miscellaneous expense. The sequential increase is primarily due to higher business promotion, supplemental compensation plan expense, and miscellaneous expenses in the current period. Turning to the full year, our results in 2022 are summarized on Page 8.On the right margin of this page, we outline the charges that we called out for both years. Included in these items, net income was $1.3 billion, down 14% compared to 2021, and earnings per share were $6.14, down 14% from the prior year. In 2022, these charges had a $227 million impact on net income and a $1.08 impact on earnings per share. In 2021, these charges had an $18 million impact on net income and a $0.07 impact on earnings per share. Full year revenue and expense trends are outlined on Page 9 and include the charges previously mentioned. Trust, investment and other servicing fees grew 2% in 2022. The growth during the year was primarily driven by lower money market fee waivers and new business, partially offset by unfavorable markets and unfavorable currency translation.Net interest income grew 36%. Average earnings assets during the year decreased by 10% while the net interest margin increased 64 basis points, driven by higher average interest rates. The net result was revenue growth of 5% in 2022 compared to 2021 and expense growth of 10%. Excluding these charges in both periods, revenue for the full year was up 8% from the prior year and expenses were up 9%. Turning to Page 10, our capital ratios remain strong with our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.8% under the standardized approach, up from the prior quarter's 10.1%. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 7.1%, up from 7% in the prior quarter. A decrease in net unrealized losses in the available for sale securities portfolio and less foreign exchange volatility were the primary factors in this quarter's increase in capital ratios.Accumulated other comprehensive income at the end of the quarter was a loss of $1.6 billion. During the quarter, we returned $158.9 million to common shareholders through cash dividends of $158.8 million and share repurchases of $0.1 million. In early January of this year, we sold $2.1 billion of higher capital consuming, lower yielding, non-HQLA debt securities and reinvested the proceeds into lower capital consuming, higher yielding HQLA assets.

121,d2206235-88b6-3fae-abd3-8ceae88b5173,AIG,2023-01-21,5 Insurance Stocks Likely to Zoom Past Q4 Earnings Estimates,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-insurance-stocks-likely-zoom-134001255.html,1674222001,STORY,"['VOYA', 'AIG', 'AFL', 'MMC', 'RE']","[Improved pricing, new products and services, rising interest rates, and accelerated digitalization efforts are expected to have been the highlights of the insurance industry in the fourth quarter of 2022. The insurance players are part of the broader Zacks Finance sector (one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification). Technological improvements and adoptions are expected to have lowered costs and improved efficiency for companies like Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. MMC, American International Group, Inc. AIG, Aflac Incorporated AFL, Everest Re Group, Ltd. RE and Voya Financial, Inc. VOYA.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have identified five companies, MMC, AIG, AFL, REand VOYA, which are poised to outpace the Zacks Consensus Estimate in fourth-quarter earnings. These stocks have the ideal combination of two ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy), #3 (Hold) — to surpass expectations. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Before we get into the details of factors that are anticipated to have influenced the fourth-quarter performance, let’s take a look at the sector projections.Per the latest Earnings Preview, the finance sector’s fourth-quarter 2022 earnings are estimated to decline 9.2%, while revenues are expected to increase 2.7%. Rising interest rates, growing awareness, scaling of businesses and other factors are expected to have supported the industry players’ top-line growth.Factors Shaping Q4 ResultsIn the fourth quarter, the insurance players are expected to have witnessed improved pricing. An active catastrophe environment and growing awareness are likely to have triggered the policy renewal rate and supported pricing growth. Favorable reserve development and robust capital levels are anticipated to have boosted the companies’ underwriting profitability.Story continuesThe significant winter storm of late December resulted in massive catastrophe losses for some insurers, which weighed on their quarterly performances. For example, The Allstate Corporation alone incurred estimated catastrophe losses of $478 million from the Winter Storm Elliott. This can give an idea about how the property and casualty stocks suffered in the quarter.However, auto and home insurance premiums are expected to have increased significantly in the quarter under review, providing some respite to the industry players. The insurers facing increased expenses due to supply-chain woes, the shortage of microchips and auto replacement parts opted for auto rate hikes. This is expected to have boosted fourth-quarter premiums.Inflationary pressures are expected to have triggered households to hedge against inflation and complement public health coverage with health insurances, which aided the health insurers. Insurance brokerage companies are expected to have gained from global expansions, increasing rates, tightening underwriting standards and cost-control efforts.The high interest rate environment is likely to have aided the insurers’ investment yields. Rate-sensitive investments and alternative investments in private equity, hedge funds, and real estate, among others, are expected to have benefited the companies’ investment income.Rising demand for protection products and policies with “living” benefits are likely to have boosted life insurers’ sales figures. Accelerated digitalization efforts are expected to have saved costs, improved operating efficiency and driven margin expansion for the insurance players.Potential Q4 OutperformersBelow we list five insurance stocks that have the right mix of elements to pull off a beat this earnings season.Based in New York, Marsh &amp; McLennan is a globally leading insurance broker. Solid performances of the Risk and Insurance Services, and Consulting businesses are anticipated to have driven its fourth-quarter 2022 earnings, partially offset by higher costs. New business generation and solid retention rates are likely to have aided its performance in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Marsh &amp; McLennan’s fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.40 per share, suggesting an increase of 2.9% from the year-ago reported figure. It beat earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average of 3.2%. MMC has an Earnings ESP of +2.72% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present.

127,fc3b40b8-52e5-3462-ba2d-3f890535f77e,NFLX,2023-01-21,Netflix’s Reed Hastings has made it clear ‘he’s not going anywhere’: Reporter,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/netflix-reed-hastings-made-clear-213650384.html,1674250610,VIDEO,['NFLX'],"[Dawn Chmielewski, Reuters U.S. Entertainment Business Correspondent and “Binge Times” Co-Author, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss Netflix's outlook following news of co-founder Reed Hastings stepping down as CEO, the platform's new leadership, and acquisition possibilities for the streaming service.Video TranscriptDAVE BRIGGS: Shares of Netflix surging today just about 8.5% on a stellar earnings report in which the streaming giant added more than 7 million subscribers-- up big time more, than twice that this year. The headline, however, remains CEO Reed Hastings stepping down as co-CEO. Joining us now is Dawn Chmielewski, ""Reuters"" US Entertainment Business Correspondent and Co-Author of ""Binge Times.""Nice to see you. So let's talk about this Reed Hastings departure-- going to stay on as chairman. Greg Peters, COO, will join Sarandos as co-CEO. What do you make of the transition and how they handled it?DAWN CHMIELEWSKI: Well, I think it's gotten rather enthusiastic response from the investment community. So Netflix has been planning for this for a decade, or so they say. And 2 and 1/2 years ago, Ted Sarandos, who has long been the content chief at Netflix, was elevated to a new role of co-CEO.And his now co-CEO Greg Peters was elevated to a chief operating officer-- operating role like 2 and 1/2 years ago. So these executives have been working together for 2 and 1/2 years. There doesn't appear to be any sort of conflict. So this transition translated to the Street as being a really smooth transition from the company's co-founder to two executives who've been working together for 15 years and in this leadership role for the last 2 and 1/2. So it wasn't a particularly jarring transition. It seems, in fact, more effortless than some media-- some of their media peers here in Hollywood.SEANA SMITH: Dawn, I think maybe the question here is whether or not this is going to change the culture at all. Because when it comes to Netflix's culture, it's really been a standout among Silicon Valley-- 125-page slide deck that describes its culture has been downloaded 17 million times. So it really just shows the interest in Netflix's culture. Are you expecting that to change at all?Story continuesDAWN CHMIELEWSKI: So that was a key question that we were examining. As you know, Reed Hastings credits this company's very distinct culture-- it has a performance culture, it invests a lot of autonomy in its executives. And Reed credits this sort of independence that it affords these high performing executives who come to the company with the company's success.But in interviews yesterday with Jessica Ehrlich during Netflix's earnings video, the new co-CEOs sought to assure the Street that everything-- nothing will change. That they will attempt to adhere to the culture that Reed Hastings created and that they've worked within for well more than a decade. So they say no changes ahead, which, perhaps, explains how the market is reacting.DAVE BRIGGS: And no changes in terms of the co-CEO role, which you really don't see anyone else in that space do. Is that-- obviously, content is king, but is that part of the special sauce there at Netflix? Why does it work so well for them?DAWN CHMIELEWSKI: So it's really interesting-- as you know, the history of co-CEOs is not always a stellar one in the tech world. Oracle, for example, had co-CEOs not that long ago, ditto for salesforce.com. And it doesn't always work out.In this case, you have two executives with clearly delineated roles. You have Ted Sarandos, who is the architect of Netflix's drive into original content, and you have Greg Peters, who has more of a technical orientation, who is credited with helping Netflix rather quickly launch an ad-supported version of its service. He is behind the initiative-- Netflix initiative to get into games. So he has a much more technical orientation. And these two are seen as having complementary skills.SEANA SMITH: Dawn, from your coverage of Reed Hastings, everything you know about him, obviously, extremely invested in Netflix given that he's a co-founder, been with the company since the start-- over 20 years. Now that he's chairman, I guess how much do you really see him stepping aside versus his involvement with the company still?DAWN CHMIELEWSKI: Well, Reed Hastings in his message to investors was explicit in saying that he's not going anywhere. He will remain attentive to the company that he helped found, that he will be paying careful attention to the company's stock price, and will no doubt play a role in helping inform the company's direction for some time to come. He is handing over the reins of daily day-to-day operation to two trusted deputies who have already demonstrated their ability to lead the company.DAVE BRIGGS: Netflix has been mentioned in about a handful of names that could potentially acquire WWE, which makes sense when you compare the market cap is basically about four seasons of NFL rights. Could they be in that conversation? Or will 2023 for Netflix be defined by what, do you think?DAWN CHMIELEWSKI: So I think Ted Sarandos has actually addressed the question about sports very directly. And I believe it was during a UBS conference fairly recently. So Ted is saying, look, I'm not going to say we'll never get into sports content.And, indeed, Netflix has had some success with dramatic programming built around sports, like its Formula One series was very successful and actually spurred interest in the racing sport. But Ted has said, we don't need to have sports rights to continue to grow our business, at least not in the near-term. And he's also said that those rights are expensive compared with the other the cost of other sorts of content that attract subscribers.DAVE BRIGGS: But I'm not talking about sports rights.DAWN CHMIELEWSKI: At least recently, you know, Ted has signaled they're not they're not in the sports-- not in the bidding for sports rights.DAVE BRIGGS: But, one, WWE is not a sport, I think it's more of an entertainment.

128,2c95003e-6473-3aec-82ab-a0f2affcd34a,NFLX,2023-01-21,"Stocks moving this week: Netflix, Microsoft, Google, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Tesla",Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/stocks-moving-week-netflix-microsoft-213509514.html,1674250509,VIDEO,"['NFLX', 'GOOG', 'GOOGL', 'MS', 'MS-PO', 'MS-PP', 'TSLA', 'GS', 'MSFT']","[Yahoo Finance Live anchors discuss the top stories of the week affecting stocks such as Google, Tesla, Netflix, among others.Video TranscriptSEANA SMITH: All right, we want to dive a little bit deeper on some of the biggest stories, the biggest stock stories of the week also today. And let's start with Netflix. We're looking at gains of just about 8 and 1/2%, the move higher coming after the company reported quarterly subscriber growth nearly double what the Street had been expecting. Netflix's positive number there outshining the streaming giant shakeup in the C-suite. Co-founder Reed Hastings stepping away from his co-CEO role. It is important to point out, though, he is staying on as chairman, so he's not totally stepping aside here when it comes to Netflix.But Dave, taking a look at the reaction in the stock today, that subscriber number much bigger than I was anticipating, shares hitting the highest level that we've seen since April. The stock has now more than doubled from the low back in May. Safe to say that its new ad tier seems to be working. And then, of course, that strong slate of content is paying off for now.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, literally every hit that you see in the streaming space has been Netflix this year, with the exception of, really, ""Yellowstone."" And that's more of a traditional legacy media. But you look at ""Glass Onion"" has been huge, and ""Wednesday's"" been massive.And they just continue to roll them out, but I was really surprised by the reaction to Reed Hastings because just about every analyst said one of the best CEOs in this country today, and yet they applauded the transition and how they handled it and seem to be very optimistic about them not falling off one bit. So you thought with the applauds would be some more fears that Netflix might lose their way, but that was not the case.SEANA SMITH: No, it doesn't certainly seem to be the case. JPMorgan was out with a note saying that Reed's exit, it does mark the end of an era clearly, but they're expecting a smooth transition. And Hastings saying in that blog post that they have been preparing for this. He's been preparing for it with the board for years. So it seems at least for right now, Wall Street is pretty confident in the direction of the company.Story continuesThis is totally different reaction than what we've seen to Netflix's earnings recently. Evercore was out with the note saying that the new ad tier, the crackdown on password sharing, that those are major catalysts here. And they're very confident that's going to drive a material reacceleration in revenue and EPS growth, something that the Street has been waiting for when it comes to Netflix.DAVE BRIGGS: Really curious to ask a guest coming up here, the author of ""Binge Times,"" what it is about Netflix that might teach other companies in this space that co-CEOS work because they are staying in that co-CEO lane. I do want to mention other streamers seem to gain off of Netflix as well. Warner Brothers Discovery up more than 4% and up 36% this year. Disney is up more than 4% and up 16% this year. And lastly, Paramount is up 4% today as well, all three of them, and up 19% this year. So, yes, they were all beaten down names last year, but a lot of optimism in the streaming space right now.Not so much the case in tech, of course. Tech layoffs this week causing varying reaction to stocks. Microsoft laid off 10,000 workers and saw shares tumble roughly 3%. Meanwhile, Google's layoffs appear to have had the opposite impact with the shares climbing today. And why that's, I think, really notable is that they're both making layoffs for exactly the same reason. They overhired during the pandemic, which demand was skyrocketing. And now they're simply cutting back because it's a different economy moving forward. Why do you think the stocks reacted so differently?SEANA SMITH: I think in Microsoft's regard, I think it was expected from the Street. Maybe that's why we didn't really see the reaction. A lot of that had already been priced in. But I think Google's cuts really did surprise the Street. When you take a look at the gains that we saw today, significant move to the upside.And when you take a look at some of the analyst commentary that we have gotten out so far, Morgan Stanley was out saying that they do expect the job cuts to save between 3 and 5 billion. They called them a welcome surprise. They say it speaks to Google's ability to really make difficult decisions on how to better manage cash flow.So I think analysts, many analysts weren't necessarily expecting Google to have to come out and slash 12,000 jobs. So I think that's why we're seeing such a bounce up in the stock today, given the cost cuts that the company will get from this.DAVE BRIGGS: Big picture, some wondering if this is a positive Fed story in terms of moving the unemployment rate up. We are still at a 50-year low of 3 and 1/2. And you've got to consider, although these get a lot of headlines, these big tech firms, such a small slice of our employment. You're talking about 10% of the economy in terms of what they make up, but not in terms of the share of the employment in the United States, only about 2%. So really a small slice. Not going to move the needle in terms of what Jerome Powell wants and needs to see. That's the heartless side of the story.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly important to bring up, though. We also want to talk about some of the big banks because Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley both reported on Tuesday. Goldman reporting profits were down nearly 70% on a yearly basis in its most recent quarter. Shares, though, down another 2 and 1/2% today, falling on the news on a Journal report that the Federal Reserve is investigating Goldman's consumer lending business.Of course, this adds to some of the woes facing Goldman right now. I mentioned that 70% drop in profit. Goldman also cutting over 3,000 jobs earlier this month. We know many of that-- many of those jobs coming from its trading and investment banking division, something that Goldman is going to be relying on more so going forward when you take into account it's moving away from that consumer side of its business. But certainly this probe here from the Federal Reserve, what the Journal is reporting, another challenge facing the bank, Dave.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah, and that consumer facing the markets, as it's called, really has been the rough, rough go, repeatedly struggling in that area. It'll be-- a sports reference here-- interesting how they make half-time adjustments because now they're going to have to react to what others around them have done. They have led for so long. Now we're going to have to see, with deal-making continually flat lining, how do they adjust to what others are doing, the only one of the big banks to make layoffs. David Solomon said trying to do too much too quickly. Again, that was their largest quarterly miss in more than a decade.On the other hand, Morgan Stanley rising after exceeding earnings expectations this week. The company's wealth management business posted record net revenue of $6.3 billion. That was the difference maker. Wealth Management, they pivoted. They perhaps saw the lack of M&amp;A, the lack of dealmaking ahead, made a move, and it paid off big-time. How will Goldman Sachs follow and react?SEANA SMITH: Yeah, certainly UBS have called their results, fourth quarter results encouraging. And also what struck me from Morgan Stanley, comparing it to what we've heard from the other banks, was the comments from CEO James Gorman. He was pretty upbeat just in terms of saying that he is very positive with the outlook of Morgan Stanley right now, saying that a Fed pause will boost dealmaking and underwriting activity, really seeing maybe a green light here at the end of this tunnel, some light at the end of the tunnel.But Morgan Stanley clearly the outperformers, especially when you put it up against Goldman Sachs in terms of the numbers that they reported. But like you were saying, almost all that had to do with the wealth management arm.DAVE BRIGGS: All right, and rounding things out with Tesla, seeing positive action this week to its vehicle price cuts after the stock initially dropped on the news last Friday. Wall Street analyst out this week, highlighting that while the move may hurt margins, Teslas are now more affordable and the company should see increased demand moving forward. Piper Sandler writing in a note to clients earlier this week, Tesla can now, quote, ""easily achieve at least 50% delivery growth in 2023.""Now these very same analysts were very critical of the move initially because of the impact on margins and now they've really kind of flipped to applaud the move because it opens up a whole new audience to Teslas that can now afford the car. It'll be interesting to see-- we won't get a look at it in next week's earnings because this is really a Q1 next quarter story. It will be really interesting to see how much those margins are trimmed.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, exactly. And I think that's a key issue here because, yes, they are more optimistic in terms of demand, in terms of Tesla being able to reach some of those delivery targets, but the pressure it's going to have on margins, I think that's still a huge question out there. When you take a look at some of the analyst action, we have seen a number of the price targets lowered on Tesla, at least for right now, with Citi lowering their price target to 137 from 140. Piper Sandler, even though they were optimistic about those deliveries, they did mention the margin pressure here, at least in the short-term.And the average price target on the Street now is just around 192, so substantially higher from where we are today. But that's off more than 30% from the average price target just in November. So really putting that in perspective. And I think analysts still have some questions about that margin pressure and also what demand, even with the price cuts, might look like if we do get a deeper recession than maybe many are expecting.DAVE BRIGGS: Yeah. As for the price cuts in China, which preceded ours initially, we thought really adverse reaction, a lot of protests to Tesla factories from people that just bought a Tesla. Dan Ives and Wedbush, though, took a survey, and in China, found nearly 70% responded these recent price cuts have positively influenced their decision to more likely purchase a Tesla Model Y. So it looks like a win in China.]"

Insiders would probably have been better off holding on to their shares given that the average selling price of US$246 is still lower than the current share price.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Amgen Amgen Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP, Jonathan Graham, sold US$3.3m worth of shares at a price of US$242 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$263, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was only 40% of Jonathan Graham's holding.Insiders in Amgen didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Amgen Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Amgen shares. In total, insiders sold US$273k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesDoes Amgen Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Amgen insiders own about US$221m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Amgen Tell Us?Insiders haven't bought Amgen stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. On the plus side, Amgen makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing.

In the same way, growth investors often end up investing in expensive stocks. Going by Warren Buffett, these two approaches are joined at the hip.Accordingly, some investors sought to join the bridge between value and growth with a hybrid strategy of investment. Their theory suggests that to make a long-term investment more effective, the principles of both value and growth strategies need to be combined.GARP (growth at a reasonable price) investment, often known as a special case of value investment, is gaining popularity. What GARPers look for is whether the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential (Investopedia).Several stocks, which have surged significantly in the recent past, show an overwhelming success of this hybrid investing strategy over pure-play value and growth investments. Here we will discuss the success of five such stocks. These include Conagra Brands, Teck Resources, SAP SE, Deutsche Bank AG and NRG Energy.A Few More Words on GARPOne of the fundamental metrics for finding GARP is the price/earnings growth ratio (PEG). Although it is categorized under value investing, this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing.The PEG ratio is defined as (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks P/E ratio with the future earnings growth rate.While P/E alone only gives an idea of stocks that are trading at a discount, PEG, while adding the growth element to it, helps to identify stocks that have solid future potential.A lower PEG ratio, preferably less than 1, is always better for GARP investors.Story continuesSay for example, if a stock's P/E ratio is 10 and the expected long-term growth rate is 15%, the company's PEG will come down to 0.66, a ratio that indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential.However, the question that often arises is whether the market has an adequate number of companies that are growing earnings while trading at reasonable valuations? Going by a CFA Institute Blog by Nicolas Rabener, ""on average, 38% of all stocks exhibit a PEG ratio below 1, which is more than enough for security selection.""Unfortunately, this ratio is often neglected due to investors' limitations in calculating the future earnings growth rate of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though. It does not consider the common situation of changing growth rates, such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are the five out of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening:Conagra Brands: Chicago-based Conagra Brands is one of the leading branded food companies of North America. The company offers premium edible products, with a refined focus on innovation.

Teck Resources' principal products include steelmaking coal; copper concentrates and refined copper cathodes; refined zinc and zinc concentrates; energy products, such as bitumen; and lead concentrates. It also produces molybdenum, gold, silver, germanium, indium, mercury, and cadmium, as well as chemicals, industrial products, and fertilizers.

The revised quarterly dividend will be 78 cents, payable on Mar 1, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Feb 14. The company continues to target a dividend payout of 65 to 70% of earnings.The company’s new annualized dividend rate is $3.12 per share, resulting in a dividend yield of 3.39%. The current dividend yield is better than the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite’s 1.63%.Utilities’ History of Dividend PaymentThe companies that are involved in providing utility services generally have stable operations and earnings. Consistent performance and the ability to generate cash flows allow utilities to reward shareholders with a regular dividend. WEC Energy Group has been distributing dividends for 322 consecutive quarters.It is not the only company with a track record of consistent dividend payments. Utilities like Consolidated Edison, Inc. ED and The York Water Company YORW are also rewarding their shareholders with dividend payments for more than 100 years without fail.The current dividend yields of Consolidated Edison and York Water Company are pegged at 3.4% and 1.8%, respectively.Can We Expect Hikes in Coming Years?In 2022, WEC completed a few acquisitions and entered into an agreement to acquire a few more renewables to expand its clean energy generation portfolio. A majority of the clean projects acquired have a long-term offtake agreement for all energy produced, which ensures a steady flow of earnings for the company.Based on improving conditions in the company’s service area, WEC Energy continues to witness an uptick in customer volumes. The company expects weather-normalized electric and gas sales for the Wisconsin segment to be 0.7-1% each during the 2025-2027 time frame.WEC Energy received regulatory approval for two Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) facilities to address the demand for additional natural gas supply in Wisconsin. The commercial operation of LNG facilities is expected to be in service by late 2023 or early 2024. The total expected investments in the project were $370 million. These LNG facilities will provide solution to Southeastern Wisconsin to meet peak customer demands during the coldest days of the year.All the factors stated above clearly indicate that the company has enough financial strength to move forward with a shareholder-friendly strategy over the long term.Story continuesPrice MovementIn the past three months, WEC Energy’s shares have gained 5.9% compared with the industry’s growth of 10%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank and A Stock to ConsiderWEC Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Even during a challenging 2022 Visa managed to stay positive, up 8.5% over the last 12 months, well above the S&amp;P’s return of -11%.Quick OverviewVisa is a powerhouse in the payments technology industry, dominating its closest competitor Mastercard MA, with more than 50% greater payments volume. V has also grown its revenue consistently over the years including 10% in fiscal 2021 and 22% in 2022.Along with many other multinationals, Visa has been affected negatively by the Russia, Ukraine conflict. After building a significant presence in Russia it has completely withdrawn. Business in Russia accounted for 4% of Visa’s revenue.CompetitionVisa’s primary competitor is Mastercard MA, as well as American Express AXP, and Discover Financial Services DFS.Mastercard has very similar offerings as Visa. Neither are involved in extending credit or issuing cards, and only do so through co-branded relationships. AXP and DFS are different in that way as they offer credit options.Mastercard, like Visa, is a tremendous business, and MA has outperformed V over the long-term. Since 2008 Visa has returned 1,480%, while Mastercard has returned 1,840%. Although over the last 12 months, V has edged a small outperformance of 9% vs. 6%Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings ExpectationsZacks estimates call for Visa’s Q1 FY23 sales to increase 8.8% to $7.7 billion. Earnings expectations are strong too, with Zacks analysts forecasting 10.5% growth to $2.00 per share.Earnings estimate revisions have stayed mostly consistent, with a $0.01 increase to the current quarter estimates, and no change to the current year. There have been small revisions lower for the next quarter and next year estimates, which are down to $9.50 from $9.77 per share 90 days earlier.Story continuesThese flat, to negative earnings revisions explain Visa’s Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDiscover Financial Services DFS, already reported this week, offering some insights and setting expectations for Visa. DFS had a solid earnings report, beating estimates on both the top and bottom line for the quarter.DFS also announced that it is revamping its share repurchase plan, as well as paying a new semi-annual cash dividend on preferred shares. Over the last quarter DFS repurchased about 5.9 million shares worth $602 million, which reduced the share count by 2.1%.It wasn’t all good news for Discover Financial. FY22 adjusted earnings per share of $15.05 declined 13% YoY, and net earnings plunged 19% to $4.4 billion.Operating Metrics One Visa metric I will be looking at closely is total volume. Total volume is the sum of total payments and cash volume. Aggregate figures like total volume can break down large, complicated businesses into a single figure. Of course, it isn’t completely explanatory, but provides useful insights in a simple medium.The figure is also useful for gauging the economy broadly. As the world’s leading payment processor, Visas figures provide valuable information on individuals economic activities.Total volume has missed estimates over the past three reported quarters, and four of the last five. Something I find concerning is that the magnitude of the misses continues to grow as well. Looking a little closer at the data we can see last quarter, total volume missed by -3.6%, but the brunt of the loss came from Europe, which missed estimates by -14.5%.Europe is the second largest contributor to Visa’s top line, so these results have significant impact. Additionally, it offers insights into European economic behavior, which would appear to be slowing. Interestingly, the rest of the geographies all missed by less than the total number.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings BeatsVisa almost always beats earnings estimates. Going back to 2008, the closest they have gotten to a miss was two reports that reported exactly in line with estimates.But with earnings revisions coming in flat, and the economy slowing, maybe now we see a miss. The probability of a miss, is admittedly very low, but if it were to happen it would be significant for Visa and speak to the state of the economy.Zacks figures think Visa will beat. Using Zacks ESP (Earnings Surprise Prediction) we can expect Visa to beat earnings by 0.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuationFor Visa’s entire history as a public company, it’s one year forward P/E ratio has remained above the S&amp;P’s average. Considering Visa’s exceptional business model, and consistent growth this makes sense.With a one year forward P/E ratio of 25.5x, Visa is currently above its 15-year median of 24x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVisa sits comfortably holding a very large cash position of $15.7 billion, and regularly building it with its strong free cash flow. Additionally, Visa’s net debt is 4.3% of its net capital, which is significantly lower than the industry average of 17%.Visa has also demonstrated its commitment to shareholder value by increasing is dividend payment every year since 2009, which currently yields 0.8%.ConclusionVisa is a great company, with a rock-solid business model, and very long runway considering the size and scope of the digital payments landscape. It excelled during the very challenging 2022 period, continues to prioritize shareholders, and grow both the top and bottom line.The real risk for Visa is the underlying strength of the economy. For now, the economy expects a soft landing, or mild recession. But if those expectations are wrong, the sales and earnings forecasts of V and many other companies will need to readjust. That being said, even in the worst-case people will be using Visa’s payments technology.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The report - ""5G and the Digital Divide"" - calls for making the closing of the digital divide a top policy priority and explains how, although the divide has been narrowed, it still persists around the world. Getting all stakeholders aligned on unleashing the full potential of 5G technology is key to intelligently connecting everything everywhere, the report states.""Qualcomm® 5G technology has the potential to close the digital divide and create transformational change, particularly for disadvantaged and underserved populations,"" said Kirti Gupta, Vice President, Technology &amp; Economic Strategy, Qualcomm Incorporated. ""As a leader in advanced 5G solutions, it is our responsibility to ensure the world understands the importance and potential of this technology. With everyone pulling in the same direction, the world will benefit greatly from the widespread implementation of 5G mobile and FWA technology.""The digital divide refers to inequalities in access to and use of high-speed internet and other digital technologies. The digital divide is the new face of inequality, and 37% of the world's population still remains offline (Source: Measuring Digital Development - Facts and Figures 2021, International Telecommunication Union). The three principal factors behind the digital divide are:The lack of internet connectivity where people live, work, or learn,The lack of affordability, andThe lack of digital skills to navigate the connected world.5G technology, including mobile and fixed broadband solutions, can alleviate these issues. 5G is paving the way to faster mobile broadband speeds and more reliable connections, benefiting those in less developed economies with limited fixed infrastructure, where mobile is the main source of connectivity and plays a key role in economic growth. 5G Fixed Wireless Access (FWA), or 5G home internet service, has become an alternative to fiber for fixed broadband, because it is a highly affordable solution for households and businesses due to lower deployment costs and increased market competition.Story continues5G FWA will close the digital divide by reducing costs and improving coverage, capacity, and speed. According to the report, if 5G FWA is fully deployed by 2032, global GDP will increase by $3.3 trillion, with middle- and low-income economies seeing their GDP per capita increase by 5% or more. This will provide 850 million people with access to high-speed internet at home for the first time.Other benefits of using 5G mobile and FWA technology to close the digital divide include:Expanding education access and outcomes,Improving efficiency and reach of public services and policies,Expanding access to health care services and information,Improving financial inclusion and reducing financial transaction costs, andGenerating environmental benefits, such as accelerating the deployment of smart energy devices in rural areas.Read the white paper and learn more about how Qualcomm and 5G technology working to close the digital divide here.About QualcommQualcomm is enabling a world where everyone and everything can be intelligently connected.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Expedia has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Zalando has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that EXPE likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than ZLNDY has recently. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.EXPE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.93, while ZLNDY has a forward P/E of 84. We also note that EXPE has a PEG ratio of 0.85. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. ZLNDY currently has a PEG ratio of 8.93.Another notable valuation metric for EXPE is its P/B ratio of 4.50. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, ZLNDY has a P/B of 5.60.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to EXPE's Value grade of B and ZLNDY's Value grade of D.EXPE has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than ZLNDY, so it seems like value investors will conclude that EXPE is the superior option right now.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about PulteGroup (PHM) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.PulteGroup currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.77, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 13 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.77 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 13 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy, representing 61.5% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for PHMBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for PHMCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for PulteGroup here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying PulteGroup, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is PHM Worth Investing In?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for PulteGroup, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 1.1% over the past month to $10.11.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for PulteGroup. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for PulteGroup with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:WEC) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 1st of March to $0.78. This makes the dividend yield about the same as the industry average at 3.4%. Check out our latest analysis for WEC Energy Group WEC Energy Group's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWhile it is always good to see a solid dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is feasible. Before making this announcement, WEC Energy Group was earning enough to cover the dividend, but it wasn't generating any free cash flows. In general, we consider cash flow to be more important than earnings, so we would be cautious about relying on the sustainability of this dividend.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 18.1%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 61% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendWEC Energy Group Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.20 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $3.12. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 10% per annum over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.We Could See WEC Energy Group's Dividend GrowingThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. It's encouraging to see that WEC Energy Group has been growing its earnings per share at 7.4% a year over the past five years. The company is paying out a lot of its cash as a dividend, but it looks okay based on the payout ratio.Our Thoughts On WEC Energy Group's DividendOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think WEC Energy Group will make a great income stock. While the low payout ratio is a redeeming feature, this is offset by the minimal cash to cover the payments. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company. Just as an example, we've come across 3 warning signs for WEC Energy Group you should be aware of, and 1 of them is a bit concerning. If you are a dividend investor, you might also want to look at our curated list of high yield dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

The revised quarterly dividend will be 78 cents, payable on Mar 1, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Feb 14. The company continues to target a dividend payout of 65 to 70% of earnings.The company’s new annualized dividend rate is $3.12 per share, resulting in a dividend yield of 3.39%. The current dividend yield is better than the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite’s 1.63%.Utilities’ History of Dividend PaymentThe companies that are involved in providing utility services generally have stable operations and earnings. Consistent performance and the ability to generate cash flows allow utilities to reward shareholders with a regular dividend. WEC Energy Group has been distributing dividends for 322 consecutive quarters.It is not the only company with a track record of consistent dividend payments. Utilities like Consolidated Edison, Inc. ED and The York Water Company YORW are also rewarding their shareholders with dividend payments for more than 100 years without fail.The current dividend yields of Consolidated Edison and York Water Company are pegged at 3.4% and 1.8%, respectively.Can We Expect Hikes in Coming Years?In 2022, WEC completed a few acquisitions and entered into an agreement to acquire a few more renewables to expand its clean energy generation portfolio. A majority of the clean projects acquired have a long-term offtake agreement for all energy produced, which ensures a steady flow of earnings for the company.Based on improving conditions in the company’s service area, WEC Energy continues to witness an uptick in customer volumes. The company expects weather-normalized electric and gas sales for the Wisconsin segment to be 0.7-1% each during the 2025-2027 time frame.WEC Energy received regulatory approval for two Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) facilities to address the demand for additional natural gas supply in Wisconsin. The commercial operation of LNG facilities is expected to be in service by late 2023 or early 2024. The total expected investments in the project were $370 million. These LNG facilities will provide solution to Southeastern Wisconsin to meet peak customer demands during the coldest days of the year.All the factors stated above clearly indicate that the company has enough financial strength to move forward with a shareholder-friendly strategy over the long term.Story continuesPrice MovementIn the past three months, WEC Energy’s shares have gained 5.9% compared with the industry’s growth of 10%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank and A Stock to ConsiderWEC Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 2.41%.The healthcare bellwether’s performance has been pretty impressive, with the company exceeding earnings expectations in each of the trailing four quarters. It delivered a four-quarter earnings surprise of 1.59%, on average.Johnson &amp; Johnson Price and EPS SurpriseJohnson &amp; Johnson Price and EPS Surprise        Johnson &amp; Johnson price-eps-surprise | Johnson &amp; Johnson QuoteJ&amp;J’s stock has risen 1.6% in the past year compared with an increase of 14% for the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFactors to ConsiderJ&amp;J’s Pharma segment is expected to have contributed to the top line, led by increased penetration and market share gains of key products such as Darzalex and Stelara.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Darzalex and Stelara is pegged at $2.07 billion and $2.46 billion, respectively while our estimates are $2.11 billion and $2.45 billion, respectively.Other core products like Invega Sustenna and new drugs, Erleada and Tremfya, might have also contributed significantly to sales growth. Its COVID-19 vaccine sales are expected to have been negligible in the fourth quarter. International sales are expected to have accounted for most of the COVID-19 vaccine sales.However, lower sales of its key medicine, Imbruvica is likely to have hurt the top line in the fourth quarter. Rising competitive pressure in the United States from novel oral agents is likely to have hurt sales of the key drug, Imbruvica. Also, below pre-COVID levels in the CLL market are expected to have hurt sales in the United States and government clawbacks are expected to put pressure on sales in Europe.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Imbruvica is $873 million, while our estimate is $849.7 million.Generic/biosimilar competition for drugs like Zytiga, Procrit/Eprex and Remicade is likely to have hurt the top line. Zytiga, which already faces generic competition in the United States, lost exclusivity in EMEA markets in September, which is likely to hurt sales further in the fourth quarter.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for J&amp;J’s Pharmaceuticals unit is $13.08 billion, while our estimate is $12.8 billion.With regard to the MedTech segment, sales are expected to have been driven by continued recovery in worldwide procedure volumes, better execution and new product launches. However, lingering headwinds from hospital staffing and volume-based procurement (VBP) issues in China are expected to have hurt international sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for J&amp;J’s MedTech segment is $6.97 billion, while our model estimate is $7.06 billion.In the Consumer Health segment, supply constraints in the United States (due to raw material availability and labor shortages), inflationary pressure and sales suspension of personal care products in Russia are likely to have continued to hurt sales. However, strategic price increases, and above-market growth in the over-the-counter medicines business, seen in the previous quarters, is likely to have benefited the top line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for J&amp;J’s Consumer Health segment is $3.73 billion, while our model estimate is $3.7 billion.Overall, currency headwinds are expected to have significantly hurt J&amp;J’s top line in the fourth quarter.J&amp;J expects supply constraints, inflationary pressure and rising input costs to continue to hurt margins in the fourth quarter of 2022 as well as in 2023Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for J&amp;J this time around.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Most Undervalued Auto Stocks According To Hedge Funds. The automotive industry has been plagued by multiple problems apart from the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the constrained Asia Pacific backdrop and the war in Ukraine. The shortages in microchips and labor are also impacting every level of the automotive supply chain. However, the development of electric vehicles is a significant global trend, with particular focus on improving battery performance and expanding charging infrastructure. This results in increased research and development by vehicle manufacturers, who are continuing to invest in EV technology despite other challenges they may be facing. The fast pace of development in the EV industry indicates that manufacturers have an optimistic outlook about the future of EVs. New advancements are regularly being made, bringing the industry closer to the concept of ""Vehicles 2.0"". Larry Keyler, Partner and Global Automotive Leader at RSM US, said on January 18: “The development of autonomous vehicle technology has slowed down somewhat, as manufacturers redirect and refocus on the refinement of the electric vehicle. These are certainly being driven by the regulatory landscape, which at the moment is accelerating a path to wide-scale EV adoption. Governments in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific are all implementing their own initiatives, not to mention the UN, and auto makers are under pressure to deliver”. However, Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska wrote in an investor note in December 2022: “There is active demand destruction in the industry, given inflation, interest rates, and energy costs − but so far, this has mostly impacted the backlog.”Investors looking to explore the auto space can also check out 11 Best Autonomous Vehicle Stocks To Buy, 10 Fastest Growing Car Companies in the World, and 10 Best Auto Stocks To Buy.

(NYSE:PAG) from $125 to $110 and kept a Neutral rating on the shares.

(NYSE:PAG) was part of 24 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 22 in the last quarter. Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 485,534 shares worth $47.8 million. 9. Stellantis N.V.

(NYSE:ALSN) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:“Allison Transmission is a niche industrial company with roughly 80% market share in truck transmissions. Its products provide the company’s customers with critical advantages, including fuel economy, reduced emissions, reliability and total-cost-of ownership. The importance of Allison Transmission’s products and its dominant market position have historically given it strong pricing power. Yet, in the year leading up to our purchase, the company’s shares underperformed peers by more than 40 percentage points. Although we believe the company’s fundamentals are still as strong, if not better, than its peers, investors have worried about how commercial vehicle electrification will affect Allison Transmission’s long-term business. We believe that the company’s investments in next-generation products will enable it to maintain its position as an industry leader, even as technologies change. Furthermore, we believe that our investment carries limited downside risk because Allison Transmission’s shares sell at 10x free cash flow, which ascribes almost no value to the future. In addition, the company’s management team diligently returns capital to shareholders.”7. Group 1 Automotive, Inc. (NYSE:GPI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30P/E Ratio as of January 19: 5.55Group 1 Automotive, Inc.

The analyst noted that the setup for franchise auto dealers into Q3 earnings is the most negative he has encountered since the pandemic. He upgraded Group 1 Automotive, Inc. (NYSE:GPI) based on his revised price targets for the group.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, Group 1 Automotive, Inc. (NYSE:GPI) was part of 30 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 24 in the earlier quarter. Anthony Bozza’s Lakewood Capital Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 331,726 shares worth $47.4 million. Here is what ClearBridge Investments Small Cap Value Strategy has to say about Group 1 Automotive, Inc. (NYSE:GPI) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“We also initiated a new position in Group 1 Automotive (NYSE:GPI), in the consumer discretionary sector. Group 1 Automotive is one of the leading auto dealership groups in the U.S. and the U.K. Through our analysis, we believe the current stock price already discounts a considerable decline in revenue and profits due to concerns about elevated used car prices and high gross margins per unit. However, we believe this does not reflect the underlying strength of the company’s diversified business line and flexible cost structure. Ultimately, we believe the company will prove more durable than the market expects and be a long-term value creator for the portfolio.”6. The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company (NASDAQ:GT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32P/E Ratio as of January 19: 3.58The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company (NASDAQ:GT) was incorporated in 1898 and is headquartered in Akron, Ohio.

(NYSE:AN), The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company (NASDAQ:GT) is one of the most undervalued auto stocks according to hedge funds. Here is what ClearBridge Small Cap Value Strategy has to say about The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company (NASDAQ:GT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We exited a number of stocks during the period, including Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber (NASDAQ:GT). We sold our position in Goodyear due to the cavalcade of concerns including the company’s elevated debt levels, inflationary pressures from higher input prices, continued manufacturing challenges in the auto industry and complications with the company’s manufacturing volume. With substantial exposure to the automotive industry through other portfolio holdings, we elected to consolidate our exposure within those higher-conviction holdings.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Undervalued Auto Stocks According To Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:11 Best Debt Free Stocks To Buy14 Best Dividend Stocks To Buy and Hold10 Best Vanguard ETFs for Diversification Disclosure: None. 11 Most Undervalued Auto Stocks According To Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Air India and Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Reuters reported last month that Air India was close to placing orders for around 500 jets from both Airbus and Boeing after months of intense talks on the core plane order.Industry sources said on Monday finalising the deal depended on ongoing negotiations with engine makers, but two people familiar with the matter said talks were mostly complete.Such a deal would rank among the biggest by a single airline in volume terms, overshadowing a combined order for 460 Airbus and Boeing jets from American Airlines over a decade ago.Next Friday's likely announcement comes a year to the day after the Tata Group conglomerate regained control of Air India, launching an ambitious shake-up and renewal of the flag carrier that entrepreneur J.R.D. Tata originally founded in 1932.Air India, with its maharajah mascot, was once known for its lavishly decorated planes and stellar service but its reputation declined in the mid-2000s as financial troubles mounted.Tata Group has said it plans to transform the previously state-run carrier into a ""world-class airline"" in five years.The deal consolidates Airbus' position in India as the leading supplier of narrow-body planes. IndiGo, the country's largest carrier, is the biggest customer for Airbus' A320neo family.It is also however, a breakthrough for Boeing which has been lagging behind Airbus in the fast-growing market, where its customers include start-up Akasa Air and SpiceJet.

However, its fourth-quarter 2022 earnings, scheduled for release on Jan 25, are projected to reflect some impacts of abnormal costs related to the 777-9 program.Click here to know how the company’s overall Q4 performance is likely to have been.Solid 737 &amp; 787 Jet Deliveries to Boost GrowthThanks to steadily recovering air traffic (both domestic and international), improved delivery figures for Boeing’s 737 and 787 jets were observed in the fourth quarter of 2022. Notably, the aerospace giant delivered 110 737 jets in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, reflecting quite a solid improvement of 31% from 84 units delivered in the year-ago quarter.Moreover, Boeing delivered 22 787 Dreamliner jets in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to none in the year-ago period, following this product line’s delivery resumption in the third quarter of 2022. This must have also boosted the Boeing Commercial Airplane (BCA) segment’s top-line performance.The Boeing Company Price and EPS SurpriseThe Boeing Company Price and EPS SurpriseThe Boeing Company price-eps-surprise | The Boeing Company QuoteIn fact, such significant delivery figures of 737 and 787 primarily drove a surge of 53.5% in the company’s overall commercial deliveries. This, in turn, must have contributed to BCA segment’s revenues in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boeing’s commercial business segment’s revenues, pegged at $8,145 million, indicates a solid 71.5% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Earnings ExpectationOn the cost front, the delivery resumption of the 787 product line is likely to have boosted BCA’s operating profit, thereby adding impetus to its quarterly earnings.Moreover, improvements in the BCA segment's financial performance due to increasing 737 MAX and 787 deliveries  and consistent efforts by the BCA team to manage costs through business transformation activities must have contributed to this unit’s bottom-line growth in the fourth quarter.Story continuesFurther, a steady improvement in the company’s expenses is likely to have taken place in relation to the storage of the 737 aircraft as jets that were in the inventory are gradually getting delivered.However, the production pause for the 777-9 program must have resulted in some abnormal costs for this segment, which in turn might have weighed on this unit’s Q4 bottom line.So, the overall effect of the aforementioned factors on the BCA segment’s fourth-quarter earnings performance seems to have been favorable. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boeing’s commercial business segment is pegged at a loss of $291 million, indicating a solid improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported loss of $4,454 million.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Boeing this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

The informal term ""seaweed"" makes it sound like an undesirable pest. And it may seem like one, if you've only encountered it as a drying clump on the beach or a slimy surprise in the waves. But look beneath the surface and you'll find that ""seaweed"" belies a dazzling variety of creatures: the billion-year-old ancestor of all plants, source of half the world's oxygen, and a crucial player in the future of global food production, microbiology, and medicine.The United Nations recognizes seaweed cultivation as part of its Sustainable Development Goals: As food, it's a major source of protein, vitamins, and iron; and crops not grown for food can be excellent absorbers of carbon dioxide and pollutants, reducing ocean acidification and capturing greenhouse gas. Certain compounds extracted from it, like carrageenan and agar, have a multitude of further scientific applications, from a growth medium for other microorganisms to a vegan alternative to gelatin in desserts. But some of the regions with the greatest seaweed biomass-like Brazil, with its 8000 kilometers of coastline-have yet to take full advantage of this potential.The Brazilian aquaculture industry's ability to grow is hampered by a scarcity of genetic sequencing data from relevant seaweeds, especially elkhorn sea moss, or Kappaphycus alvarezii. But the Brazilian Consortium for Phycogenomics (BCP) is determined to change that. The nonprofit project was formed in 2021 by researchers from SENAI CETIQT in Río de Janeiro, the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo State University, and seven other universities and companies; it's also making progress in a research collaboration between Scott Fahrenkrug at biotechnology research firm Forjazul and Michael Roleda at the Marine Science Institute at the University of the Philippines, where K. alvarezii farming first began.Story continues""The phycogenomics project has a special place in my heart,"" says Rodrigo Cano, business analyst at SENAI CETIQT and project manager for BCP. ""We can see a clear path from sequence data to the development of new cultivars and informed management strategies that will directly impact small stakeholders that produce most of the seaweed in Brazil.""Announced this week at the Plant and Animal Genome conference in San Diego, SENAI CETIQT is the latest recipient of Illumina's Agricultural Greater Good Initiative grant, an award given annually since 2011 to projects that support research into food security and sustainability. The grant will enable BCP to generate a high-quality genome sequence of K. alvarezii and make it publicly available. Using an Illumina NextSeq sequencer, the consortium will collect trillions of base pairs' worth of transcriptome data for it and other seaweeds, probing the protists to discover the secrets of how they grow and synthesize their useful biomolecules.K. alvarezii alone is a model organism for phycogenomics, and insight into its biostimulants and carbon sequestration mechanisms could advance environmental efforts and support farmers worldwide. Fahrenkrug explains that ""molecular genetic methods can be used to find and protect genetic diversity, and in the face of changing climate conditions, can contribute to the sustainability and resilience of seaweed production, and enable strategies to leverage its already tremendous capacity for fixing carbon for the global blue economy.""One of the oldest branches on the tree of life is a key to humanity's future.

The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Right now, TDK Corp. is sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while TE Connectivity has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).

The analyst still thinks it's a good time to buy defense.In the analyst's view, potential cuts to the Defense budget are not a slam dunk, and the sentiment could reverse should fears of deep cuts, which the analyst sees as overblown today, start to ease.The analyst sees the recent pullback in Northrop Grumman Corp (NYSE: NOC) stock price providing an attractive opportunity to accumulate shares and reiterate both the Overweight rating and Top Pick designation.While the company screens expensive at a 15% premium to peers, the analyst sees few substitutes for NOC's best-of-breed portfolio and continues to view the stock as the defense ballast to own.The analyst sees NOC as well-aligned to some of the fastest-growing areas of the U.S. defense budget, including space and nuclear modernization.Reporting suggests Kevin McCarthy may have entertained a deal to make him House Speaker that would propose a $75 billion cut to defense spending, amounting to a 9% Y/Y cut.The analyst views the likelihood of this cut as remote. Deep cuts to defense are likely to meet material opposition from GOP defense hawks, the analyst added.The GOP controls the House by a slim majority and defense spending requires approval by both the House and Senate, along with the President.Also, bipartisan support for defense spending is on the rise, in the analyst's view, as Russia/Ukraine conflict and tensions with China have underscored the need for continued Defense investment.While the analyst currently sees fears of deep cuts as overblown, if support for cuts moves from a minority view to a mainstream view, a downside risk to the defense cycle could emerge.The analyst is watching for potential increases in planned buyback activity for Defense Primes.As a baseline, Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: LMT) guided to $4 billion in share repurchases in 2023, and NOC guided to slightly higher than $1.5 billion.Price Action: NOC shares are trading higher by 1.80% at $450.28 on the last check Friday.Photo Via CompanyStory continuesLatest Ratings for LMTDateFirmActionFromToMar 2022Wells FargoMaintainsEqual-WeightMar 2022Morgan StanleyMaintainsOverweightFeb 2022Wolfe ResearchUpgradesPeer PerformOutperformView More Analyst Ratings for LMTView the Latest Analyst RatingsDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

If you happened to be a customer of the banking institution during the period of 2011 to 2022, this could apply to you, according to CNBC.See: Can I Draw Social Security at 62 and Still Work Full Time?Find Out: How To Stay Safe When Using Mobile Banking AppsLearn: 2023’s Housing Correction Could Be the Largest Since Post-WWIIThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau filed proceedings against the financial giant for “breaking federal consumer protection laws that apply to financial products,” and the bank has now finalized a settlement to the tune of $3.7 billion. In addition to $1.7 billion that will go towards a victims’ relief fund, per the CFPB, that leaves $2 billion that is owed in direct payments to the bank’s customers who may have been subject to erroneous overdraft checking account fees, misapplied payments and foreclosures in regards to mortgages and auto loans.According to the CFPB, one in three American households were customers of Wells Fargo during this time period and the organization has provided more information on who may be affected and how to recoup the financial restitution.Take Our Poll: How Big of a Sign-Up Bonus Would It Take for You To Change Banks?Wells Fargo Checking Account CustomersAny customer who was charged incorrect fees may be eligible for the damages payment. This includes anyone who had a “surprise” overdraft fee for debit card purchases, checks or ATM withdrawals when their account had enough funds to cover the transaction. It also includes anyone who had a monthly fee that shouldn’t have been applied. Banking clients may receive up to $100 in damages.Wells Fargo Auto Loan HoldersThis provision applies to those with auto loans where payments were “not applied correctly” and might have resulted in higher interest or late fees, as well as “wrongful repossessions.” It also applies to those that paid for GAP coverage (covering the full loan after accidents or theft) when Wells Fargo didn’t refund money in some cases, as in when the loan was paid ahead of time. Auto loan holders are owed “at least” $4,000 as part of the settlement.Story continuesWells Fargo Mortgage CustomersThe CFPB has also gone after the financial institution for wrongful practices with mortgages. That includes customers who were charged fees when they shouldn’t have been or loan holders that were “unfairly turned down when they requested modifications to their loan to avoid foreclosure.”Those with mismanaged mortgages are owed more than $24,000.As part of the settlement, Wells Fargo is required to notify customers and act swiftly on providing payments. “You don’t need to take any action to receive your payment. Some customers have already received their payments,” says the CFPB.

194,584ffb3b-0404-3e4f-b296-636daa8ba587,PFE,2023-01-21,There's A Lot To Like About Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE) Upcoming US$0.41 Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/theres-lot-pfizers-nyse-pfe-122201749.html,1674303721,STORY,['PFE'],"[It looks like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) is about to go ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Meaning, you will need to purchase Pfizer's shares before the 26th of January to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 3rd of March.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.41 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$1.60 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Pfizer stock has a trailing yield of around 3.5% on the current share price of $45.11. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to investigate whether Pfizer can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. View our latest analysis for Pfizer Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Fortunately Pfizer's payout ratio is modest, at just 30% of profit. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It distributed 38% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. That's why it's comforting to see Pfizer's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 35% per annum for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing very quickly, and the company is paying out a relatively low percentage of its profit and cash flow. Companies with growing earnings and low payout ratios are often the best long-term dividend stocks, as the company can both grow its earnings and increase the percentage of earnings that it pays out, essentially multiplying the dividend.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Pfizer has increased its dividend at approximately 6.2% a year on average. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.To Sum It UpFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Pfizer? We love that Pfizer is growing earnings per share while simultaneously paying out a low percentage of both its earnings and cash flow. These characteristics suggest the company is reinvesting in growing its business, while the conservative payout ratio also implies a reduced risk of the dividend being cut in the future. There's a lot to like about Pfizer, and we would prioritise taking a closer look at it.So while Pfizer looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock.

200,1e9d60e6-b3e6-357b-8c9d-0afedf519e5f,PYPL,2023-01-21,3 Fintech Stocks That Will Make You Rich in 10 Years,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-fintech-stocks-rich-10-131949909.html,1674047989,STORY,"['V', 'PYPL', 'SQ']","[Financial technology (fintech) companies that facilitate online payments and digital banking services had a difficult time in 2022. Dragged lower by the broader market downturn and as investor sentiment soured on technology companies, many fintech stocks have seen their share price cut in half, or worse, over the last year. But despite the carnage, there are reasons to believe that things will turn a corner for fintech stocks.The fintech market remains robust and continues to grow strongly. According to Allied Market Research, the global fintech market was worth $110.57 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach $698.48 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.3% through the end of the decade. With this growth in mind, we offer the following three fintech stocks that could make investors rich in 10 years’ time.TickerCompanyPricePYPLPayPal$80.18SQBlock$75.10VVisa$223.00InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comA legendary Silicon Valley success story whose founders include Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and Max Levchin, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is viewed by many investors and analysts as the original financial technology company. It certainly has dominated online payments since its founding 25 years ago. While PYPL stock has had a rough go of it over the last year, declining 54%, there is every reason to believe that the company and its stock will recover.In fact, PYPL stock has risen 7% to start 2023, showing signs that it might have bottomed at $67 on December 28 of last year. A bullish report from analysts at Truist sparked renewed optimism, who slapped a “buy” rating on the stock, noting that it remains extremely profitable despite slowing user growth coming out of the pandemic, with a 26% free-cash-flow margin. Truist also points out that PayPal currently has 432 million active accounts, meaning it remains a market leader in the fintech space.Story continuesThe company also spent nearly $1 billion on share repurchases in each quarter of 2022, and its currently trading at about 15 times trailing free cash flow, one of the cheapest valuations in its history. This presents a clear buy-the-dip opportunity.Block (SQ)Block logo over a background with former square logo. SQ stock.Source: Sergei Elagin / ShutterstockInvestors who believe that cryptocurrencies, in particular Bitcoin (BTC-USD), will survive the current market downturn should consider taking a position in Block (NYSE:SQ). The fintech company started by Jack Dorsey (who also co-founded Twitter) has suffered after it began to focus more on cryptocurrencies, just as the market for digital coins and tokens began to collapse. Over the past 12 months, SQ stock has declined 45% to now trade at $71 per share. In August 2021, the shares were changing hands at $275 each.However, while Jack Dorsey is a crypto enthusiast, his fintech company does not focus solely on digital assets. Block continues to run the popular and profitable Square and Cash App that are widely used by small and medium-sized businesses, as well as consumers. The Cash App continues to add users and grow at a brisk 36% year-over-year rate. Fans also point out that Block’s exposure to crypto is limited to Bitcoin only, and that the company does not allow trading or payments in smaller cryptos that are susceptible to fraud.Through its “Afterpay” service, Block is moving into the buy now, pay later sector that remains popular with consumers, particularly people under age 30, and is also pushing into traditional banking and money management services through “Round-up,” which rounds up transactions to the nearest dollar and invests the money automatically. Long-term, SQ stock could prove the naysayers wrong. Thus, it is among the top fintech stocks to buy that will make you rich in 10 years.Visa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comCredit card giant Visa (NYSE:V) is likely not the first company investors think of when talking about fintech stocks to buy that will make you rich in 10 years. However, the San Francisco-based company, which was founded in 1958, is expanding aggressively into fintech as it recognizes the changes taking place in the world of online payments and transitions to keep up with the industry. Visa has been gobbling up smaller fintech companies in recent years, bringing their technology and intellectual property in-house. Additionally, the company continues to expand its “Visa Fintech Partner Connect” program, which is designed to help financial institutions connect with vetted technology providers that help facilitate online payments.Visa is clearly trying to use its size and deep pockets to position itself as a leader and facilitator in the fintech sector. Beyond fintech, Visa also remains a credit behemoth with 3.9 billion of its cards in circulation, processing more than 250 billion transactions annually. The company’s net profit margin currently sits at more than 50%, and while down, its stock continues to outperform the broader market. In 2022, V stock declined only around 5% compared to a 19% drop in the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index. Over the last five years, the share price has gained 82% and currently trades at $223.

On Tuesday, we get second quarter earnings from Microsoft. Wednesday, we get Q4 reports from Tesla and IBM. And on Thursday, Intel reports its fourth quarter results. So let's go through them one at a time and start with Microsoft. What jumps out to you?SEANA SMITH: Yeah, Dave, it's going to be an interesting quarter here for Microsoft. We know the company just announced 10,000 job cuts. I'm sure the Street will want to hear a little bit more from Satya Nadella just in terms of those cuts, what he thinks that's going to mean for the company here going forward. Revenue growth is expected to be the slowest pace that we have seen in about six years.Also, the company got its first sell rating in more than three years this week. So the Street kind of taking a second look at Microsoft over the past year. We're looking at a one-year chart right now. The stock off just about 20%. So Microsoft, I think a lot of the emphasis is going to be on the earnings call and what we hear from executives there.DAVE BRIGGS: And you know all eyes are on ChatGPT. Interesting to have a conversation earlier about this in terms of you saw Larry Page and Sergey Brin come back, according to the ""New York Times,"" because of the threat that ChatGPT poses to the AI business over there at Alphabet. And we still haven't seen how they're going to monetize ChatGPT. But the theory is, it poses a real threat to Google's search business. Many don't buy that because they don't think there's a realistic challenge from Bing. I happen to agree with that. I think the monetization is going to come elsewhere. And those practical use applications are, quite frankly, endless. All right, to Tesla.SEANA SMITH: To Tesla. Tesla, I think a lot of it's going to be on the call as well. We know that delivery number missed estimates when it-- coming into fourth quarter. That was a huge disappointment for the Street. The price cuts, I think we're going to want to hear a lot more about that, what it has done for demand. It's only been, what, about a week or so far, but what they think it could do for demand going forward. And then, of course, on the negative side, the pressure might be on margins. But again, Tesla still off about 60% in the last year.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: And margins we won't really know. They're probably not going to tell us, and it's more of a Q1 story for the next report. Now, also on Tesla, Elon Musk did take the stand today in California. This is all related to that 2018 tweet claiming that he had lined up the financing to take Tesla private. And Alexis Keenan reporting that he did say this on the stand, ""Difficult to say that the stock price is linked to the tweet.""Asked whether he's aware that Tesla's price stock sometimes goes up or down following his posts, Musk rejected the idea that his tweets could be directly correlated to the stock's behavior. Really? I think he's well aware of the impact his tweets have on stock's behavior.SEANA SMITH: I think so too.DAVE BRIGGS: Not just his own. Look at what he's done with Dogecoin and others.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, I think so too. And will be interesting more of the headlines that come out from that today. Also, Intel is going to be an important one to watch. We talk about the slowdown. And we have certainly seen in the chip sector, that has been reflected in shares, off nearly 30% in the last six months. Some of that contraction, though, in the industry, I think, is expected to pressure the top line here for Intel.Bank of America saying that their estimates, they think it's going to drop about 9%, well below the consensus of a 3% drop. Weaker performance here being flagged by management. But I don't know how much of that has already been priced into the stock. Certainly, some of that rebound might be further out than we had anticipated. Maybe second half of 2023 is a safer bet.DAVE BRIGGS: Pat Gelsinger in Davos telling CNN, ""Where the technology supply chains are and where semiconductors are built is the most important question for the next five decades."" He said it's more important than even oil reserves for the future. So a massive statement on the future for the space from Pat Gelsinger.]"

GM says it will be investing nearly a billion dollars in four US facilities to manufacture V8 engines and EV parts. Yahoo Finance senior autos reporter Pras Subramanian has the details. Hey, Pras.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Hey, how's it going, man? So, yeah, a billion dollars into V8 production and also EV components, like you said, for plants across the Midwest and Western New York, mostly, like you said, for those gas parts-- for those engines. But, you know, with regards to EVs, GM ramping up their production here. We've known about this for a while. In this case, it can be for casting parts and other components, this on their way to GM making a million EVs annually by 2025. That's the goal anyway for Mary Barra and company.SEANA SMITH: So, Pras, when you take into account, yes, this is a step in the right direction, we spend a lot of times focused on EVs, but future investment down the line, what do you think that looks like not only from GM, but also from some of the competitors out there?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Well, in this case, we're seeing them invest heavily into V8, these gas powered engines that we're seeing that they're still important for the automaker, right? Because they need these for the Tahoe's, their Silverado's, Escalades, and things like that. So it sounds like this is just sort of a way for GM to sort of bet on the next 10 years or so because they don't-- as they see 2035 is their kind of goal for pure electrics, it's still a long time from now. And they're going to be investing in gas powered engines.And this is along the same lines as Ford kind of splitting the company up into two parts, their EV business and also their gas powered business. That's also pretty big. And Stellantis and their CEO talking about how we don't see that gas business going away anytime soon, especially if we can make more fuel efficient engines and replace older cars with these cars that spew less carbon out of the exhaust pipe and also give you better mileage, better performance, and also might be better for the environment, too.DAVE BRIGGS: All right, Pras Subramanian there.

The shortages in microchips and labor are also impacting every level of the automotive supply chain. However, the development of electric vehicles is a significant global trend, with particular focus on improving battery performance and expanding charging infrastructure. This results in increased research and development by vehicle manufacturers, who are continuing to invest in EV technology despite other challenges they may be facing. The fast pace of development in the EV industry indicates that manufacturers have an optimistic outlook about the future of EVs. New advancements are regularly being made, bringing the industry closer to the concept of ""Vehicles 2.0"". Larry Keyler, Partner and Global Automotive Leader at RSM US, said on January 18: “The development of autonomous vehicle technology has slowed down somewhat, as manufacturers redirect and refocus on the refinement of the electric vehicle. These are certainly being driven by the regulatory landscape, which at the moment is accelerating a path to wide-scale EV adoption. Governments in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific are all implementing their own initiatives, not to mention the UN, and auto makers are under pressure to deliver”. However, Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska wrote in an investor note in December 2022: “There is active demand destruction in the industry, given inflation, interest rates, and energy costs − but so far, this has mostly impacted the backlog.”Investors looking to explore the auto space can also check out 11 Best Autonomous Vehicle Stocks To Buy, 10 Fastest Growing Car Companies in the World, and 10 Best Auto Stocks To Buy.

Its products provide the company’s customers with critical advantages, including fuel economy, reduced emissions, reliability and total-cost-of ownership. The importance of Allison Transmission’s products and its dominant market position have historically given it strong pricing power. Yet, in the year leading up to our purchase, the company’s shares underperformed peers by more than 40 percentage points. Although we believe the company’s fundamentals are still as strong, if not better, than its peers, investors have worried about how commercial vehicle electrification will affect Allison Transmission’s long-term business. We believe that the company’s investments in next-generation products will enable it to maintain its position as an industry leader, even as technologies change. Furthermore, we believe that our investment carries limited downside risk because Allison Transmission’s shares sell at 10x free cash flow, which ascribes almost no value to the future. In addition, the company’s management team diligently returns capital to shareholders.”7. Group 1 Automotive, Inc.

(NYSE:GPI) based on his revised price targets for the group.According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, Group 1 Automotive, Inc. (NYSE:GPI) was part of 30 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 24 in the earlier quarter. Anthony Bozza’s Lakewood Capital Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 331,726 shares worth $47.4 million. Here is what ClearBridge Investments Small Cap Value Strategy has to say about Group 1 Automotive, Inc. (NYSE:GPI) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“We also initiated a new position in Group 1 Automotive (NYSE:GPI), in the consumer discretionary sector. Group 1 Automotive is one of the leading auto dealership groups in the U.S. and the U.K. Through our analysis, we believe the current stock price already discounts a considerable decline in revenue and profits due to concerns about elevated used car prices and high gross margins per unit. However, we believe this does not reflect the underlying strength of the company’s diversified business line and flexible cost structure. Ultimately, we believe the company will prove more durable than the market expects and be a long-term value creator for the portfolio.”6.

Cowen is naming United Airlines its best idea for 2023.For more on the steel-bird trade, let's bring in Cowen senior research analyst Helane Becker. Helane, great to speak with you this morning here. Why United Airlines as the best idea for 2023?HELANE BECKER: Hi. Thanks for having me.Well our number-one reason is international business expansion. So we think domestic business travel will not grow that much this year. You're seeing a lot of layoffs at companies, especially on the West Coast where United has one of its major-- one of its major hubs. But you are seeing a return of international business travel where it's just so hard to do Zoom calls with time-zone changes that range from anywhere from, say, seven hours to Eastern Europe from the US East Coast to as long as 12 hours to Tokyo or 14 or 15 hours to Australia.So when you think about that, when you think about getting business done and borders reopening, United is very well positioned from their coastal hubs to encompass that travel, and they're also adding more leisure destinations for the summer to encapture-- encapsulate that.So from our perspective, we think they're in a really good position to grow that business. That's higher-margin, higher-yielding business. Air fares in the back of the cabin are going up or have gone up and don't seem to show any signs of abating. And their costs-- even though we expect their labor costs, especially pilot costs, to rise in the second half of this year, their costs seem to be somewhat under control.JARED BLIKRE: And let me ask you about some of the competitors then. Delta another big airline here that you cover. How does Delta compare to United? And some of the favorable terms that you were seeing in that particular airline, how does that cross over?Story continuesHELANE BECKER: Yeah, so sort of similar. The only difference between United and Delta in here is that Delta has some very cost-specific issues for the first quarter. So for them, they have higher maintenance costs than United has this quarter. They have a shift in-- or I guess I want to say an increase in capacity from their core hubs like Atlanta and Minneapolis, and that shift is going to cause their unit costs to appear to rise faster than those of United's or maybe go down slower than those of United's because they're both forecasting a decline in unit costs this year from the 2019-- I guess the 2019 levels, kind of getting back to those levels.Anyway, I think those are some of the issues we see for Delta that are very company specific that we don't see for United. But that said, Delta has a great balance sheet. They're paying down debt. They're not buying $20 billion worth of aircraft this year and next year combined, as United is. They have the commitment to pay down debt before they return capital to shareholders. So we do have an outperform rating on Delta too.BRAD SMITH: Helane, all of the airlines are still trying to get back to their prepandemic capacity, and all of them are pointing to pilots as well. United Airlines making a big investment in one of its new hubs to train pilots and even some of the flight attendants. We know that this has been a big priority over at Delta from our conversations with CEO Ed Bastian as well. Do pilots eliminate all of the capacity issues, though, that airlines have right now, and what is the difference that customers can expect once pilots are fully back in the throes to those prepandemic levels?HELANE BECKER: OK so that's a fair question, and there's a lot to unpack there. Here's my thought on this. In 2020, the airlines asked any pilot who was intending to retire between 2020 and 2022 to accelerate their retirement, compensated them by paying them until whichever day was that they were going to turn 65. They kept them on for health benefits and so on.United didn't do that. They just asked their pilots if they would consider cutting the hours for all pilots rather than accelerate retirements. Probably some pilots did retire, but they tried to keep as many on staff as possible.Now as you think about coming out of the pandemic, the industry had to hire 10,000 pilots to replace the ones that retired in 2020, those that were accelerating retirement and those who were mandated to retire anyway. And now, you know, fast forward to where we are in 2023. The industry had to hire something like 14,000 pilots last year to replace those who left and those who were turning 65 anyway.And then as you think about the growth this year, this was going to be a peak decade anyway. We wrote about this as far back as 2014 that the 2020s were going to be a period of time when the airline industry needed to accelerate pilot hiring, and this year we're forecasting at least 10,000 to 12,000 pilots need to be hired-- 8,000 at American, Delta, United and Southwest alone, and then the other 2,000 to 4,000 at every other airline to handle the growth.This is why many small cities are losing service because airlines are hiring from their regional partners. And just because one airline says we won't hire from this regional partner because we don't want to, you know, screw up our own feed, it doesn't mean another airline won't hire from them.So you see a lot of pilot training going on. That's a big bottleneck. We're thinking that doesn't get resolved before next year at the earliest and more likely 2025. Every time I think about how close we are to '24 and '25, it's astonishing to me because it's going to be a couple of more years.And then aside from all of that, you don't have a lot of expansion going on at airports around the country. You have a lack of air-traffic controllers, which people forget about and don't talk about. The government says ATC is not an issue, but the industry is losing 400 to 500 a year in retirements, and at least 200 to 300 a year wash out of the academy, and they only take 1,000 into the academy. So they're only netting 500 or so.So in addition to--BRAD SMITH: Helane?HELANE BECKER: --the pilot shortage-- yes, sir?BRAD SMITH: Yeah, I've got to be quick here. We've only got about 15 seconds. But if I'm an investor trying to figure out if I should get into any of the airlines right now, should I be excited, or should I be a little concerned about the number of pilots that need to come into the fold here?HELANE BECKER: I think you should be excited to invest in the largest airlines because they're never going to have a problem.BRAD SMITH: All right.JARED BLIKRE: All right. We're going to have to leave it there. Really appreciate you stopping by, all your insights, as always. Cowen senior research analyst Helane Becker.]"

This Atlanta-based carrier reported better-than-expected earnings per share and revenues. However, investors were disappointed with the tepid guidance for first-quarter 2023. The downbeat first-quarter 2023 guidance was due to the expectation of high costs.United Airlines UAL, like Delta, surpassed earnings and revenue estimates for fourth-quarter 2022. Riding on upbeat air-travel demand, UAL expects earnings per share in 2023 to increase massively from 2022 actuals.Southwest Airlines LUV was also a news-maker in the past week, courtesy of the pay-related deals inked with two labor groups. Allegiant Travel Company ALGT reported rosy traffic numbers driven by buoyant air traffic.Recap of the Latest Top Stories1 Delta’s fourth-quarter 2022 earnings (excluding 19 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.48 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.29 per share. DAL reported earnings of 22 cents per share a year ago, dull in comparison to the current scenario, as air-travel demand was not so buoyant then. Delta, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), reported revenues of $13,435 million, which also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,030.3 million. Driven by the high air-travel demand, total revenues increased more than 41.87% on a year-over-year basis. Management expects first-quarter 2023 earnings per share in the band of 15-40 cents.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here2. United Airlines reported fourth-quarter 2022 earnings of $2.46 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.07. In the year-ago quarter, UAL had incurred a loss of $1.60 per share when air-travel demand was not as buoyant as in the current scenario. Operating revenues of $12,400 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12,230 million. UAL’s revenues increased 51.37% year over year owing to upbeat air-travel demand. The optimistic air-travel demand scenario is also evident from the fact that total operating revenues increased 13.9% from fourth-quarter 2019 (pre-coronavirus) levels. For the first quarter of 2023, United Airlines expects capacity to improve by around 20% from the year-ago reported figure. Revenues for the March quarter are anticipated to grow almost 50% year over year. Total unit revenues are anticipated to grow almost 25% year over year. UAL expects first-quarter earnings per share in the 50 cents-$1.00 band. UAL forecasts the average aircraft fuel price per gallon to be $3.19 in the first quarter. The adjusted pre-tax margin is expected to be roughly 3% in the March quarter.Story continuesFor 2023, United Airlines expects total unit revenues to remain flat year over year. CASM, excluding fuel, third-party business expenses, profit-sharing and special charges, is expected to remain flat year over year. UAL forecasts the average aircraft fuel price per gallon in the $2.85-$2.90 band for 2023. The adjusted pre-tax margin is expected to be 9%. Adjusted capital expenditures are expected to be around $8.5 billion. Total revenues are anticipated to grow in the high teens versus 2022 actuals. UAL expects 2023 earnings per share in the $10-$12 band.3. Southwest Airlines’ management announced that while its flight instructors approved a new contract, its facilities maintenance technicians inked a provisional deal. Southwest Airlines has 200 plus flight instructors who provide classroom instruction for flight operations and simulator training to pilots (current as well as newly hired ones). The flight instructors are represented by Transport Workers Union Local 557. They reached a tentative agreement with LUV last month. On being put to a vote, a high majority of the instructors voted in favor of the deal. The other positive labor-related update at LUV came when the union (Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association or AMFA), representing its facilities maintenance technicians, reached a tentative pay-related agreement with LUV.Recently, another carrier, Spirit Airlines SAVE received encouraging tidings on the labor front when the union covering its pilots ratified a pay-related deal. That story was covered in detail in last week’s write-up.4. At Allegiant Air, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) for scheduled service increased 5.9 points year over year to 84.7% in December 2022 as the traffic increase was more than the capacity expansion. Moreover, departures improved 2.3% from the December 2021 actuals for scheduled service as well as for total system. In December 2022, Allegiant carried 9.9% more passengers (system-wide) than in December 2021. Capacity (system-wide) increased 2.6% from the year-ago reading. Across the total system, ALGT carried 10.8% more passengers in December 2022 from December 2019 actuals. Departures (system-wide) increased 5.6% from the December 2019 actuals.5. Pilots at Hawaiian Airlines, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Hawaiian Holdings HA, reached a tentative pay-related four-year deal with the company. HA’s pilots are represented by the union, Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA). The agreement, if ratified, will make the pilots eligible for a 32.9% (on an average) pay hike during the tenure of the deal. This includes an average 16.6% pay hike on the date of signing. Other facilities like signing bonus and retirement facilities are also there. The deal, on materialization, would go a long way in improving pilots’ quality of life. However, the new contract still has a long way to go before it becomes effective. The tentative agreement does not necessarily mean that the deal will be operational. The provisional deal will now be put to a vote. The voting procedure will commence on Jan 27 and last for two weeks. The deal will be effective from Mar 2 if the outcome of the voting procedure is favorable.PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe table above shows that almost most airline stocks traded in the red over the past week.

(NASDAQ:UAL) are flying high after its fourth-quarter results cruised past analysts' estimates and forecasted for further strength this year.The stock is up more than 30% year to date and will likely continue trading in the green in 2023.Clear Skies Ahead for United AirlinesWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with UAL. Click here to check it out. UAL 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of UALPeter Lynch Chart of UALTravel demand continues to improve despite higher fares due to rising costs for fuel, labor and other expenses. According to Bank of America, system net sales on Jan. 8 climbed a remarkable 4.6% over pre-pandemic levels. Therefore, it seems the sector will remain robust this year and should push United and other airline stocks to new highs.Airlines have been a particularly strong performer in the first few weeks of 2023 as the transportation industry has climbed nearly 7%. Despite storms in December impacting holiday travelers, investors continue to have faith in the airline industry's recovery following the pandemic. However, another problem has hit the travel industry hard in recent weeks, raising speculation about a potential weakness in the transportation system.In early January, the Federal Aviation Administration suffered an outage in a key safety system. The FAA's Notice to Air Missions system failed, causing problems with operations throughout U.S. airspace and leading the agency to order a temporary halt to all domestic flight departures. Generally, however, airline stocks were not overly affected by the news.Stellar fourth-quarter resultsOver the past three years, United Airlines has made large investments in tools, infrastructure and personnel. In a statement, CEO Scott Kirby noted that this preparation has allowed the company to jump-start on its future goals. Organizationally speaking, these investments are essential and will no doubt be instrumental in helping it speed past the competition. And recent results affirm that the legacy carrier is heading in the right direction.Story continuesOn Tuesday, United reported its fourth-quarter and full fiscal 2022 results, which came out ahead of analysts' estimates on both the top and bottom lines. It posted operating revenue of $12.4 billion for the three months ended Dec. 31, beating expectations by $0.2 billion. Moreover, it generated adjusted earnings per share of $2.46, which topped estimates by 36 cents.In addition, the company recorded an $843 million profit with a 14% increase in revenue compared to the same period in 2019.For fiscal 2022, United saw adjusted net income of $831 million.Based on these strong results, United appears to be well on its way to recovery. Thanks to strong travel demand and higher fares, United's outlook for early 2023 also exceeded Wall Street's estimates.The company projected a 50% increase in revenue during the first quarter of the year compared to the same period in 2022. The airline expects to post earnings per share between 50 cents and $1, which will likely beat estimates again. Fueling this profit surge is a 20% year-over-year growth in airborne passengers, creating an atmosphere of optimism for the new year.Spending spree is a concernUnited Airlines' plan to purchase hundreds of aircraft from Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA) reinvigorated fears of aggressive spending. The airline will save money in the long run by owning the asset, but this purchase can also be seen as a long-term investment.While its $8.5 billion in capital expenditures this year are worrying, the company is likely to post over $3 billion in earnings, which should stem the bleeding somewhat.Its massive spending, though, could be justified to an extent, given that air travel and gross domestic product levels are still far below pre-Covid benchmarks. With the innovations and protocols, many of the big players in the industry are looking forward to surpassing the levels seen before the pandemic.Moreover, United has widely acknowledged the challenges ahead in light of the staffing issues plaguing airlines due to industry-wide, pandemic-related churn and plane shortages. On top of this, it has identified outdated technology as an additional pressure restricting capacity levels throughout 2022.To confront this challenge, United is taking a two-pronged approach by launching initiatives to bring new talent into the field and focusing on improving certain procedures and facilities internally. For example, through its Calibrate apprenticeship program and Aviate Academy, the company hopes to build up pilot and crew numbers for the near future.TakeawayUnited Airlines dished out a spectacular fourth quarter, which was marked by healthy growth across its business.Moreover, its outlook for the year is a breath of fresh air for investors, with additional aircraft and personnel expected to join the company to make its operations more efficient. Therefore, with all these factors considered, it can be safely said that United Airlines is a potential portfolio winner for investors who have faith in the company's vision and ability to execute.At this point, it seems United's stock is undervalued as it trades at just 0.3 times forward sales estimates, 36% lower than its five-year average, which significantly adds to its appeal.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

We are glad to offer a platform where we can network with key stakeholders to better understand community priorities and needs,"" says Richard Bynum, chief corporate responsibility officer at PNC.PNC's recently appointed Community Advisory Council joined the bank's Diversity and Inclusion, Community Development, Community Affairs and Supplier Diversity leaders for a half-day session during the symposium to discuss shared progress on PNC's Community Benefits Plan commitments and to solicit feedback for guiding ongoing actions and investments under the plan.Seventeen council members representing state and national community economic development organizations from 11 local PNC markets pointed to challenges impacting community development and lending efforts in low- and moderate-income (LMI) communities and communities of color.Story continues""Rising housing costs, inflation pressures, ongoing federal interest rate hikes and continued barriers to accessible capital topped the list of challenges,"" says Reymundo Ocañas, director of community development banking. ""We know we are going to have to pay special attention to these issues and think strategically about where we can make meaningful impact with a special lens on support through the predicted recession heading into the first quarter of 2023.""Exploring Actionable SolutionsInvited members from more than 100 community organizations attended the symposium sessions designed to inspire deeper discussions and present actionable solutions to advance financial inclusion within communities of color.Noted financial journalist and New York Times bestselling author Lynnette Khalfani-Cox, also known as The Money Coach, led a discussion on inclusive banking, the racial wealth gap, homeownership and student loan debt.""Housing wealth comprises 70% of the typical American's wealth, so we can't have any conversation about equity without talking about housing,"" says Khalfani-Cox, CEO and co-founder of financial education company TheMoneyCoach.net LLC.The personal finance expert points to Federal Reserve Bank numbers that indicate the average white household has a net worth of $188,200 while the average net worth of Black households stands at $24,100.1.""We can all do much better financially if we provide access and opportunity for all,"" she adds. ""A McKinsey report looked at what could happen if we actually closed the wealth gap by 2028. What they found was that we could add about a trillion-and-half dollars to GDP just by closing the Black-White wealth gap.""The symposium's final day featured breakout sessions, thought leadership content and a diverse slate of researchers and expert panelists offering best practices and data-driven solutions to help promote economic opportunities and address financial inequalities in local communities.Increasing Access, Reducing InequitiesRapper, activist and entrepreneur Michael ""Killer Mike"" Render, co-founder of Greenwood Bank, joined several other financial technology entrepreneurs in a panel on ""Reducing Inequities Through FinTech"" moderated by Mike Lyons, head of corporate and institutional banking at PNC. Greenwood Bank, a Black-owned financial institution and mobile banking platform, was established to meet the needs of Black and Latino individuals and businesses that have been traditionally underserved by banking institutions. PNC is an investor in the Atlanta-based digital banking platform.""I'm a part of the financial sector because Greenwood is a new and innovative idea that's working to help people save money and better understand money,"" Render says. ""I think PNC gets it. PNC isn't organizing for communities of color. It is organizing with the people.""Render adds that financial literacy and responsibility are vital to generational wealth transfer and banking relationships are key in communities of color.Bynum agrees and sees the symposium discussions as key to improving access to financial resources and the Bank's effort to advance economic empowerment in the communities it serves.""These important discussions will help inform how PNC's regional presidents and Community Development Banking teams advance affordable housing, economic development and financial health initiatives in local markets,"" he says.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from The PNC Financial Services Group on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: The PNC Financial Services GroupWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/pnc-financial-services-groupEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: The PNC Financial Services GroupView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/736087/PNC-Convenes-Inaugural-Community-Leadership-Symposium-to-Understand-Needs]"

ISRG is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter 2022 results on Jan 24, after the closing bell.The company’s stock has gained 12.4% in the past six months, compared with a increase of 0.5% for the industry. The S&amp;P 500 Index declined 3.3% in the same time period.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 8.18%. Its earnings beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average earnings surprise being 3.41%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ4 EstimatesCurrently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for ISRG’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.66 billion, suggesting an improvement of 6.9% from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings stands at $1.26 per share, indicating a decline of 3.1% from the prior-year quarter.Factors to NoteIntuitive Surgical announced preliminary results for the fourth quarter earlier this month. The company estimates total revenues in the quarter to be $1.66 billion, below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.87 billion. The 7% year-over-year growth in revenues is likely to have been driven by continued demand for da Vinci procedures. The company’s system placements are likely to decline compared to the year-ago period. These effects are likely to have driven the fourth-quarter results.The Instruments &amp; Accessories segment’s revenues are likely to be approximately $941 million in the fourth quarter, up 12% from the prior-year period. Robust demand for da Vinci procedures continued across all markets but China, where COVID-19 resurgence adversely impacted procedure volume. The da Vinci procedures increased 18% year over year. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues stands at $954 million.Intuitive Surgical’s da Vinci capital placements are estimated to be on the lower side due to lesser trade-in of systems (majority of the U.S. customers have upgraded to newer generation systems), continued supply chain challenges impacting the availability of semiconductor components, and growing capital spending pressure on hospitals amid rising inflation. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of the da Vinci system in the United States is pegged at 198 units.Story continuesHowever, the company’s da Vinci capital placements have been benefiting from rising demand outside the United States. Intuitive Surgical placed 130 systems in the third quarter compared with 109 in the prior-year quarter in ex-U.S. markets. The trend is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter. The company expects the growth of the single port (SP) platform to have been driven by additional clinical indications and clearances in markets beyond Korea and the United States. Moreover, approval for its da Vinci SP in Japan in October is likely to have driven unit sales in the country during the soon-to-be reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of the da Vinci system outside the United States is pegged at 149 units.The company estimated that it has sold 369 da Vinci Surgical systems in the fourth quarter of 2022 across all markets, down from 385 systems in the year-ago period.During the third quarter, the use of Intuitive Surgical’s digital product, Intuitive Hub, continued to exhibit strong growth year over year. The company is in discussion with the FDA on how to best characterize some of its core artificial intelligence technologies. It will continue to bring its flexible endoscopy platform Ion to scale and boost capacity, quality and cost improvements while seeking to expand access to new markets. These developments might have contributed to Intuitive Surgical’s fourth-quarter performance.ISRG’s new platforms made advancements in commercialization, innovation and clinical programs. This trend is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter as well. However, higher logistics costs during the reported quarter amid supply-chain challenges and rising inflationary pressure are likely to have driven expenses higher, thus hurting margins.What Does Our Model Say?Per our proven model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

231,7fb456a9-e4e2-39d5-9e70-d72dce66a7f8,RF,2023-01-21,Regions Financial (RF) Beats Q4 Earnings and Revenue Estimates,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regions-financial-rf-beats-q4-122512981.html,1674217512,STORY,"['RF', 'RF-PC', 'RBCAA']","[Regions Financial (RF) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.67 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.65 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.44 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3.08%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this holding company for Regions Bank would post earnings of $0.59 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.56, delivering a surprise of -5.08%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Regions Financial , which belongs to the Zacks Banks - Southeast industry, posted revenues of $2 billion for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.05%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.63 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Regions Financial shares have added about 0.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 1.6%.What's Next for Regions Financial?While Regions Financial has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Regions Financial: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.65 on $1.93 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.50 on $7.78 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Banks - Southeast is currently in the bottom 31% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Republic Bancorp (RBCAA), has yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022.This holding company for Republic Bank &amp; Trust is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.83 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -1.2%.

232,d01b478c-7a03-37c8-b255-3f48a2b14f0b,V,2023-01-21,Investors in Visa (NYSE:V) have made a favorable return of 83% over the past five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-visa-nyse-v-made-120041596.html,1674302441,STORY,['V'],"[When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. To wit, the Visa share price has climbed 78% in five years, easily topping the market return of 33% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 9.7% in the last year , including dividends .So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Visa While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Visa managed to grow its earnings per share at 20% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 12% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Visa has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Visa, it has a TSR of 83% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Visa has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 9.7% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 13% per year, is even more impressive. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for Visa  you should be aware of.We will like Visa better if we see some big insider buys.

234,e19151e1-9143-3f16-a862-db9af3f212f4,V,2023-01-21,Is Visa Stock a Buy Going into Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-stock-buy-going-earnings-215509361.html,1674251709,STORY,"['V', 'MA', 'DFS']","[Visa V, the global payments processing company, reports Q1 FY23 earnings on Thursday January 26 after the market closes.Since its IPO in 2008, Visa has been a tremendous stock returning 1,500%. Even during a challenging 2022 Visa managed to stay positive, up 8.5% over the last 12 months, well above the S&amp;P’s return of -11%.Quick OverviewVisa is a powerhouse in the payments technology industry, dominating its closest competitor Mastercard MA, with more than 50% greater payments volume. V has also grown its revenue consistently over the years including 10% in fiscal 2021 and 22% in 2022.Along with many other multinationals, Visa has been affected negatively by the Russia, Ukraine conflict. After building a significant presence in Russia it has completely withdrawn. Business in Russia accounted for 4% of Visa’s revenue.CompetitionVisa’s primary competitor is Mastercard MA, as well as American Express AXP, and Discover Financial Services DFS.Mastercard has very similar offerings as Visa. Neither are involved in extending credit or issuing cards, and only do so through co-branded relationships. AXP and DFS are different in that way as they offer credit options.Mastercard, like Visa, is a tremendous business, and MA has outperformed V over the long-term. Since 2008 Visa has returned 1,480%, while Mastercard has returned 1,840%. Although over the last 12 months, V has edged a small outperformance of 9% vs. 6%Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings ExpectationsZacks estimates call for Visa’s Q1 FY23 sales to increase 8.8% to $7.7 billion. Earnings expectations are strong too, with Zacks analysts forecasting 10.5% growth to $2.00 per share.Earnings estimate revisions have stayed mostly consistent, with a $0.01 increase to the current quarter estimates, and no change to the current year. There have been small revisions lower for the next quarter and next year estimates, which are down to $9.50 from $9.77 per share 90 days earlier.Story continuesThese flat, to negative earnings revisions explain Visa’s Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDiscover Financial Services DFS, already reported this week, offering some insights and setting expectations for Visa. DFS had a solid earnings report, beating estimates on both the top and bottom line for the quarter.DFS also announced that it is revamping its share repurchase plan, as well as paying a new semi-annual cash dividend on preferred shares. Over the last quarter DFS repurchased about 5.9 million shares worth $602 million, which reduced the share count by 2.1%.It wasn’t all good news for Discover Financial. FY22 adjusted earnings per share of $15.05 declined 13% YoY, and net earnings plunged 19% to $4.4 billion.Operating Metrics One Visa metric I will be looking at closely is total volume. Total volume is the sum of total payments and cash volume. Aggregate figures like total volume can break down large, complicated businesses into a single figure. Of course, it isn’t completely explanatory, but provides useful insights in a simple medium.The figure is also useful for gauging the economy broadly. As the world’s leading payment processor, Visas figures provide valuable information on individuals economic activities.Total volume has missed estimates over the past three reported quarters, and four of the last five. Something I find concerning is that the magnitude of the misses continues to grow as well. Looking a little closer at the data we can see last quarter, total volume missed by -3.6%, but the brunt of the loss came from Europe, which missed estimates by -14.5%.Europe is the second largest contributor to Visa’s top line, so these results have significant impact. Additionally, it offers insights into European economic behavior, which would appear to be slowing. Interestingly, the rest of the geographies all missed by less than the total number.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings BeatsVisa almost always beats earnings estimates. Going back to 2008, the closest they have gotten to a miss was two reports that reported exactly in line with estimates.But with earnings revisions coming in flat, and the economy slowing, maybe now we see a miss. The probability of a miss, is admittedly very low, but if it were to happen it would be significant for Visa and speak to the state of the economy.Zacks figures think Visa will beat. Using Zacks ESP (Earnings Surprise Prediction) we can expect Visa to beat earnings by 0.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuationFor Visa’s entire history as a public company, it’s one year forward P/E ratio has remained above the S&amp;P’s average. Considering Visa’s exceptional business model, and consistent growth this makes sense.With a one year forward P/E ratio of 25.5x, Visa is currently above its 15-year median of 24x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVisa sits comfortably holding a very large cash position of $15.7 billion, and regularly building it with its strong free cash flow. Additionally, Visa’s net debt is 4.3% of its net capital, which is significantly lower than the industry average of 17%.Visa has also demonstrated its commitment to shareholder value by increasing is dividend payment every year since 2009, which currently yields 0.8%.ConclusionVisa is a great company, with a rock-solid business model, and very long runway considering the size and scope of the digital payments landscape. It excelled during the very challenging 2022 period, continues to prioritize shareholders, and grow both the top and bottom line.The real risk for Visa is the underlying strength of the economy. For now, the economy expects a soft landing, or mild recession. But if those expectations are wrong, the sales and earnings forecasts of V and many other companies will need to readjust. That being said, even in the worst-case people will be using Visa’s payments technology.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

237,5c115fa4-4d01-3303-9f46-85e3155e7cbf,MAR,2023-01-21,Quite a few insiders invested in Doré Copper Mining Corp. (CVE:DCMC) last year which is positive news for shareholders,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quite-few-insiders-invested-dor-131220934.html,1674306740,STORY,['HG=F'],"[Generally, when a single insider buys stock, it is usually not a big deal. However, when several insiders are buying, like in the case of Doré Copper Mining Corp. (CVE:DCMC), it sends a favourable message to the company's shareholders.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Doré Copper Mining The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Doré Copper MiningEarlier in the year, President Ernest Mast paid CA$0.58 per share in a CA$95k purchase. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being CA$0.32). Their view may have changed since then, but at least it shows they felt optimistic at the time. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.While Doré Copper Mining insiders bought shares during the last year, they didn't sell. They paid about CA$0.44 on average. I'd consider this a positive as it suggests insiders see value at around the current price. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeDoré Copper Mining is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Doré Copper Mining Insiders Bought Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen a bit of insider buying at Doré Copper Mining. Insiders shelled out CA$43k for shares in that time. It's good to see the insider buying, as well as the lack of recent sellers. However, in this case the amount invested recently is quite small.Story continuesDoes Doré Copper Mining Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Insiders own 7.0% of Doré Copper Mining shares, worth about CA$1.6m, according to our data. However, it's possible that insiders might have an indirect interest through a more complex structure. Overall, this level of ownership isn't that impressive, but it's certainly better than nothing!What Might The Insider Transactions At Doré Copper Mining Tell Us?Our data shows a little insider buying, but no selling, in the last three months. The net investment is not enough to encourage us much. On a brighter note, the transactions over the last year are encouraging. We'd like to see bigger individual holdings. However, we don't see anything to make us think Doré Copper Mining insiders are doubting the company. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Doré Copper Mining. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 5 warning signs for Doré Copper Mining (of which 2 are a bit unpleasant!) you should know about.But note: Doré Copper Mining may not be the best stock to buy.

VZ is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2022 results before the opening bell on Jan 24. In the fourth quarter, the Consumer segment is likely to have recorded year-over-year higher revenues owing to a healthy momentum in the wireless business.Factors at PlayThe Consumer segment includes the retail wireline and wireless businesses.In the fourth quarter, Verizon continued to deploy 100 MHz of C-Band spectrum to further expand its 5G coverage and reached more than 175 million people with 5G Ultra Wideband service. The company is witnessing significant 5G adoption and fixed wireless broadband momentum while increasing demand for premium mobility and broadband offerings instill optimism. It extended its high-speed fiber Internet across additional homes in Massachusetts. These are likely to get reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.During the quarter, Verizon offered customers the Welcome Unlimited plan with unlimited talk, text and data on its 5G Nationwide network for just $25 per line per month for four lines. It also launched new Prepaid Unlimited plans for as low as $50 per month, including free access to Disney+ for six months. In addition to the new Unlimited plans, Verizon Prepaid offered a 15GB data plan for as low as $35 per month with Auto Pay. These developments are likely to have had a positive impact on Verizon’s performance.In the to-be-reported quarter, the company began moving customer traffic onto the new cloud-native, containerized 5G design core for improved service agility, flexibility and automated scalability. The higher level of operational autonomy is likely to facilitate the seamless functioning of the next generation of services enabled by new network technologies. This is likely to have translated into incremental revenues.However, adverse foreign currency translations and high operating costs are likely to have led to soft margins in the fourth quarter. Continuous infrastructure investments for fiber and 5G deployments are expected to have weighed on the margins.The company’s wireline division is also struggling with persistent losses in access lines as a result of competitive pressure from voice-over-Internet protocol service providers and aggressive triple-play (voice, data, video) offerings by the cable companies. Due to challenging macroeconomic conditions and high inflationary pressures, several customers are likely to have faltered on their monthly bill payments, further affecting the quarterly performance.Story continuesOverall ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Consumer segment is pegged at $26,749 million, indicating an improvement from $25,697 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Operating income from the segment stands at $7,165 million, suggesting a fall from $7,349 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $35,059 million. It reported revenues of $34,067 million in the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimate for adjusted earnings per share stands at $1.21, which suggests a decline from the year-ago tally of $1.31.Earnings WhispersOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Verizon for the fourth quarter.

Spectrum crunch with a saturated wireless market is another headwind.However, Verizon plans to accelerate the availability of the 5G Ultra Wideband network with C-Band deployment, focusing on 5G mobility, nationwide broadband, mobile edge compute and business solutions. It is offering various mix-and-match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans.Verizon is also aggressively expanding its fiber optics network to support 4G LTE, 5G wireless standards and wireline connections.

Shares have underperformed the industry this year so far.However, Sanofi's Specialty Care unit is on a strong footing, particularly with the regular label expansion of Dupixent. Dupixent has become the key top-line driver for Sanofi. With outside U.S. revenues accelerating and multiple approvals for new indications, its sales are expected to be higher. Sanofi possesses a leading vaccine portfolio, which has become the primary top-line driver.Its R&amp;D pipeline is strong. Several data read-outs are expected in 2023.

According to the terms of the collaboration, the firms will work in unison to provide rural communities and seniors with limited access to transportation with greater access to care powered by the Verizon 4G LTE and 5G Ultra Wideband networks.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in the Last 10 Years.  While it is important for investors to have a long-term perspective and not get caught up in short-term fluctuations, it is equally important to consider historical context and not base investment decisions solely on recent performance or market headlines. A diversified portfolio and a well thought out investment strategy can help individuals stay focused on their long-term goals and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market movements.  Investors selling off their equities are displaying short sightedness, since latest Morgan Stanley data suggests that the operating margin of the S&amp;P 500 Index stands at 11.6%, which is still close to the record high of 13.1% achieved in late 2021. The present operating margin is also meaningfully higher than pre-pandemic levels of 10.2% and the rolling 10-year average of 9.4%. 2022 nominal revenues for S&amp;P 500 constituents were also 8% greater than the 10-year trend. Similarly, the real inflation-adjusted consumption in 2022 was approximately 7% ahead of its long-term trend.  To build a portfolio that has a chance to beat market volatility and offer stable returns, investors should look out for the top performing S&amp;P 500 stocks over the years. Although past performance is not a measure for future performance, it is helpful to pick up companies that have shown resilience over time and will likely continue to perform well. While some investors choose income stocks to weather a harsh market environment (see 11 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats to Buy), others seek out defensive equities instead. (see 14 Best Stocks To Buy Before A Recession) Some of the best performing S&amp;P 500 stocks in the last 10 years include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). Story continuesOur MethodologyWe used a stock screener to scan the S&amp;P 500 index and picked 11 of the best-performing stocks over the past 10 years with most significant gains, as of January 18. However, some of these companies were not operational during the entire ten year period. We scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 920 hedge funds to assess the hedge fund sentiment around these equities. The list is arranged according to the share price returns of each firm. 11 Best Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in the Last 10 YearsPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashBest Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in the Last 10 Years11. Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 4410-Year Share Price Gains as of January 18: 925.2%Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) is an American biotechnology company that discovers, develops, and sells messenger RNA therapeutics and vaccines for the treatment of infectious diseases, immuno-oncology diseases, rare diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and auto-immune diseases worldwide. On January 17, Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) announced results from a late-stage trial of its investigational respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine candidate, noting that it met its core efficacy goals. The vaccine candidate, mRNA-1345, indicated an efficacy of 83.7% against RSV lower respiratory tract disease in older adults, the company reported. On January 11, Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Papadakis raised Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA)’s price target from $185 to $225 and maintained a ""Buy"" rating on the shares. Despite trimming the company's fiscal 2024 revenue estimates, the analyst believes that recent news updates have been positive and have contributed to the boost in the price target. However, the analyst also believes that Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) will incur a loss this year due to planned research and development expenses.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 44 hedge funds were long Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 45 funds in the last quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 5.70 million shares worth $674.7 million. In addition to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) is one of the best performing stocks over the last decade. Here is what Baron Funds said about Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Within biotechnology, underperformance of Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) and lower exposure to this better performing sub-industry weighed the most on relative performance. Shares of Moderna, a leader in the emerging field of mRNA-based vaccines and therapeutics, declined due to increasing uncertainty around what a booster market could look like as COVID shifts away from pandemic status and becomes an increasingly commercial market rather than government funded.”10. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26910-Year Share Price Gains as of January 18: 969.5%Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the best performing S&amp;P 500 stocks, with shares exhibiting 10-year price gains of 969.5% as of January 18. On January 17, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares rose marginally after the company announced that it was expanding access to ChatGPT through its Azure cloud service. The tech giant disclosed that ChatGPT would be available ""soon"" via a program called Azure OpenAI Service. Microsoft already has a $1 billion stake in OpenAI, and is in talks to grow its investment in the company by perhaps as much as $10 billion.On January 18, Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss maintained an Overweight rating and a $307 price target on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares ahead of the FQ2 earnings report. In a research note, the analyst told investors that Microsoft's alignment with primary secular trends and benefits from vendor consolidation are likely to result in continued share gains for the company. Weiss also believes that Microsoft's technology, scale, and distribution advantages contribute to a positive outlook on the company. According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was part of 269 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 258 funds in the prior quarter. Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 39.2 million shares worth $9.14 billion. Fundsmith made the following comment about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its yearly 2022 investor letter:“Take the example of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Intuit. Microsoft shares are currently being valued at a P/E ratio of 25.0 times the consensus EPS estimate for the fiscal year ending June 2023. Meanwhile, Intuit is being valued at 28.4 times the non-GAAP consensus estimate for the fiscal year ending July 2023. Many investors and analysts may accept that Intuit is trading at a higher multiple given expectations of greater growth potential. However, Intuit removes share-based compensation from their non-GAAP EPS whereas Microsoft does not. Given that Intuit’s GAAP EPS guidance for the year ending 31st July 2023 is $6.92–$7.22, its non-GAAP guidance is $13.59–$13.89, and the consensus estimate for 2023 EPS is at $13.69, it seems clear that most sell-side analysts are accepting the company’s non-GAAP adjustments, which includes the removal of some $1.8bn of share-based compensation, in their estimates. If we include the impact of share-based compensation in Intuit’s 2023 EPS to make a more apples-to-apples comparison with Microsoft based upon GAAP EPS, Intuit’s 2023 EPS would be closer to $9, meaning that the shares would be trading at a multiple of about 43 times. I think investors and analysts may find a premium of 14% for Intuit over Microsoft (28.4 times versus 25.0 times) to be reasonable. I’m not so sure they are fully aware that Intuit shares are actually trading at a premium of 73% if share-based compensation is treated in the same manner between the two companies.”9.

Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) was incorporated in 1980 and is headquartered in Fremont, California. The company distributed a $1.725 per share quarterly dividend to shareholders on January 4. It is one of the best performing S&amp;P 500 members over the last decade, with 10-year share price gains of 1,240% as of January 18. On January 18, Stifel analyst Brian Chin resumed coverage of Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) with a Hold rating and a $495 price target. The analyst cited that fundamentals, particularly in the memory market, have rapidly declined, and he expects investments to contract sharply next year, resulting in a drop in overall spending on fab equipment. He believes that Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX)’s leadership position in the memory market will likely become a drag on the business in 2023. According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 63 hedge funds were long Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX), compared to 56 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the biggest position holder in the company, with 3.7 million shares worth $1.37 billion. Renaissance Investment made the following comment about Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Conversely, we sold our positions in Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) and Zoetis (ZTS) following a sustained deterioration in fundamental factors. After a qualitative review of Lam Research, we believe the company will face a number of headwinds that could make for an unfavorable risk-reward position, given the highly cyclical nature of its business in a slowing global economy. We are also expecting fundamentals to turn negative as sales and operating profits are poised to decelerate, resulting in negative earnings revisions. While the stock trades at an attractive valuation multiple, we believe that this is more a sign that earnings will decline meaningfully.”6. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 10310-Year Share Price Gains as of January 18: 1,420%ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a California-based company that provides enterprise cloud computing solutions worldwide. It is one of the top S&amp;P 500 performers over the last decade, with 10-year share price gains of 1,420% as of January 18. On January 12, Wolfe Research analyst Alex Zukin raised the price target on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) to $500 from $440 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. His checks were ""so strong on an absolute and relative basis"" that he sees ServiceNow, Inc.

(NYSE:NOW) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 99 funds in the last quarter. Chase Coleman’s Tiger Global Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 1.7 million shares worth nearly $640 million. Like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is one of the most popular S&amp;P 500 stocks among elite hedge funds. Aristotle Atlantic made the following comment about ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Underperformance in the third quarter can be attributed to ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)’s slight miss on the second quarter earnings and guidance that was lower than expected for its third quarter outlook. The company is facing headwinds from the weaker macroeconomic conditions and a tempered outlook resulting from elongated sales cycles and an overall slowing software spending environment. These worsening conditions were highlighted by many software companies during the second quarter earnings season. We expect this to be temporary for ServiceNow where the long-term thesis of the company’s platform strategy and relevance to digital transformation strategies remains intact. The stock was also likely impacted by the rapid increase in interest rates during the third quarter and the resulting contraction of multiples on high-growth software stocks.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in the Last 10 Years.  Suggested articles:13 Best Communication Services Stocks To Invest In12 Best DRIP Stocks To Own13 Cash Rich Penny Stocks That Hedge Funds Are Buying Disclosure: None. 11 Best Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in the Last 10 Years is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +9.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +2.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Nvidia falls in, has gained 3.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.81 per share, indicating a change of -38.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.26 points to a change of -26.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.41 indicates a change of +35.1% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Nvidia.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NVDA _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $6.02 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -21.2%. The $26.94 billion and $29.47 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +0.1% and +9.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNvidia reported revenues of $5.93 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -16.5%. EPS of $0.58 for the same period compares with $1.17 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.93 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.02%. The EPS surprise was -17.14%.Over the last four quarters, Nvidia surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The GYN Surgical arm is expected to have gained from an ongoing rebound in elective procedures.We anticipate the company’s first-quarter fiscal 2022 results, scheduled for release on Feb 1 after the closing bell, to reflect these aspects.Click here to know how the company’s overall fiscal first-quarter performance is expected to be.DiagnosticsHologic’s Molecular Diagnostics sales for the fiscal first quarter are likely to have been impacted by a significant drop in the demand for COVID-19 testing. However, the company seems optimistic about the benefits of non-COVID assays on the Panther system. On the fiscal Q4 earnings call, Hologic noted strong global diagnostic business growth amid the adversities. During the fourth-quarter earnings update, Hologic noted that the company has nearly 3,250 Panthers instruments placed globally. This might have significantly boosted the segment’s revenues in the quarter to be reported.Per October 2022 update, Hologic is witnessing continued strong sequential growth from Biotheranostics and incremental contribution from Mobidiag internationally. The first-quarter performance is expected to have been driven by both legacy and new assays, namely the BBCVTV vaginitis panel, MGen, CTMG and respiratory menu on the Panther Fusion.GYN SurgicalHologic’s GYN Surgical business arm is likely to have gained from an ongoing rebound in elective procedures with the full-fledged opening up of the economy as well as acceleration from new business lines. During Q4, Hologic registered a strong performance from the surgical franchise led by MyoSure and Fluent, with contributions from recent acquisitions. We expect Hologic to have continued benefiting from the acquisitions of MyoSure Fluent and Bolder and Acessa in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Story continuesHologic, Inc.

ISRG is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter 2022 results on Jan 24, after the closing bell.The company’s stock has gained 12.4% in the past six months, compared with a increase of 0.5% for the industry. The S&amp;P 500 Index declined 3.3% in the same time period.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 8.18%. Its earnings beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed once, the average earnings surprise being 3.41%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQ4 EstimatesCurrently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for ISRG’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.66 billion, suggesting an improvement of 6.9% from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings stands at $1.26 per share, indicating a decline of 3.1% from the prior-year quarter.Factors to NoteIntuitive Surgical announced preliminary results for the fourth quarter earlier this month. The company estimates total revenues in the quarter to be $1.66 billion, below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.87 billion. The 7% year-over-year growth in revenues is likely to have been driven by continued demand for da Vinci procedures. The company’s system placements are likely to decline compared to the year-ago period. These effects are likely to have driven the fourth-quarter results.The Instruments &amp; Accessories segment’s revenues are likely to be approximately $941 million in the fourth quarter, up 12% from the prior-year period. Robust demand for da Vinci procedures continued across all markets but China, where COVID-19 resurgence adversely impacted procedure volume. The da Vinci procedures increased 18% year over year. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues stands at $954 million.Intuitive Surgical’s da Vinci capital placements are estimated to be on the lower side due to lesser trade-in of systems (majority of the U.S. customers have upgraded to newer generation systems), continued supply chain challenges impacting the availability of semiconductor components, and growing capital spending pressure on hospitals amid rising inflation. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of the da Vinci system in the United States is pegged at 198 units.Story continuesHowever, the company’s da Vinci capital placements have been benefiting from rising demand outside the United States. Intuitive Surgical placed 130 systems in the third quarter compared with 109 in the prior-year quarter in ex-U.S. markets. The trend is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter. The company expects the growth of the single port (SP) platform to have been driven by additional clinical indications and clearances in markets beyond Korea and the United States. Moreover, approval for its da Vinci SP in Japan in October is likely to have driven unit sales in the country during the soon-to-be reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of the da Vinci system outside the United States is pegged at 149 units.The company estimated that it has sold 369 da Vinci Surgical systems in the fourth quarter of 2022 across all markets, down from 385 systems in the year-ago period.During the third quarter, the use of Intuitive Surgical’s digital product, Intuitive Hub, continued to exhibit strong growth year over year. The company is in discussion with the FDA on how to best characterize some of its core artificial intelligence technologies. It will continue to bring its flexible endoscopy platform Ion to scale and boost capacity, quality and cost improvements while seeking to expand access to new markets. These developments might have contributed to Intuitive Surgical’s fourth-quarter performance.ISRG’s new platforms made advancements in commercialization, innovation and clinical programs. This trend is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter as well. However, higher logistics costs during the reported quarter amid supply-chain challenges and rising inflationary pressure are likely to have driven expenses higher, thus hurting margins.What Does Our Model Say?Per our proven model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

258,2626b098-c536-3f1f-a4dd-e2dabfc9a16f,TRV,2023-01-21,5 Property & Casualty Insurers to Gain Despite Catastrophe Loss,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-property-casualty-insurers-gain-152003545.html,1674228003,STORY,"['BRK-B', 'CB', 'TRV', '^GSPC', 'PGR', 'RE']","[The Zacks Property and Casualty Insurance (P&amp;C) industry is likely to benefit from better pricing, prudent underwriting and exposure growth. Industry players like Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B), Chubb Limited CB, The Progressive Corporation PGR, The Travelers Companies Inc. TRV and Everest Re Group RE are poised to grow despite a rise in catastrophic activities. Given an active catastrophe environment, the policy renewal rate should accelerate. Also, the increasing adoption of technology and the emergence of insurtech will help in the smooth functioning of the industry players.Though the industry is witnessing a rate increase, the magnitude has decreased in the last seven quarters. Nonetheless, an improvement in surplus and accelerated economic activities set the stage for a better M&amp;A environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Property and Casualty Insurance industry comprises companies that provide commercial and personal property insurance, and casualty insurance products and services. Such insurance helps to safeguard property in case of any natural or man-made disasters. Liability coverages are also provided by some industry players. The insurance coverage offered also includes automobiles, professional risk, marine, excess casualty, aviation, personal accident, commercial multi-peril, and professional indemnity and surety. Premiums are the primary source of revenues for these insurers. These companies invest a portion of premiums to meet their commitments to policyholders. The interest rate environment has started to improve. The Fed has already made seven hikes in 2022 with more to come in 2023. An improving rate environment is a boon for insurers, especially long-tail insurers4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Property and Casualty Insurance IndustryImproved pricing to help navigate claims: Catastrophes are a concern for insurers due to the high degree of losses incurred. They implement price hikes to ensure uninterrupted claims payment. Global commercial insurance prices rose for 20 straight quarters though the magnitude has slowed down over the last seven quarters, per Marsh Global Insurance Market Index. Better pricing will help insurers write higher premiums and address claims payment prudently. Per Deloitte Insights, trends like commercial lines witnessing growth at a faster pace than personal lines and homeowners’ premiums improving better than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023. Per Deloitte Insights, gross premiums are estimated to increase sixfold to $722 billion by 2030. China and North America should account for more than two-thirds of the global market, per the report. Catastrophe loss induces volatility in underwriting profits: The property and casualty insurance industry is susceptible to catastrophe events, which drag down underwriting profit. Swiss Re estimated insured losses from natural catastrophes of $35 million for the first half of 2022, while Munich Re estimated losses of $65 billion, with slightly less than half insured. Per a report published in LAW360, AM Best estimated the net income of U.S. property and casualty insurers to decline 17% year over year to $31.4 billion in the first half of 2022. While the third quarter largely suffered the wrath of Hurricane Ian, the fourth quarter faced the wrath of winter storms that impacted much of the United States and Canada in late December. However, exposure growth, better pricing, prudent underwriting and favorable reserve development will help withstand the blow. Also, frequent occurrences of natural disasters should accelerate the policy renewal rate.Merger and acquisitions: Consolidation in the property and casualty industry is likely to continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geography. Buying businesses along the same lines will also continue as players look to gain market share and grow in their niche areas. With the reopening of the economy, optimistic growth outlook and sturdy capital level, the industry is witnessing a number of mergers, acquisitions and consolidations.Increased adoption of technology: The industry is witnessing increased use of technology like blockchain, artificial intelligence, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation that expedite business operations and save cost. The industry has also witnessed the emergence of insurtech — technology-led insurers — creating competition for incumbent players. The focus of insurtech is mainly on the property and casualty insurance industry. Accelerated digitalization has become the need of the hour and insurers continue to invest heavily in technology to improve basis points, scale and efficiencies. As insurtechs use the latest technologies and concepts that the incumbents are just beginning to experiment with, there remains a huge market risk.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak prospects in the near term.

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 1.89%. At the same time, the Dow added 1%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 10%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the engine maker had lost 2.16% over the past month. This has was narrower than the Auto-Tires-Trucks sector's loss of 4.76% and lagged the S&amp;P 500's gain of 2.3% in that time.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Cummins as it approaches its next earnings report date. This is expected to be February 6, 2023. On that day, Cummins is projected to report earnings of $4.88 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 71.23%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $7.36 billion, up 25.81% from the prior-year quarter.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Cummins. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Cummins currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Digging into valuation, Cummins currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 11.48. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 13.56, so we one might conclude that Cummins is trading at a discount comparatively.It is also worth noting that CMI currently has a PEG ratio of 1.26. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate.

As we reflect on 2022, we want to start by taking a moment to recognize the hard work and dedication of our more than 22,000 colleagues, your tireless efforts to support our customers and communities during challenging times are the heartbeat of M&amp;T. We also give a shout out to #3 and the early responders who saved his life, you remind us all about the bigger game of life. A year ago, we outlined three key objectives for 2022: complete our long-awaited merger with People's United; deploy excess liquidity to reduce asset sensitivity while protecting shareholder value; and to distribute capital that isn't required to support lending in our communities. Achieving those objectives, we believe, aligns with our goal to build a customer-focused bank and resultant balance sheet that produces consistent, predictable earnings over long periods of time.Story continuesAgainst those objectives, here are a few key highlights of the work done in 2022. We closed the acquisition of People's United, the largest in our history. We also completed the systems conversion and continue the process of integrating this valuable franchise. The financial benefits of this combination are consistent to slightly better than our expectations at announcement. We repositioned the balance sheet to deploy excess liquidity, reducing our interest-bearing deposits held at banks from $41.9 billion at the end of 2021 to under $25 billion at the end of 2022. In deploying that excess liquidity, we reduced costly wholesale funding. We organically, that is, excluding the impact of People's, grew loans by $4.1 billion and added $7 billion in net investment securities growth.These efforts, which also included the retention of most of the residential mortgage production as well as the acquired People's United $12 billion longer-duration securities portfolio have led to a reduction in asset sensitivity, helping to protect our net interest margin from future rate shocks. In terms of capital, we resumed common share repurchases in last year's second quarter now having repurchased $1.8 billion in common stock, representing 6% of outstanding shares, and our common dividend grew by 7% in 2022 representing the sixth year of consecutive increases. And despite the impact from the acquisition and the rapid rise in long bond yields, our CET1 ratio remained strong at 10.4% which continues to exceed our median peer bank. Our hard work translated into strong full year financial results.GAAP-based diluted earnings per common share, which include merger-related charges, were $11.53 compared to $13.80 in 2021, down 16%. Net income was $1.99 billion compared with $1.86 billion in the prior year, improved by 7%. These results produced returns on average assets and average common equity of 1.05% and 8.67% compared to 1.22% and 11.4%, respectively, in 2021. We note that these results were impacted by merger-related expenses associated with the People's United transaction. Such expenses amounted to $580 million in 2022 or $2.63 per share. Those same expenses were $44 million or $0.25 per share in 2021. In accordance with the SEC's guidelines, this morning's press release contains a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity.Consistent with our long-term practice, M&amp;T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis, from which we have only ever excluded the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions. We believe this information provides investors with a better picture of the long-term earnings power of the combined institution. Net operating income which excludes the after-tax impact from the amortization of intangible assets as well as merger-related expenses was $2.47 billion during 2022, up 30% compared to what was $1.9 billion in the prior year. Net operating income per diluted common share was $14.42 compared with $14.11 in 2021, up 2%. Net operating income for 2022 expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity was 1.35% and 16.7%.This compares with 1.28% and 16.8%, respectively, in the prior year. On a net operating basis, we generated 4% positive operating leverage and 43% growth in pre-tax pre-provision net revenue. This was due in large part to the $2 billion or 53% increase in taxable equivalent net interest income as the net interest margin increased some 63 basis points year-over-year. We are pleased with the results we achieved in 2022 in the face of many challenges, not the least of which was a rapid shift in monetary policy. But our work is not done. We will continue to recognize the value created by our merger while building a more capital-efficient, less asset-sensitive balance sheet that will produce stable and predictable revenue and earnings over the long term.Let's take a look at the results for the fourth quarter. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $4.29 in the fourth quarter of 2022, up 22% compared to $3.53 in the third quarter of 2022. Net income for the quarter was $765 million, 18% higher than the $647 million in the linked quarter. On a GAAP basis, M&amp;T's fourth quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 1.53% and an annualized return on average common equity of 12.59%. This compares with rates of 1.28% and 10.43%, respectively, in the previous quarter. Included in GAAP results were after-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $14 million in each of the two most recent quarters, representing $0.08 per common share in both quarters.Pre-tax merger-related expenses of $45 million related to the People's United acquisition were included in the fourth quarter's GAAP results. These merger charges translate to $33 million after tax or $0.20 per common share. M&amp;T's net operating income for the fourth quarter, which excludes intangible amortization and the merger-related expenses, was $812 million, up 16% from the $700 million in the linked quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $4.57 for the recent quarter compared to $3.83 in 2022's third quarter. Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity of 1.7% and 21.3% in the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.44% and 17.89% in the third quarter of 2022.Both GAAP and net operating earnings for the fourth quarter of '22 were impacted by certain noteworthy items. Fourth quarter results included a $136 million gain related to the sale of M&amp;T Insurance Agency reported in other revenue from operations as well as a $135 million contribution to M&amp;T's Charitable Foundation reported in other costs of operations. These items collectively net and did not materially impact net income. Let's take a deeper dive into the balance sheet and the net interest margin. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.84 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of $150 million or 9% from the linked quarter. The increase was driven largely by the $143 million impact from higher rates on interest-earning assets, inclusive of the effect from interest rate hedges, an incremental $19 million from volume and mix of earning assets, partially offset by a $12 million reduction in interest received on nonaccrual loans.Net interest margin for the past quarter was 4.06%, up 38 basis points from the 3.68% in the linked quarter. The primary driver of the increase to the margin was higher interest rates, which we estimate boosted the margin by 32 basis points. In addition, the margin benefited from a reduced level of cash held on deposit at the Federal Reserve, which we estimate added 6 basis points. Total average loans and leases were $129.4 billion during the fourth quarter of 2022, up 1.5% compared to the linked quarter. Looking at the loans by category. On an average basis compared with the third quarter, commercial and industrial loans and leases increased by $1.7 billion or 4.5% to $40 billion, with $1.2 billion or 4% growth being broad-based across our core commercial banking clients and $542 million or 22% growth in average dealer floor plan balances.During the fourth quarter, average commercial real estate loans decreased by $592 million or 1% to $45.7 billion, driven largely by declines in average construction loans. On an end-of-period basis, construction balances increased slightly from the linked quarter. Permanent average commercial mortgage balances were nearly flat quarter-over-quarter. Residential real estate loans increased $372 million or about 2% to $23.3 billion due to the continued retention of new mortgage originations retained for investments, partially offset by normal amortization. Average consumer loans were up $384 million or about 2% to $20.3 billion. Recreational finance loan growth continues to be the main driver. These average loans grew $325 million or 4%. Average earning assets, excluding interest-bearing cash on deposit at the Federal Reserve increased by $3.2 billion or 2% due to the $1.9 billion growth in average loans and $1.4 billion increase in average investment securities.Average interest-bearing cash balances decreased by $5.7 billion to $25.1 billion during the fourth quarter of this year, essentially in line with our projections. The sequential quarter decline was due to the drop in deposit balances and the cash deployed to fund loan growth and to purchase investment securities. Average deposits decreased $3.8 billion or 2% compared with the third quarter. Our efforts to grow and retain deposits has helped reduce the rate of decline compared to recent quarters. However, due to the rapidly rising rate environment and increased competition for deposits, there has been a mix shift within the deposit base to higher cost deposits. Average demand deposits declined $2.6 billion. Savings and interest-bearing checking deposits declined by $2.3 billion, partially offset by a $1.1 billion increase in time deposits.Average commercial deposits declined $4.8 billion as business owners shifted money into both off and on balance sheet sweep accounts, paid down debt and made distributions. On balance sheet sweep, average balances increased $2.5 billion during the fourth quarter of 2022. Turning to noninterest income. Noninterest income, excluding the $136 million gain from the sale of the M&amp;T Insurance Agency, totaled $546 million in the fourth quarter compared with $563 million in the linked quarter. Trust income was $195 million in the recent quarter, up 4% from the $187 million in the third quarter. The increase was due largely to the impact of better market valuations on assets under management and administration. Service charges on deposit accounts were $106 million compared with $115 million in the third quarter.The decline primarily reflects the waiver of service charges in October and November on acquired customer deposit accounts. These service charges were also waived in September. Mortgage banking revenues were $82 million in the recent quarter, down 2% from the linked quarter. Revenues from our residential mortgage business were $54 million in the fourth quarter compared with $55 million in the prior quarter. Both figures reflect our decision to retain the substantial majority of the mortgage originations for investment on our balance sheet. Commercial mortgage banking revenues were $28 million in both the third and fourth quarters. That figure was $49 million in the year ago quarter. Other revenue from operations, excluding the gain from the sale of the M&amp;T Insurance Agency were $131 million, down $22 million sequentially.The decrease was due to the impact of two fewer months of revenues related to the M&amp;T Insurance Agency, which was sold in October, lower commercial loan fees, reflecting lower capital markets activities and a write-down on the underlying assets in certain bank-owned life insurance contracts. Turning to expenses. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter, which exclude the amortization of intangible assets and merger-related expenses, were $1.35 billion or $138 million higher than the linked quarter. This increase was largely due to the $135 million charitable donation in the fourth quarter. Excluding merger-related expenses, salary and benefits expense decreased by $30 million due to one less business day, the realization of acquisition synergies and the impact of the sale of the M&amp;T Insurance Agency.The quarter included $21 million in higher sequential advertising and outside data processing and software expenses. Both of these categories tend to show some degree of seasonality. The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization and merger-related expenses from the numerator and securities gains or losses from the denominator, was 53.3% in the recent quarter compared with 53.6% in 2022's third quarter and 59.7% in the fourth quarter of last year. Next, let's turn to credit. Despite the challenges of labor shortages and persistent inflation, credit remained stable. The allowance for credit losses amounted to $1.93 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up $50 million from the end of the linked quarter. In the fourth quarter, we recorded a $90 million provision for credit losses compared to the $115 million provision in the third quarter.Net charge-offs were $40 million in the fourth quarter compared to $63 million in last year's third quarter. The reserve build was largely due to growth in our C&amp;I and consumer portfolios. The baseline macroeconomic forecast experienced nominal deterioration during the fourth quarter for those indicators that our reserve methodology is most sensitive to, including the unemployment rate, GDP growth and residential and commercial real estate values. At the end of the fourth quarter, nonaccrual loans were $2.4 billion and represented 1.9% of loans, essentially unchanged from the end of the linked quarter. As noted, net charge-offs for the recent quarter amounted to $40 million. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 12 basis points for the fourth quarter compared to 20 basis points in the third quarter.Photo by Ales Nesetril on UnsplashLoans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest, were $491 million at the end of the recent quarter compared to $477 million sequentially. In total, 74% of these 90 days past due loans were guaranteed by government-related entities. Turning to capital. M&amp;T's common equity Tier 1 ratio was an estimated 10.4% compared with 10.7% at the end of the third quarter. The decrease was due in part to the impact of the repurchase of $600 million in common shares which represented 2% of our outstanding common stock as well as growth in risk-weighted assets. Tangible common equity totaled $14.7 billion, up slightly from the end of the period of the prior quarter. Tangible common equity per share amounted to $86.59, up 3% from the end of the third quarter.Now, turning to the outlook. As we look forward into 2023, we expect that inflation and higher interest rates will continue to impact the bank and our customers. We believe we are well positioned to sustain a strong net interest margin and pre-tax pre-provision net revenue to risk-weighted assets with our goal to generate top quartile return on average tangible common equity. As a reminder, the acquisition of People's United closed on April 1, 2022. Thus, the outlook for 2023 includes four quarters of operations and balances from the acquired company compared to only three quarters during 2022. This 2023 outlook also reflects the sale of M&amp;T Insurance Agency that closed in October of 2022. During the first nine months in 2022, this business recorded revenues of $31 million and the results of its operations were not material to M&amp;T's net income.Additionally, in December, our subsidiary, Wilmington Trust NA announced the sale of its Collective Investment Trust business. Trust income associated with this business totaled $165 million in 2022. And after considering expenses, the results of operations from this business were not material to M&amp;T's net income. Sale of this business is expected to close in the first half of 2023. Since the timing of the closing is uncertain, this outlook includes the full year of the Collective Investment Trust business. First, let's talk about our net interest income outlook. We expect taxable equivalent net interest income to grow in the 23% to 26% range when compared to the $5.86 billion during 2022. This range reflects different rates of deposit balance growth, deposit pricing and loan growth.Consistent with the current forward curve, our forecast incorporates two 25 basis point Fed funds hikes in the first quarter of 2023 and one 25 basis point cut in the fourth quarter. Key driver of net interest income in 2023 will be the ability to efficiently fund earning asset growth. We expect continued intense competition for deposits in the face of industry-wide outflows. Full year average total deposit balances are expected to be down low single digits compared to the $158.5 billion during 2022. In order to offset deposit declines and to ensure a stable liquidity profile, we plan to issue senior debt during 2023. We continue to expect deposit mix to shift toward higher cost deposits with declines expected in demand deposits and growth in time deposits as well as on balance sheet sweeps.This is expected to translate into a through-the-cycle deposit beta in the high 30% to low 40% range. Next, let's discuss the drivers of earning asset growth. We currently plan to grow the securities portfolio by $4 billion compared to the $25 billion balance at the end of 2022 with the addition of longer duration mortgage-backed securities throughout the year. Next, turning to the outlook for average loans. We expect average loan and lease balances during 2023 to grow in the 8% to 9% range when compared to the 2022 full year average of $119.3 billion. This implies total average loan and lease balances in the fourth quarter of 2023 to be flat to slightly up from the $129.4 billion average during the fourth quarter of 2022. Mix of C&amp;I, CRE and consumer loans, inclusive of consumer real estate loans is almost 1/3 each at the end of 2022.We expect this trend to shift slightly as C&amp;I growth outpaces CRE. As we've seen during the second half of 2022, higher levels of interest rates are expected to slow down the growth in our consumer loan book in 2023. Turning to fees. Excluding the $136 million gain on the sale of the M&amp;T Insurance Agency in the fourth quarter of 2022 as well as securities losses, noninterest income was $2.23 billion in 2022. We expect 2023 noninterest income growth to be in the 5% to 7% range compared to 2022. The outlook for 2023 reflects approximately 10 months of foregone income from M&amp;T Insurance Agency as a result of the sale. Overall, mortgage banking revenues are expected to be up 5% to 7% compared to 2022. Commercial mortgage banking revenues are expected to rebound in 2023, and we will return to a gain on sale residential mortgage banking model in 2023.However, with the high level of interest rates, we expect muted origination volumes and thus, anticipate total residential mortgage banking revenues to be relatively stable compared to 2022. We expect service charges on deposit accounts to be 3% to 6% higher than 2022 and anticipate trust income to be 8% to 10% higher in 2023. Turning to expenses. We anticipate expenses, excluding merger-related costs, the charitable contribution and intangible amortization to be up 10% to 12% and when compared to the $4.52 billion we experienced during 2022. Approximately half of this increase reflects an extra quarter of People's United expenses. This outlook also incorporates the impact from the sale of the M&amp;T Insurance Agency. We do not anticipate incurring any material merger-related costs in 2023 and intangible amortization is expected to be in the $60 million to $65 million range during 2023.As a reminder, first quarter expenses will be elevated as a result of our typical seasonal increase in compensation expense. For the first quarter of 2023, we anticipate an uptick in the range of $90 million to $95 million. That amount last year was approximately $74 million. Turning to credit. We expect credit losses to be higher than the strong results in 2022, but to remain below M&amp;T's legacy long-term average of 33 basis points. Provision expense over the year will follow the CECL methodology and will be affected by changes in the macroeconomic outlook as well as changes in loan balances. For 2023, we expect taxable equivalent tax rate to be in the 25% range. Finally, turning to capital. We believe the current level of core capital exceeds that needed to safely run the company and to support lending in our communities.We plan to return excess capital to shareholders at a measured pace. M&amp;T's common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.4% at December 31, 2022 comfortably exceeds the required regulatory minimum threshold which takes into account our stress capital buffer or SCB. With a solid starting CET1 ratio and the potential to generate additional amounts of capital over the next few years, we don't expect to change our capital distribution plans. We anticipate continuing to repurchase common shares at a pace of $600 million per quarter under our current capital plan. Before we go to Q&amp;A, I wanted to take a moment and reflect back on some comments made at the beginning of the call, where we reference #3 and how he is winning the game of life. Sometimes numbers can be simple with deeper meaning than what meets the eye like the divine proportion.I'd like to take a moment and share what I see with some of these numbers. The first game after #3 went to the hospital. Our team returned a kickoff, the first time it has done so in three years and three months. First playoff game was won by 3 points. #14 and 17 are key leaders on our team. The difference between 14 and 17 is 3. That number seems to come up quite often. If you look at those key leaders and you drop the 1 from 14 and the 1 in front of 7, you're left with 4, 7. 47 is an interesting number. I know you're all thinking about the periodic table of elements. 47 is the atomic number of silver. The Vince Lombardi Trophy is made out of silver. That interesting? But it gets even weirder. The symbol for silver is Ag. If you reverse those letters, you get GA which is the abbreviation for Georgia, the potential site of the AFC Championship.And all of this is happening in 2023. There's that number again. Probably just a set of random coincidences or is it? With that, let's open it up to questions.See also 25 Largest Illinois Companies and 25 Countries that Have the Most Debt Per Capita.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

271,5e648399-8e5a-3543-bfff-f0f6162298c5,HP,2023-01-21,Wall Street Analysts Predict a 25.48% Upside in Helmerich & Payne (HP): Here's  What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-predict-25-145502677.html,1674226502,STORY,"['TGT', 'HP']","[Shares of Helmerich &amp; Payne (HP) have gained 0.6% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $46.90, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $58.85 indicates a potential upside of 25.5%.The average comprises 13 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $38 to a high of $77, with a standard deviation of $9.47. While the lowest estimate indicates a decline of 19% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 64.2% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in HP. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseZacks Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for HPHere's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.Story continuesWhile Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Why HP Could Witness a Solid UpsideAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current year, one estimate has moved higher over the last 30 days compared to no negative revision. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 0.4%.Moreover, HP currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means it is in the top 5% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much HP could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

272,d53194af-a8c1-35a0-b411-debda581183b,HP,2023-01-21,Equinor (EQNR) Makes Natural Gas Discovery Offshore Norway,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/equinor-eqnr-makes-natural-gas-142202956.html,1674224522,STORY,"['EQNR.OL', 'EQNR', 'PUMP', 'HP', 'RIG']","[Equinor ASA EQNR and partners made a commercially-viable natural gas discovery in production license 1128 in the Norwegian Sea.This is the first hydrocarbon discovery made on the Norwegian Continental Shelf this year.Drilled by the Deepsea Stavanger drilling rig, exploration wells 6605/1-2 S and A made the gas discovery in the Norwegian Sea. These are the first and second exploration wells in production license 1128, awarded in APA 2020. Equinor operates the license with a 70% interest.The well 6605/1-2 S encountered three sandstone layers in the Springar Formation, with moderate to good reservoir quality. The well 6605/1-2 A proved a 12-meter gas column in the uppermost sandstone layer, with moderate to good reservoir quality. The wells were not formation-tested, but extensive data collection and sampling were performed.The latest discovery, Obelix Upflank, was made 23 kilometers south of the Irpa gas field, which is currently being developed. The latest discovery is estimated to hold 12.6-69.2 million barrels of oil equivalent or 2-11 billion standard cubic meters of recoverable gas.Equinor and partners will evaluate further delineation of the discovery and tie-in to the Irpa field. Discoveries near existing infrastructure require less volume to be commercially developed and can be brought online with low emissions. Equinor, with its partners, will consider tying back the latest discovery to Irpa. The companies have submitted a plan for development and operation for the tie-in to the Irpa field.Norway is currently the largest single gas supplier to Europe after Russia flows were significantly reduced, with Norwegian deliveries meeting about 25% of Europe’s demand.

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of 71 cents per share on revenues of $1.2 billion.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the provider of hydraulic fracturing and other auxiliary services to onshore exploration and production companies in North America in the December quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at LBRT’s previous-quarter performance first.Highlights of Q3 Earnings &amp; Surprise HistoryIn the last-reported quarter, the Denver, CO-based oilfield service company beat the consensus mark due to the impact of strong execution, higher activity and increased service pricing, LBRT had reported earnings per share of 78 cents, 15 cents higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues of $1.2 billion generated by the firm also came in above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1 billion.LBRT beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, which resulted in an earnings surprise of 58.5%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below:Liberty Energy Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseLiberty Energy Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseLiberty Energy Inc. price-eps-surprise | Liberty Energy Inc. QuoteTrend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter bottom line has remained unchanged in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 336.7% jump year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues, meanwhile, suggests a 74.7% increase from the year-ago period.Factors to ConsiderDespite growing risk in financial markets due to the aggressive monetary tightening by central banks and the fallout from China’s zero-COVID lockdown policy, Liberty management believes that the energy market remains tight. On top of this, the OPEC+ supply cut, sanctions on Russian oil and limited availability of spare production capacity are likely to further strengthen the demand for North American energy.This means that upstream operators are drilling more wells to increase output that has remained depressed over the past two years due to the lack of investment, supply-chain issues, scarcity of labor and equipment attrition. With crude demand set to remain robust and eventually surpass the pre-COVID record, most of the domestic fracking capacity is on the verge of being exhausted. In this context, Liberty management sees elevated demand for its next-generation fleet that supports clients’ requirements for quality and reliability. Notwithstanding holiday and seasonal weather, the company sees fourth-quarter results in line with the strong third quarter.On a somewhat bearish note, the increase in LBRT’s costs might have dented the company’s to-be-reported bottom line. The company’s third-quarter total operating expenses totaled $1 billion, up 59.4% from the year-ago period. The upward cost trajectory is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter due to the prevailing inflationary environment.Story continuesWhat Does Our Model Say?The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that LBRT is likely to beat estimates in the fourth quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates.

However, in fourth-quarter 2022, the S&amp;P 400 Index witnessed an impressive rally with a gain of 10.3%.This happened despite the fact that the inflation was stuck at its 40-year high level due to the pandemic-led destruction of the global supply-chain system and strong demand from U.S. citizens due to unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimuli in the pandemic-ridden years.Story continuesMoreover, aggressive interest rate hikes by major central banks led by the Fed, lockdown in China due to the resurgence of COVID-19 infections and the geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine rattled the global financial world last quarter.Our Top PicksFive mid-cap (market capital &gt; $1 billion &lt; $10 billion) companies are set to beat earnings estimates this reporting cycle.

NDAQ is slated to report fourth-quarter 2022 earnings on Jan 25, before the opening bell. The company delivered an earnings surprise in each of the last four quarters, the average being 5.88%.Factors to ConsiderSolid organic revenue growth, strong performance at index and analytics businesses and contributions from the acquisition of Verafin are likely to have aided Nasdaq’s fourth-quarter performance.Improved performance at Market Technology, Market Data and Analytics businesses is expected to have benefited non-trading revenues.We expect Analytics revenues to increase 5.9% to $58.2 million, while market data revenues are expected to increase 2.4% to $106.5 millionImproved anti-financial crime technology revenues owing to the inclusion of revenues from the acquisition of Verafin, new sales and strong retention, higher SaaS revenues as well as organic revenue growth are likely to have aided Market Technology revenues. We expect Market Technology revenues to be $130.7 million in the fourth quarter.Market Services segment revenues are likely to have been driven by better performance at Equity Derivatives Trading and Clearing and Trade Management Services. We expect Market Services segment revenues to be $306.4 million.Expenses are likely to have increased owing to the development and diversification of its business, compensation and benefits, merger and strategic initiatives, restructuring charges, general, administrative and other expenses. These are expected to have weighed on margin expansion.Nasdaq expects 2022 non-GAAP operating expenses in the range of $1.70 billion to $1.72 billion. We expect the metric to increase 5.5% to $1.7 billion.The continued share buyback is anticipated to have provided an additional boost to the bottom line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 66 cents, indicating a 3.1% increase from the prior-year reported figure.

277,1d6d6be8-7186-3964-89be-56c201886bbf,CL,2023-01-21,Colgate-Palmolive (CL) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: What to Know Ahead of Q4 Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/colgate-palmolive-cl-expected-beat-150003086.html,1674226803,STORY,['CL'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Colgate-Palmolive (CL) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis consumer products maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.76 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -3.8%.Revenues are expected to be $4.55 billion, up 3.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.14% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Colgate-Palmolive?For Colgate-Palmolive, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.13%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Colgate-Palmolive will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings.

279,e559dd04-9d0c-3af5-b0f2-1b28d28dac92,CMCSA,2023-01-21,Earnings Preview: Charter Communications (CHTR) Q4 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-charter-communications-chtr-150003189.html,1674226803,STORY,"['CHTR', 'CMCSA']","[Charter Communications (CHTR) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis cable provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $8.03 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -10.1%.Revenues are expected to be $13.7 billion, up 3.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.54% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Charter?For Charter, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.11%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Charter will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Charter would post earnings of $7.94 per share when it actually produced earnings of $7.38, delivering a surprise of -7.05%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Charter doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Cable Television industry, Comcast (CMCSA) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.78 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +1.3%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $30.42 billion, up 0.3% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Comcast has been revised 1.7% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -4.52%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Comcast will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

URI is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2022 results on Jan 25, after market close.In the last-reported quarter, United Rentals’ adjusted earnings topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3%, but revenues missed the same by 1.2%, respectively. This largest equipment rental company’s third-quarter adjusted earnings and revenues grew 40.9% and 17.5% year over year, respectively.Markedly, its earnings surpassed expectations in 33 out of the last 37 quarters. The company’s revenues topped the consensus mark in 20 out of the trailing 22 quarters.Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings has increased to $10.04 from $10.02 per share over the past 30 days. The estimated figure indicates 35.9% growth from the year-ago earnings of $7.39 per share. The consensus mark for revenues is $3.29 billion, suggesting an 18.6% year-over-year improvement.Factors to NoteHigher pricing and improved activity level, backed by stronger demand in each of the end markets served in North America (industrial and other non-construction and commercial construction), are expected to aid United Rentals’ fourth-quarter results. Notably, federally funded infrastructure projects, industrial manufacturing, energy and power activities are expected to aid the company’s quarterly results. Furthermore, acquisitions are expected to have helped United Rentals to boost the top line in the quarter to be reported.The company’s quarterly results are expected to benefit from solid mega-project activity. URI’s solid exposure to blue-chip engineering &amp; construction accounts and industry-leading market share are expected to reflect its quarterly performance.The company’s investment in the General Rental segment (wherein the primary growth drivers are non-residential construction and plant maintenance) also bodes well. Overall, industrial markets are expected to have aided the company’s performance.Equipment Rentals revenues (accounting for more than 75% of its total revenues) are expected to have registered growth in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Equipment Rentals revenues is $2,762 million, which suggests an increase from the year-ago reported figure of $2,312 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Rental Equipment revenues is $332 million, which suggests an increase of 2.5% from the year-ago reported figure.The consensus estimate for New Equipment sales suggests a decrease of 6.7% year over year. The consensus mark for Contractor supplies sales indicates 15.4% growth from the prior year. The consensus mark for Service and other revenues suggests 21.3% growth on a year-over-year basis.From the margin perspective, supply-chain disruptions and higher inflation might be causes of concern.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model predicts a likely earnings beat for United Rentals for the quarter to be reported.

Shares have added about 14% in that time frame, outperforming the S&amp;P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Micron due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Micron Q1 Earnings &amp; Revenues Miss Expectations, Fall Y/YMicron kicked off fiscal 2023 on a very disappointing note as the company’s fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenues declined on a year-over-year basis.Micron reported a non-GAAP loss of 4 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 2 cents.  The bottom line compared unfavorably with the prior-year quarter’s earnings of $2.16 per share.Quarterly revenues of Micron plunged 46.8% year over year to $4.09 billion, which missed the consensus mark of $4.08 billion. The company cited rapidly weakening consumer demand and substantial customer inventory adjustments across end markets amid macroeconomic uncertainty as the reasons behind the dismal quarterly performance.Q1 Top-Line DetailsDynamic random access memory revenues of $2.83 billion, accounting for 69% of the total revenues in the fiscal first quarter, declined 49% year over year and 41% sequentially. Bit shipments decreased approximately in the mid-20 percentage sequentially while average selling price (ASP) plunged in the low-20 percentage on a quarter-over-quarter basis.NAND revenues of $1.10 billion, representing 27% of the total top line, were down 41% on a year-over-year basis and 35% quarter over quarter.

QSR is likely to benefit from expansion efforts, strategic investments and the loyalty program. Also, the emphasis on boosting advertising fund contributions from participating franchisees bodes well.

During the third quarter of 2022, the company opened four locations in India and registered growth in the Middle East, Philippines, Mexico and Monterrey. It also opened restaurants in Houston and Texas. Also, it stated progress with new partnership and development deals across international markets for Popeyes.

Restaurant Brands stated that following a rapid ramp-up phase, nearly half of the customers pay through Tim's Rewards. During the second quarter of 2022, the company’s in-store loyalty sales increased double digits year over year. It reported heightened guest engagement backed by integrated marketing campaigns.

288,95d0d453-d274-3e67-884b-f0ffc713c638,PLD,2023-01-21,"Industry Analysts Just Upgraded Their Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) Revenue Forecasts By 13%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/industry-analysts-just-upgraded-prologis-120458001.html,1674302698,STORY,['PLD'],"[Shareholders in Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) may be thrilled to learn that the analysts have just delivered a major upgrade to their near-term forecasts. The revenue forecast for this year has experienced a facelift, with analysts now much more optimistic on its sales pipeline.After the upgrade, the nine analysts covering Prologis are now predicting revenues of US$7.0b in 2023. If met, this would reflect a notable 18% improvement in sales compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are supposed to descend 13% to US$3.17 in the same period. Previously, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$6.2b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$3.05 in 2023. The forecasts seem more optimistic now, with a nice gain to revenue and a small increase to earnings per share estimates. See our latest analysis for Prologis earnings-and-revenue-growthDespite these upgrades, the analysts have not made any major changes to their price target of US$138, suggesting that the higher estimates are not likely to have a long term impact on what the stock is worth. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. The most optimistic Prologis analyst has a price target of US$193 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$117. This shows there is still some diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation.One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. The period to the end of 2023 brings more of the same, according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 18% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 16% annual growth over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to see their revenues grow 6.4% per year. So although Prologis is expected to maintain its revenue growth rate, it's definitely expected to grow faster than the wider industry.Story continuesThe Bottom LineThe biggest takeaway for us from these new estimates is that analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, with improved earnings power expected for this year. Fortunately, analysts also upgraded their revenue estimates, and our data indicates sales are expected to perform better than the wider market. Given that analysts appear to be expecting substantial improvement in the sales pipeline, now could be the right time to take another look at Prologis.Analysts are definitely bullish on Prologis, but no company is perfect. Indeed, you should know that there are several potential concerns to be aware of, including dilutive stock issuance over the past year.

Considering the low cost of production in both assets, it will continue to generate handsome returns.

The recent estimate revision trend for 2023 funds from operations (FFO) per share indicates an unfavorable outlook.However, Prologis’ fourth-quarter 2022 results reflected healthy leasing activity with solid rent growth. Given its capacity to offer high-quality facilities in key markets, the firm is poised to capitalize on the favorable industrial real estate industry trends.Along with the fast adoption of e-commerce, this asset category is set to gain from a likely rise in inventory levels.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 17 cents per share, which suggests a decline of 93% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Management anticipates second-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues of $1.85 billion (+/- 150 million) while non-GAAP EPS for the fiscal second quarter is expected to be 15 cents per share (+/- 20 cents per share).Seagate Technology Holdings PLC Price and EPS SurpriseSeagate Technology Holdings PLC Price and EPS SurpriseSeagate Technology Holdings PLC price-eps-surprise | Seagate Technology Holdings PLC QuoteThe company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters while surpassing the same in the remaining quarter.

In the past year, shares of the company have lost 39% of their value compared with the sub-industry’s decline of 35.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Factors Setting the Tone for Q2Seagate’s performance is likely to have been affected by global macroeconomic weakness, rising interest rates, geopolitical turmoil and surging inflation. The supply-chain issues (although started to ease somewhat) and component shortages continue to remain headwinds along with customer inventory corrections.  Enterprise, and video and image applications market is also bearing the brunt of prevailing macroeconomic challenges.Cautious spending patterns amid macroeconomic weakness by customers, including global enterprise OEMs and certain domestic cloud clients, are likely to affect the demand for mass capacity solutions in near term.STX is focused on cutting costs to better align with changing market conditions and support its long-term business strategy. In the last reported quarter, the company had announced a restructuring plan to reduce the global workforce by 8% or approximately 3,000 employees, along with other cost-saving initiatives.This plan is expected to complete by the end of fiscal second-quarter 2023 and result in pre-tax charges (cash-based employee severance and other one-time termination payments) between $60 million and $70 million.Moreover, declining trends witnessed in PC shipments in fourth-quarter calendar-year 2022 are likely to have negatively impacted HDD sales resulting in affecting the company’s performance in the quarter under review.Cloud data center demand is likely to have cushioned demand for Seagate’s mass storage capacity solutions, especially its 20-terabyte drives.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Seagate this time around.

294,bfa6ed97-6825-3ac1-bc84-296004736a95,AXP,2023-01-21,American Express (AXP) Q4 Earnings Preview: What's in the Cards?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-express-axp-q4-earnings-150003503.html,1674226803,STORY,"['AXP', 'AX']","[Wall Street expects flat earnings compared to the year-ago quarter on higher revenues when American Express (AXP) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis credit card issuer and global payments company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.18 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter.Revenues are expected to be $14.25 billion, up 17.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.93% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for American Express?For American Express, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.28%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that American Express will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that American Express would post earnings of $2.42 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.47, delivering a surprise of +2.07%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.American Express doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry, Axos Financial (AX), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.24 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +19.2%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $216.37 million, up 22.7% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Axos Financial has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.16%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggests that Axos Financial will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.88 billion, indicating growth of 16.8% from the prior-year reported figure.The bottom line of the largest rural lifestyle retailer in the United States is expected to have increased year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share for the fourth quarter has been unchanged at $2.35 in the past 30 days. The figure suggests growth of 21.8% from the year-ago period.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2022 revenues is pegged at $14.08 billion, suggesting 10.6% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. For 2022 earnings, the consensus mark is pegged at $9.62, suggesting growth of 11.7% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.

In the last reported quarter, this Brentwood, TN-based company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.5%.Tractor Supply Company Price and EPS Surprise Tractor Supply Company Price and EPS SurpriseTractor Supply Company price-eps-surprise | Tractor Supply Company QuoteKey Factors to NoteTractor Supply has been benefiting from its robust e-commerce business, strong demand and growth endeavors. Strength in the Life Out Here Strategy and healthy demand for its product categories have been aiding its top and bottom lines for the past few quarters. Continued sturdy demand for everyday merchandise, including consumable, usable and edible products, as well as strength in seasonal categories, is likely to have boosted the company’s performance in the fourth quarter.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management expected the recent acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home to contribute $75 million to sales in the fourth quarter and 2022. Consequently, it estimated net sales of $14.06-$14.12 billion for 2023.We expect 2022 net sales of 14,058.7 million, suggesting a year-over-year increase of 10.4%. Our estimate indicates comp growth of 5.6% for 2022, which is in sync with the company’s forecast of 5.4-5.8% growth.The company’s estimate for 2022 operating margin is anticipated to be 10.1-10.15%, while we expect an operating margin of 10.1%. Our model suggests 7.7% growth in net income for 2022 to $1,074 million, which is in line with the company’s estimate of net income of $1.07-$1.08.Earnings per share are likely to be $9.55-$9.63. The view also includes gains from the 53rd week in 2022, which is expected to contribute 1.5 percentage points to the top line and 15 cents to the bottom line. We expect earnings per share of $9.59 for 2022.Given the changing consumer trends, the company has been focused on integrating its physical and digital operations to offer consumers a seamless shopping experience. It has been on track with the ‘ONETractor’ strategy to connect store and online shopping. TSCO’s omni-channel investments include curbside pickup, same-day and next-day delivery, a re-launched website, and the new mobile app. Gains from these efforts are expected to have led to strong e-commerce growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The company is also expected to have benefited from the progress on its “Life Out Here” strategy and everyday low pricing. Its Neighbor's Club loyalty program has also been boosting sales. Tractor Supply has been on track with the Project Fusion remodels and Side Lot transformation to remain nationally strong and locally relevant by bringing the latest merchandising strategies to life. These have been significant investments toward stores and are expected to have boosted productivity across the existing and new stores.However, TSCO has been witnessing rising inflationary and supply-chain issues. Higher product cost inflation and transportation costs have been hurting Tractor Supply’s gross margin for a while. Elevated costs, stemming from increased wage rates, have been acting as deterrents. The company has been witnessing increased investments in the Life Out Here strategic efforts. These costs are likely to have marred its performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Tractor Supply this time around.

MDLZ has been benefiting from the strength of its snacks business. At the launch of its fourth annual State of Snacking report, the company highlighted that consumers continue to put snacking as a priority, even amid inflated costs and economic headwinds.A survey of the attitude and behavior of consumers in 12 countries reveals an increased preference for snacking, which is replacing traditional meals at an increasing rate. Given these trends, Mondelez looks well-placed with its efforts to solidify its snacking category.Mondelez Focuses on SnackingMondelez has always been keen on expanding its business through acquisitions and alliances. The company has been expanding its snacking category in particular.As consumers prefer snacking over traditional meals, the company’s core categories — chocolates and biscuits — have historically depicted resilience to economic downturns and pricing actions. Consumers in developed countries consider chocolates and biscuits as affordable indulgences and one of the most-valued snacking products.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn its third-quarter earnings release, MDLZ noted that it closed the Ricolino buyout, which is expected to double the size of its Mexico business. In August 2022, it closed the buyout of Clif Bar. Management announced incremental investments in the Cocoa Life program and expanded its target to source all cocoa volumes from Cocoa Life by 2030.Mondelez concluded the integration of the Chipita S.A. business, which was acquired in January 2022 and is a major producer of sweet and salty snacks in Central and Eastern Europe. Contributions from this acquisition boosted net revenues in the third quarter of 2022.In 2021, Mondelez took over a renowned sports performance and active nutrition brand — Grenade. Further, the company acquired the Australia-based food company — Gourmet Food Holdings — which operates in the premium biscuit and cracker category.Mondelez completed the acquisition of Hu Master Holdings, the parent company of Hu Products on Jan 4, 2021. Earlier, the company acquired a majority interest in Give &amp; Go (in April 2020), which is a pioneer in fully finished sweet baked goods.The company’s focus on undertaking acquisitions to gain scale in its categories and distribution capabilities bodes well. Mondelez is committed to increasing its focus on areas with higher growth potential. The company divested its beverage assets in 2021 and used the net proceeds as investments in its brands and growth drivers.Story continuesWrapping UpA focus on areas with greater demand, such as snacking, is likely to continue working well for Mondelez.

The company has been benefiting from the recovery in consumer demand across markets and market share gains. DEO is anticipated to have retained the strength in its business on constant premiumization efforts and favorable industry trends, particularly in the spirits category. However, Diageo has been suffering from persistent inflationary pressures, induced by higher commodity costs, particularly agave, energy expenses and supply disruptions.Notably, the alcoholic beverage company, which reports on a half-yearly basis, posted strong top-line growth, gross margin expansion and productivity savings in fiscal 2022. Effective marketing and exceptional commercial execution further aided the results.We expect the company’s first-half fiscal 2023 total revenues to increase 21.4% year over year in local currency and the bottom line in U.S. dollars to increase 27.4% to $8.05 per share.Diageo plc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Diageo plc Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseDiageo plc price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Diageo plc QuoteKey Factors to NoteStrong consumer demand in the off-trade channel and recovery of the on-trade channel in key markets are likely to have aided Diageo’s top and bottom lines in the first half of fiscal 2022. Recovery in the on-trade channel in North America and Europe, and the partial recovery in Travel Retail have been aiding the price/mix for a while. The robust performance of its super-premium-plus brands, particularly scotch, tequila and Chinese white spirits, is expected to have led to a continued positive mix for Diageo in the first half.Diageo has been well-poised for growth from effective marketing and exceptional commercial execution. It has been investing strongly in marketing and innovation, and leveraging its revenue growth management capabilities, including strategic pricing actions. This is likely to support DEO’s top and bottom-line growth in the to-be-reported period’s results.Moreover, DEO’s margin trends have been favorable, owing to its premiumization efforts, rebound in markets, pricing actions and supply productivity savings, which have been offsetting the cost inflation. Productivity savings, driven by COGS productivity and marketing effectiveness, are expected to aid margin in the first half of fiscal 2023.Although Diageo expects the operating environment to be challenging in fiscal 2023, it remains confident about its business resilience and ability to navigate the headwinds. In the fiscal 2022 earnings call, the company anticipated market growth across North America, Europe and the Asia Pacific in fiscal 2023 to aid the top line. This is likely to get reflected in the first-half performance. It anticipates continued organic operating margin growth for fiscal 2023, aided by strong premiumization trends and operating leverage despite constant.However, the company has been witnessing inflationary pressures, induced by higher commodity costs, particularly agave, energy expenses and supply disruptions. As a substantial portion of Diageo’s business comes from international operations, exchange rate fluctuations have been hampering its sales for a while.While the weakening of sterling against the U.S. dollar and some impacts of emerging market currencies look favorable, Diageo expects adverse currency impacts from hyperinflationary economies, primarily Turkey.Story continuesLooking for Lucrative Picks?

BSX’s bottom line beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in one. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 1.85%, on average.Factors at PlayBoston Scientific expects fourth-quarter 2022 operational revenue growth in the range of 8.5% to 10.5% year over year. This excludes an approximate 650-basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on rates during the Q3 earnings release. Excluding a 150-basis point contribution from the acquisition of Baylis, the company expects fourth-quarter 2022 organic revenue growth to be in the range of 7% to 9%.Meanwhile, BSX’s top line is likely to have improved year over year, with non-COVID elective medical procedures running in a full-fledged way in the United States and elsewhere across the globe. Given the improving scenario along with an innovative pipeline, expansion into faster growth markets, globalization efforts and enhanced digital capabilities, Boston Scientific is well-positioned to register decent fourth-quarter 2022 results.However, the rate of growth is expected to have remained sluggish, thanks to the back-to-back attack of infectious diseases worldwide, which resulted in significant staffing shortages and supply disruption through the months of the fourth quarter. Further, given the ongoing inflationary situation, the business is expected to have faced the hurdle of surging labor and raw material cost, which might have weighed on BSX’s bottom line in Q4.Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseBoston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseBoston Scientific Corporation price-eps-surprise | Boston Scientific Corporation QuoteOn a geographic basis, despite all macroeconomic headwinds, in the last reported quarter, the company registered double-digit and faster growth in nearly every business than the peer group growth. With macroeconomic factors being more or less the same, this trend is expected to have been repeated in the Q4 months for BSX.Story continuesThe company is expected to have registered strong growth in EMEA within structural heart, including TAVR, WATCHMAN, and other interventional cardiology therapies, as well as electrophysiology divisions, fueled by new product rollouts, including ACURATE neo2 TAVR. In the Asia Pacific — particularly in Japan and Australia — product launches are expected to have contributed to the company’s top line. However, given the COVID wave and related restrictions in China,  the underlying procedural volumes have been impacted in the fourth quarter.In the newly-formed WATCHMAN subsegment within the Cardiovascular division, according to the company, WATCHMAN is on track to deliver full-year double-digit growth with sustained momentum from the second-generation WATCHMAN FLX, ongoing clinical evidence, globalization and commercial execution. In terms of innovation, recently, Boston Scientific launched Trusteer, its new steerable sheath and also highlighted the next-generation FLX device, WATCHMAN FLX PRO, at the TCT investor event. These developments are expected to have enhanced WATCHMAN sales in Q4.The Interventional Cardiology business is expected to have registered year-over-year growth in Structural Heart Valves and Complex PCI and Imaging franchises. In the United States, Q4 performance is likely to have been driven by the coronary therapies franchise, which performed well in the third quarter, driven by strong performance with the company’s differentiated imaging franchise. Internationally, strong growth is expected to have continued, backed by strong performance in Europe with the ACURATE neo2 TAVR platform.Within the Peripheral Interventions business, fourth-quarter sales are expected to have been strong, banking on the strong performance of the drug-eluting franchise, supported by ongoing clinical evidence and the company’s category leadership portfolio. The recentFDA approval for a line extension of ELUVIA and the launch of the longest drug-eluting stent for peripheral arterial disease in the United States are expected to have contributed to the Q4 top line.Interventional Oncologyis expected to have gained from strong momentum in the company’s advanced cancer therapies, TheraSphere and ICEfx, as well as the robust set of embolization access and delivery tools.Within Urology/ Pelvic Health, sales of Stone, Prostate Health and Pelvic Health franchises are expected to have recorded strong growth, banking on ongoing product launches such as LithoVue and SpaceOAR in key countries. The growth momentum is expected to have continued with the recent approvals and commercial launches of SpaceOAR in Korea and Mexico and Rezum in Japan.Within Endoscopy, broad-based recovery across regions and growing strength in infection prevention are expected to have driven fourth-quarter revenues. The company is expected to report strong momentum in biliary hemostasis and single-use imaging franchise.Within Neuromodulation, the company is likely to have registered balanced procedure recovery across RF (radiofrequency), Vertiflex and Spinal Cord Stimulation on strong execution of category leadership strategy in pain. The U.S. launches of WaveWriter Alpha and Vercise Genusare are expected to have boosted the top line.Q4 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter total revenues is pegged at $3.24 billion, suggesting an improvement of 3.5% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. Our model estimates 3.1% growth in Q4 revenues on a year-over-year basis.The consensus mark for adjusted earnings stands at 47 cents per share, implying a 4.4% rise from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Per the Zacks model, adjusted earnings growth is expected to be 2.1% year over year.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsPer our proven model, a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates.

However, the numbers came below NRF's projection of 6% to 8% increase over the 2021 period to between $942.6 billion and $960.4 billion.Nonetheless, stimulus savings from last year, steady wage gains and a lower unemployment rate still kept demand alive.

Increased operating costs are also limiting bottom-line growth. Costs are likely to have been steep in fourth-quarter 2022 at GLOP due to supply-chain troubles.The spike in fuel costs is also flaring up the operating expenses of the industry players.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for GasLog this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.

After declining 5.7% over the past four weeks, the stock looks well positioned for a trend reversal as it is now in oversold territory and there is strong agreement among Wall Street analysts that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier.Here is How to Spot Oversold StocksWe use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.Here's Why KO Could Experience a TurnaroundThe RSI reading of 27.77 for KO is an indication that the heavy selling could be in the process of exhausting itself, so the stock could bounce back in a quest for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.The RSI value is not the only factor that indicates a potential turnaround for the stock in the near term. On the fundamental side, there has been strong agreement among the sell-side analysts covering the stock in raising earnings estimates for the current year. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for KO has increased 0.8%. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Story continuesMoreover, KO currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises.

316,06a0623a-1575-38fc-a770-6fd28597d5f2,KO,2023-01-21,Here's How Diageo (DEO) is Placed Ahead of 1H23 Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-diageo-deo-placed-ahead-140202544.html,1674223322,STORY,"['DGE.L', 'DEO', 'MDLZ', 'KO', 'ADM']","[Diageo Plc DEO is scheduled to release interim results for the first half of fiscal 2023 on Jan 26. The company has been benefiting from the recovery in consumer demand across markets and market share gains. DEO is anticipated to have retained the strength in its business on constant premiumization efforts and favorable industry trends, particularly in the spirits category. However, Diageo has been suffering from persistent inflationary pressures, induced by higher commodity costs, particularly agave, energy expenses and supply disruptions.Notably, the alcoholic beverage company, which reports on a half-yearly basis, posted strong top-line growth, gross margin expansion and productivity savings in fiscal 2022. Effective marketing and exceptional commercial execution further aided the results.We expect the company’s first-half fiscal 2023 total revenues to increase 21.4% year over year in local currency and the bottom line in U.S. dollars to increase 27.4% to $8.05 per share.Diageo plc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Diageo plc Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseDiageo plc price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Diageo plc QuoteKey Factors to NoteStrong consumer demand in the off-trade channel and recovery of the on-trade channel in key markets are likely to have aided Diageo’s top and bottom lines in the first half of fiscal 2022. Recovery in the on-trade channel in North America and Europe, and the partial recovery in Travel Retail have been aiding the price/mix for a while. The robust performance of its super-premium-plus brands, particularly scotch, tequila and Chinese white spirits, is expected to have led to a continued positive mix for Diageo in the first half.Diageo has been well-poised for growth from effective marketing and exceptional commercial execution. It has been investing strongly in marketing and innovation, and leveraging its revenue growth management capabilities, including strategic pricing actions. This is likely to support DEO’s top and bottom-line growth in the to-be-reported period’s results.Moreover, DEO’s margin trends have been favorable, owing to its premiumization efforts, rebound in markets, pricing actions and supply productivity savings, which have been offsetting the cost inflation. Productivity savings, driven by COGS productivity and marketing effectiveness, are expected to aid margin in the first half of fiscal 2023.Although Diageo expects the operating environment to be challenging in fiscal 2023, it remains confident about its business resilience and ability to navigate the headwinds. In the fiscal 2022 earnings call, the company anticipated market growth across North America, Europe and the Asia Pacific in fiscal 2023 to aid the top line. This is likely to get reflected in the first-half performance. It anticipates continued organic operating margin growth for fiscal 2023, aided by strong premiumization trends and operating leverage despite constant.However, the company has been witnessing inflationary pressures, induced by higher commodity costs, particularly agave, energy expenses and supply disruptions. As a substantial portion of Diageo’s business comes from international operations, exchange rate fluctuations have been hampering its sales for a while.While the weakening of sterling against the U.S. dollar and some impacts of emerging market currencies look favorable, Diageo expects adverse currency impacts from hyperinflationary economies, primarily Turkey.Story continuesLooking for Lucrative Picks?

319,fbc6eda5-9cdf-398c-8f56-c7a47ea0cf14,WM,2023-01-21,Waste Management (NYSE:WM) Seems To Use Debt Quite Sensibly,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/waste-management-nyse-wm-seems-110048959.html,1674298848,STORY,['WM'],"[Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We can see that Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) does use debt in its business. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.When Is Debt A Problem?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Waste Management What Is Waste Management's Debt?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at September 2022 Waste Management had debt of US$13.4b, up from US$12.5b in one year. And it doesn't have much cash, so its net debt is about the same.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is Waste Management's Balance Sheet?According to the last reported balance sheet, Waste Management had liabilities of US$3.83b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$19.0b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$137.0m as well as receivables valued at US$2.68b due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$20.0b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.This deficit isn't so bad because Waste Management is worth a massive US$62.4b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution.Story continuesIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.With a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.5, Waste Management uses debt artfully but responsibly. And the fact that its trailing twelve months of EBIT was 9.5 times its interest expenses harmonizes with that theme. One way Waste Management could vanquish its debt would be if it stops borrowing more but continues to grow EBIT at around 11%, as it did over the last year. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Waste Management can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Waste Management produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 75% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.Our ViewHappily, Waste Management's impressive conversion of EBIT to free cash flow implies it has the upper hand on its debt. But, on a more sombre note, we are a little concerned by its net debt to EBITDA. Looking at all the aforementioned factors together, it strikes us that Waste Management can handle its debt fairly comfortably. Of course, while this leverage can enhance returns on equity, it does bring more risk, so it's worth keeping an eye on this one. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it.

320,b39b274c-92c1-3521-8702-e7f8f5935f8a,WM,2023-01-21,7 Stocks That Will Make You Rich in 10 Years,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-rich-10-years-172117049.html,1673976077,STORY,"['RIO', 'EPSN', 'WM']","[Although it might seem like the Federal Reserve took all the upside potential away from risk-on assets, forward-looking investors can still bank on stocks that will make you rich in 10 years. Admittedly, it’s not the most favorable cycle right now. With the central bank still trying to reel in a record expansion of the M2 money stock, we may be in for an extended winter.Nevertheless, it’s hardly the end for stocks that will make you rich in 10 years. Although the Fed commands incredible power, monetary policy has its limits. Remember that while policymakers aggressively raised rates throughout 2022, energy prices largely skyrocketed. Put another way, interest rates couldn’t completely disrupt supply demand dynamics for critical resources.And that’s why speculative opportunities still exist. At least a few compelling enterprises feature underlying narratives that should perform very well in the decade ahead. So, strap in and consider these stocks that will make you rich in 10 years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWMWaste Management$154.90RIORio Tinto$76.03SBSWSibanye Stillwater$11.72EPSNEpsilon Energy$6.28SMRNuScale Power$10.66OPTTOcean Power$0.71CBULFGratomic$0.21Waste Management (WM)person depositing a plastic water bottle in a yellow plastic recycling bin. The bin is in a line-up of several other blue and green bins.Source: shutterstock.com/PhotoByToRGranted, when you think about the topic of stocks that will make you rich in 10 years, Waste Management (NYSE:WM) doesn’t immediately come to mind. As a blue-chip enterprise, WM’s investment narrative appears mature. I mean, the company pays a dividend for crying out loud! We’re going to get into the wild opportunities, don’t you worry. But do give WM a chance.As the brand suggests, Waste Management oversees our waste products. For decades, Americans didn’t really think too much about it. They figured that once the trash goes into the waste-disposal truck, it magically disappears; basically, out of sight, out of mind. However, countries that previously imported waste like China are putting an end to the practice. In terms of relevance, WM seemingly has nowhere to go but up.Story continuesTo avoid alarmist arguments, experts in the field state that we’re not at risk of running out of landfill space. However, we still need to do something with our waste. We’re talking about real objects that take up real space and impose a real impact on the environment. Thus, because of sheer necessity, WM may be one of the stocks that will make you rich in 10 years.Rio Tinto (RIO)Production of copper wire, bronze cable in reels at factory.Source: Parilov / Shutterstock.comAnother major enterprise, metals and mining firm Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) may still rank among the stocks that will make you rich in 10 years. Yes, it’s a mature business. Plus, it’s not entirely focused on growth, as evidenced by the company’s dividend yield of 8.81%. Nevertheless, Rio mines and produces some of the world’s most valuable resources, including copper.Because of its distinct properties, various industries integrate copper across several applications. However, the metal represents an essential material for electric vehicles. According to the Copper Development Association, copper “…is used in the electric motors, batteries, inverters, wiring and in charging stations because of its durability, malleability, reliability and superior electrical conductivity.”Of course, the global EV rollout symbolizes one of the greatest investment narratives. However, it’s doubtful because of consolidation pressures that all EV brands will make it. However, copper will always be relevant. Therefore, Rio Tinto makes for one of the stocks that will make you rich in 10 years.Sibanye Stillwater (SBSW)a construction worker looks on as an excavator gets to work in a mineSource: ShutterstockSmart diversification is always important in the investing world and for those that want to hedge exposure to Rio Tinto above, Sibanye Stillwater (NYSE:SBSW) presents an intriguing idea. While seemingly everyone states that EVs represent the future of mobility, it’s not a guaranteed outcome. For instance, if Californian grids can’t handle residents using their air conditioners, EVs are a different ballgame. Plus, upgrading the grid may be onerously expensive.Now, here’s where SBSW may become one of the stocks that will make you rich in 10 years. Among Sibanye’s specialties is palladium production, a silver-like metal heavily used in catalytic converters. In other words, combustion cars may still be relevant for years to come. What’s more, it’s not just a random hunch.Most notably, auto giant Toyota (NYSE:TM) refuses to go all-in on EVs. Management believes that consumer options will still exist, including combustion power and hybrids. Given that palladium may continue to enjoy an upside pathway (and with palladium-producer Russia effectively out of the picture), SBSW draws intrigue as one of the stocks that will make you rich in 10 years.Epsilon Energy (EPSN)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. Energy stocks; energy storageSource: PopTika / ShutterstockAlong with talks about EV integration, folks can’t stop waxing poetic about clean and renewable energy. Sincerely, I hope that in the future, advanced technologies will enable perfectly green sustainable infrastructures. But for now, the science doesn’t lie. Energy sources such as wind and solar feature the lowest capacity factors or measure of power outflow reliability.Therefore, as anachronistic as it might sound, on-shore focused independent oil and natural gas company Epsilon Energy (NASDAQ:EPSN) still offers significant relevancies. To be fair, the future of energy may very well be clean and renewable. But to make a full transition to this point will probably take more than a decade. In the meantime, hydrocarbon energy specialists will still be chugging along.Combined with geopolitical flashpoints that artificially lowered available supply for western countries, Epsilon may enjoy a greater share of the addressable market. What I also appreciate are the financial metrics. The company features a strong balance sheet, excellent profit margins and is objectively undervalued to boot. EPSN easily ranks among the stocks that will make you rich in 10 years.NuScale Power (SMR)clean energy stocks: a nuclear power plant in BelgiumSource: engel.ac / ShutterstockOver the past several months, I’ve been pounding the table regarding NuScale Power (NYSE:SMR). Offering a fresh look at nuclear power facilities, NuScale specializes in the manufacturing of small modular reactors. These powerplants feature a smaller footprint than their traditional counterparts. As well, they incorporate advanced safety protocols, enabling their integration closer to the source of demand.What’s particularly intriguing about all nuclear power centers on the underlying energy density. According to the Nuclear Energy Institute, one uranium fuel pellet has as much energy as 17,000 cubic feet of natural gas, 149 gallons of crude oil or one ton of coal. You’re just not going to get that kind of density from any other source.Now, combine this incredible density with NuScale’s geographically flexible SMRs (due to the smaller footprint) and you have a viable solution to our power needs. To be fair, it might take a few years for NuScale to grow into the business. That said, I think there’s great potential for SMR to be one of the stocks that will make you rich in 10 years.Ocean Power Technologies (OPTT)A photograph of the ocean.Source: Manu Galdamez/ShutterStock.comMoving on to the riskiest names among the stocks that will make you rich in 10 years, we’ll start with Ocean Power Technologies (NYSEAMERICAN:OPTT). As a literal penny stock, you’re going to need to be extremely careful with OPTT. And if you’re even thinking about wagering with money you can’t afford to lose, please don’t. Ocean Power isn’t for the faint of heart.However, the company intrigues in that it utilizes wave energy or the natural kinesis of the ocean. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, “[t]he theoretical annual energy potential of waves off the coasts of the United States is estimated to be as much as 2.64 trillion kilowatthours, or the equivalent of about 64% of total U.S. utility-scale electricity generation in 2021.”Moreover, wave energy infrastructures remain underwater, thus not impacting the aesthetical appeal of their surrounding environment. Of course, the drawbacks include high costs and potential maritime impact. As well, OPTT’s lifetime return is a loss of nearly 100%. That said, the drive for different energy sources may lift OPTT from the grave. If you can handle the risk, it might be worth some loose change from your sofa.Gratomic (CBULF)Multiple pieces of graphite are stacked on top of each other.Source: ShutterstockAs the only name on this list of stocks that will make you rich in 10 years that’s traded over the counter, Gratomic (OTCMKTS:CBULF) presents astounding risks. Also, shares presently trade hands for only 21 cents. And don’t think such a low-priced security can’t get any lower. In the trailing year, shares lost more than 80% of value.Put another way, the folks that were thinking it can’t get lower than a buck were wrong – very wrong. Still, for those that can handle extreme speculation, Gratomic might offer something for this special class of risk-tolerate traders.A multinational company with projects in Namibia, Brazil, and Canada, Gratomic seeks to become a a leading global graphite supplier. Beyond its traditional use in pencils, graphite features heavily in lubricants, batteries, brushes for electric motors and cores of nuclear reactors. As institutions and nations build their portfolio of advanced technical applications, graphite demand will likely accelerate.Of course, this doesn’t mean that Gratomic will jump higher. However, if you want to take a potshot, CBULF could make you rich in two or three years. Then again, it can also make you poor so watch out.On Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

325,628a7aa2-6b05-3b57-9c84-b4d0fc84ab17,LYB,2023-01-21,Earnings Preview: LyondellBasell (LYB) Q4 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-lyondellbasell-lyb-q4-150003070.html,1674226803,STORY,"['LYB', 'EMN']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when LyondellBasell (LYB) reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis oil refiner and chemical company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.09 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -70%.Revenues are expected to be $10.43 billion, down 18.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.16% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for LyondellBasell?For LyondellBasell, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.76%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that LyondellBasell will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that LyondellBasell would post earnings of $2.96 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.96, delivering a surprise of -33.78%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.LyondellBasell doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Chemical - Diversified industry, Eastman Chemical (EMN) is soon expected to post earnings of $1.26 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -30.4%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $2.29 billion, down 14.8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Eastman Chemical has been revised 6.8% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -7.31%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Eastman Chemical will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

328,2626b098-c536-3f1f-a4dd-e2dabfc9a16f,PGR,2023-01-21,5 Property & Casualty Insurers to Gain Despite Catastrophe Loss,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-property-casualty-insurers-gain-152003545.html,1674228003,STORY,"['BRK-B', 'CB', 'TRV', '^GSPC', 'PGR', 'RE']","[The Zacks Property and Casualty Insurance (P&amp;C) industry is likely to benefit from better pricing, prudent underwriting and exposure growth. Industry players like Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B), Chubb Limited CB, The Progressive Corporation PGR, The Travelers Companies Inc. TRV and Everest Re Group RE are poised to grow despite a rise in catastrophic activities. Given an active catastrophe environment, the policy renewal rate should accelerate. Also, the increasing adoption of technology and the emergence of insurtech will help in the smooth functioning of the industry players.Though the industry is witnessing a rate increase, the magnitude has decreased in the last seven quarters. Nonetheless, an improvement in surplus and accelerated economic activities set the stage for a better M&amp;A environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Property and Casualty Insurance industry comprises companies that provide commercial and personal property insurance, and casualty insurance products and services. Such insurance helps to safeguard property in case of any natural or man-made disasters. Liability coverages are also provided by some industry players. The insurance coverage offered also includes automobiles, professional risk, marine, excess casualty, aviation, personal accident, commercial multi-peril, and professional indemnity and surety. Premiums are the primary source of revenues for these insurers. These companies invest a portion of premiums to meet their commitments to policyholders. The interest rate environment has started to improve. The Fed has already made seven hikes in 2022 with more to come in 2023. An improving rate environment is a boon for insurers, especially long-tail insurers4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Property and Casualty Insurance IndustryImproved pricing to help navigate claims: Catastrophes are a concern for insurers due to the high degree of losses incurred. They implement price hikes to ensure uninterrupted claims payment. Global commercial insurance prices rose for 20 straight quarters though the magnitude has slowed down over the last seven quarters, per Marsh Global Insurance Market Index. Better pricing will help insurers write higher premiums and address claims payment prudently. Per Deloitte Insights, trends like commercial lines witnessing growth at a faster pace than personal lines and homeowners’ premiums improving better than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023. Per Deloitte Insights, gross premiums are estimated to increase sixfold to $722 billion by 2030. China and North America should account for more than two-thirds of the global market, per the report. Catastrophe loss induces volatility in underwriting profits: The property and casualty insurance industry is susceptible to catastrophe events, which drag down underwriting profit. Swiss Re estimated insured losses from natural catastrophes of $35 million for the first half of 2022, while Munich Re estimated losses of $65 billion, with slightly less than half insured. Per a report published in LAW360, AM Best estimated the net income of U.S. property and casualty insurers to decline 17% year over year to $31.4 billion in the first half of 2022. While the third quarter largely suffered the wrath of Hurricane Ian, the fourth quarter faced the wrath of winter storms that impacted much of the United States and Canada in late December. However, exposure growth, better pricing, prudent underwriting and favorable reserve development will help withstand the blow. Also, frequent occurrences of natural disasters should accelerate the policy renewal rate.Merger and acquisitions: Consolidation in the property and casualty industry is likely to continue as players look to diversify their operations into new business lines and geography. Buying businesses along the same lines will also continue as players look to gain market share and grow in their niche areas. With the reopening of the economy, optimistic growth outlook and sturdy capital level, the industry is witnessing a number of mergers, acquisitions and consolidations.Increased adoption of technology: The industry is witnessing increased use of technology like blockchain, artificial intelligence, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing and robotic process automation that expedite business operations and save cost. The industry has also witnessed the emergence of insurtech — technology-led insurers — creating competition for incumbent players. The focus of insurtech is mainly on the property and casualty insurance industry. Accelerated digitalization has become the need of the hour and insurers continue to invest heavily in technology to improve basis points, scale and efficiencies. As insurtechs use the latest technologies and concepts that the incumbents are just beginning to experiment with, there remains a huge market risk.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak prospects in the near term. The Zacks Property and Casualty Insurance industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #173, which places it in the bottom 31% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.Before we present a few property and casualty stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.Industry Outperforms S&amp;P 500 and SectorThe Property and Casualty Insurance industry has outperformed both the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite as well as its sector over the past year.

330,c449cfeb-606f-37d5-b0de-e325c5044799,VLO,2023-01-21,"With 81% ownership in Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO), institutional investors have a lot riding on the business",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/81-ownership-valero-energy-corporation-120028954.html,1674302428,STORY,['VLO'],"[Every investor in Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 81% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).And as as result, institutional investors reaped the most rewards after the company's stock price gained 4.8% last week. The one-year return on investment is currently 86% and last week's gain would have been more than welcomed.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Valero Energy. See our latest analysis for Valero Energy ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Valero Energy?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Valero Energy does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Valero Energy's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Valero Energy is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 11% of shares outstanding. With 9.1% and 7.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 20 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Story continuesWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Valero EnergyWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Valero Energy Corporation in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$221m worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 18% stake in Valero Energy. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Valero Energy  that you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of 71 cents per share on revenues of $1.2 billion.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the provider of hydraulic fracturing and other auxiliary services to onshore exploration and production companies in North America in the December quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at LBRT’s previous-quarter performance first.Highlights of Q3 Earnings &amp; Surprise HistoryIn the last-reported quarter, the Denver, CO-based oilfield service company beat the consensus mark due to the impact of strong execution, higher activity and increased service pricing, LBRT had reported earnings per share of 78 cents, 15 cents higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues of $1.2 billion generated by the firm also came in above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1 billion.LBRT beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, which resulted in an earnings surprise of 58.5%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below:Liberty Energy Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseLiberty Energy Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseLiberty Energy Inc. price-eps-surprise | Liberty Energy Inc. QuoteTrend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter bottom line has remained unchanged in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 336.7% jump year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues, meanwhile, suggests a 74.7% increase from the year-ago period.Factors to ConsiderDespite growing risk in financial markets due to the aggressive monetary tightening by central banks and the fallout from China’s zero-COVID lockdown policy, Liberty management believes that the energy market remains tight. On top of this, the OPEC+ supply cut, sanctions on Russian oil and limited availability of spare production capacity are likely to further strengthen the demand for North American energy.This means that upstream operators are drilling more wells to increase output that has remained depressed over the past two years due to the lack of investment, supply-chain issues, scarcity of labor and equipment attrition. With crude demand set to remain robust and eventually surpass the pre-COVID record, most of the domestic fracking capacity is on the verge of being exhausted. In this context, Liberty management sees elevated demand for its next-generation fleet that supports clients’ requirements for quality and reliability. Notwithstanding holiday and seasonal weather, the company sees fourth-quarter results in line with the strong third quarter.On a somewhat bearish note, the increase in LBRT’s costs might have dented the company’s to-be-reported bottom line. The company’s third-quarter total operating expenses totaled $1 billion, up 59.4% from the year-ago period. The upward cost trajectory is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter due to the prevailing inflationary environment.Story continuesWhat Does Our Model Say?The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that LBRT is likely to beat estimates in the fourth quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in the Last 10 Years.  While it is important for investors to have a long-term perspective and not get caught up in short-term fluctuations, it is equally important to consider historical context and not base investment decisions solely on recent performance or market headlines. A diversified portfolio and a well thought out investment strategy can help individuals stay focused on their long-term goals and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market movements.  Investors selling off their equities are displaying short sightedness, since latest Morgan Stanley data suggests that the operating margin of the S&amp;P 500 Index stands at 11.6%, which is still close to the record high of 13.1% achieved in late 2021. The present operating margin is also meaningfully higher than pre-pandemic levels of 10.2% and the rolling 10-year average of 9.4%. 2022 nominal revenues for S&amp;P 500 constituents were also 8% greater than the 10-year trend. Similarly, the real inflation-adjusted consumption in 2022 was approximately 7% ahead of its long-term trend.  To build a portfolio that has a chance to beat market volatility and offer stable returns, investors should look out for the top performing S&amp;P 500 stocks over the years. Although past performance is not a measure for future performance, it is helpful to pick up companies that have shown resilience over time and will likely continue to perform well. While some investors choose income stocks to weather a harsh market environment (see 11 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats to Buy), others seek out defensive equities instead. (see 14 Best Stocks To Buy Before A Recession) Some of the best performing S&amp;P 500 stocks in the last 10 years include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). Story continuesOur MethodologyWe used a stock screener to scan the S&amp;P 500 index and picked 11 of the best-performing stocks over the past 10 years with most significant gains, as of January 18. However, some of these companies were not operational during the entire ten year period. We scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 920 hedge funds to assess the hedge fund sentiment around these equities. The list is arranged according to the share price returns of each firm. 11 Best Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in the Last 10 YearsPhoto by Adam Nowakowski on UnsplashBest Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in the Last 10 Years11. Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 4410-Year Share Price Gains as of January 18: 925.2%Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) is an American biotechnology company that discovers, develops, and sells messenger RNA therapeutics and vaccines for the treatment of infectious diseases, immuno-oncology diseases, rare diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and auto-immune diseases worldwide. On January 17, Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) announced results from a late-stage trial of its investigational respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine candidate, noting that it met its core efficacy goals. The vaccine candidate, mRNA-1345, indicated an efficacy of 83.7% against RSV lower respiratory tract disease in older adults, the company reported. On January 11, Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Papadakis raised Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA)’s price target from $185 to $225 and maintained a ""Buy"" rating on the shares. Despite trimming the company's fiscal 2024 revenue estimates, the analyst believes that recent news updates have been positive and have contributed to the boost in the price target. However, the analyst also believes that Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) will incur a loss this year due to planned research and development expenses.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 44 hedge funds were long Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 45 funds in the last quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 5.70 million shares worth $674.7 million. In addition to NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) is one of the best performing stocks over the last decade. Here is what Baron Funds said about Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Within biotechnology, underperformance of Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) and lower exposure to this better performing sub-industry weighed the most on relative performance. Shares of Moderna, a leader in the emerging field of mRNA-based vaccines and therapeutics, declined due to increasing uncertainty around what a booster market could look like as COVID shifts away from pandemic status and becomes an increasingly commercial market rather than government funded.”10. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26910-Year Share Price Gains as of January 18: 969.5%Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the best performing S&amp;P 500 stocks, with shares exhibiting 10-year price gains of 969.5% as of January 18. On January 17, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares rose marginally after the company announced that it was expanding access to ChatGPT through its Azure cloud service. The tech giant disclosed that ChatGPT would be available ""soon"" via a program called Azure OpenAI Service. Microsoft already has a $1 billion stake in OpenAI, and is in talks to grow its investment in the company by perhaps as much as $10 billion.On January 18, Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss maintained an Overweight rating and a $307 price target on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares ahead of the FQ2 earnings report. In a research note, the analyst told investors that Microsoft's alignment with primary secular trends and benefits from vendor consolidation are likely to result in continued share gains for the company. Weiss also believes that Microsoft's technology, scale, and distribution advantages contribute to a positive outlook on the company. According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was part of 269 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 258 funds in the prior quarter. Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Trust is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 39.2 million shares worth $9.14 billion. Fundsmith made the following comment about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its yearly 2022 investor letter:“Take the example of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Intuit. Microsoft shares are currently being valued at a P/E ratio of 25.0 times the consensus EPS estimate for the fiscal year ending June 2023. Meanwhile, Intuit is being valued at 28.4 times the non-GAAP consensus estimate for the fiscal year ending July 2023. Many investors and analysts may accept that Intuit is trading at a higher multiple given expectations of greater growth potential. However, Intuit removes share-based compensation from their non-GAAP EPS whereas Microsoft does not. Given that Intuit’s GAAP EPS guidance for the year ending 31st July 2023 is $6.92–$7.22, its non-GAAP guidance is $13.59–$13.89, and the consensus estimate for 2023 EPS is at $13.69, it seems clear that most sell-side analysts are accepting the company’s non-GAAP adjustments, which includes the removal of some $1.8bn of share-based compensation, in their estimates. If we include the impact of share-based compensation in Intuit’s 2023 EPS to make a more apples-to-apples comparison with Microsoft based upon GAAP EPS, Intuit’s 2023 EPS would be closer to $9, meaning that the shares would be trading at a multiple of about 43 times. I think investors and analysts may find a premium of 14% for Intuit over Microsoft (28.4 times versus 25.0 times) to be reasonable. I’m not so sure they are fully aware that Intuit shares are actually trading at a premium of 73% if share-based compensation is treated in the same manner between the two companies.”9.

(NYSE:VZ), Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), and Charter Communications, Inc.

(NASDAQ:TMUS):“As mentioned, the communication services sector has come under some pressure, and irrational pricing competition has negatively impacted wireless industry growth and profitability of late, weighing on T-Mobile. Faced with these headwinds, and with pressure from other wireless carriers and cable companies that could cause the company to cede share in subscriber growth in 2022, we exited our position in the fourth quarter.”8.

Our four largest current holdings in the portfolio weathered that period well. UnitedHealth’s (NYSE:UNH) earnings were resilient. While it reported modestly down earnings in 2008, its earnings rebounded quickly to record highs in 2010 and the shares responded strongly in anticipation of this.”7. Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 6310-Year Share Price Gains as of January 18: 1,240%Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) designs, manufactures, refurbishes, and services semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits. Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) was incorporated in 1980 and is headquartered in Fremont, California. The company distributed a $1.725 per share quarterly dividend to shareholders on January 4. It is one of the best performing S&amp;P 500 members over the last decade, with 10-year share price gains of 1,240% as of January 18. On January 18, Stifel analyst Brian Chin resumed coverage of Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) with a Hold rating and a $495 price target. The analyst cited that fundamentals, particularly in the memory market, have rapidly declined, and he expects investments to contract sharply next year, resulting in a drop in overall spending on fab equipment. He believes that Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX)’s leadership position in the memory market will likely become a drag on the business in 2023. According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 63 hedge funds were long Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX), compared to 56 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the biggest position holder in the company, with 3.7 million shares worth $1.37 billion. Renaissance Investment made the following comment about Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Conversely, we sold our positions in Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) and Zoetis (ZTS) following a sustained deterioration in fundamental factors. After a qualitative review of Lam Research, we believe the company will face a number of headwinds that could make for an unfavorable risk-reward position, given the highly cyclical nature of its business in a slowing global economy. We are also expecting fundamentals to turn negative as sales and operating profits are poised to decelerate, resulting in negative earnings revisions. While the stock trades at an attractive valuation multiple, we believe that this is more a sign that earnings will decline meaningfully.”6. ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 10310-Year Share Price Gains as of January 18: 1,420%ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a California-based company that provides enterprise cloud computing solutions worldwide. It is one of the top S&amp;P 500 performers over the last decade, with 10-year share price gains of 1,420% as of January 18. On January 12, Wolfe Research analyst Alex Zukin raised the price target on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) to $500 from $440 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. His checks were ""so strong on an absolute and relative basis"" that he sees ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) having the ""best setup"" for Q4 earnings among the software stocks he covers, the analyst told investors. The analyst said he would buy the stock given its current valuation. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 103 hedge funds were bullish on ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 99 funds in the last quarter. Chase Coleman’s Tiger Global Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 1.7 million shares worth nearly $640 million. Like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is one of the most popular S&amp;P 500 stocks among elite hedge funds. Aristotle Atlantic made the following comment about ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Underperformance in the third quarter can be attributed to ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW)’s slight miss on the second quarter earnings and guidance that was lower than expected for its third quarter outlook. The company is facing headwinds from the weaker macroeconomic conditions and a tempered outlook resulting from elongated sales cycles and an overall slowing software spending environment. These worsening conditions were highlighted by many software companies during the second quarter earnings season. We expect this to be temporary for ServiceNow where the long-term thesis of the company’s platform strategy and relevance to digital transformation strategies remains intact. The stock was also likely impacted by the rapid increase in interest rates during the third quarter and the resulting contraction of multiples on high-growth software stocks.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in the Last 10 Years.  Suggested articles:13 Best Communication Services Stocks To Invest In12 Best DRIP Stocks To Own13 Cash Rich Penny Stocks That Hedge Funds Are Buying Disclosure: None. 11 Best Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks in the Last 10 Years is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Today's event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&amp;G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter &amp; Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter &amp; Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to P&amp;G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten.Andre Schulten: Good morning. Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. We're going to keep our prepared remarks brief and then turn straight to your questions. Execution of our integrated strategies continued to yield good results in the October to December quarter, growing organic sales in nine of 10 categories, holding global aggregate market share, continued productivity savings, improving supply efficiency, sustained investment and superiority of our brands across all five vectors: product, package, communication, go-to-market and value continue to pay benefits for our consumers and retail partners and in turn, for P&amp;G shareholders.Progress against our plan fiscal year-to-date enables us to increase the guidance range for organic sales growth and maintain ranges for core EPS growth, free cash flow productivity and cash return to shareowners. Moving to the second quarter numbers. Organic sales grew 5%, pricing at a 10 points to sales growth and mix was up 1 point. Volume declined 6 points driven by a combination of market contraction, trade inventory reductions and portfolio reduction in Russia. Growth was broad-based across business units with each of our 10 product categories growing or holding organic sales. Personal Health Care grew high teens, Feminine Care, Fabric Care and Home Care were up high single digits. Hair Care was up mid-single digits. Baby Care, Family Care, Oral Care and Skin and Personal Care were each up low single digits.Story continuesGrooming was in line with prior year. Focus markets grew 3% for the quarter, with the U.S. up 6%. Greater China organic sales were down 7% versus prior year, as the market continued to be impacted by COVID lockdowns and weaker consumer confidence. We continue to expect a slow recovery as consumer mobility increases over the coming quarters. Long term, we expect China to return to strong underlying growth rates. Enterprise markets were up 14% with each of the three regions up 10% or more. Global aggregate market share was in line with prior year with 27 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share. In the U.S., all outlet value share was in line with prior year with seven of 10 categories holding or growing share. U.S. volume share is up 0.5 point versus the prior year quarter, delivering sequential improvement from quarter one.Recent innovations like Downy Rinse and Refresh in fabric enhancers and Dawn Powerwash in hand dishwashing are extending superiority advantages and driving value and volume share growth. Innovation also serves as a catalyst for pricing across our other brands and forms in their category segments. On the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.59, down 4% versus prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS increased 5%. Core operating margin decreased 170 basis points, primarily due to gross margin pressure from commodities and foreign exchange. Currency-neutral core operating margin decreased 70 basis points. Productivity improvements were 110 basis points help to the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 72%, primarily due to a temporary reduction in payables.We returned $4.2 billion of cash to shareowners, approximately $2.2 billion in dividends and $2 billion in share repurchase. In summary, considering the backdrop of a very challenging cost and operating environment, continued solid results across the top line, bottom line and cash for the first half of the fiscal year. Moving on to strategy. Our team continues to operate with excellence, executing the integrated strategies that have enabled strong results over the past four years, and that are the foundation for balanced growth and value creation. A portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning, health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. Ongoing commitment to and investment in irresistible superiority across the five vectors of product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value.PG 58009547_ml Procter &amp; Gamble Corporate Headquarters.

Productivity improvement in all areas of our operations to fund investments in superiority offset cost and currency challenges, expand margins and deliver strong cash generation. An approach of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future, especially important in this volatile environment. Finally, an organization that is increasingly more empowered, agile and accountable with little overlap or redundancy, flowing to new demands, seamlessly reporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world.Going forward, there are four areas we are driving to improve the execution of the integrated strategies, Supply Chain 3.0, digital acumen, environmental sustainability and employee value creation. These are not new or separate strategies. They are necessary elements in continuing to build the priority, reduce cost to enable investment and value creation and to further strengthen our organization. We expanded on each of these at our Investor Day in November. If you weren't able to attend or listen in remotely, I encourage you to review the materials on our IR events website. Our strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization are interdependent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other.When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth is to double down on these integrated strategies starting with commitment to deliver irresistible superior propositions to consumers and retail partners. Now moving to guidance. We continue to expect more volatility in costs currencies and consumer dynamics as we move through the second half of the fiscal year. However, we think the strategies we've chosen, the investments we've made and the focus on executional excellence have positioned us well to manage through this volatility over time. Raw and pack material costs inclusive of commodities and supplier inflation are still a significant headwind versus last fiscal year, though we have seen some modest sequential improvement.Based on current spot prices and latest contracts, we now estimate a $2.3 billion after-tax headwind in fiscal '23. Foreign exchange is also a significant year-on-year headwind. But like raw and pack materials, we've seen modest directional improvement. Based on current exchange rates, we now forecast a $1.2 billion after-tax impact for the fiscal year. Freight costs remain higher versus prior year, and we continue to expect the $200 million after-tax headwind in fiscal '23. Combined headwinds from these items are now estimated at approximately $3.7 billion after tax, $1.50 per share, a 26 percentage point headwind to EPS growth for the year. For perspective, recall that we began the year expecting approximately $1.33 of cost and FX headwinds.So despite some modest relief since last quarter, our current outlook is still $0.17 worse than our ingoing position. We are offsetting a portion of these cost headwinds with price increases and productivity savings. We are continuing to invest in irresistible superiority, and we are investing to improve our supply capacity, resilience and flexibility. As we've said before, we believe this is a bottom line rough patch to grow through with continued investment in the business and underlying strategies. As I noted at the outset, our solid first half results enable us to raise our organic sales outlook and confirm our guidance ranges on EPS and cash. We are increasing our guidance for organic sales growth from a range of 3% to 5% to a range of 4% to 5%.Within this company-wide range, we -- there are many puts and takes. As I mentioned, we expect to see some modest improvement in China, but European markets have softened as high inflation affects consumer spending. The U.S. remains relatively strong to date, and most enterprise markets remain resilient. On the bottom line, we're maintaining our outlook of core earnings per share growth in the range of in line to plus 4% versus prior year. The significant headwinds from input costs and foreign exchange keep our current expectations towards the lower end of this range. This guidance also reflects our intent to remain fully invested to drive our superiority strategy and increase investments as opportunities are available. We continue to forecast adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%.We expect to pay around $9 billion of dividends and to repurchase $6 billion to $8 billion of common stock, combined a plan to return $15 billion to $17 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth rate estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions, major production stoppages or store closures are not anticipated within these guidance ranges. To conclude, we continue to face high year-over-year commodity and transportation cost inflation in the upstream supply chain and in our own operations, headwinds from foreign exchange, geopolitical issues, COVID disruptions impacting consumer confidence and historically high inflation impacting consumer budgets.These macroeconomic and market level consumer challenges we're facing are not unique to P&amp;G, and we won't be immune to the impact. We attempt to be realistic about these impacts in our guidance and transparent in our commentary. As we've said before, we believe this is a rough patch to grow through, not a reason to reduce investment in the long-term health of the business. We're doubling down on the strategy that has been working well and is delivering strong results. We continue to step forward towards our opportunities, and we remain fully invested in our business. We are committed to driving productivity, improvements to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges and to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth. With that, we're happy to take your questions.See also Top AI Healthcare Stocks to Buy and 10 Penny Stocks that will Make You A Millionaire.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

345,d2206235-88b6-3fae-abd3-8ceae88b5173,AFL,2023-01-21,5 Insurance Stocks Likely to Zoom Past Q4 Earnings Estimates,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-insurance-stocks-likely-zoom-134001255.html,1674222001,STORY,"['VOYA', 'AIG', 'AFL', 'MMC', 'RE']","[Improved pricing, new products and services, rising interest rates, and accelerated digitalization efforts are expected to have been the highlights of the insurance industry in the fourth quarter of 2022. The insurance players are part of the broader Zacks Finance sector (one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification). Technological improvements and adoptions are expected to have lowered costs and improved efficiency for companies like Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. MMC, American International Group, Inc. AIG, Aflac Incorporated AFL, Everest Re Group, Ltd. RE and Voya Financial, Inc. VOYA.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have identified five companies, MMC, AIG, AFL, REand VOYA, which are poised to outpace the Zacks Consensus Estimate in fourth-quarter earnings. These stocks have the ideal combination of two ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy), #3 (Hold) — to surpass expectations. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Before we get into the details of factors that are anticipated to have influenced the fourth-quarter performance, let’s take a look at the sector projections.Per the latest Earnings Preview, the finance sector’s fourth-quarter 2022 earnings are estimated to decline 9.2%, while revenues are expected to increase 2.7%. Rising interest rates, growing awareness, scaling of businesses and other factors are expected to have supported the industry players’ top-line growth.Factors Shaping Q4 ResultsIn the fourth quarter, the insurance players are expected to have witnessed improved pricing. An active catastrophe environment and growing awareness are likely to have triggered the policy renewal rate and supported pricing growth. Favorable reserve development and robust capital levels are anticipated to have boosted the companies’ underwriting profitability.Story continuesThe significant winter storm of late December resulted in massive catastrophe losses for some insurers, which weighed on their quarterly performances. For example, The Allstate Corporation alone incurred estimated catastrophe losses of $478 million from the Winter Storm Elliott. This can give an idea about how the property and casualty stocks suffered in the quarter.However, auto and home insurance premiums are expected to have increased significantly in the quarter under review, providing some respite to the industry players. The insurers facing increased expenses due to supply-chain woes, the shortage of microchips and auto replacement parts opted for auto rate hikes. This is expected to have boosted fourth-quarter premiums.Inflationary pressures are expected to have triggered households to hedge against inflation and complement public health coverage with health insurances, which aided the health insurers. Insurance brokerage companies are expected to have gained from global expansions, increasing rates, tightening underwriting standards and cost-control efforts.The high interest rate environment is likely to have aided the insurers’ investment yields. Rate-sensitive investments and alternative investments in private equity, hedge funds, and real estate, among others, are expected to have benefited the companies’ investment income.Rising demand for protection products and policies with “living” benefits are likely to have boosted life insurers’ sales figures. Accelerated digitalization efforts are expected to have saved costs, improved operating efficiency and driven margin expansion for the insurance players.Potential Q4 OutperformersBelow we list five insurance stocks that have the right mix of elements to pull off a beat this earnings season.Based in New York, Marsh &amp; McLennan is a globally leading insurance broker. Solid performances of the Risk and Insurance Services, and Consulting businesses are anticipated to have driven its fourth-quarter 2022 earnings, partially offset by higher costs. New business generation and solid retention rates are likely to have aided its performance in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Marsh &amp; McLennan’s fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.40 per share, suggesting an increase of 2.9% from the year-ago reported figure. It beat earnings estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average of 3.2%. MMC has an Earnings ESP of +2.72% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present.

Next week will be the first big one of this reporting cycle. This earnings season will be important as market participants will closely monitor any sign of earnings, revenues or margin decline.A large section of economists and financial experts are concerned that the U.S. economy may face at least a mild recession in 2023 with a higher interest rate regime and tighter monetary control adopted by the Fed.Nevertheless, five large-cap companies are set to beat Q4 2022 earnings results next week.

Here is what several big names in business had to say on the potential for a recession in the next year.More Yahoo Finance coverage of Davos 2023:Rubenstein: Fed will settle for 'tolerable' 3% inflation, doesn't see imminent recessionNouriel Roubini says 'literally 99% of crypto is a scam'Roubini: U.S. debt ceiling fight is a potential 'financial catastrophe''You can see': Citi CEO details how the bank handles productivity amid hybrid workWhy Unilever's CEO has embraced Disney investor Nelson PeltzImmigration tops U.S. officials' agendas at this week's global gatheringGary Cohn on recession fears: 'We've weathered the storm in the United States'Bank of America CEO: No mass layoff announcements are in the cardsBank of America CEO on Fed easing: Why 'higher for longer' makes senseDavos: PwC survey finds 'bleak CEO outlook' for 2023Davos 2023: ChatGPT ‘a great co-pilot for creatives,’ will.i.am saysA 'mild' and 'shallow' recessionUnilever CEO Alan Jope""Well, the world is not flat,"" Jope told Yahoo Finance. ""So we are very bullish on South Asia — not just India, by the way. Pakistan, India, Bangladesh [are] all doing very well. Southeast Asia, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand starting to come back strongly. We see an extraordinary ability to navigate uncertainty in Latin America. So far, the U.S. consumer has held up well. Europe is a more difficult space. So I think there will be parts of the world that go into recession this year.""(Photo: Kevin Burke/Yahoo Finance)Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan""Our research team has moved their recession outlook out a little later in this year into early next year,"" Moynihan stated. ""That means that they actually have a positive number for GDP growth in the U.S. this year, slightly positive. And it'll be a mild recession, largely because of the stimulus and other things. Even though the Fed raised rates, you see the capacity of the American consumer to keep going.""Story continuesEY Global Chairman &amp; CEO Carmine Di Sibio""I thought there was going to be complete pessimism everywhere,"" Di Sibio told Yahoo Finance. ""I'm surprised that's not the case. I'm not saying there's a lot of optimism, but it's much more balanced. I think people are looking at that we will have some kind of downturn in the U.S. and Europe, and how long it'll last, will it be shallow? There's more of a sense that it's going to be short and shallow right now.""KPMG CEO Paul Knopp""I do not think we're in a recession in the U.S.,"" Knopp stated. ""I actually see some pillars of strength in the U.S. when it comes to innovation, technology. The Inflation Reduction Act, actually, also helped with respect to spending in the U.S.""""There's no doubt that there are challenges, too, when it comes to interest rates and inflation,"" Knopp added. ""But I am personally optimistic that there may not be a recession or, if there is one, it'll be short and shallow.""Chuck Robbins, CEO of Cisco, attends a session during the World Economic Forum WEF 2022 Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, May 25, 2022.

""It's funny because publicly in the press, everybody wants to talk about whether we're going into a recession or not.""""When we go into our meetings, we generally don't talk about that,"" he continued. ""There's a lot of discussions around Ukraine. Obviously, there's a lot of discussion around geopolitical issues. There's a lot of discussions around inflation in general [and] the energy crisis. But I think, overall, I sense there's still more optimism here than what's sort of being portrayed relative to this fear of a recession.""Carlyle Co-Founder David Rubenstein""The press that has been written about Davos suggests that people here think that we're going into a recession for sure, and things are pretty gloomy,"" Rubenstein said. ""I don't really agree with that. The numbers that we have in our own companies at Carlyle don't suggest a recession is imminent. And we also think that the U.S. policy to get inflation down is probably working. And so I don't really think it's clear we're going to go into a recession in the third or fourth quarter.""The outlook for the global economy may not be that bright, leaders warned at this year's World Economic Forum. Williams-Sonoma CEO Laura Alber chats with Yahoo Finance about the outlook for her home furnishings business. (Yahoo Finance)'A lot of uncertainty'HP CEO Enrique Lores""I think it's hard to know what is going to happen,"" Lores told Yahoo Finance. ""And clearly, I'm not an expert. What is true, though, is there are significant challenges when we look at the impact of inflation, the impact of the war, the increase of energy prices, the situation in China. Each of these things could drive for a recession. It's hard to know what will happen.""""For all of us, what is important is to focus on those things that we can control,"" Lores added. ""I think this is where we, as CEOs, can add value. And in our case, it's really about managing our costs while we continue to invest in the growth areas to position ourselves in the right way for whenever the economy will revamp.""Williams-Sonoma CEO Laura Alber""I think there's been a lot of conversation about what's happening,"" Alber said. ""Honestly, it's a lot of uncertainty, and the debate about recession, no recession. And I was reflecting on that last night and thinking about the opportunity and the importance of thinking long-term and not thinking too short-term — preparing for whatever might come but building for the future.""Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.
