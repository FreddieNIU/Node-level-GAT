But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Currently, INTERTEK GP has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Verisk Analytics has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that IKTSY likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than VRSK has recently. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.IKTSY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 19.66, while VRSK has a forward P/E of 40.74. We also note that IKTSY has a PEG ratio of 2.70. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. VRSK currently has a PEG ratio of 3.44.Another notable valuation metric for IKTSY is its P/B ratio of 5.70. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, VRSK has a P/B of 408.09.Based on these metrics and many more, IKTSY holds a Value grade of B, while VRSK has a Value grade of D.Story continuesIKTSY has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than VRSK, so it seems like value investors will conclude that IKTSY is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Schwab is likely best known for its leading market trading platform, but over the years its consumer banking operations have grown into the tenth largest bank in the U.S. We believe both the trading and banking franchises remain strong, however, the current interest rate environment (particularly the availability of highly attractive yields in money market funds versus traditional deposits) has diminished the earnings power of the bank, at least in the short term. Given this uncertainty, we elected to move to the sidelines for now and free up capital for higher-conviction investment alternatives. We were net sellers during the first quarter.

Fixed-income investments are subject to various other risks including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors.High-yield securities and unrated securities of similar credit quality (junk bonds) are subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risks and may be more volatile than higher-rated securities.

7,d4051d0c-720c-3b25-a180-fdfa0833f955,SCHW,2023-06-27,Is SWRSX a Strong Bond Fund Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swrsx-strong-bond-fund-now-110005795.html,1687777205,STORY,['SCHW'],"[Any investors who are searching for Mutual Fund Bond funds should take a look at Schwab Treasury Inflation Protected Security (SWRSX). The fund does not have a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank, though we have been able to explore other metrics like performance, volatility, and cost.History of Fund/ManagerSchwab Funds is responsible for SWRSX, and the company is based out of San Francisco, CA. Schwab Treasury Inflation Protected Security made its debut in March of 2006, and since then, SWRSX has accumulated about $2.55 billion in assets, per the most up-to-date date available. The fund's current manager, Matthew Hastings, has been in charge of the fund since March of 2006.PerformanceInvestors naturally seek funds with strong performance. This fund carries a 5-year annualized total return of 2.56%, and it sits in the middle third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of 0.28%, which places it in the middle third during this time-frame.It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. The standard deviation of SWRSX over the past three years is 6.99% compared to the category average of 7.79%. Over the past 5 years, the standard deviation of the fund is 6% compared to the category average of 5.92%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.This fund has a beta of 0.74, meaning that it is less volatile than a broad market index of fixed income securities. Taking this into account, SWRSX has a positive alpha of 1.72, which measures performance on a risk-adjusted basis.Story continuesExpensesAs competition heats up in the mutual fund market, costs become increasingly important. Compared to its otherwise identical counterpart, a low-cost product will be an outperformer, all other things being equal. Thus, taking a closer look at cost-related metrics is vital for investors. In terms of fees, SWRSX is a no load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.05% compared to the category average of 0.84%. From a cost perspective, SWRSX is actually cheaper than its peers.Investors should also note that the minimum initial investment for the product is $0 and that each subsequent investment has no minimum amount.Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.Bottom LineFor additional information on the Mutual Fund Bond area of the mutual fund world, make sure to check out www.zacks.com/funds/mutual-funds.

This change outpaced the S&amp;P 500's 0.45% loss on the day. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.04%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 3.58%.Coming into today, shares of the chipmaker had lost 4.88% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 7.46%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 5.01%.Wall Street will be looking for positivity from Texas Instruments as it approaches its next earnings report date. In that report, analysts expect Texas Instruments to post earnings of $1.76 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 28.16%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $4.36 billion, down 16.43% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $7.48 per share and revenue of $17.93 billion, which would represent changes of -20.34% and -10.49%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Texas Instruments. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. Texas Instruments is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.In terms of valuation, Texas Instruments is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 22.41. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 22.41, so we one might conclude that Texas Instruments is trading at a no noticeable deviation comparatively.Story continuesAlso, we should mention that TXN has a PEG ratio of 2.4. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Semiconductor - General industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.4 as of yesterday's close.The Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 115, which puts it in the top 46% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

GIII, StoneCo Ltd. STNE and Hudson Technologies, Inc. HDSN.4 Low Price-to-Cash Flow Stocks to Pick for Optimum ReturnsValue style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that are fundamentally sound but have been beaten down by some external factors. Such stocks are poised to bounce back as and when investors recognize the inherent value of companies. Certainly, the value investment strategy best suits investors with a long-term horizon.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength. Still, a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, the Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio is one of the key metrics. Unum Group, G-III Apparel Group, Ltd., StoneCo Ltd. and Hudson Technologies, Inc. boast a low P/CF ratio.This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company's financial health.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company’s liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.Story continuesHowever, solely based on the P/CF metric, an investment decision may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.Here are four of the six stocks that qualified the screening:Unum Group, which provides financial protection benefit solutions, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has an expected EPS growth rate of 8.4% for three-five years.

11,70e45979-d034-34b9-8352-7226b50640a3,UNM,2023-06-27,4 Value Stocks to Hold for the Long Term,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-value-stocks-hold-long-154200224.html,1687794120,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'UNM', 'AXS', 'LCUT', 'TEF']","[Long-term investing, as the name implies, refers to those stocks, bonds and other assets that you intend to hold for a very long period of time, say 5-10 years at least. Since most of us aren’t experts on how different markets and technologies will develop, the task of finding long-term options and resisting the urge to sell off when any Tom, Dick or Harry sounds an alarm, can be daunting.Therefore, in order to avoid the anxiety that would be natural in such a setting, it’s best to get in with the attitude that you may make mistakes. And the best way to deal with such a situation -- alright, the second-best way -- is to make sure you have diversified holdings. (The best way is to study, study and study the stocks you intend to invest in.) Back to diversification. Ideally, this should be different industries and not just different stocks within the same industry. Although it’s more work, stocks in different industries give you better protection because the same industry would have certain dynamics that affect all the players in the same way. And you don’t want to get caught in that sameness.Tip number two, it really helps if you’re getting paid for holding the stocks. So, if there’s a dividend going, all the better. For those who can stomach more risk, go ahead and use those dividends to buy more stock. As your holdings grow, you get to earn even more dividends. In addition to the increase in capital. Remember, a company that pays a dividend is likely to have more stable prices than one that does not. But do go back 5-10 years and check its dividend payment history. If it’s steady and rising periodically, that’s good. Only a company that has stable earnings can pay steady dividends over a period of time. Third, buy cheap. I know, that sounds kind of obvious. But only if you know what I mean by cheap. I don’t mean just that the dollar value is low, which can also be a good thing. But the real point is, you need to buy stocks that are trading below their potential value. There’s a number of ways that you can gauge this. Analysts generally use a ratio called P/E (price-to-earnings), but there are also several others, such as P/B (price-to-book) or P/S (price-to-sales).Story continuesTo keep things simple, you can stick with P/E alone or a combination of P/E and P/S in most cases. And you need to compare this ratio with that of the peer group, industry, or some benchmark, such as the S&amp;P 500. A relatively low P/E basically means that the price is relatively low considering the earnings potential and compared to other stocks within the industry (when comparing with the industry) or other stocks in the market (when comparing with a broader index, such as the S&amp;P 500).Let’s consider some examples:AXIS Capital Holdings Ltd. (AXS)Pembroke, Bermuda-based AXIS Capital Holdings is a global provider of specialty insurance and reinsurance products. The company operates through two segments: Insurance and Reinsurance. The Insurance segment offers a range of property, marine, terrorism, aviation and liability insurance products, as well as accidental death, travel and specialty health products. It also provides professional insurance coverage for directors and officers, errors and omissions, and other financial risks. The Reinsurance segment provides various reinsurance products, including catastrophe, property, professional lines and motor liability coverage.AXIS has paid a very steady dividend over the last 10 years and the dividend has also been increasing. The current dividend yields 3.28%.The near-term outlook indicates continued momentum: 7.6% revenue growth and 32.5% earnings growth in 2023, followed by 6.0% revenue growth and 11.7% earnings growth in 2024. In the last quarter, AXIS beat estimates by 23.3%. Therefore, there’s a good chance it will do it again.Not only that – Its 2023 earnings estimate has increased 4.3% in the last 60 days with the 2024 estimate also increasing 1.2%, despite an expected recession. AXIS is expected to grow its earnings 5.0% in the long term.Finally, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rated stock is also cheap. It's trading at a mere 0.88X sales, which means that investors are undervaluing revenue potential. At 6.59X earnings, they are also undervaluing its earnings. The industry P/E averages at 26.08X while the S&amp;P averages at 19.28X, both significantly higher. At the current level, they’re also at a 14.0% discount to their own median value over the past year.No wonder that Zacks has a Value Score of A on this stock.Lifetime Brands, Inc. (LCUT)Garden City, NY-based Lifetime Brands is a global company that designs, sources and sells branded kitchenware, tableware and other home products, including tools, cutlery, cookware and bakeware, as well as tableware products like dinnerware and flatware. It also offers home solutions such as thermal beverageware, bath scales and home décor items. Some of its well-known brands are Farberware, Mikasa, KitchenAid and Pfaltzgraff. Products are mainly sold through mass market merchants, specialty stores, department stores and e-commerce channels.Lifetime Brands has been paying a steady dividend for more than 10 years although the dividend has not increased much. The current divided yields 3.33%, which is not bad at all.Near-term growth prospects appear solid. Lifetime Brands is expected to generate earnings growth of 93.6% this year on revenue that’s expected to decline 6.6%. In the following year, however, revenue is expected to grow 5.0% and earnings 73.3%. In the long term, the company is expected to grow 14.0%.The 2023 estimate increased 9.1% although the 2024 estimate remains consistent with the level 60 days ago. However, things appear to be going well for Lifetime Brands, which beat earnings estimates by 40.0% in the last quarter.Its valuation is also supportive. The P/S multiple of 0.16X is a gross undervaluation of its sales potential, while the P/E of 6.28X reflects similarly on its earnings potential.The shares carry a Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) rank and have a Value Score of A.Unum Group (UNM)Chattanooga, TN-based Unum Group is a leading provider of financial protection benefit solutions primarily in the U.S., the UK and Poland. Its operating segments are Unum US, Unum International, Colonial Life, and Closed Block and Corporate. Unum's range of offerings include group disability, life, and accidental death and dismemberment coverage, as well as supplemental and voluntary products termed individual disability, dental and vision plans.Additionally, Unum provides group pensions, individual life insurance, and other related products. Distribution is through various channels including field sales personnel, independent brokers and consultants.Unum’s dividend currently yields 2.88%, which is not too bad. It has been paying a steadily increasing dividend for more than 10 years.Analysts currently expect the company to generate revenue and earnings growth of 2.5% and 206% in 2023. In 2024, revenue growth is expected to be 3.6% and earnings growth 3.5%. The 2023 earnings estimate has increased 10.6% and the 2024 estimate 7.9%. The long-term growth estimate is 8.4%. Therefore, since the 13.3% surprise in the last earnings announcement, analyst opinion has been very optimistic.At 6.01X earnings, the shares trade at a significant discount to the industry’s 9.93X, the S&amp;P 500, as well as their own median value of 6.37X over the past year. The P/S ratio of 0.75X indicates that sales are also undervalued.The shares carry a Zacks #1 rank and Value Score of A.Telefónica, S.A. (TEF)Headquartered in Madrid, Spain, Telefónica, S.A. is a telecom company that offers services in Europe and Latin America. Its fixed telecom services include PSTN lines, ISDN accesses and public telephone services. It also provides mobile services like Internet, broadband multimedia and voice over Internet protocol services. Additionally, Telefónica offers a range of wholesale services, leased lines, web hosting, system integration and professional services, as well as video/TV services, IoT products, financial services, cloud solutions and virtual assistants.Telefónica pays a dividend that currently yields 6.04%. The dividend has been continuous but the amount has fluctuated quite a bit in the last 10 years, as has its earnings.The near-term outlook is, however, encouraging. Despite the recession that everyone’s expecting around the corner, revenue growth is projected to be flattish both this year and the next while earnings growth is to be flattish this year and 5.7% in the next. Analysts expect the company to grow 20.2% in the long term. Given the 66.7% positive surprise in the last announcement, it isn’t surprising that 2023 estimates increased 34.6% in the last 60 days while the 2024 estimate increased 68%.At 10.9X earnings, the shares trade at a considerable discount to the industry’s 18.6X, as well as the S&amp;P 500. The median value of 13.0X is also higher. Therefore, the shares appear to be undervalued. On a P/S basis as well, the multiple of 0.54X makes them hugely undervalued.The #2 ranked shares carry a Value Score of A.One-Month Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the six stocks that qualified the screening:Unum Group, which provides financial protection benefit solutions, sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has an expected EPS growth rate of 8.4% for three-five years.

The company has enjoyed positive earnings estimate revisions across the board, helping land the stock into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The revisions trend has been particularly strong for the company’s upcoming quarterly release.Shares presently trade at a 10.9X forward earnings multiple, nicely beneath the 11.6X five-year median and highs of 18.7X in 2022.Further, the current forward price-to-sales ratio works out to be 0.6X, again below the five-year median and the Zacks industry average. The stock sports a Style Score of “A” for Value.The company has been a big-time earnings performer, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by an average of nearly 30% across its last four quarters. In its latest release, AMWD penciled in a 100% EPS surprise and reported revenue 5% ahead of expectations.Unum GroupUnum Group provides disability insurance, long-term care insurance, life insurance, and employee-paid group benefits and related services. Earnings expectations have been raised across all timeframes, with the stock carrying the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Story continuesSimilar to AMWD, Unum Group carries a Style Score of “A” for Value. Shares currently trade at a 6.2X forward earnings multiple, in line with the five-year median and nicely below highs of 8.1X in 2022.In addition, the forward price-to-sales sits at 0.7X currently, a tick above the five-year median and well below the Zacks industry average.And for those seeking an income stream, UNM has that covered; shares currently yield 2.9% annually, with the payout growing by a solid 6% over the last five years.Toll BrothersToll Brothers, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), builds single-family detached and attached home communities, master-planned luxury residential resort-style golf communities, and more. Analysts have taken their earnings expectations notably higher and have been in full agreement.Like the stocks above, Toll Brothers carries a Style Score of “A” for Value. Shares presently trade at a 7.2X forward earnings multiple, beneath the 8.4X five-year median and just a few ticks above the 2022 high.The forward-price-to-sales currently resides at 0.9X, slightly above highs of 0.8X in 2022 but below the Zacks industry average.Watch for TOL’s upcoming release on August 22nd; the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $2.86 indicates a 21% year-over-year improvement in earnings. The company has posted notably strong results as of late, exceeding earnings expectations by an average of nearly 25% across its last four periods.Bottom LineValue investors are always looking for deals, expecting the rest of the crowd to eventually catch onto the discounts and lead to significant gains.And when you pair this strategy with the Zacks Rank, which is focused on earnings estimate revisions, it’s much easier to find mispriced stocks with great near-term potential.All three stocks above should be closely monitored by value-focused investors.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Launched on June 25, 2018, GLDM is the leader among low-cost gold ETFs in the market with more than $6.2 billion in assets.1 Since its launch GLDM has grown to be the third largest gold ETF in the US.2This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230624979518/en/A majority of investors familiar with gold ETFs agree they are an investor-friendly product. (Photo: Business Wire)""At just 10 basis points, GLDM has proven to be a great low-cost choice for long-term buy and hold investors seeking access to the benefits of gold,"" said George Milling-Stanley, Chief Gold Strategist at State Street Global Advisors. ""The launch of the world’s first gold ETF, SPDR® Gold Shares (GLD®), nearly two decades ago broke many perceived barriers to investing in gold. It paved the way for GLDM’s introduction as a cost-effective option that further democratized investing in gold, which has increasingly become a core holding for retail investors looking to build diversified portfolios.""Gold Holds Its Value in Investors’ Eyes: Allocations Expected to Rise in Next YearTo mark the 5th anniversary of GLDM, State Street Global Advisors released the results of its Gold ETF Impact Study, which was designed to better understand investor attitudes and behaviors around investing in gold. According to the research, 20% of U.S. investors currently have gold in their portfolios. Among these investors, the average gold allocation is 14% of portfolio assets and nearly half (47%) hold gold ETFs.Story continues""With recession risk still looming, the allure of gold as an investment in today’s market environment continues to be very strong,"" said Milling-Stanley. ""Year-to-date, SPDR gold ETFs have attracted over $2 billion of inflows, which is a testament to the unique attributes of the asset class and the accessibility, transparency, and cost effectiveness of the ETF wrapper."" 3According to the study, among investors who invest in gold, more than half are likely to increase their investment in the next 6-12 months, with the percentage of investors in gold ETFs (57%) slightly outweighing investors who may also hold other types of gold assets (e.g. bars and coins, gold mining stocks, commodity funds etc.) at 53%.Millennials Have Bigger Appetite for Gold Than Generation X or Boomers, Despite Education WoesNotably, Millennials have a bigger appetite for gold than Generation X or Boomers. On average, Millennials (17%) have a higher percentage of gold in their investment portfolio than Gen X and Boomers (10% each).More Millennials than Gen X and Boomers agree that gold ETFs are the best way to invest in gold (69% versus 35% and 55% respectively).The survey also revealed that 80% of all investors believe gold will always have monetary value but only 41% say they understand what influences its price. Comparatively, of investors with gold in their portfolios, the majority (75%) say they understand the variables impacting its price.""Our Gold ETF Impact Survey indicates there is still significant room for more investor education about the benefits of gold and the role it can play in a portfolio,"" said Milling-Stanley. ""As the entire gold industry continues to improve the education around how to invest in gold and the portfolio benefits it can provide, we expect to see growth in gold investment demand.""What’s Attracting Investors to Gold ETFs?As for perceptions about gold’s impact on investment performance, nearly nine in ten gold investors (88%) feel gold is a long-term, strategic investment.Furthermore, approximately three in four gold ETF investors (73%) say the holding improved the performance of their investment portfolio, with three-fourths saying ETFs are a more cost effective way to invest in gold.Gold investors who participated in the study felt that the primary benefits of owning the precious metal are its potential to maintain/increase in value during an economic downturn (68%), diversification (67%), and its role as a hedge against inflation (67%).For investors familiar with gold ETFs, 60% believe gold ETFs are the best way to invest in the commodity. The three key perceived benefits of gold ETFs that rise to the top are:Convenience (90%)Ability to gain from price fluctuations without having to buy/sell physical gold (89%)Gold ETFs are an investor-friendly product (85%)""Our study found that investors holding gold ETFs are more likely to be optimistic about their financial future (83%) than those who do not (73%),"" said Milling-Stanley. ""Gold ETFs have proven to be resilient during times of market turbulence. We expect the three Rs of rates, recession and risk to be key drivers for gold prices and investor demand this year.""For more on SPDR’s forecast for gold, read our 2023 Midyear Gold Outlook.About State Street Global Advisors Gold ETF Impact Survey, March – April 2023State Street Global Advisors, in partnership with A2Bplanning and Prodege, conducted an online survey among individual investors in the US.

To better understand the motivation behind targeting these stalwarts, a baseball analogy may be helpful.Some of the best clubs in Major League Baseball enjoy prolonged success thanks to their work in scouting out prospects. However, rearing young players from single-A ball to enter the big show – not even talking about making significant contributions – is a time-consuming and speculative effort. That’s the market equivalent of acquiring the small caps, which is a completely different proposition from high-growth blue-chip stocks.With blue chips ready for a rebound, we’re talking about clubs acquiring proven contributors, either through trades or free-agency acquisition. Under this approach, teams will not usually receive the greatest magnitude of returns. However, they will increase their chances of amassing wins throughout the season via steady contributions from the acquired players. Even better, sometimes great ballplayers can suffer slumps. It’s the same with the market. By requiring top rebounding blue-chip stocks to buy, investors can potentially net significant returns.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Home Depot (HD)a bull next to a stack of blue gambling chips to represent blue-chip stocks, blue-chip stocks to buySource: ShutterstockPractically the go-to name for home improvement projects, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) stands among the giants of blue-chip stocks to buy. Featuring a market capitalization of just above $303 billion, HD underlines a well-recognized brand. However, the market doesn’t really care, with shares losing almost 5% since the beginning of this year.Still, astute investors may be able to pick up a compelling discount among the top rebounding blue-chip stocks to buy. First, data from Gurufocus indicates that HD lands between 5% to 15% above its 52-week low, thus representing a relative discount. On the financial side, Home Depot represents an overlooked growth engine. No, it’s not some sexy quantum computing firm. However, on a per-share basis, it sports a three-year revenue growth rate of 15.2%, above 76.5% of its peers. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period impresses at 16.7%. Thus, it’s worthy of consideration for blue chips ready for a rebound.Story continuesBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: AbbVie (ABBV)blue chip definition highlightedSource: ShutterstockA pharmaceutical firm, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) is no stranger to lists covering blue-chip stocks to buy, many of which I penned. Carrying a market cap of $244.6 billion, it more than meets the requirement of a blue-chip enterprise. Unfortunately for stakeholders at the moment, the market doesn’t care. Since the January opener, ABBV slipped nearly 15% in equity value.Like Home Depot above and the other high-growth blue-chip stocks on this list, ABBV lands between 5% to 15% above its 52-week low. More specifically, in the trailing one-year period, it’s down more than 3%. Still, investors may be overlooking AbbVie’s acquisition of Botox and its underlying relevancy. Basically, with more workers forced to return to the office, products specializing in enhancing looks should rise in demand.On a financial note, market participants also may be ignoring AbbVie’s growth narrative. Using data from Gurufocus, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate (again, on a per-share basis) clocks in at 13.4%. That’s above 71.84% of its peers, making ABBV a strong candidate for blue-chip stocks to regain market momentum.Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Pfizer (PFE)a pile of blue chips on top of a newspaperSource: ShutterstockA multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology firm, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) also frequently made prior lists focused on blue-chip stocks to buy. Carrying a market cap of over $226 billion, Pfizer dramatically inserted itself into the public discourse with the Covid-19 vaccine. However, because of fading fears of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, investors quickly abandoned PFE. Since the start of the year, shares tumbled nearly 22%.While the red ink is certainly understandable, it might also make Pfizer one of the top rebounding blue-chip stocks to consider. True, Covid-19 may no longer be the public health crisis that it once was. At the same time, fading relevance for one use of the underlying messenger-RNA technology doesn’t mean that Pfizer can’t leverage the acumen for other uses.More importantly, the financial data suggests that astute investors should keep tabs on PFE. While recent quarterly data isn’t exactly encouraging because of the fading Covid-19 story, its three-year revenue growth rate still pings at 34.4%. Also, the market prices PFE at a forward multiple of 12, which is quite undervalued. Thus, it might be one of the blue chips ready for a rebound.Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO)10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow UpSource: ShutterstockAs a manufacturer and distributor of scientific and medical equipment, Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) may represent a boring entity for some folks. Sure enough, since the beginning of this year, TMO slipped about 3%. However, the company carries significant influence in the broader healthcare sector, with a market cap of over $207 billion. Given its everyday relevance, TMO is a top idea among blue-chip stocks to buy.To be fair, Thermo Fisher hasn’t delivered compelling results in the charts. Nevertheless, it’s a business built for the long haul. By undergirding the biotech and pharmaceutical industries, Thermo almost guarantees that it will keep its name at the forefront. Regarding its financial profile, Thermo benefits from a robust three-year revenue growth rate of 21.6%, beating out 70.3% of its peers. Also, its EBITDA growth rate comes in at 20.2%, above 60.62% of the competition. Finally, Thermo is a consistently profitable enterprise. Combined with its trailing-year net margin of 13.75%, TMO belongs on your radar of high-growth blue-chip stocks to buy.Infosys (INFY)Source: ShutterstockAn Indian multinational information technology firm, Infosys (NYSE:INFY) might not be the most recognizable name (for American investors) among blue-chip stocks to buy. Nevertheless, the company earns the distinction. At the moment, it commands a market cap of almost $67 billion. However, the market hasn’t been enthused about the IT space. Since the Jan. opener, INFY slipped over 13%.It’s also an underperformer against the trailing-year framework, shedding almost 16%. Still, it’s possible that with shares rising since late April of this year, INFY may have hit a bottom. It’s no guarantee but if you want to speculate on blue-chip stocks to regain market momentum, INFY represents a “leveraged” opportunity of sorts. Looking at the financials, Infosys features a three-year revenue growth rate of 17%, beating out 70% of players in the software industry. As well, it enjoys consistent profitability with an impressive trailing-year net margin of 16.38%. As a bonus, the market prices INFY at a forward multiple of only 20.49. That’s conspicuously below the sector median stat of 26.32 times.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Source: ShutterstockArguably one of the most credible blue-chip stocks to buy on discount, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) engages in hydrocarbon exploration. Currently, the company carries a market cap of over $52 billion, which may be on the smaller side compared to other entities on this list. Nevertheless, it deserves plenty of respect for its practical relevance to the overall economy. Still, the market doesn’t care, sending OXY down nearly 5% since the January opener.Against the trailing-year comparison, OXY gained only half a percent, which seems ludicrous. True, many consumers may be transitioning to electric vehicles. Also, the Federal Reserve’s efforts to curb inflation appear to have gained some momentum. However, with more workers returning to the office, demand for hydrocarbons should blossom. After all, most drivers continue to operate combustion-powered vehicles.On the financials, Occidental posts a better-than-average three-year revenue growth rate of 12.3%. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same frame lands at 33.1%, outpacing 72.38% of its peers. Combined with the aforementioned fundamental catalyst, OXY could be a candidate for top rebounding blue-chip stocks.PayPal (PYPL)Source: ShutterstockStanding within the spectrum of high-risk, high-reward blue-chip stocks to buy, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) presents an awfully compelling narrative. A digital payments processor and overall financial technology (fintech) specialist, PayPal carries tremendous brand awareness. In addition, it sports a market cap of just over $74 billion. Unfortunately, skyrocketing inflation that began in late 2021 and early 2022 sharply crimped PayPal’s business.Unlike other tech plays, however, PYPL simply failed to recover. So far this year, shares tumbled nearly 11%. In the past 365 days, they gave up more than 8% of equity value. Fundamentally, PayPal suffers from challenges impacting the consumer economy. Also, the fintech space has become incredibly competitive.Nevertheless, PayPal can still bank on its brand power, making it a possible candidate for blue chips ready for a rebound. Additionally, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate clocks in at 16.7%, outflanking 75.2% of its peers. Also, its book growth rate during the same frame comes in at 7.4%, above 60.65% of the competition.HDHome Depot$301.75ABBVAbbVie$138.65PFEPfizer$39.62TMOThermo Fisher$527.41INFYInfosys$15.70OXYOccidental Petroleum$57.13PYPLPayPal$69.12On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Many first-generation Latinos are dependent on the youngest members of their family to communicate in English. Of adult first-generation Latinos, 23% say they can carry on a conversation in English very well. That number increases with each following generation, leaving the crucial task of translating in the hands of the youngest members of families. 1""Translators,"" will screen during the Tribeca Festival on June 13, after the film made its worldwide debut at the Los Angeles Latino International Film Festival. The documentary short film delivers an emotional, first-person look at the lives of three of these immigrant families and the important role that young translators play in everyday lives of older generations.Directed by Emmy-award winning filmmaker Rudy Valdez, the documentary short film follows the stories of three immigrant children (Densel - 11, Harye - 13 and Virginia - 16) who are responsible for handling complex adult conversations and helping to make decisions beyond their years. The impactful film highlights the need to provide resources to Hispanic and Latino communities to eliminate barriers for non-English speaking adults and provide support in closing language and opportunity gaps.""It was incredibly important to share this story with audiences as it is a topic close to my heart and something I've seen firsthand,"" said film director Rudy Valdez. ""I hope viewers gain a deeper understanding and empathy toward the challenges faced by immigrant families, especially their children, through this film.""""Translators"" is produced by Park Pictures in partnership with U.S. Bank, as part of the U.S. Bank Access Commitment™ , the bank's long-term approach to help close the racial wealth gap which includes making banking more accessible to everyone through new digital tools, resources and community engagement. Recently, U.S. Bank launched Asistente Inteligente, the first Spanish language virtual banking assistant digital experience in the United States, enabling Spanish-speaking customers to bank however, whenever, and wherever is best for them.Story continues""With over 41 million Spanish-speaking people in this country, we were inspired to look deeper into the experiences of customers to understand and connect with them and were very moved by this experience shared by so many families,"" said U.S. Bank Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Diversity Officer, Greg Cunningham. ""Through the work of Access Commitment, we are focused on wealth building and part of that for the Hispanic community is access - access to capital, resources, and opportunity. We know that language is access. It lets the community know that we see you and understand what's important to you. Through this documentary, we hope to connect with and bring more visibility and access to families across the country who are going through the same experience.""The powerful film will be introduced during the Tribeca Festival by Grammy Award winning singer and actress Leslie Grace, who signed on to the project as Documentary Ambassador.""Growing up first generation Dominican American in New York and Florida, I was a young translator for elders in my family, so I am proud to be a part of this project,"" said Grace. ""Creating such a grounded documentary like ‘Translators' as Rudy Valdez has done is so important because it allows organizations like U.S. Bank to generate awareness around the shared experience of these 11 million translators across the nation. Additionally, it opens the door for other companies and organizations to develop tools and resources that will help alleviate the burden of the younger generation as they assimilate along with their families.""For the trailer and more information on ""Translators"" and how to view the film following its premiere, please visit www.TranslatorsFilm.com.1 According to Pew Research CenterAbout U.S. BankU.S. Bancorp, with approximately 77,000 employees and $682 billion in assets as of March 31, 2023, is the parent company of U.S. Bank National Association.

Grainger and Novartis",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-com-featured-highlights-toll-083300929.html,1687768380,STORY,"['NOVN.SW', 'WMT', 'GWW', 'CAT', 'TOL', 'NVS']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – June 26, 2023 – Stocks in this week’s article are Toll Brothers TOL, Walmart Inc. WMT, Caterpillar Inc. CAT, W.W. Grainger Inc. GWW and Novartis NVS.5 Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy for Gains in the 2nd HalfWall Street has been roaring higher lately, driven by an AI-fueled rally and a pause in interest rates hike. However, the Fed’s hawkish stance for the rest of the year could again take the shine away from equities. Additionally, global slowdown concerns and geopolitical uncertainty remain. Amid such a scenario, dividend investing seems the best choice as it offers consistent and safe income.Though the strategy does not offer dramatic price appreciation, it is a major source of consistent income for investors in any market. In particular, focusing on the growth level in this strategy leads to higher returns. Stocks with a strong history of year-over-year dividend growth form a healthy portfolio, with a greater scope of capital appreciation, as opposed to simple dividend-paying stocks or those with high yields.We have selected five dividend growth stocks — Toll Brothers, Walmart Inc., Caterpillar Inc., W.W. Grainger Inc. and Novartis — that could be compelling picks heading into the second half.Dividend Growth: Why a Win Strategy?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Story continuesAlthough these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included.Here are the five of the 12 stocks that fit the bill:Pennsylvania-based Toll Brothers builds single-family detached and attached home communities, master-planned luxury residential resort-style golf communities, and urban low, mid, and high-rise communities, principally on the land it develops and improves. TOL saw solid earnings estimate revision of $1.95 over the past 30 days for the fiscal year (ending October 2023) and has an expected earnings growth rate of 6.7%Toll Brothers has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of B. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Arkansas-based Walmart has evolved from being just a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer into an omnichannel player. It is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units worldwide. The company saw positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the fiscal year (ending January 2024) and delivered an average earnings surprise of 12.03% for the past four quarters.Presently, WMT has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B.Illinois-based Caterpillar is the largest global construction and mining equipment manufacturer. The company has an estimated earnings growth rate of 28.03% for this year and delivered an average earnings surprise of 14.27% for the past four quarters.Caterpillar has a Zacks Rank #1 and Growth Score of B.Illinois-based W.W. Grainger is a broad-line, business-to-business distributor of maintenance, repair and operating products and services. The company saw solid earnings estimate revision of 30 cents over the past 30 days for this year and has an estimated growth rate of 20.8%.GWW has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of A.Switzerland-based Novartis has one of the strongest and broadest portfolios of oncology drugs and generics, which has enabled it to maintain its dominant position as a top pharma company over the years. The company saw solid earnings estimate revision of 7 cents over the past 30 days for this year and has an estimated earnings growth rate of 10.5%.At present, NVS has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B.You can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

26,2fe8f043-0e35-48c2-8f5c-623593110d19,WMT,2023-06-27,"Amazon may be the largest US retailer in 2024, according to JPMorgan analysts",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-may-be-the-largest-us-retailer-in-2024-according-to-jpmorgan-analysts-140145529.html,1687701705,STORY,"['AMZN', 'WMT']","[Amazon (AMZN) is set to hit a major milestone in 2024: Becoming the largest retailer in the US, according to JPMorgan analysts Doug Anmuth and Bryan M. Smilek.If this comes to pass, Amazon will be unseating Walmart (WMT) as the country's largest retailer. It would be a seismic shift, one driven by increased e-commerce penetration, faster delivery times, and the stickiness of Amazon Prime. JPMorgan estimates show that, in 2023, Amazon's gross merchandise volume, or GMV, will grow 11.6% year-over-over to $477 billion.This kind of growth shows the sort of resilience that Wall Street has been hoping to see out of e-commerce businesses, which had a tough 2022. Though e-commerce businesses like Amazon saw major booms during the pandemic, last year saw a pullback. It was the first year since 2009 that US e-commerce grew less than 10%, the analysts noted, adding just 8.5% year-over-year, ""likely driven by macro pressures, the resurgence of [brick-and-mortar] retailers, and the shift toward omnichannel retail following the pandemic,"" Anmuth and Smilek wrote on June 20.This year, Amazon's GMV is growing due to ""solid growth in under-penetrated categories"" like grocery and apparel, ""faster delivery speeds, with 2023 tracking toward Amazon’s fastest delivery speeds ever,"" and the ""Prime flywheel,"" the idea that the company's much-discussed subscription service builds momentum at every step in the experience, the analysts wrote.Amazon's e-commerce business will also benefit from increased business-to-business capabilities, new fintech offerings like Buy With Prime, and estimated growth in the number of third-party sellers operating in the company's marketplace, they added.JPMorgan estimates that there will be about 300 million Prime members globally by the end of this year. In 2021, then-CEO Jeff Bezos said the company had ""more than 200 million Prime members worldwide.""Story continuesAmazon also has a massive grip on the e-commerce marketplace and, at the end of 2023, JPMorgan analysts expect the company's e-commerce market share to be 42.2%, an increase of 106 basis points year-over-year.View of delivery vans at Amazon Hub in North Las Vegas (DeeCee Carter/MediaPunch /IPX) (DeeCee Carter/MediaPunch/IPx)JPMorgan's bullishness on Amazon also ties back to the belief that the company will leverage generative AI in its e-commerce operations, suggesting that a ""ChatGPT-style product search would create an interactive conversational experience"" which the analysts believe would ""enable Amazon other retailers to provide a more personalized customer experience"" and that AI could also ""could enable Amazon and other retailers to leverage a breadth of customer purchase history and data and enhance personalized recommendations.""Big tech government scrutinyThere's a catch, however: in recent months, so-called ""big tech"" companies, Amazon included, are seeing increased scrutiny from the federal government. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said he is investigating what he called Amazon's ""abysmal safety record"" and, though it's far from the first time Sanders has gone after Amazon, it's certainly one of the most formal, and is unlikely to be the last.Additionally, last week the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sued Amazon, alleging that the company has been tricking customers into signing up for Amazon Prime and making it harder to cancel those subscriptions. The lawsuit is the byproduct of an FTC investigation that began back in 2021. For Amazon, it's a gut-punch of a lawsuit, alleging that the company violated several consumer protection laws and that the court should issue an injunction to stop Amazon's Prime subscription practices.This new Amazon lawsuit comes on the heels of FTC actions against many of tech's biggest names, including Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Apple (APPL).Allie Garfinkle is a Senior Tech Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

One way to find winning stocks based on your preferred way of investing is to use the Zacks Style Scores, which are indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing types: value, growth, and momentum.Why Investors Should Pay Attention to This Value StockDifferent than growth or momentum investors, value-focused investors are all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under what their true value is before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, and Price/Cash Flow to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.Nordstrom (JWN)Founded in 1901 as a retail shoe business, and headquartered in Seattle, Washington, Nordstrom Inc. is a leading fashion specialty retailer in the United States. The company offers an extensive selection of both branded and private-label merchandise, which are positioned in the upscale segment of the industry.JWN boasts a Value Style Score of A and VGM Score of A, and holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating. Shares of Nordstrom are trading at a forward earnings multiple of 9.1X, as well as a PEG Ratio of 2.5, a Price/Cash Flow ratio of 2.5X, and a Price/Sales ratio of 0.2X.A company's earnings performance is important for value investors as well. For fiscal 2024, five analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for JWN, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.05 to $2.01 per share. JWN also holds an average earnings surprise of 54.1%.With strong valuation and earnings metrics, a good Zacks Rank, and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, investors should strongly think about adding JWN to their portfolios.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

29,40859e58-0ccf-31df-a4fc-2273cfd52a7f,JWN,2023-06-27,3 Best Stocks to Sell Before the Next Recession,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-best-stocks-sell-next-140019363.html,1687269619,STORY,"['JWN', 'WYNN', 'COP']","[The bears have been calling for a recession since mid-2021, citing the unnatural shift post-pandemic in monetary policy and the lack of production to support the stimulus-induced demand. If you go by the book, much of that has already come true. We have had two quarters of negative GDP growth and high inflation worldwide due to a shortage of tangible goods. The bulls use this as evidence that the worst is behind us. Most economists, however, believe that smart investors should always be on the lookout for stocks to sell. While a recession is not likely in 2023, the probability of it happening spikes to 68% by April 2024. The Federal Reserve has noted in its latest meeting that although they have paused for now, they are still considering two more rate hikes later this year. Even if that’s all bark and no bite, the economy still needs to digest the record increase in interest rates in the last one and a half years.Of course, that does not mean you should completely ignore the opportunities in the market. Many stocks still offer great value and upside potential with little downside risk. However, staying cautious of businesses in recession-prone sectors is critical when headwinds start brewing.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHere are three stocks to sell:Nordstrom (JWN)A Nordstrom (JWN) storefront in Toronto, Canada.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comNordstrom (NYSE:JWN) has been losing sales and market share for years, and its debt load is unsustainable. The company has no competitive edge or growth potential and faces fierce competition from online and specialty retailers.Nordstrom’s revenue fell by 10.87% year-over-year to $3.18 billion in its latest reported quarter. The company’s losses widened to $205 million, or $1.28 per share, compared to a loss of $20 million, or $0.11 per share, in the same quarter last year. The net margin here is also negative in the negatives at -6.44%, which isn’t a promising metric for a “luxury” brand. Nordstrom’s main selling point is its customer service and shopping experience, but these are not enough to justify its premium prices and lower margins. The company has tried to differentiate itself by offering services like personal styling, curbside pickup and local market strategy, but these have not been enough to attract or retain customers.Story continuesNordstrom’s debt is another major concern for me. The company has some $4.5 billion in debt compared to just $581 million in cash. With so much cash burn, it is heavily reliant on debt to finance its operations and should headwinds get tougher, JWN will be in a very dangerous position.Thus, it is one of the top stocks to sell in my book. Hedge funds, insiders and Wall Street analysts unanimously agree that there is little opportunity here. It has had 8 “Hold” and 5 “Sell” ratings with zero “Buy” ratings.Wynn Resorts (WYNN)Casino stocks in Macau, China. Wynn Macau is a luxury hotel and casino resort operated by international resort developer Wynn Resorts. Casino Lisboa is owned by the STDM built in 1970.Source: Richie Chan / Shutterstock.comWynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) might’ve been a “wynner” so far this year, but it is time to dial back on this stock before it reverses course. Indeed, a lot of people would disagree with me here as we are amidst a travel boom, but I’d reiterate that this list is primarily for recession-prone stocks. Wynn is one pick that stands out among travel stocks as it still has big caveats to account for regardless of the recession catalyst.Wynn Resorts has $13.9 billion in total debt and a large chunk of that is floating rate. As Todd Shriber points out, the excessive leverage here can lead to this stock being “vulnerable in a recession.” One of my major concerns here is that Wynn is still not profitable (on a TTM basis) despite the recent travel boom unlike many of its peers. The quarterly profits it did manage are a hair above 0 at $32 million in Q4 and $12 million in Q1. With $1.4 billion in sales last quarter, it needs more profitability to offset the debt caveat. The 41 forward price-to-earnings multiple also means it’s richly priced in this range.ConocoPhillips (COP)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comRegarding stocks to sell, the energy industry is one that is often hit the hardest during a recession. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is one you should dump right now due to its rich valuation and bad financial metrics ahead. The price of natural gas has plunged and crude oil is also not in a good position right now. The company’s revenue has plunged by nearly 20% YoY in the last reported quarter and profits declined by almost 50% YoY. This is yet to be reflected in the share price as COP trades at very elevated levels with a forward P/E ratio of 11 times.Looking further, analysts expect sales to continue shrinking through 2025, and 2025 EPS is expected to be lower than what it is now at $8.95 vs $9.63 now. With abysmal growth potential and a rich valuation, even GuruFocus, a very bullish analysis tool, sets the fair price at $90 by 2026!On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the manufacturing sector, head directly to 5 Best Manufacturing Stocks To Buy Now. In 2022, the manufacturing industry remained resilient, and while this year also experienced record demand and production levels, the short-term outlook is not rosy. This is due to the unstable macro environment and uncharted inflation rates, which are destroying growth pace in the sector. Complex issues persist in the manufacturing sector, including supply chain bottlenecks, inventory and logistics backlogs, skyrocketing costs, and cybersecurity breaches. According to Deloitte, there are five crucial trends that will shape the global manufacturing industry in 2023. First, ongoing investments in complex manufacturing technologies will increase productivity and resilience in the manufacturing sector. Second, manufacturers are working hard to address the high workforce turnover and looking to keep their employees onboard with improved talent retention methods. Moreover, manufacturers are alleviating supply chain constraints by shifting to just-in-case inventory strategies and sourcing raw materials locally. Some manufacturers are even creating in-house raw materials to mitigate unforeseen shortages. In addition to that, manufacturers are digitally transforming their plants and factories by making their operations smart or creating a metaverse platform for their products and services. Manufacturers are also working hard to keep their environmental, social, and governance commitments. Another emerging trend in the manufacturing sector is Supply Chain 4.0, which refers to supply chain management that is led by trailblazing technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and big data analytics. This helps revolutionize logistics, supply chains, and production by optimizing costs, increasing efficiency, promoting innovation, and staying ahead of the competition. Story continuesDon't Miss: Top 20 Manufacturing Countries in the WorldJay Timmons, President and CEO of The National Association of Manufacturers, described the manufacturing outlook for this year and commented on January 5, 2023: “The majority of manufacturers expect a recession this year. Congress failed to act on essential tax reforms, which complicates investment, increases inflationary pressures and could stifle economic growth. Much needed permitting reforms and provisions to strengthen our ability to conduct research and development, buy machinery and finance job-creating investments — which we need to promote growth within the sector — were left on the cutting room floor last year. Those reforms, combined with manufacturers’ ongoing efforts to inspire, educate and empower the future workforce, are critical to our competitiveness.”According to Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s Elon Musk, while it is great how many entrepreneurs are entering the tech and software industry, he believes the heavy industry presents significant opportunities. Musk recently stated that there is a scarcity of skilled workforce in the manufacturing and heavy industries.

(NYSE:CAT), smart investors are piling into Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) for exposure to the manufacturing sector.Here is what Stewart Asset Management has to say about Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We also need to point out one global consequence of the rapid rise in interest rates: an irrepressibly strong dollar. This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Others sell goods that are priced in dollars such as Parker-Hannifin’s (NYSE:PH) aerospace products.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Manufacturing Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:Top 16 Medicine Producing Countries in the World15 Best Large-Cap Value Stocks To Buy25 Part-time Retirement Jobs that Pay Well Disclosure: None. 12 Best Manufacturing Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The stock outpaced the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.45%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.04%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 3.58%.Heading into today, shares of the chipmaker had gained 4.66% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 7.46% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 5.01% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Microchip Technology as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, Microchip Technology is projected to report earnings of $1.64 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 19.71%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $2.29 billion, up 16.55% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $6.23 per share and revenue of $8.81 billion, which would represent changes of +3.49% and +4.45%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Microchip Technology. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. Microchip Technology is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Investors should also note Microchip Technology's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 13.15. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 17.99.Story continuesWe can also see that MCHP currently has a PEG ratio of 0.78. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.7 based on yesterday's closing prices.The Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector.

Those companies have shunned Africa in recent years in favour of investment in the U.S. shale patch and in prolific giant oilfields elsewhere such as offshore Brazil and Guyana.In May, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait's share of total OPEC production was over 10% higher than it was 15 years ago at 55%, according to OPEC production figures. Nigeria and Angola's total share over the same period has shrunk by over 3% to below 9%.For Nigeria, ""capacity continues to be restricted by operational and security issues, combined with low investment levels, leading to decline,"" analysts at consultancy Wood Mackenzie said.New field developments and recent discoveries in Angola will not be enough to stem long term capacity declines, they added.Story continuesIn contrast, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have plans in place to significantly boost their production capacity to 13 million bpd and 5 million bpd, respectively, by 2027 from current levels of about 12 and 4 million.Fellow Gulf producer Kuwait on June 18 said it would boost its production capacity by 200,000 bpd by 2025 to reach 3 million bpd.Capacity additions from the three Gulf countries over the 2020-2025 period total a combined 1.2 million bpd, double the capacity that Nigeria and Angola are projected to lose over the same period, Reuters calculations find.The two West African countries have lost nearly a quarter of their production capacity since 2019 as a result of underinvestment and security issues.QUOTA OVERHAULAt its June 4 meeting, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, led by Russia, (OPEC+) overhauled production quotas for the majority of its members.""In the final analysis what this agreement will achieve for all of us is that those who invest, not this year, but the years to come, '24 and '25 and moving forward, there will be a recognition for their investment,"" Prince Abdulaziz said.One OPEC+ source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the overhaul was needed to create a fairer system that better reflects the reality of member countries' production capacity.While the majority of members of OPEC+ got a lower production target, the UAE's was higher.Richard Bronze, Head of Geopolitics at Energy Aspects, said one of the reasons behind the change was to address OPEC's previous credibility issues when policy changes were not necessarily reflected on oil markets.""It meant that the actual supply increase or decrease resulting for a quota change would be far smaller than the announced figure, fuelling doubts in the market about the ability of the group to manage market fundamentals,"" he said.(Reporting by Ahmad Ghaddar; editing by Barbara Lewis)]"

Concerns over slowing economic growth and high inflation have continued to play their part too. Despite investor skepticism associated with these macro challenges, fortunately, there are certain companies that have held up better than others. We believe Cheniere Energy, APA Corporation, Northern Oil and Gas and Evolution Petroleum should be able to weather the current environment and drive future returns based on their operating efficiencies.About the IndustryThe Zacks Oil and Gas - US E&amp;P industry consists of companies primarily based in the domestic market, focused on the exploration and production (E&amp;P) of oil and natural gas. These firms find hydrocarbon reservoirs, drill oil and gas wells, and produce and sell these materials to be refined later into products such as gasoline, fuel oil, distillate, etc.The economics of oil and gas supply and demand is the fundamental driver of this industry. In particular, a producer’s cash flow is primarily determined by the realized commodity prices. In fact, all E&amp;P companies' results are vulnerable to historically volatile prices in the energy markets. A change in realizations affects their returns and causes them to alter their production growth rates. The E&amp;P operators are also exposed to exploration risks where drilling results are comparatively uncertain.3 Key Investing Trends to Watch in the Oil and Gas - US E&amp;P IndustryProducers Struggle With Low Commodity Prices: Energy remains the worst S&amp;P 500 sector this year. The space has witnessed a total return of (9.7%) in 2023 so far against the S&amp;P 500’s gain of around 13.3%. Even Saudi Arabia’s surprise decision to slash output by an additional one million barrels per day from next month could not spur “black gold.”Story continuesWith investors dumping risky assets in the wake of concerns about a slowing global economy, oil has broken below the $70 threshold on more than one occasion. It’s not any different for natural gas. The fuel slumped to a 25-year low in June 2020 but hit $10 per MMBtu for the first time since 2008 in August last year. Now, it is trading below $3, on the expectation of comfortable temperatures and, therefore, lighter heating or cooling demand.Persistent Inflation: Most U.S. energy upstream companies have been experiencing rising costs in the form of increased expenses related to maintenance and inventory. The inflationary environment, together with supply-chain tightness, is not only pushing costs higher but also affecting their capital programs. Apart from being hard to ignore, escalation in expenses is drowning out the benefits of any commodity price increase. In our view, the inflation-associated headwinds will continue to challenge growth and margin numbers with little chance of a quick resolution. This may lead to a rough road for oil/gas equities. In particular, worries about weaker energy demand due to the threat of recession might jeopardize the commodity’s ascent.Notable Shareholder Returns: The sharp increase in crude prices last year allowed the upstream operators to deliver a solid financial performance. In particular, cash from operations is on a sustainable path, with revenues improving and companies slashing capital expenditures from the pre-pandemic levels amid higher commodity realizations. To put it simply, the environment of strong prices in 2022 helped the E&amp;P firms to generate significant “excess cash,” which they intend to use to boost investor returns. In fact, more and more energy companies are allocating their increasing cash pile by way of dividends and buybacks to pacify the long-suffering shareholders.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bearish OutlookThe Zacks Oil and Gas - US E&amp;P industry is a 41-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #220, which places it in the bottom 12% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates challenging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are becoming pessimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. While the industry’s earnings estimates for 2023 have gone down 45.4% in the past year, the same for 2024 have fallen 26%.Despite the dim near-term prospects of the industry, we will present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio. But it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation first.Industry Underperforms S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Zacks Oil and Gas - US E&amp;P industry has fared worse than the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite as well as the broader Zacks Oil – Energy sector over the past year.The industry has gone down 12% over this period compared with the broader sector’s increase of 1.2%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 11.4%.Industry's Current ValuationSince oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt. For capital-intensive companies, EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of noncash expenses.On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 4.44X, significantly lower than the S&amp;P 500’s 13.2X. It is, however, above the sector’s trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA of 2.74X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 15.45X, as low as 2.95X, with a median of 5.84X.4 Stocks to Watch ForEvolution Petroleum: Founded in 2003, Evolution Petroleum is an independent upstream operator engaged in the exploration, development and production of onshore oil and natural gas properties in the United States. Headquartered in Houston, TX, EPM is focused on the non-operated working interests in high-quality, long-life reserves in several properties across the nation. Evolution Petroleum is known for its prioritisation of maximizing shareholder returns through buybacks and dividends.EPM beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters and missed in the other. The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 38.4%, on average. Evolution Petroleum’s shares have gained 34.1% in a year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Northern Oil and Gas: Northern Oil and Gas’ core operations are focused on three leading basins of the United States — the Williston, Permian and the Appalachian. The upstream operator employs a unique nonoperating business model, which helps it to keep costs down and increase free cash flow. Prioritizing returns to investors, NOG pays a 37 cents per share quarterly base dividend following a 9% hike recently.Carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), the 2023 Zacks Consensus Estimate for Northern Oil and Gas indicates 27.1% earnings per share growth over 2022. NOG shares have gained 16.4% in a year.APA Corporation: APA’s large geographically diversified reserve base and high-quality drilling inventory should guarantee multi-year production growth. The company’s increased focus on the Permian basin, known for its low cost and high internal rates of return, is another key driver. APA’ slew of discoveries in offshore Suriname, through its joint venture with TotalEnergies, is another positive catalyst for the company.APA beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters and met in the other. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 6.7%, on average. APA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Meanwhile, The energy explorer has seen its shares lose 13.1% in a year.Cheniere Energy: Being the first company to receive regulatory approval to export LNG from its 2.6 billion cubic feet per day Sabine Pass terminal, Cheniere Energy certainly enjoys a distinct competitive advantage. The company is primed for significant revenue and earnings growth on the back of solid operations and long-term contracts.Cheniere Energy has a projected earnings growth rate of 452% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this #3 Ranked natural gas exporter’s 2023 earnings has been revised 89.8% upward over the past 60 days. LNG shares have gained 13.4% in a year.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

(NYSE:CRM) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Salesforce The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At SalesforceOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Co-Founder, Marc Benioff, for US$105m worth of shares, at about US$211 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$207. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.Salesforce insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Salesforce Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Salesforce. In total, Co-Founder Marc Benioff dumped US$105m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesDoes Salesforce Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Salesforce insiders own 3.1% of the company, currently worth about US$6.3b based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Salesforce Tell Us?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Salesforce. At Simply Wall St, we found 3 warning signs for Salesforce that deserve your attention before buying any shares.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

51,aed2b38c-7269-37ef-bef7-1b52c1d631b6,FLS,2023-06-27,Danaher (DHR) Shares Decline 10% YTD: What's Pulling It Down?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/danaher-dhr-shares-decline-10-152800305.html,1687793280,STORY,"['DHR', 'GGG', 'FLS']","[Shares of Danaher Corporation DHR have lost 10.2% in the year-to-date period compared with the industry’s 4.5% decline. The downside can be attributed primarily to a decline in demand for COVID-related products. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research What’s Ailing the Stock?Danaher is plagued by weakness in the Biotechnology and Diagnostics segments due to a decrease in the sale of COVID-related products. In the Diagnostics segment, revenues declined 10% year over year in the first quarter due to lower COVID-related respiratory testing volumes. In the Biotechnology segment, revenues fell 16% year over year. Due to lower demand for COVID-19 testing, vaccine and therapeutics, Danaher expects total core revenues to decline in the high single digits for the second quarter and the full year.Escalating cost of sales poses a threat to Danaher’s bottom line. The company’s cost of sales increased 8.9% year over year in 2022 due to inflation in raw material costs. Logistics problems and high freight costs have been weighing on the company’s operations. Despite the improvement, supply chain issues remain a major challenge for the company.Given Danaher’s substantial international operations, it is exposed to headwinds arising from unfavorable movements in foreign currencies. In 2022, foreign currency translation had a negative impact of 4% on sales. In the first quarter, the same had a negative impact of 3% on sales.What Lies Ahead for the Stock?With a slowdown in the manufacturing sector, thanks to the Federal Reserve’s aggressive monetary policy tightening to curtail inflation, industrial demand has taken a hit. Amid a volatile environment as recession fears loom large, a turnaround in the manufacturing sector is not likely anytime soon.With Danaher already grappling with weakness across its Biotechnology and Diagnostics segments, continued softness in manufacturing activities and the resultant impact on industrial demand pose a major challenge to the company. Given the company’s diverse operations, weakness in some end markets might be offset by strength across other end markets. Strong demand for advanced solutions and strength in the genomics consumables business within the Life Sciences segment should help the company partly offset the adversities.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderDanaher presently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked industrial companies are as follows:Ingersoll Rand IR presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Fallon/BloombergA senior Microsoft executive claimed the US tech giant could “spend Sony out of business” in the battle for control of the video games market, according to newly released emails.Microsoft, which designs the Xbox console, is fighting both British competition regulators and the US Federal Trade Commission which have sought to block its $69bn (£54bn) takeover of Call of Duty-maker Activision.The FTC has been in court to attempt to stop the deal over fears it will hurt competition in the video games market.Newly released emails revealed as part of the case showed that Microsoft executives had previously discussed ways to gain an upper hand over rival Sony. Matt Booty, the tech giant’s head of Xbox Games Studios, in 2019 had urged finance chief Tim Stuart to unleash billions of dollars in spending to put pressure on Sony’s position.Mr Booty said: “We (Microsoft) are in a very unique position to be able to go spend Sony out of business.” The comments were made two years before Microsoft launched a bid to acquire Activision.Sony, the Japanese tech company, has insisted the Microsoft takeover would result in it being barred from the lucrative Call of Duty action franchise. Microsoft has argued it would have no incentive to make the game exclusive to the Xbox.Mr Booty said: “In 10 years, we might look back and say, ‘Totally would have been worth it to lose $2bn to $3bn in 2020 to avoid a situation where Tencent, Google, Amazon or even Sony have become the Disney of games and own the most valuable content.”He added that “Sony is really the only other player who could compete” with Microsoft’s game streaming products.A Microsoft spokesman told The Verge website: “This email is three and a half years old and predates the announcement of our acquisition by 25 months.“It refers to industry trends we never pursued and is unrelated to the acquisition.”Activision has been hugely critical of the CMA’s decision to block the deal, claiming it shows that Britain is “closed for business”.Story continuesActivision’s chief executive, Bobby Kotick, has accused the CMA of being a “tool” of the FTC. The CMA has denied these claims.Further documents disclosed as part of the US court battle show Microsoft also looked to buy games maker Bungie, which developed several games for the popular Destiny games franchise, and Sega.Bungie was later bought by Sony in 2022 for $3.6bn.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Three dimensional inversion modelling and interpretation of the MAG survey and coincident gold-in-soil anomalies indicates that the gold bearing intrusive bodies present at surface and that host these intrusion-related gold deposits could be much larger than previously defined and appear to be part of a major, gold-enriched intrusive system that is connected at depth. The MAG survey and coincident geochemical data also demonstrates that the gold mineralized extensional corridor that spans across the Blackjack and Eiger gold deposits appears to be over 5 kilometres in length (see Figures 1 through 3).Key PointsSitka has compiled recently interpreted geophysical data from a high resolution airborne magnetic survey with geochemical data from drilling and surface sampling in the area hosting the Blackjack and Eiger gold deposits.3D modelling shows that intrusive rocks with known gold mineralization coincide with areas of higher magnetic susceptibility which are associated with the hornfels alteration zones caused by the emplacement of intrusive rocks (see Figures 1 and 2).Areas of higher magnetic susceptibility in the model extend well beyond current areas of defined gold mineralization and support previous interpretations of the geology in the Clear Creek area that suggest that the Saddle, Eiger, Josephine and Pukelman intrusions coalesce at depth (see Figure 3).Mag highs along with coincident geochemical data have significantly expanded the length of an extensional mineralized corridor from approximately 2 km to over 5 km that encompasses the Saddle, Eiger and Josephine intrusions. A similar extensional corridor that is associated with elevated geochemical data along the northern margin of the Pukelman intrusive stock (see Figures 1 and 2) remains untested.Gold mineralization along these expanded corridors appears to be much more extensive than previously considered.Story continuesFigure 1: Magnetic Susceptibility and Intrusive Stocks (CNW Group/Sitka Gold Corp.)""The results from this MAG survey have significantly expanded the size and scale of the intrusion-related gold system present at our Blackjack and Eiger gold deposits,"" stated Cor Coe, CEO and Director of Sitka Gold. ""The magnetic highs, as seen in Figures 1 and 3, appear to correlate well with the known intrusions identified on surface and show the potential of a massive intrusive body at depth that reaches the surface in several locations, including the Blackjack, Eiger, Pukelman, and Josephine intrusive stocks, which we believe may ultimately host a major gold system that connects the intrusives found at surface. This newly interpreted data also expands the mineralized corridor, which was previously represented by just the historical gold-in-soil anomalies and surface rock grab samples, to over 5 kms laterally from west of the Blackjack deposit to well beyond the Josephine Stock (see Figures 1 and 2). While the results from the resource expansion drilling program currently underway at the Blackjack deposit, where our latest results produced an interval of 0.74 g/t gold over the entire length of a 422.7 m long drill hole from surface to depth, including 111.7 m of 1.24 g/t gold (see news release dated June 21, 2023), continue to demonstrate the persistent and higher-grade nature of this intrusion-related gold system, the data gathered from this MAG survey further demonstrates the potential this system has to host an overall gold resource that is multiples larger than the current initial mineral resource estimate of 1,340,000 ounces of gold that was delineated with just 13,000 metres of drilling. While we will continue to focus on the systematic step out drilling designed to expand both the Blackjack and Eiger deposits, both of which remain open in all directions, we are also very excited to test the potential world-class scale of this robust gold system with additional exploration along this 5 km long mineralized corridor.""Figure 2: Surface Geochemical Results and Intrusive Stocks (CNW Group/Sitka Gold Corp.)Figure 3: 3D Modelling of Magnetic Susceptibility (CNW Group/Sitka Gold Corp.)Gold mineralization at the RC project is hosted in quartz veins that occur in broad zones within both intrusive and metasedimentary rocks, with higher grade gold mineralization generally occurring in the intrusive rocks near the contact with the metasedimentary rocks. As with all intrusion-related gold systems, the source of the gold mineralization is considered to be a large, underlying magmatic system, therefore intrusions both at surface and at depth are critical targets for gold mineralization.Three-dimensional modelling of the MAG survey flown over the Blackjack, Saddle and Eiger zones in 2022 demonstrates that the intrusive rocks associated with the known gold mineralization at these zones (the Saddle and Eiger intrusives) coincide with areas of higher magnetic susceptibility in the model (Figures 1 and 3, adapted from Trent Pezzot, 2022 Memorandum - Interpretation of Airborne Magnetic Survey on the Clear Creek Property, Yukon).  Sitka interprets the higher magnetic responses to indicate large hornfels alteration zones that surround the known intrusions. The hornfels zones as mapped on surface encompasses the Saddle, Eiger, Josephine and Pukelman intrusions are far more extensive than expected given the surface extent of these known intrusions.Figures 2 and 3 also demonstrate that the areas of higher magnetic susceptibility extend considerably beyond areas of currently defined gold mineralization and mapped intrusions, indicating both that the intrusive bodies could be larger than previously defined and that associated gold mineralization could be much more extensive than currently known.The 3D modelling also suggests that the higher magnetic susceptibility features associated with the Saddle and Eiger intrusions coalesce at depth, indicating that these bodies and associated gold mineralization are part of a much larger gold enriched intrusive system. This possibility is further supported by the large 100 ppb gold in soil anomaly that extends continuously from the Saddle intrusion (Blackjack deposit) through the Eiger intrusion (Eiger deposit) and Pukelman intrusion and, discontinuously to the Josephine intrusion. Both the Jospehine and Pukelman intrusions are high priority, intrusion-related gold targets that have not yet been tested by Sitka.These interpretations support conclusions of previous explorers, including Newmont Exploration Limited, who in 1998 suggested that the Saddle, Eiger, Josephine and Pukelman intrusions coalesce at depth. Additional Newmont data, including airborne radiometrics, supported this theory however Newmont withdrew from the project before drill-testing the theory.New and historical interpretation of geophysical, geochemical and geology data supports the theory that a large gold mineralized intrusion may underlie and contribute to the near surface deposits and surface mineralization discovered to date.About the RC Gold ProjectThe RC Gold Project (RC Gold) consists of a 376 square kilometre contiguous district-scale land package located in the newly road accessible Clear Creek, Big Creek, and Sprague Creek districts in the heart of Yukon's Tombstone Gold Belt. The project is located approximately 100 kilometres east of Dawson City and is accessed via a secondary gravel road from the Klondike Highway an approximate 2 hour drive from Dawson. It is the largest consolidated land package strategically positioned mid-way between Victoria Gold's Eagle Gold Mine - Yukon's newest gold mine which reached commercial production in the summer of 2020 - and Sabre Gold Mine's Brewery Creek Gold Mine. The RC Gold Project land package comprises five underlying properties, namely, the RC, Bee Bop, Mahtin, Clear Creek, and Barney Ridge properties*. The planned 10,000 metre drill program for 2023 is currently underway and is focused on expanding the Blackjack and Eiger gold deposits, both of which remain open in all directions.On January 19, 2023 Sitka Gold announced an Initial Mineral Resource Estimate prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 (""NI 43-101"") guidelines for the RC Gold  Property of 1,340,000 ‎ounces of gold(1). The road accessible, pit constrained Mineral Resource is classified as inferred and is contained in two near/on-surface zones: The Blackjack and Eiger deposits. The Mineral Resource estimate is presented in the following table at a base case cut-off grade of 0.25 g/t Au:Table 2: RC Gold Inferred Mineral Resource EstimateCOG g/t AuBlackjack ZoneEiger ZoneCombinedTonnes 000'sAu g/t0z Au 000'sTonnes 000'sAu g/t0z Au 000'sTonnes 000'sAu g/t0z Au 000's0.2035,7980.8092132,5230.4547168,3210.631,3910.2533,7430.8390027,3620.5044061,1050.681,3400.3031,2820.8888522,2530.5539353,5350.741,2790.3529,0650.9286017,8170.6034446,8820.801,2030.4026,9750.9683314,5060.6630841,4810.861,140Notes1.Mineral resource estimate prepared by Ronald G. Simpson of GeoSim Services Inc. with an effective date of January 19, 2023. Mineral Resources are classified using the 2014 CIM Definition Standards.2.The cut-off grade of 0.25 g/t Au is believed to provide a reasonable margin over operating and sustaining costs for open-pit mining and processing3.Mineral resources are constrained by an optimised pit shell using the following assumptions: US$1800/oz Au price; a 45° pit slope; assumed metallurgical recovery of 85%; mining costs of US$2.00 per tonne; processing costs of US$8.00 per tonne; G&amp;A of US$1.50/t.4.Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.5.Totals may not sum due to rounding.The Initial Mineral Resource Estimate of 1,340,000 ounces of gold at the RC Gold Project is comprised of two deposits: the Blackjack deposit containing 900,000 ounces of gold at a grade of 0.83 g/t gold and the Eiger deposit containing 440,000 ounces of gold at a grade of 0.50 g/t gold (see news release dated January 19, 2023). Both of these deposits are at/near surface, are potentially open pit minable and amenable to heap leaching, with initial bottle roll tests indicating that the gold is not refractory and has high gold recoveries of up to 94% with minimal NaCN consumption (see News Release July 13, 2022).The Blackjack and Eiger deposits are in close proximity to highway and power infrastructure, are road accessible year-round, remain open in all directions and are respectively located at the western and eastern end of a large, 500 metre by 2 kilometre intrusion related gold system that was recently discovered on the Property. To date, just 41 diamond drill holes have been drilled into this system for a total of approximately 14,500 metres with results of up to 201.0 m of 1.26 g/t gold from surface, including 82.0 m of 2.04 g/t gold and 19.5 m of 4.87 g/t gold at Blackjack (drill hole DDRCCC-22-040; see news release dated January 11, 2023) and 354 m of 0.41 g/t gold including 72 m of 0.72 g/t gold at Eiger (drill hole DDRCCC-21-09; see news release date August 19, 2021).Several high priority intrusion related gold targets exist at RC Gold with nine outcropped intrusions identified to date over the 376 sq km property, however Sitka's main focus at the RC Gold Project has been on the underlying Clear Creek Property where a large 500 metre by 2000 metre intrusion related gold system covering the area over the Blackjack, Saddle and Eiger zones was identified. Prior to the onset of the 2023 winter drilling program, the Company had drilled 38 diamond drill holes into this system for a total of approximately 13,000 metres. This drilling culminated in the discovery of the Blackjack and Eiger deposits with an initial inferred mineral resource estimate of 1,340,000 gold ounces(1).Sitka Gold inherited a wealth of historical and current data from these properties from work spanning the last 40 years. Recent exploration work and the compilation of historical data have defined several mineralized zones with both bulk tonnage, intrusion-related gold deposit targets and high-grade, vein- and breccia-hosted gold targets. The RC Gold Project also has a common border with Victoria Gold's Clear Creek property at its western boundary and Florin Resources' Florin Gold property at its northern boundary.(1)Simpson, R.  January 19, 2023.  Clear Creek Property, RC Gold Project, NI 43-101 Technical Report, Dawson Mining District, Yukon Territory.*For more detailed information on the underlying properties please visit our website at www.sitkagoldcorp.com.Deposit ModelExploration on the Property has mainly focused on identifying an intrusion-related gold system (""IRGS""). The property is part of the Tombstone Gold Belt which is the prominent host to IRGS deposits within the Tintina Gold Province in Yukon and Alaska. Notable deposits from the belt include: Fort Knox Mine in Alaska with current Proven and Probable Reserves of 230 million tonnes at 0.3 g/t Au (2.471 million ounces; Sims 2018)(1); Eagle Gold Mine with current Measured and Indicated Resources of 233 million tonnes at a grade of 0.57 g/t Au at the Eagle Main Zone (4.303 million ounces; Harvey et al, 2022)(2); the Brewery Creek deposit with current Indicated Mineral Resource of 22.2 million tonnes at a gold grade of 1.11 g/t (0.789 million ounces; Hulse et al. 2020)(3); the Florin Gold deposit, located adjacent to Sitka's RC Gold project, with a current Inferred Mineral Resource of 170.99 million tonnes grading 0.45 g/t (2.47 million ounces; Simpson 2021)(4) and  the AurMac Project with an Inferred Mineral Resource of 207.0 million tonnes grading 0.60 gram per tonne gold (3.99 million ounces; Jutras 2022)(5).(1)Sims J.

It's also well below Wall Street expectations.Analysts forecast adjusted earnings of $4.44 per share for the fiscal year, which ends in August, according to FactSet.CEO Rosalind Brewer said in a statement from the company that the new forecast takes “an appropriately cautious forward view in light of consumer spending uncertainty, while still demonstrating clear drivers of a return to operating growth next fiscal year.”The company said it was raising its cost management program target to $4.1 billion in total savings from $3.5 billion.Walgreens' profit fell 59% to $118 million in the fiscal third quarter, which ended May 31.The Deerfield, Illinois-based company reported earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, of $1 per share.The results did not meet Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $1.06 per share.The drugstore chain posted revenue of $35.42 billion in the period, exceeding Street forecasts. Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $33.79 billion.Walgreens shares fell 7%, or $2.21, to $29.38 before markets opened Tuesday._____Elements of this story were generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.

The coffee giant disputes these allegations.More than 3,000 workers at over 150 Starbucks stores in the United States will walk off the job, the union said on Friday.Starbucks also filed two complaints against Workers United with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) on Monday, alleging that the union made misleading claims on the company's in-store decoration guidelines and gender-affirming care benefits.The union said in an emailed statement to Reuters that every charge against them by Starbucks was dismissed by the NLRB, adding that any new charges will also be dismissed because ""they are nothing more than a public relations stunt meant to distract from Starbucks' own actions.""The union added that if Starbucks wants to be an ally to the LGBTQIA+ community, they will actually listen to their queer workers by coming to the bargaining table to negotiate in good faith.NLRB did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.Several U.S. retail brands have faced backlash from conservatives over the display of LGBTQ+ merchandise, as well as criticism from gay rights groups for insufficient support for the community.(Reporting by Akanksha Khushi and Rishabh Jaiswal in Bengaluru; Additional Reporting by Lavanya Ahire and Chandni Shah; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu and Rashmi Aich)]"

The Seattle Roastery was closed all day Friday and was open for just five hours on Sunday instead of its usual 15, the union said.Starbucks said the impact on its operations has been limited. On Monday, 120 stores were participating in the strike but only 13 of those were fully closed, the company said. In some cases, drive-thrus have remained open but cafes have closed, the company said.Workers are protesting reports that some Starbucks stores banned LGBTQ+ Pride displays this year after backlash against companies like Target, where angry customers tipped over Pride displays and confronted workers. The union also says Starbucks officials have warned workers that unionizing could threaten their health benefits, including gender affirming care for transgender workers.But Starbucks insists there has been no change of corporate policy around Pride displays or employee benefits. Starbucks extended full health care to same-sex partners in 1988 and added coverage for gender reassignment surgery in 2013.In a letter to employees posted Friday on Starbucks’ website, CEO Laxman Narasimhan noted that a Pride flag is currently flying over the company’s Seattle headquarters, just as it has in past years.“We want to be crystal clear: Starbucks has been and will continue to be at the forefront of supporting the LGBTQIA2+ community, and we will not waver in that commitment,” Narasimhan said. “As such, we strongly disapprove of any person or group, seeking to use our partners’ cultural and heritage celebrations to create harm or flagrantly advance misinformation for self-interested goals.”At least 319 of Starbucks' 9,265 company-operated U.S. stores have voted to unionize since late 2021, while 76 stores have voted against unionizing, according to the National Labor Relations Board. Workers are seeking guaranteed minimum hours, gender-neutral store bathrooms and safety improvements, among other things.Story continuesStarbucks doesn’t support unionization, and the effort has been contentious. Earlier this month, the company agreed to settle an NLRB complaint that it improperly blocked unionized employees from working shifts at University of Washington football games. The company agreed to back pay for 10 workers and also said it would inform current employees in the Seattle area that it won’t interfere with their right to organize.Workers went on strike twice late last year and again in March ahead of the company’s annual meeting. But the strikes don't appear to be impacting customer demand. Starbucks' U.S. same-store sales were up 12% in the quarter ending April 2.Starbucks shares were flat in midday trading Monday.]"

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the manufacturing sector, head directly to 5 Best Manufacturing Stocks To Buy Now. In 2022, the manufacturing industry remained resilient, and while this year also experienced record demand and production levels, the short-term outlook is not rosy. This is due to the unstable macro environment and uncharted inflation rates, which are destroying growth pace in the sector. Complex issues persist in the manufacturing sector, including supply chain bottlenecks, inventory and logistics backlogs, skyrocketing costs, and cybersecurity breaches. According to Deloitte, there are five crucial trends that will shape the global manufacturing industry in 2023. First, ongoing investments in complex manufacturing technologies will increase productivity and resilience in the manufacturing sector. Second, manufacturers are working hard to address the high workforce turnover and looking to keep their employees onboard with improved talent retention methods. Moreover, manufacturers are alleviating supply chain constraints by shifting to just-in-case inventory strategies and sourcing raw materials locally. Some manufacturers are even creating in-house raw materials to mitigate unforeseen shortages. In addition to that, manufacturers are digitally transforming their plants and factories by making their operations smart or creating a metaverse platform for their products and services. Manufacturers are also working hard to keep their environmental, social, and governance commitments. Another emerging trend in the manufacturing sector is Supply Chain 4.0, which refers to supply chain management that is led by trailblazing technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and big data analytics. This helps revolutionize logistics, supply chains, and production by optimizing costs, increasing efficiency, promoting innovation, and staying ahead of the competition. Story continuesDon't Miss: Top 20 Manufacturing Countries in the WorldJay Timmons, President and CEO of The National Association of Manufacturers, described the manufacturing outlook for this year and commented on January 5, 2023: “The majority of manufacturers expect a recession this year. Congress failed to act on essential tax reforms, which complicates investment, increases inflationary pressures and could stifle economic growth. Much needed permitting reforms and provisions to strengthen our ability to conduct research and development, buy machinery and finance job-creating investments — which we need to promote growth within the sector — were left on the cutting room floor last year. Those reforms, combined with manufacturers’ ongoing efforts to inspire, educate and empower the future workforce, are critical to our competitiveness.”According to Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s Elon Musk, while it is great how many entrepreneurs are entering the tech and software industry, he believes the heavy industry presents significant opportunities. Musk recently stated that there is a scarcity of skilled workforce in the manufacturing and heavy industries.

This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Others sell goods that are priced in dollars such as Parker-Hannifin’s (NYSE:PH) aerospace products.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Manufacturing Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:Top 16 Medicine Producing Countries in the World15 Best Large-Cap Value Stocks To Buy25 Part-time Retirement Jobs that Pay Well Disclosure: None. 12 Best Manufacturing Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The company's shares saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$82.55 and falling to the lows of US$70.55. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Archer-Daniels-Midland's current trading price of US$73.64 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Archer-Daniels-Midland’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland Is Archer-Daniels-Midland Still Cheap?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 4.6% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Archer-Daniels-Midland today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $77.21, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. What's more, Archer-Daniels-Midland’s share price may be more stable over time (relative to the market), as indicated by its low beta.What kind of growth will Archer-Daniels-Midland generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. However, with an extremely negative double-digit change in profit expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth is certainly not a driver of a buy decision. It seems like high uncertainty is on the cards for Archer-Daniels-Midland, at least in the near future.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? ADM seems fairly priced right now, but given the uncertainty from negative returns in the future, this could be the right time to de-risk your portfolio. Is your current exposure to the stock optimal for your total portfolio? And is the opportunity cost of holding a negative-outlook stock too high? Before you make a decision on the stock, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on ADM for a while, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. The stock appears to be trading at fair value, which means there’s less benefit from mispricing. In addition to this, the negative growth outlook increases the risk of holding the stock. However, there are also other important factors we haven’t considered today, which can help crystalize your views on ADM should the price fluctuate below its true value.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

If you want to skip our analysis of the tobacco industry and consumption trends, go directly to the Top 5 Countries with the Highest Tobacco Consumption.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are 1.3 billion tobacco users globally, and 80% of tobacco consumers reside in low- and middle-income nations. Primarily, tobacco is consumed through cigarettes around the world, and it kills more than 8 million people annually. This makes tobacco consumption one of the biggest epidemics in the world. Tobacco consumption directly contributes to the deaths of over 7 million people each year. Additionally, 1.2 million people lose their lives due to exposure to tobacco as second-hand smokers. The WHO believes that there are around 4,000 chemicals in tobacco smoke, and no safe level of exposure can be determined for second-hand smoke.Experts believe that imposing taxes on tobacco products discourages its use. According to estimates provided by the WHO, an increase in the price of tobacco by 10% lowers its consumption by 4% in high-income countries and by 5% in low and middle-income nations. Ghana, Nigeria, and Panama are the least-smoking countries in the world as they have the lowest percentage of adults indulging in smoking as of 2020. Meanwhile, Serbia has the highest smoking rate in Europe by country at 39%. Globally, Bulgaria and Croatia are also among the top 10 countries with the highest percentage of smokers. As of 2020, 22.3% of the total population in the world used tobacco, and there was a stark contrast between the smoking rates by gender. Overall, 36.7% of all the men in the world and 7.8% of all the women in the world consumed tobacco. The female smoking rates by country are highly influenced by the socio-cultural values across regions. According to Grand View Research, the size of the global tobacco industry is anticipated to rise from $867.6 billion in 2022 to $1.05 trillion by the end of this decade. This reflects a compound annual growth rate of 2.4%. The growth is expected to be driven by an increased percentage of smokers in the world.Story continuesSome of the leading tobacco companies in the world are Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), British American Tobacco p.l.c. (NYSE:BTI), Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO), Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914.T), and Imperial Brands PLC (IMB.L). The Stamford, Connecticut-based Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is the biggest publicly listed tobacco company in the world. The company has a footprint in over 180 countries globally and has brands like Marlboro, L&amp;M, and Chesterfield under its portfolio. The company was alone responsible for shipping 621 billion cigarettes globally in 2022. Meanwhile, Richmond, Virginia-based Altria Group, Inc.

These stocks come with their fair share of risk. But by carefully selecting high-potential small-cap stocks, investors can position themselves for substantial returns.Small-cap stocks refer to companies with market capitalizations falling between approximately $300 million and $2 billion. These companies are often young. However, they offer rapid growth potential, making them an attractive choice for investors. Yet, it’s crucial to note that small-cap stocks are generally less stable than their larger counterparts and can fall quickly.Despite their volatility, small-cap stocks tend to outperform large-cap companies over the long term, especially during bull markets. With the major indices recently crossing into bull market territory, it may be time to focus on the top small-cap stocks to buy like the names below.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCarParts.com (PRTS)Car sitting outside with the sun behind it.Source: ShutterstockFormerly known as Auto Parts Network, CarParts.com (NASDAQ:PRTS) is going through a transformation under new management. With a strategic consolidation of its web brands, the company streamlined operations and witnessed a remarkable surge in sales during the Covid-19 pandemic.Not resting on its laurels, CarParts.com is actively investing in cutting-edge technology and robust marketing initiatives. This forward-thinking approach is complemented by the rapid expansion of its distribution centers as the company seeks to offer one-day delivery to 80% to 90% of its customers.CarParts.com is poised for continued growth as it capitalizes on the ongoing semiconductor shortage impacting the auto manufacturing sector that has hindered new car production in recent years. Additionally, the company is taking advantage of the rising price of new and used cars, which is causing people to keep their existing vehicles longer, thus requiring them to spend more money on repairs.Story continuesWhile the pandemic has certainly played a role, CarParts.com’s success is not a temporary phenomenon. Management is targeting a long-term revenue growth rate of 20% to 25% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 8% to 10%.PRTS stock is down 35% year to date, despite the company reporting record results in March, to trade with a market cap of $228.7 million. With its transformative strategies and ability to adapt to market dynamics, CarParts.com is poised to continue its growth trajectory beyond the pandemic, making it a compelling choice for investors seeking top small-cap stocks to buy.Perion Network (PERI)peri stock: the Perion logo on the side of a buildingSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.comThe boom in ad tech stocks following the pandemic can be attributed to the overall expansion of digital advertising and connected TV. Among the top small-cap stocks to buy in this sector is Israeli company Perion Network (NASDAQ:PERI), which has a market cap of $1.6 billion. According to The Motley Fool, “Perion connects ad buyers and sellers through its Intelligent Hub (iHub), which enables cost-effective ad placements for brands and publishers, and also gives them value-added, customizable tools to improve ROI.”Perion Network has gained a strong foothold in the market, benefiting from a close partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). In fact, the company plays a vital role in helping Microsoft monetize its Bing search engine.With a strategic focus on growth, Perion has been rapidly expanding through acquisitions while solidifying its position in premium ads. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on the ad tech industry’s continued evolution, and shares have the potential to deliver strong returns for investors seeking high-potential small-cap stocks.Western Union (WU)Logo/electronic sign for Western Union (WU)Source: 360b / Shutterstock.comWestern Union (NYSE:WU) offers convenient money transfer services worldwide. With a market cap of $4.4 billion, it’s really more of a SMID cap stock, but it still offers plenty of upside potential. A crucial aspect of the company’s competitive advantage lies in its robust digital channel.Although first-quarter results were not impressive, there are positive indicators suggesting Western Union is addressing recent challenges and moving toward overall stabilization. The company’s leadership position in the industry benefits from the highly scalable nature of the money transfer business. This advantageous position has granted Western Union a notable cost advantage.There is concern regarding a stagnant top line, which may prompt a reassessment of the company’s value in the future. Yet, with a core emphasis on simplifying global money transfers, Western Union continues to distinguish itself as a prominent player.With WU stock down 15% year to date and nearly 50% over the past two years, a small position in this beaten-down small-cap stock could yield a big return for investors willing to take accept the risk.On the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not hold (directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This bolsters the growth prospects of aerospace-defense equipment stocks, especially those involved in commercial aerospace. However, COVID-led supply chain disruption might hurt the earnings and cash flows of industry players.Also, rising jet fuel prices put pressure on airlines, which, in turn, may hurt aerospace-defense equipment stocks. Frequent mergers and acquisitions tend to boost the revenue-generation prospects of industry participants. Some key players in this industry that you may keep in your portfolio include TransDigm Group, Bae Systems and Curtiss-Wright.About the IndustryThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense Equipment industry comprises firms that manufacture various vital components for the aerospace-defense space, ranging from aerostructures, space shuttles, propulsion systems, aircraft engines, defense electronics, missile and radar systems to flight test equipment, structural adhesives, instrumentation and control systems, communication products and many more.Some of these companies also offer integrated simulation and training services to the U.S. defense force. While majority of the revenues are generated from the production of the aforementioned accompaniments, the industry players also generate revenues by providing notable aftermarket support and services like maintenance, repair and overhaul activities to aerospace and defense players.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Aerospace-Defense Equipment IndustryNew M&amp;As Instill Hopes: Rising competition has historically prompted industry majors to expand their product lines through smal-l and medium-sized mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) apart from the big mergers in the industry. In May 2023, Heico Corp.declared its intent to acquire Wencor Group. Wencor Group, which boasts a strong portfolio of products in the aftermarket space and serves varied airlines worldwide, aircraft maintenance repair and overhaul companies, military agencies and defense contractors.Story continuesThe acquisition will thus provide HEICO an opportunity to expand its customer base, enhance its product offerings and increase its market share in the aftermarket jet service business area. In March, AAR Corp. completed the acquisition of the aircraft maintenance, repair and operation and fleet management software provider, Trax USA Corp., for $120 million. This buyout is projected to expand AIR’s offerings in digital solutions for its core aviation aftermarket customers.Such consolidations should improve economies of scale for the industry as a whole, with the players having access to diversified business models.Recovering Air Traffic View Boosts Prospects: World air travel data has been on a steady growth trajectory for the past few months. Per the latest report published by IATA in June 2023, the airline industry is forecast to return to profitability in 2023, only three years after the historic loss of $140 billion in 2020. Total airline revenues are expected to recover to around 93% of the 2019 figure, with operating profits reaching $22.4 billion. This, in turn, should benefit aerospace-defense equipment industry stocks, especially those engaged in commercial aviation.Unusual Strength of the Dollar Remains a Concern: Global inflation rose to 8.7% in 2022 and is likely to pull back to 7% in 2023. This leaves the price level higher, although may be at a somewhat slower pace, but is still rising. A stronger U.S. dollar puts pressure on airlines on top of high inflation and high jet fuel prices. This is because U.S. dollar-denominated costs rise for all businesses whose revenues are in another currency. An appreciated U.S. dollar value is a risk for aerospace-defense equipment stocks, particularly the ones in commercial aerospace, considering the fact that the share of jet fuel in airlines’ operating costs is considerably high, between 25% and 30%.Supply Chain Disruption Poses Risk: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented crisis in the aerospace and defense supply chain. Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) need to dramatically scale back their capacity to reflect the new realities of the commercial air travel market. Such OEM rate reductions have been affecting the extended commercial aerospace manufacturing supply chain, which might lower earnings and cash flows for the aerospace and defense equipment industry in the near term.Zacks Industry Rank Reflects Bright OutlookThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense Equipment industry is housed within the broaderZacks Aerospace sector.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.PPG Industries and Novozymes A/S are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #4 (Sell), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that PPG is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.PPG currently has a forward P/E ratio of 19.16, while NVZMY has a forward P/E of 26.07. We also note that PPG has a PEG ratio of 1.18. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. NVZMY currently has a PEG ratio of 9.95.Another notable valuation metric for PPG is its P/B ratio of 4.51. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, NVZMY has a P/B of 5.52.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to PPG's Value grade of A and NVZMY's Value grade of C.PPG stands above NVZMY thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that PPG is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

GS is firing managing directors (MD) across the globe in response to the industry-wide plunge in deal-making activities, per a Bloomberg article that cited people familiar with the matter.According to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified as the cuts aren't public, the layoffs are currently in progress, which will affect nearly 125 MDs from several departments, including some investment banking (IB) positions.Markedly, GS has undergone a minimum of three phases of job cuts within a year and these initiatives are part of the company's deep cost-savings drive.Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs announced job cuts of more than 30 IB positions across the Asia region. During the first quarter of 2023, GS trimmed its headcount by 3,200, its biggest round of layoffs since the 2008 financial crisis. Last year, the company also cut about 500 jobs.Global mergers and acquisitions and volumes for initial public offerings have been declining in the past few quarters. A host of factors, such as geopolitical tensions, inflation, rising interest rates and fears of a global recession, acted as headwinds for mergers and acquisitions, Thus, deal volume and total deal value numbers crashed in the quarter. For the same reasons, IPOs and follow-up equity issuances died up. The bond issuance volume witnessed a decline too as investors turned pessimistic.Amid theses, IB revenues declined in 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. Nonetheless, the same is likely to rebound in the near term as the company's robust client engagement, backed by digital disruption and transformation trends, and its decent investment banking backlog are positives. Therefore, these positives will likely give it an edge over its peers. Our estimates for IB fees indicate an 8.4% decline in 2023, but an increase of 11.7% in 2024.Over the past six months, shares of GS have declined 8% compared with the industry’s fall of 12.2%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCurrently, the company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Similar to Goldman Sachs, Wall Street firms, including Citigroup Inc. C and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM, have been reducing the workforce in their IB division.This month, in its latest round of staffing reductions, C will likely cut 30 IB jobs and 20 more in its corporate banking unit in London. The news was reported by Financial News.Also, JPM is slashing about 40 IB dealmakers in North America as part of a global headcount reduction. The primary reason for this is the plunge in dealmaking activities across the industry, per Bloomberg News, reported last week.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

107,bff24d25-eb4a-39e8-b692-8e8829345de3,APTV,2023-06-27,3 Autonomous Driving Stocks to Buy With Explosive Upside Potential,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-autonomous-driving-stocks-buy-193516865.html,1687289716,STORY,['APTV'],"[With artificial intelligence and optical technologies accelerating, investors looking for their next big opportunity should consider the top autonomous driving stocks to buy. Fundamentally, autonomy on the roads may help significantly improve safety. Even the best drivers can’t monitor every little detail, which is where tech steps into the picture.In addition, high-potential autonomous driving stocks may facilitate the unlocking of economic value. Data from Inrix – billed as the world leader in mobility analytics and connected car services – claimed that Americans lost an average of 97 hours a year due to traffic congestion. In 2018, delays on the road imposed a cost of nearly $87 billion to commuting workers.Further, the sector itself presents an unignorably compelling opportunity for forward-thinking investors. According to McKinsey &amp; Company, road autonomy could create $300 billion to $400 billion in revenue by 2035. Therefore, it’s well worth planning ahead with autonomous driving stocks with explosive growth. To be sure, it’s a growing arena and that implies growing pains. However, if you’re a patient speculator, these may be the best autonomous driving stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAPTVAptiv$100.16AURAurora Innovation$2.42OUSTOuster$5.55Aptiv (APTV)Aptiv corporate location with logo against white wall.Source: AptivA global technology firm, Aptiv (NYSE:APTV) develops safer, greener and more connected solutions enabling the future of mobility, according to its public profile. One of the least speculative top autonomous driving stocks, Aptiv features a market capitalization of over $27 billion. While it might not yield blistering gains, APTV should help with consistent performance, keeping you in the game.Primarily, Aptiv ranks among the high-potential autonomous driving stocks thanks to its Gen 6 ADAS platform. Under this innovative architecture, vehicle manufacturers benefit from a proven software stack integrated with myriad features and services. More importantly, ADAS integrates a next-generation sensor suite, which incorporates radar, vision and lidar technologies. Theoretically, this combination should lend a competitive edge for Aptiv.Story continuesFinally, Wall Street analysts peg APTV a consensus strong buy. This assessment breaks down as 10 buys, three holds and significantly zero sell ratings. Overall, the experts’ average price target lands at $127.09, implying over 25% upside potential. Thus, it’s a solid idea for best autonomous driving stocks to buy that likely won’t leave you on the road.Aurora Innovation (AUR)7 Autonomous Vehicle Stocks to Drive You to the FutureSource: ShutterstockBased in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Aurora Innovation (NASDAQ:AUR) is an American self-driving vehicle technology company. According to its corporate profile, Aurora is known for developing the Aurora Driver, a computer system that can be integrated into cars for autonomous driving. As with Aptiv above, the company sports a respectable market cap of nearly $2.7 billion. Since the start of the year, AUR shares nearly doubled, thus making a strong case for top autonomous driving stocks.Notably, its website states that next year, Aurora plans to launch Horizon, the first autonomous service powered by the aforementioned Aurora Driver platform. Per its directive, Horizon should bring safety, value and efficiency to carriers and fleet owners.Though an enticing narrative for autonomous driving stocks with explosive growth, Aurora presents an aspirational profile in its financials. Notably, it has a long way to profitability. Nevertheless, its cash-to-debt ratio pings at just over 7 times, which beats out 61.54% of its peers. Lastly, analysts peg AUR a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target clocks in at $3.13, implying over 39% upside potential. Thus, it’s one of the promising autonomous driving stocks for speculators.Ouster (OUST)Autonomous self driving electric car using lidar change the lane and overtakes city vehicle. MVIS stockSource: temp-64GTX / Shutterstock.comFor folks who really want to ramp up their risk-reward profile, Ouster (NYSE:OUST) just might fit the bill. As a lidar technology specialist, Ouster builds high-resolution, digital 3D lidar sensors for use in autonomous vehicles, industrial, robotics, drones, mapping, defense and security systems. Further, its sensors produce images from ambient infrared, with software that enables a vehicle’s sensing and mapping functions.That sounds great on a marketing brochure. And on paper, OUST seemingly makes a robust case for top autonomous driving stocks. However, investors will look at the reality of the situation, which is that OUST hemorrhaged over 43% of equity value since the January opener. Even worse, over the trailing one-year period, the security fell slightly more than 72%.Nevertheless, the occasional positive news items have previously skyrocketed OUST. So, it’s not a complete loss when it comes to best autonomous driving stocks to  buy (for extreme speculators). In closing, analysts peg OUST a moderate buy. For the believers ,their average price target stands at $10.63, implying over 94% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

While 84% expect to grow, 22% plan to implement changes to their operating models to achieve efficiency and cost savings.The white paper, The Evolving Asset Management Landscape: Only the Fittest Will Thrive, revealed a gap between the strategic priorities of asset managers and their appetite for structural changes that could prepare firms to meet the scale of future challenges ranging from increased competition and the impact of higher interest rates to regulatory change and technology disruption.""Asset managers continue to face considerable adversity, and we commissioned this study to understand how the asset management industry is evolving,"" said Grant Johnsey, Head of Client Solutions, Capital Markets, Americas. ""Active, long-only strategies remain an important component in our clients’ investment mix. Information from this research can help guide our continued development of outsourced trading, investment operations outsourcing, foreign exchange and other solutions integrating the whole office to support the business environment of tomorrow for asset managers.""The research shows asset managers expect their top internal challenges over the next three years to include performance (59%), talent management (50%) and rising costs (44%). When asked how they expect to achieve efficiency and cost savings, 63% said they would deploy new technology.""Addressing the internal challenges facing managers will require skill and a diverse mix of capabilities to continue on their growth course,"" says Gerard Walsh, Global Head of Capital Markets Client Solutions. ""Managers plan to deploy new technology and implement more cost-effective operational approaches, which can be difficult to do in a contracting market. In the next phase of the cycle, it seems likely that firms will seek more ways to develop orchestrated ecosystems that support their alpha generation activity. We believe firms that assess their entire value chain of activities will benefit from recent evolution of traditional outsourcing models into new areas. This will help them deliver their strategic growth priorities.""Story continuesThe white paper recommends that asset managers take a holistic view of efficiency that includes outsourcing some or all processes and more deeply integrating the front, middle and back office of the investment organization.Stephen Bruel, Senior Analyst at Coalition Greenwich Market Structure &amp; Technology and author of the report said: ""While there are many unknowns in the current environment, one item asset managers control is their operating model.

110,f146b56e-8225-34f4-b1e3-7990b7134027,AIG,2023-06-27,AIG Rises 16.4% in Three Months: What's Driving the Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aig-rises-16-4-three-163700460.html,1687797420,STORY,['AIG'],"[American International Group, Inc. AIG shares have jumped 16.4% in the past three months compared with the 5.4% rise of the industry it belongs to, thanks to the rapidly improving underwriting performance. AIG’s efficient management and favorable business scenario have created prudent investment opportunities.Based in New York, AIG is a leading global insurance organization. It has a market cap of $40 billion now.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCan it Retain Momentum?The answer is yes and before we get into the details, let us show you how its estimates for the full-year 2023 stand.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AIG’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $6.46 per share, indicating a 42% jump from $4.55 a year ago. It has witnessed three upward estimate revisions in the past 60 days against one movement in the opposite direction. The company beat earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters and missed once, with an average surprise of 9.2%.Furthermore, the consensus estimate for 2023 revenues stands at $49.5 billion, signaling a 9% year-over-year rise.Now let’s delve into what’s driving this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.The company’s improving profitability is making the stock lucrative for investors. The management is working on improving ROCE with the help of cost-curbing efforts, enhancing underwriting profitability and streamlining operations. AIG closed the IPO of Corebridge Financial, Inc. CRBG, the holding company of its Life and Retirement unit, in September 2022. This month, it closed the secondary offering, where it sold 74.75 million CRBG shares.The company has managed to improve its combined ratio over the past few years. In its General Insurance business, AIG reduced the combined ratio from 104.3% in 2020 to 95.8% in 2021 and 91.9% in 2022. Our estimate for 2023 and 2024 for the metric is pegged at 90.3% and 88.8%, respectively, indicating more premiums to remain with the company after claims.Strong pricing will likely help AIG to increase its revenues. We expect premium income for 2023 to increase by almost 10% year over year. Furthermore, the high interest rate environment will keep boosting its investment returns. Our estimate for net investment income for this year indicates 9.2% year-over-year growth. Story continuesRisksDespite the upside potential, there are a few factors that might hold back the stock’s growth.Its debt-laden balance sheet is concerning. American International exited the first quarter with a cash balance of $1,923 million, which decreased from $2,043 million at 2022-end. Its short and long-term debt of $22.1 billion rose from $21.3 billion at the prior-year end. Its net debt-to-capital of 48% is significantly higher than the industry average.Also, AIG is likely to avoid some home insurance policies in disaster-prone zones, which can affect its sales. Nevertheless, we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will drive the company’s long-term growth.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader finance space are Assurant, Inc. AIZ and Old Republic International Corporation ORI, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

Solid first-quarter 2023 performance buoys optimism. However, forex woes and lower sales impede growth.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 0.9% against a 22.7% decline of the industry and a 13.3% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.This renowned provider of a diversified line of healthcare products has a market capitalization of $187.89 billion. The company projects a 5.1% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. Abbott’s earnings surpassed estimates in all of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 19.28%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors at PlayQ1 Upsides: Abbott exited the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Organic sales growth excluding COVID testing increased 10%, led by double-digit growth in Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals and Nutrition. Within EPD, sales increased 11% in the quarter led by strong performance in Brazil, China and Southeast Asia and across several therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic, gastroenterology, CNS and pain management. EPD has been sustaining its double-digit sales growth momentum for the last two years.Progress With Diabetes Business: This business achieved organic sales growth of 21% in the first quarter of 2023, led by a more than 25% growth in FreeStyle Libre, including approximately 50% growth in the United States and mid-teens internationally. In the quarter, sales of FreeStyle Libre were $1.2 billion. During the quarter, Libre received FDA clearance for connectivity with automated insulin delivery systems. Abbott is currently working with leading insulin pump manufacturers to integrate their systems with Libre 2 and Libre 3.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn a relatively short span, Libre has achieved global leadership among CGM systems for Type 1 and Type 2 users. In 2020, the company received the U.S. approval of Freestyle Libre 2 (an integrated continuous glucose monitoring or iCGM system for adults and children) and CE Mark for Libre 3(integrates Libre's accuracy and performance into the world's smallest fitness disposable sensor) and Libre Sense Glucose Sport (which is Abbott’s initial step in a very intentional approach to pursue mass market biosensor opportunities beyond diabetes).Story continuesUpbeat Guidance: Abbott provided its 2023 earnings per share guidance.Full-year adjusted earnings (excluding specified items of $1.25 per share) are expected in the range of $4.30-$4.50. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.36. Abbott projects full-year 2023 organic sales growth, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, of at least high-single digits and COVID testing-related sales of around $1.5 billion.DownsidesForeign Exchange Translation Impacts Sales: Foreign exchange is a major headwind for Abbott due to considerable percentage of its revenues coming from outside the United States. The strengthening of Euro and some other developed market currencies have been hampering the company’s performance in the international markets.Lower Sales: Abbott’s first-quarter worldwide sales were down 18.1% year over year on a reported basis. Total sales were affected by COVID-19 testing-related sales decline. Diagnostics’ sales growth, as projected, was dented by a significant decline in COVID testing sales compared with first-quarter 2023 levels.Estimate TrendsIn the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has moved 0.2% north to $4.39.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $39.38 billion, suggesting a 9.8% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

INSP scaled a new 52-week high of $323.23 on Jun 23, 2023, before closing the session at $315.08.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 56.8% against the 30.3% decline of the industry. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 11.5% growth in the said time frame.The company’s projected earnings per share growth rate of 26.1% compares with the industry’s growth projection of 17.1%. Inspire Medical’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 43.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchInspire Medical is witnessing an upward trend in its stock price, prompted by its global presence. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter 2023 performance and receipt of a few regulatory approvals are expected to contribute further. However, threats from stiff competition and overdependence on Inspire System persist.Let’s delve deeper.Key Growth DriversGlobal Presence: Investors are upbeat about Inspire Medical’s solid revenues from its two geographic regions, the United States and outside of the United States. In the first quarter of 2023, U.S. revenues and revenues from outside the United States reflected an increase of 87% and 15%, respectively, from the year-ago quarter on a reported basis.During the quarter, Inspire Medical activated 68 new U.S. centers, thus bringing the total to 973 U.S. medical centers providing Inspire therapy. The company also created 17 new U.S. sales territories in the quarter, bringing the total to 242 U.S. sales territories.Regulatory Approvals: Investors are optimistic about Inspire Medical’s receipt of a slew of FDA approvals over the past few months. This month, the company received the FDA’s approval on an expanded indication. The update includes an increase on the upper limit of the Apnea Hypopnea Index to 100 events per hour from 65 and raises the Body Mass Index warning in the labeling to 40 from 32.Story continuesIn March, the company received the FDA’s approval to offer Inspire therapy to pediatric patients with Down syndrome.Strong Q1 Results: Inspire Medical’s impressive first-quarter 2023 results buoy optimism. The company saw a robust improvement in its top line and strength in year-over-year geographic results. Management’s expectations of activating more U.S. medical centers and adding new U.S. sales territories during each quarter of 2023 also raise optimism about the stock.DownsidesOverdependence on Inspire System: Sales of Inspire Medical’s Inspire system accounts for primarily all its revenues. Management expects that sales of the Inspire systems will continue to account for the substantial majority of the company’s revenues going forward. Inspire Medical’s ability to execute its growth strategy and become profitable will, therefore, depend upon the adoption of the Inspire therapy by patients, physicians and sleep centers, among others, to treat moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients who cannot use or get consistent benefit from continuous positive airway pressure.Stiff Competition: The medical technology industry is highly competitive, subject to change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants. Inspire Medical’s competitors have historically dedicated and will continue to dedicate significant resources to promote their products or develop new products or methods to treat moderate to severe OSA.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

The watch, which offers continuous measurements of key physiological parameters, is currently available outside the United States as a medical device that integrates with the Masimo SafetyNet remote patient management and telehealth platform.However, the Masimo W1 for use in medical applications has not yet been cleared in the United States by the FDA.The latest adoption of Masimo’s product is expected to significantly strengthen Masimo’s remote patient monitoring (RPM) business across the world.Significance of the AdoptionHospital La Fe has been using Masimo SafetyNet with Radius PPG tetherless monitoring as part of its enhanced recovery pathway program for post-surgical patients since last year. The hospital, based on the initial success of that program, is currently planning to equip patients scheduled for elective surgery with Masimo W1 watches in advance. This is aimed at improving pre-habilitation via analysis of the heart rate variability data gathered by the watch.Per Masimo’s management, Hospital La Fe adopting Masimo W1 to collect a set of insightful baseline data for their pre-operative patients will likely allow them to better understand individual patient’s normal and abnormal readings before undergoing invasive treatment.Hospital La Fe’s management believes that the future adoption is expected to test the effect of telemonitoring with Masimo W1 in the pre-operative setting for upgrading pre-habilitation and improving patient condition and engagement.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Grand View Research, the global RPM system market was valued at $4.4 billion in 2022 and is anticipated to reach $16.9 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 18.5%. Factors like the recent pandemic, the increasing geriatric population and the cost-effectiveness of the treatment are expected to drive the market.Story continuesGiven the market potential, the adoption of its health-tracking watch is likely to provide a significant boost to Masimo’s business globally.Recent DevelopmentsThis month, Masimo announced that it is expanding its premium Denon brand to introduce its latest offering, Masimo AAT (Adaptive Acoustic Technology).The same month, Masimo announced that Fresno, CA-based Community Health System was adopting a variety of advanced Masimo monitoring technologies and solutions across its campuses.Also, in June, Masimo received the FDA’s 510(k) clearance for its patient-worn, continuous multi-parameter vital signs monitor, Radius VSM.Price PerformanceShares of Masimo have gained 15.9% in the past year compared with the industry’s 9.3% rise and the S&amp;P 500's 11.5% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksCurrently, Masimo carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

Also, strategic acquisitions poise the company for future growth. Yet, unfavorable currency movement and weak solvency are major dampeners for the stock. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Envista has outperformed the industry in the past year. The stock has declined 10.6% compared with the industry’s 22.8% fall.In first-quarter 2023, Envista registered strong growth in the Specialty Products &amp; Technologies Segment, driven by the combined Orthodontics business and Spark Aligner business. The company registered double-digit growth in other emerging markets and high single-digit growth in Europe. The Orthodontic business continued to perform well, delivering double-digit core growth despite the challenges in China and Russia. On a geographic basis, developed markets grew 3.5%, driven by strong growth in Western Europe.In Q1, the company’s implant businesses in Europe performed well on the back of disciplined commercial execution. The company’s regenerative business, including the newly-acquired Osteogenics business, continues to accelerate as well.In 2022, Envista closed two strategically significant acquisitions that positioned it to drive the digitization of the dental market while exposing it to higher growth segments within the industry.In July 2022, Envista acquired Osteogenics Biomedical — the developer of innovative regenerative solutions for periodontists, oral &amp; maxillofacial surgeons and clinicians involved in implant dentistry throughout the world. In April 2022, Envista acquired Carestream Dental's Intraoral Scanner business. The business is rebranded as DEXIS and will operate as part of the Envista Equipment and Consumables Segment. This acquisition further enables the company’s purpose of partnering with dental professionals to improve patients' lives by digitizing, personalizing and democratizing dental care.Story continuesEnvista Holdings Corporation PriceEnvista Holdings Corporation PriceEnvista Holdings Corporation price | Envista Holdings Corporation QuoteDuring the first quarter earnings update, the company stated that the recently-acquired business DEXIS IOS and Osteogenics continued to perform in line with the company’s expectations, delivering combined sales of greater than $20 million in the reported quarter. The businesses are expected to contribute over 75 basis points of core growth to Envista in 2023.On the flip side, Envista ended first-quarter 2023 with lower-than-expected revenues and earnings. The year-over-year decline in core sales was primarily the result of weakness in China and Russia as well as lower demand for large capital equipment.Geographically, the company’s sales declined substantially in Russia and China. The downside in Russia was primarily due to unusually strong performance in the first quarter of 2022 as clinicians pre-purchased inventory at the start of the conflict in Ukraine. In China, demand was down significantly in the quarter due to COVID-related slowdown. Contraction of both margins is discouraging too.Gross profit for the reported quarter fell 3% year over year while gross margin contracted 142 basis points (bps) to 57.8%. Selling, general and administrative expenses were up 3.1% year over year. Research and development expenses rose 0.4% year over year. Meanwhile, operating profit was down 21.2% year over year.

HSIC is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by the strength of its dental business. The company’s revenue growth has been consistently supported by niche acquisitions and partnerships.Within HSIC’s Technology and Value-Added Services business, Henry Schein One had an excellent quarter. However, weak solvency and the declining sales of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits pose challenges for the company.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has increased 1.2% compared with the 15.9% growth of the industry and the 11.6% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The leading distributor of healthcare products and services has a market capitalization of $10.34 billion. The company has an earnings yield of 6.67% compared with the industry’s 4.75%. Henry Schein surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one, delivering an average earnings surprise of 0.51%.Let’s delve deeper.TailwindsFavorable Dental Business Trends: The fundamentals of HSIC’s dental end markets are fueled by an aging global population, low unemployment levels and the global awareness of the healthcare benefits of preventative care and oral hygiene. Excluding sales of PPE products, local currency internal sales of Global Dental consumable merchandise increased 8.4% in the first quarter of 2023, including a 6.6% increase in North America.Of the dental equipment, traditional equipment sales grew strongly in contrast to digital equipment comprising 2D and 3D digital imaging, mills and intra-oral scanners.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWithin the Dental Specialty business, implant sales growth was driven by the premium Camlog product line in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. North America reported an increase in dental specialty practices being acquired by larger dental service organizations.Henry Schein One Holds Potential: HSIC’s dental software business has been progressing well despite a challenging business environment. In the last reported quarter, North America registered strong sales of Dentrix and Dentrix Ascend cloud-based solutions and a customer shift from the Easy Dental product, with the Easy Dental lifecycle ending later this year.Story continuesInternationally, the growth was fully supported by cloud-based solutions, particularly in Australia and New Zealand, where it was recently launched. Recently, the company announced the full integration of AI solutions into Dentrix Ascend.Expansion Through Acquisitions &amp; Partnerships: In April 2023, Henry Schein signed a definitive agreement to acquire S.I.N. Implant System, one of Brazil’s leading manufacturers of dental implants.The company also completed its majority share acquisition of Biotech Dental, adding to the prospect of offering a seamless digital workflow solution. The acquisition of Unitas by Henry Schein’s subsidiary — eAssist Dental Solutions — advances and accelerates the development of value-added services offered by Henry Schein Dental and fortifies the company’s commitment to be a trusted advisor to customers.DownsidesQ1 Negatives: In the first quarter of 2023, traditional dental equipment growth in North America was hampered by a decrease in sales of digital equipment. Lower sales of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits continued to impact the company’s performance. High operating expenses negatively affected the quarter’s adjusted operating margin.Slightly Leveraged Balance Sheet: The total debt at the end of the first quarter was $1.31 billion, much higher than the corresponding cash and cash equivalents of $126 million. HSIC exited the quarter with a short-term payable of $291 million, displaying weak solvency.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for HSIC’s 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has remained constant at $5.26 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $12.83 billion.

To skip our introduction and immediately see who wins this competition, click Kanye West Stock Portfolio vs. Warren Buffett Stock Portfolio: Who Wins?Back in December 2017, American rapper Kanye West gifted her then-wife Kim Kardashian about $200,000 worth of stocks as a Christmas present. It was clearly a peculiar present and it seemed Kim Kardashian was also pleasantly surprised. She shared this gift in an Instagram post with a “best husband alert” title. In the post Kardashian shared the photos of different stock certificates gifted to her by Kanye West and some related details. These stocks included Adidas,  Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Disney. At the time many lauded Kanye’s stock-picking skills as all of these were blue-chip companies posting solid returns and had a strong outlook. But how did these stocks perform over the years? Was Kanye West’s stock portfolio really able to beat the market like many had predicted at the time? In this post we decided to evaluate the returns of Kanye West’s stock portfolio and compare them to Warren Buffett’s stock portfolio returns. While some might call this an unfair comparison, we believe it’d be an interesting exercise since Kanye West’s business skills aren’t a secret. The 45-year rapper has started many businesses and ventures over these years. He has an estimated worth of about $400 million.Kanye West's Business AcumenYeezy, which Ye started in collaboration with Adidas, is perhaps the biggest business venture of the rapper which has pocketed him millions of dollars. While the partnership has run into trouble, some latest media reports claimed that Ye made about $25 million just from the sale of leftover Yeezy stock. Some other notable ventures of Ye include creative agency Donda and independent record label Good Music. He has also reportedly bought fast food restaurants in the past through his company KW Foods.Story continuesBut it comes to Warren Buffett, his investment philosophy and impeccable record of beating the market hardly needs any introduction since we have talked about these topics in detail previously in our articles. For this article we were interested in taking a look at what Buffett was talking about in his letter to shareholders in 2017, the year for which we use his stock portfolio in our article. And we were not surprised to see that Buffett in 2017 was repeating the same, age-old and time-tested investment mantras which have served him so well over all these years.Take a look at the humility of Buffett when he talks about his “secrets” of success.“Charlie and I view the marketable common stocks that Berkshire owns as interests in businesses, not as ticker symbols to be bought or sold based on their “chart” patterns, the “target” prices of analysts or the opinions of media pundits. Instead, we simply believe that if the businesses of the investees are successful (as we believe most will be) our investments will be successful as well. Sometimes the payoffs to us will be modest; occasionally the cash register will ring loudly. And sometimes I will make expensive mistakes. Overall – and over time – we should get decent results. In America, equity investors have the wind at their back. From our stock portfolio – call our holdings “minority interests” in a diversified group of publicly-owned businesses – Berkshire received $3.7 billion of dividends in 2017. That’s the number included in our GAAP figures, as well as in the “operating earnings” we reference in our quarterly and annual reports. That dividend figure, however, far understates the “true” earnings emanating from our stock holdings. For decades, we have stated in Principle 6 of our “Owner-Related Business Principles” that we expect undistributed earnings of our investees to deliver us at least equivalent earnings by way of subsequent capital gains. Our recognition of capital gains (and losses) will be lumpy, particularly as we conform with the new GAAP rule requiring us to constantly record unrealized gains or losses in our earnings. I feel confident, however, that the earnings retained by our investees will over time, and with our investees viewed as a group, translate into commensurate capital gains for Berkshire. The connection of value-building to retained earnings that I’ve just described will be impossible to detect in the short term. Stocks surge and swoon, seemingly untethered to any year-to-year buildup in their underlying value. Over time, however, Ben Graham’s oft-quoted maxim proves true: “In the short run, the market is a voting machine; in the long run, however, it becomes a weighing machine.”Kanye West Stock Portfolio vs. Warren Buffett Stock PortfolioKanye West Photo Credit: David ShankboneOur MethodologyFor this article, we first discussed Kanye West’s five stock picks based on the gifts he gave to Kim Kardashian in 2017. The details of these stocks were reported by several media outlets. We then mentioned the top 5 stock picks of Warren Buffett using his Q4’2017 portfolio. We then compared equal-weighted returns of both these stock portfolios.Kanye West Stock Portfolio vs. Warren Buffett Stock Portfolio First, we take a look at Kanye West's stock portfolio.adidas AG (OTC:ADDYY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: N/AAccording to media reports Kanye West gifted around 1015 shares of Adidas to Kim Kardashian for the 2017 Christmas. As of June 4 the stock was trading at around $85.79, while its price back in December 2017 stood at around $98.46. The stock’s return is a negative 12.86% during the period starting from late December until June 4.Here is what Polen International Growth Fund has to say about adidas AG (NYSE:ADDYY) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“We added to the Portfolio’s position in adidas AG as we believe the company’s management team is making strides in positioning the company for faster growth. Innovative product development, along with interesting design and marketing collaboration initiatives, have been unlocking the company’s growth potential.We also believe the continuing shift away from wholesale distribution to direct-to-consumer sales should drive steady margin progress. We estimate that adidas will grow earnings in the high teens annually over the next five years.”Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 243Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s stock price on December 25 was around $58.52 while today the stock price stands at $124.25. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has returned more than 112% during this period. This way, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was one of the best stock picks of Kanye West.Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also highly popular among hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, 243 hedge funds had stakes in the company. The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Amazon during this period was Natixis Global Asset Management’s Harris Associates which owns a $2.4 billion stake in the company.Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 131Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is another top performer in Kanye West stock portfolio. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares were trading at approximately $42.70 as of December 25, 2017, while today the stock price stands at $180.95. Apple has returned about 320% in this period.Hedge funds also love Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, 131 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Apple was, you guessed it, Warren Buffett, who had a $151 billion stake in the company. We will talk about Warren Buffett’s stake in Apple in the second part of this article.Loop Capital recently reduced its rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) citing the company’s decreased targets for iPhone shipments for June. However, the firm kept its price target of $180 on the stock.The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 95Kanye West had gifted around 950 shares of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) to Kim Kardashian back in December 2017. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) was trading at around $108 at that time. Today, Disney’s stock price is $90.77. Clearly, it wasn’t a wise bet from Kanye, since the stock posted losses of about 15% during this period.Nevertheless The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) remains one of the most popular stocks among elite hedge funds in America and analysts believe the stock has a strong potential to grow. Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds shows that 95 hedge funds had stakes in the company as of the end of March this year. The most significant shareholder of the company was Trian Partners of Nelson Peltz which owns a $592 million stake in the company.Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108Back in 2017, when Kanye West gifted Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares to Kim Kardashian, the streaming company was looking like it won’t ever see a decline. Everyone was flocking to Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and the company was the dominant player in the industry. Its subscribers were growing exponentially. The stock was trading at around $532 near the end of December 2017. Fast forward to today, the stock has plummeted to $400, as the company started to lose subscribers to competitors and faced growth challenges. Since December 2017 the stock has lost about 25%.Bloomberg recently reported that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) shareholders have rejected compensation packages for the company’s top executives.

Similarly, Dropbox gave out free cloud storage, Amazon offered free shipping for orders over $25, and Uber and Lyft raced to be the cheapest car services around.Now, we’re starting to see what happens when the music stops. The combination of global political uncertainty, inflation, the end of low interest rates, and a million other factors besides has resulted in a grand belt-tightening across Silicon Valley. That’s resulted in layoffs, canceled product lines, reduced spending, and even the divestment of once-prized acquisitions.The net result: the end of tech’s era of peace, love, and freebies—and the beginning of what you might call the Big Squeeze. From Netflix to Reddit to Twitter and beyond, the signs are everywhere that the days of seemingly unlimited tech largesse are rapidly coming to an end.In its place, we’re seeing the rise of a new trend, as tech giants increasingly search for ways to charge for things that used to be free, hike prices, and generally make more money from their existing customers quickly.Netflix’s password-sharing dilemmaThe swirling controversy around Netflix’s password-sharing crackdown is probably the most visible example of the ways tech is getting squeezed, and then squeezing in turn.Netflix’s whole pitch, back when it launched in 1997, was that unlike Blockbuster and other video stores, it didn’t charge late fees. A decade later, Netflix offered Watch Instantly, the first incarnation of the modern streaming model—and consciously turned a blind eye to password sharing, letting its users go wild giving access to their account to whomever they pleased.“We’re doing fine as it is,” Netflix founder and then-CEO Reed Hastings said in 2016, when investors asked about the possibility of cracking down on the practice.Story continuesThat was true, right up until it wasn’t. Last year was particularly rough for the streaming giant, as it shed subscribers amid increased competition, a tougher economy, and a return-to-office world that suddenly had less time to watch TV. And so, in February of this year, Netflix started to do the previously unthinkable, as it started to charge for accounts used in multiple households. The company went after freeloaders in Portugal, Spain, Canada, and New Zealand, and a few months later extended the move to the U.S.The thing is that it worked: Despite all the grumbling, Netflix subscriptions spiked in the immediate aftermath of the crackdown. The company squeezed its customers out gently, but firmly, and won.While their businesses are very different from Netflix’s, you can also see this sort of thinking in Meta’s and Twitter’s recent moves to charge users for a coveted verification mark, a digital ornament that was once free but available only to certain users.In both cases, Meta and Twitter are promising new benefits for paid subscribers beyond the check mark (better customer support for Meta Verified subscribers; editable tweets and fewer ads for Twitter Blue users). Perhaps more starkly, Twitter went so far as to disable its users’ SMS two-factor authentication, an important security practice, unless they paid an extra $8 per month for Twitter Blue.It remains to be seen if this kind of squeeze will pay off for the social media companies as well as it has for Netflix, but it comes from the same place. With advertising revenues harder to come by, and growth not what it once was for either company, new revenue streams are needed.If you’re feeling queasy it’s probably because you’re thinking of the last time you got on an airplane. Want to check a bag? Pay extra. Something to eat? That’s extra. More legroom? Also extra.And remember, when it comes to advertising-based internet services, you’re already paying your way by allowing yourself to be targeted with ads.The internet’s plumbing is getting squeezed out, tooA less obvious, but arguably more impactful, sign of this squeeze is what’s happening with the relationship between software developers and services like Twitter or Reddit. Both companies encouraged developers to build tools that either enhanced the user experience, or even that outright replaced their own apps and websites.Twitter’s relationship with developers has had its ups and downs over the years, but the platform has long hosted a flourishing ecosystem of apps like Block Party and Tweetbot. Reddit users, meanwhile, have had the option of browsing the site through unofficial mobile apps like Reddit Is Fun and Apollo, with the benevolent approval of Reddit itself.Over the past several months, though, that’s changed dramatically. Under Elon Musk, Twitter dramatically hiked prices for its API—short for application programming interface, the connector that lets apps “talk” to each other—and cut off the free tier, effectively killing off its entire developer ecosystem. Block Party left the Twitter ecosystem entirely, while popular apps Twitterrific and Tweetbot offered its users refunds (but asked them to consider not taking one, to help cover costs as they shut down).Reddit followed a similar path earlier this month, spurring a dramatic user uprising across the site that’s still ongoing. Steve Huffman, the CEO and cofounder of Reddit, has cited Musk as an inspiration behind the company’s decision to suddenly stop allowing developers to tap into the site’s API for free. The developer of Apollo said that running his app would cost $20 million a year after the changes. The reaction from Reddit users has been ugly, to say the least.Notably, both Musk and Huffman have cited the notion that their respective APIs are being used to train A.I. systems like OpenAI’s ChatGPT without remuneration. Also notably, both Reddit and Twitter are said to have hit ad sales slowdowns ahead of their respective decisions to hike API prices.Either way, the fact remains: Something that was free is now paid, with users and developers the ones to really feel the squeeze. And at least for now, it seems clear that the only thing to do is get used to it.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Does unlimited access to the movies and shows offered by Netflix justify the cost of a subscription, and with all the other monthly obligations, is Netflix worth it?$10,000 Quarter: This 1999 Georgia Coin Is Worth Big Money Because of an ErrorLearn: How To Build Your Savings From ScratchThat, of course, depends on you, your budget, your streaming habits and whether or not you already subscribe to one of Netflix’s many competitors. Only you know if Netflix’s impressive catalog of content is worth the cost of joining. Here’s what you need to consider before you decide.Netflix Is No Longer the US King of StreamingNetflix has an enormous worldwide subscriber base with 233 million in 190-plus countries. But in the United States, the number of paid streamers was 74.4 million in the first quarter of 2023 – a drop of about 200,000 from the same quarter in 2022, according to Statista. And Netflix has fallen behind Amazon Prime Video when it comes to streaming on demand services and market share.In the first quarter of 2023 Prime had 21% of market share, per Statista. Netflix and Disney+ had market shares of 20% and 15%, respectively.But the second quarter results could hold some positive changes for Netflix.Read: 6 Household Staples That Are a Waste of MoneyNetflix Has Cracked Down on Password SharingNetflix notified its subscribers in March that it was updating its policy pertaining to password sharing. Instead of letting your aunt in California and your daughter in Pennsylvania sign in via your password, Netflix took away that ability, limiting access to the streaming service to only those people living in your household.In the aftermath, Netflix had back-to-back days of nearly 100,000 signups each day, Antenna reported, meaning Netflix could return its title as top streaming service.Story continuesIs the Price Worth It?Netflix offers four subscription tiers:Standard with ads: $6.99 per month Two streams, full high def (1080p)Basic: $9.99 per month One stream, standard high def (720p)Standard: $15.49 per month Two simultaneous streams, full high def (1080p)Premium: $19.99 per month Four simultaneous streams, ultra high def/4K (2160p)Note that definition is limited by the capabilities of your devices. To watch streaming in 4K, for example, your device must be able to display 2160p resolution. Also, subscription fees are per household.If you’d like to add a person to your account who lives outside your household, that’s possible for a fee. Holders of standard accounts may add one extra member, and premium account members can sign up two people. Either way, the fee is $7.99 per month for each additional member.Netflix Satisfies the Industry StandardNetflix checks most of the boxes that people have come to expect from streaming services. With Netflix:You can downgrade and upgrade to a different plan at any time.You can download shows and movies so you can watch offline, on some plans.There are no contracts and no commitments — you can cancel anytime.You can stream Netflix on just about any device that supports the Netflix app or a compatible web browser.No Live EventsNetflix is not designed for cord-cutters looking to replace cable and live TV. There is no news, no sports, no Thanksgiving Day parade, no annual tree-lighting ceremony, no Oscars, no live events of any kind and no channel surfing.The Catalog Has ShrunkNetflix subscribers now have far fewer titles to choose from than they did in years past. That, however, isn’t necessarily a bad thing.According to Politico’s tech and media publication Protocol, Netflix’s catalog is shrinking by design. When Netflix was just getting started, it was forced to license hundreds of titles at the same time through bulk catalogs. Netflix is a far more mature service now and it has shifted to a quality-over-quantity philosophy, cleaned out the clutter and let many of those junky bulk licenses expire.Prime’s Movie and TV Library Is BiggerPrime Video offers a higher quantity of TV shows and movies, 7,429 in its U.S. catalog, more than Netflix’s 7,318, according to a January 2023 report from Statista.Both beat out Hulu (6,741), Discovery+ (6,203), Peacock (4,908), Paramount+ (4,449), Max (4.207) and Disney+ (1,868).Netflix’s TV Catalog Is as Impressive as Its Stable of MoviesAccording to Statista, Discovery+ is the leader in TV shows in its library – 6,203 as it doesn’t have movies, followed by Hulu (4,515), Netflix (3,618), Peacock (3,030) and Prime Video (2,277), falling off from there.Netflix Has the Most Original Shows by a Long ShotNetflix has produced and released more than 1,500 original TV shows and movies, according to Comparitech. That’s a mammoth number, considering that the No. 2 contender, Amazon Prime, produces a fraction of that and no other streaming service comes close.Netflix has increased its spending on original content with shows like “Stranger Things” and “The Crown” costing $12 million and $13 million to produce per episode, respectively, per Comparatech.Netflix is expected to spend $17 billion on content in 2023, trailing Warner Bros. Discovery ($20 billion) but ahead of Amazon ($10 billion), IndieWire reported.That Content Wins Lots of AwardsIn 2013, something brand new happened that would have been deemed impossible before — a web-based TV series available only through online streaming won a Primetime Emmy. The show was “House of Cards,” and the streaming service, of course, was Netflix. Its director beat out Showtime’s “Homeland,” HBO’s “Boardwalk Empire,” “Breaking Bad” and “Downton Abbey.”It was a watershed moment.That year, Netflix received 13 Primetime Emmy nominations. Three years later in 2016, Netflix received 160 nominations. According to figures compiled by Statista, Netflix was nominated for 105 Emmys and won 26 in 2022. The previous year, Netflix took home 44 Emmy Awards in 129 nominations.Since 2013, Netflix released both movies and series that were nominated for and sometimes won Golden Globes, Grammys and Academy Awards. Among them are:“Bridgerton”“The Irishman”“Marriage Story”“Mudbound”“Orange Is the New Black”“The Two Popes”“Making a Murderer”“Stranger Things”“The Queen’s Gambit”“Ozark”“The Great British Baking Show”Traveling Can Be a PainMuch of Netflix’s content is regional, and if you leave the States, you’ll notice that your library and streaming options have changed. You might even find that some or all of your content is blacked out. If you’re thinking that you’ll just solve the problem by using a VPN to trick Netflix into thinking you’re still at home, think again. Netflix is having none of it, and its technology is excellent at detecting most VPN services.Netflix Has Secret Search CodesNetflix has a secret search feature that lets users scour the platform for their favorite shows and movies on a granular level. If you know the numerical codes – which you can find with a simple Google search — you can unlock all kinds of great hidden content. Netflix has tons of subgenres, but they’re not easy to find without the codes. Just find the subgenre you like, type the corresponding number into the search bar, and prepare to be wowed.You Can Still Rent DVDs If You’d LikeWhen Netflix started out in 1997, it was a mail-order DVD rental subscription service, and the company says it has sent out more than 5 billion DVD and Blu-ray rentals. Although waiting for an envelope with a disc inside to arrive in the mail might seem a bit primitive now, it’s important to remember that the chief competition at that time was Blockbuster Video. With that business model, you had to show up to your local store and rent whatever it had in stock.High-bandwidth streaming made that format irrelevant — for most. Hundreds of thousands of subscribers are still in it for the DVDs. Netflix actually still offers three different DVD mailer subscription tiers through DVD.com:Basic: $9.99 per month for one DVD out at a timeStandard: $14.99 per month for two DVDs out at a timePremium: $19.99 per month for three DVDs out at a timeYou can include Blu-ray discs if you’d like, and you can hang on to your rental as long as you want. There are no late fees and no shipping fees, and you can cancel anytime.Bottom Line: Is It Worth It To Pay for Netflix?For millions of subscribers, Netflix is worth the cost of membership. Its library of movies and TV series is bigger than those of all its major competitors except for Amazon, but the Netflix library is curated, uncluttered and streamlined on a user-friendly platform.Its original content leads the industry and includes everything from stand-up comedy to original horror series. Netflix studio productions routinely bring home major awards that until recently were reserved for the likes of HBO and the big Hollywood studios.There are, however, some drawbacks. Netflix doesn’t offer live TV, which means it’s purely an add-on for anyone who enjoys traditional channel-surfing. It is not a cable alternative for cord-cutters and provides only a stand-alone service.Prime Video, for example, comes as part of a bundle of services packaged into the standard Amazon Prime subscription and the NFL’s Thursday night football offering. Hulu’s library of content and original programming is included with its live TV streaming service. Therefore, anyone who already subscribes to Prime or Hulu — or one of the many other streaming services with overlapping content — might have a hard time justifying an a la carte subscription to Netflix when looking for places to trim the household budget.More From GOBankingRatesMark Cuban Says This Is the No. 1 Thing To Do To Build WealthWhy Home Prices Are Plummeting in These 6 Cities3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000Financial Goals That Are Easy To Stick To All YearDaria Uhlig and Andrew Lisa contributed to the reporting for this article.Editorial Note: This content is not provided by any entity covered in this article.

After all, who doesn’t love getting paid?Of course, income-focused investors commonly gravitate toward stocks with a history of dividend growth, as the payouts can quickly add up.Three companies – Caterpillar, The TJX Companies and Lockheed Martin – have all displayed a shareholder-friendly nature with a track record of increased payouts.In addition, all three have enjoyed positive earnings estimate revisions, indicating near-term optimism among analysts. For those interested in reaping a passive income stream, let’s take a closer look at each.CaterpillarCaterpillar is the world's leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, off-highway diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines, and diesel-electric locomotives. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), with earnings estimates increasing across the board.Caterpillar holds the rank of a Dividend Aristocrat, reflecting an unparalleled commitment to shareholders through 25+ years of increased payouts. Shares currently yield 2.1% annually, nicely above the Zacks Industrial Products sector average.In addition, the company continues to buy back its shares at a rapid pace, another shareholder-friendly move. Just in 2022, Caterpillar authorized a sizable $15 billion share repurchase program.The TJX CompaniesThe TJX Companies is a leading off-price apparel and home fashion retailer in the U.S. and worldwide. The company’s earnings outlook has improved across several timeframes, helping land it into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).TJX’s payout has grown by an impressive 11% over the last five years, with shares currently yielding 1.6% annually. Further, the company’s 37% payout ratio resides on the sustainable side.Story continuesThe company continues to grow steadily, with estimates calling for 15% earnings growth on 7% higher revenues in its current fiscal year (FY24).

KR has once again demonstrated its commitment to rewarding shareholders by approving an increase in its annual dividend to $1.16 from $1.04. This dividend boost represents a 12% increase. The quarterly dividend of 29 cents per share will be paid out on Sep 1, 2023, to shareholders of record as of Aug 15, 2023.Kroger's dividend payment history is truly remarkable, with this year's increase marking the 17th consecutive year of dividend growth.

126,504adf61-a9e0-357e-83ad-9b35ece7f03a,AMGN,2023-06-27,Does Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) Have A Healthy Balance Sheet?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-amgen-nasdaq-amgn-healthy-110040689.html,1687863640,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We can see that Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) does use debt in its business. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.When Is Debt A Problem?Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. View our latest analysis for Amgen How Much Debt Does Amgen Carry?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at March 2023 Amgen had debt of US$61.6b, up from US$36.9b in one year. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$31.6b, its net debt is less, at about US$30.0b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Amgen's LiabilitiesZooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Amgen had liabilities of US$14.2b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$69.2b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$31.6b and US$5.74b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$46.1b.While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since Amgen has a huge market capitalization of US$120.1b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution.Story continuesIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.Amgen has net debt worth 2.3 times EBITDA, which isn't too much, but its interest cover looks a bit on the low side, with EBIT at only 5.8 times the interest expense. While that doesn't worry us too much, it does suggest the interest payments are somewhat of a burden. Importantly Amgen's EBIT was essentially flat over the last twelve months. Ideally it can diminish its debt load by kick-starting earnings growth. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Amgen can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. During the last three years, Amgen generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 91% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.Our ViewOn our analysis Amgen's conversion of EBIT to free cash flow should signal that it won't have too much trouble with its debt. However, our other observations weren't so heartening. For example, its net debt to EBITDA makes us a little nervous about its debt. Considering this range of data points, we think Amgen is in a good position to manage its debt levels. Having said that, the load is sufficiently heavy that we would recommend any shareholders keep a close eye on it. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Amgen that you should be aware of before investing here.If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay.Have feedback on this article?

The firm’s projected earnings-per-share for fiscal 2023 is $4.95, pointing to a 20% year-over-year growth rate, slightly higher than its previous estimate of roughly 18%.Despite some minor shortcomings in its recent earnings report, PayPal demonstrated a 10% year-over-year growth in total payment volume, which amounted to a whopping $355 billion.

Additionally, with its recent acquisition of Newcrest Mining Limited, valued at approximately $19 billion, it has added a treasure trove of Tier-1 jurisdiction assets to its portfolio, further solidifying its dominance in the mining sphere.Furthermore, Newmont has effectively positioned itself to capitalize on the anticipated gold price rallies, expecting a $400 million increase in free cash flow for every $100 rise in the gold price. This boost is bound to bolster dividends and enhance credit metrics, thereby leading to an uptick in valuations. In addition, Newmont is poised to reduce its all-in-sustaining cost, setting the stage for healthy EBITDA margin expansion. Hence, with these promising prospects, Newmont presents an exciting opportunity for the astute investor.Albemarle (ALB)Lithium element on the periodic table. Undervalued Lithium StocksSource: tunasalmon / ShutterstockAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) is arguably one of the best secondary plays in the burgeoning electric vehicle space. Its powerful lithium segment, a key component in EV batteries, has driven its cash flow expansion. As EV adoption accelerates, a lithium supply gap looms on the horizon, and the firm is strategically positioned to capitalize on this trend.A glimpse into Albemarle’s progress reveals an impressive growth trajectory. In 2019, it reported a lithium conversion capacity of 85ktpa, but by 2022, this capacity had more than doubled to 200ktpa. Moreover, by 2027, it aims for a whopping 550ktpa capacity. As a result, robust revenue and EBITDA growth are expected for the foreseeable future. Despite a relative dip in lithium prices in 2023, Albemarle continues to deliver stellar growth across both lines. Additionally, it boasts a dividend profile marked by 28 years of consecutive payout growth.Apple (AAPL)Apple store. Apple Inc.

With its timeless products, such as the iPhone, contributing over half of company revenues, it has built a massive cash war chest, making it a relatively safe bet.Recently, Apple unveiled its $3,500 AR/VR headset, perhaps its most significant leap in product innovation in the past decade. In tandem with this, there’s plenty of buzz around the potential launch of an electric car by 2026. Diversification is key for the firm, particularly with its services and wearables divisions, predicted to swell in the coming years, and its foray into massive new growth markets such as India. Furthermore, it reported a whopping $62.6 billion in operating cash flows in the first half of fiscal 2023 and an impressive $167 billion in cash and equivalents.

It delivered a whopping $31.7 billion in free cash flows last year, almost a 72% bump on a year-over-year basis. Though oil prices have dropped from their peak last year, they have held up remarkably well, offering incredible upside ahead for its shareholders.Moreover, Chevron continues to focus on delivering value to shareholders. This is evident in its share buybacks and a handsome dividend yielding over 3.8%. In its first quarter, it committed to returning a staggering $2.9 billion in dividends and repurchasing $3.75 billion worth of shares to its stockholders. Also, it delivered an incredible $6.7 billion profit, outpacing market expectations and coming significantly ahead of the previous year’s $6.5 billion.

The firm’s in-house approach and unwavering efforts to slash costs have fueled its massive success. Self-designing components and materials, Tesla has effectively bypassed the need for alternatives, trimming costs substantially along the way. Its strategy, coupled with an audacious goal of rolling out 20 million EVs annually, positions it for improved efficiency and escalating demand.The past half-decade has seen Tesla’s profit margin shift gears from a negative 20% to an impressive positive 13.7%. The earnings per share have followed suit, skyrocketing by a staggering 2,500%. Though this year’s earnings could potentially dip by double-digit margins, analysts forecast a robust rebound of 40% in 2024. Beyond EVs, Tesla is one of the leaders in the production of lithium-ion battery manufacturing, a critical player in the renewable energy transition. This technological prowess amplifies Tesla’s presence in the EV market, paving the way for ventures into other energy-related sectors and fueling further growth opportunities.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)medicine research, pharmaceutical background, LJPC stockSource: Sisacorn / Shutterstock.comJohnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is a long-standing titan in the healthcare sphere that has effectively carved out a lucrative niche in the high-margin pharmaceutical space. Its strategic emphasis has seen its pharmaceutical division account for a robust 54% of total revenue. Moreover, it experienced a 7% leap in adjusted sales to an amazing $13.4 billion in the first quarter. Standout drugs such as Stelara and Darzalex raked in over $2.2 billion each, underpinning its monstrous growth.Likewise, a recent pivotal move saw the firm spinning off its consumer wellness arm, Kenvue,  a decision that’s streamlined its corporate structure. This maneuver should fuel an enhanced valuation for both J&amp;J and Kenvue as independent entities. Layer that up with its sturdy 3% dividend yield and more than $13.5 billion in trailing free cash flow and you have a compelling case for J&amp;J’s continued dominance in the healthcare sphere.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing GuidelinesMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

If you go by the book, much of that has already come true. We have had two quarters of negative GDP growth and high inflation worldwide due to a shortage of tangible goods. The bulls use this as evidence that the worst is behind us. Most economists, however, believe that smart investors should always be on the lookout for stocks to sell. While a recession is not likely in 2023, the probability of it happening spikes to 68% by April 2024. The Federal Reserve has noted in its latest meeting that although they have paused for now, they are still considering two more rate hikes later this year. Even if that’s all bark and no bite, the economy still needs to digest the record increase in interest rates in the last one and a half years.Of course, that does not mean you should completely ignore the opportunities in the market. Many stocks still offer great value and upside potential with little downside risk. However, staying cautious of businesses in recession-prone sectors is critical when headwinds start brewing.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHere are three stocks to sell:Nordstrom (JWN)A Nordstrom (JWN) storefront in Toronto, Canada.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comNordstrom (NYSE:JWN) has been losing sales and market share for years, and its debt load is unsustainable. The company has no competitive edge or growth potential and faces fierce competition from online and specialty retailers.Nordstrom’s revenue fell by 10.87% year-over-year to $3.18 billion in its latest reported quarter. The company’s losses widened to $205 million, or $1.28 per share, compared to a loss of $20 million, or $0.11 per share, in the same quarter last year. The net margin here is also negative in the negatives at -6.44%, which isn’t a promising metric for a “luxury” brand. Nordstrom’s main selling point is its customer service and shopping experience, but these are not enough to justify its premium prices and lower margins. The company has tried to differentiate itself by offering services like personal styling, curbside pickup and local market strategy, but these have not been enough to attract or retain customers.Story continuesNordstrom’s debt is another major concern for me. The company has some $4.5 billion in debt compared to just $581 million in cash. With so much cash burn, it is heavily reliant on debt to finance its operations and should headwinds get tougher, JWN will be in a very dangerous position.Thus, it is one of the top stocks to sell in my book. Hedge funds, insiders and Wall Street analysts unanimously agree that there is little opportunity here. It has had 8 “Hold” and 5 “Sell” ratings with zero “Buy” ratings.Wynn Resorts (WYNN)Casino stocks in Macau, China. Wynn Macau is a luxury hotel and casino resort operated by international resort developer Wynn Resorts. Casino Lisboa is owned by the STDM built in 1970.Source: Richie Chan / Shutterstock.comWynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) might’ve been a “wynner” so far this year, but it is time to dial back on this stock before it reverses course. Indeed, a lot of people would disagree with me here as we are amidst a travel boom, but I’d reiterate that this list is primarily for recession-prone stocks. Wynn is one pick that stands out among travel stocks as it still has big caveats to account for regardless of the recession catalyst.Wynn Resorts has $13.9 billion in total debt and a large chunk of that is floating rate. As Todd Shriber points out, the excessive leverage here can lead to this stock being “vulnerable in a recession.” One of my major concerns here is that Wynn is still not profitable (on a TTM basis) despite the recent travel boom unlike many of its peers. The quarterly profits it did manage are a hair above 0 at $32 million in Q4 and $12 million in Q1. With $1.4 billion in sales last quarter, it needs more profitability to offset the debt caveat. The 41 forward price-to-earnings multiple also means it’s richly priced in this range.ConocoPhillips (COP)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comRegarding stocks to sell, the energy industry is one that is often hit the hardest during a recession. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is one you should dump right now due to its rich valuation and bad financial metrics ahead. The price of natural gas has plunged and crude oil is also not in a good position right now. The company’s revenue has plunged by nearly 20% YoY in the last reported quarter and profits declined by almost 50% YoY. This is yet to be reflected in the share price as COP trades at very elevated levels with a forward P/E ratio of 11 times.Looking further, analysts expect sales to continue shrinking through 2025, and 2025 EPS is expected to be lower than what it is now at $8.95 vs $9.63 now. With abysmal growth potential and a rich valuation, even GuruFocus, a very bullish analysis tool, sets the fair price at $90 by 2026!On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This move lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.45%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.04%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 3.58%.Heading into today, shares of the online travel company had gained 8.76% over the past month, outpacing the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 5.3% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 5.01% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Expedia as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, Expedia is projected to report earnings of $2.40 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 22.45%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $3.36 billion, up 5.53% from the year-ago period.EXPE's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $9.14 per share and revenue of $12.89 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +34.61% and +10.46%, respectively.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Expedia. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 1.71% lower within the past month. Expedia is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Valuation is also important, so investors should note that Expedia has a Forward P/E ratio of 11.47 right now. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 19.17, so we one might conclude that Expedia is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesMeanwhile, EXPE's PEG ratio is currently 1.15. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. EXPE's industry had an average PEG ratio of 0.95 as of yesterday's close.The Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 83, which puts it in the top 33% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

After all, who doesn’t love getting paid?Of course, income-focused investors commonly gravitate toward stocks with a history of dividend growth, as the payouts can quickly add up.Three companies – Caterpillar, The TJX Companies and Lockheed Martin – have all displayed a shareholder-friendly nature with a track record of increased payouts.In addition, all three have enjoyed positive earnings estimate revisions, indicating near-term optimism among analysts. For those interested in reaping a passive income stream, let’s take a closer look at each.CaterpillarCaterpillar is the world's leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, off-highway diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines, and diesel-electric locomotives. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), with earnings estimates increasing across the board.Caterpillar holds the rank of a Dividend Aristocrat, reflecting an unparalleled commitment to shareholders through 25+ years of increased payouts. Shares currently yield 2.1% annually, nicely above the Zacks Industrial Products sector average.In addition, the company continues to buy back its shares at a rapid pace, another shareholder-friendly move. Just in 2022, Caterpillar authorized a sizable $15 billion share repurchase program.The TJX CompaniesThe TJX Companies is a leading off-price apparel and home fashion retailer in the U.S. and worldwide. The company’s earnings outlook has improved across several timeframes, helping land it into a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).TJX’s payout has grown by an impressive 11% over the last five years, with shares currently yielding 1.6% annually. Further, the company’s 37% payout ratio resides on the sustainable side.Story continuesThe company continues to grow steadily, with estimates calling for 15% earnings growth on 7% higher revenues in its current fiscal year (FY24). And in FY25, earnings and revenue are forecasted to see growth of 10% and 5%, respectively.TJX’s 62.8% trailing twelve-month return on equity is certainly worth highlighting as well, reflecting a higher efficiency level in generating profits from existing assets relative to its peers.Lockheed MartinLockheed Martin is the largest defense contractor in the world. The company focuses on defense, space, intelligence, homeland security, information technology, and cyber security. The stock is presently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).LMT shares currently yield a solid 2.6% annually. Reflecting its shareholder-friendly nature, the company has grown its payout by almost 9% over the last five years.The defense titan has delivered better-than-expected results as of late, exceeding both earnings and revenue expectations in back-to-back releases. In fact, the average EPS surprise over the company’s last four quarters comes in at 7.5%.Shares aren’t stretched regarding valuation, with the current 16.9X forward earnings multiple sitting modestly above the five-year median and well beneath the Zacks Aerospace/Defense industry average. The stock carries a Style Score of “B” for Value.Bottom LineDividends provide a nice boost to any portfolio, helping to limit drawdowns in other positions and providing the opportunity for maximum returns through dividend reinvestment.And all three companies above – Caterpillar, The TJX Companies, and Lockheed Martin – have fully reflected their shareholder-friendly nature through dividend growth.In addition, all three sport a favorable Zacks Rank, indicating near-term optimism among analysts.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

The stock has fared better than the Zacks Construction sector and the S&amp;P 500 Index’s 23.6% and 14.4% rallies, respectively.The price surge was probably due to the news related to the new residential construction sector that demonstrated positive growth across various metrics. Building permits, housing starts, and housing completions all showed encouraging signs.

The company designs, markets, constructs and sells single-family homes and attached townhomes to first-time, millennial, move-up, empty-nester and luxury buyers under the M/I Homes brand name.Owing to this tailwind, the company has been benefiting, which is reflected in the homes closed. In the first quarter of 2023, homes delivered increased 10% to 2,007 homes. M/I Homes had 200 communities on Mar 31, 2023, compared to 176 communities on Mar 31, 2022.MHO increased first-quarter 2023 revenues by 16% to a record $1 billion, increased pre-tax income by 11% to $136 million and delivered 2,007 homes.

(NYSE:WEC) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 76%",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wec-energy-group-inc-nyse-103143775.html,1687861903,STORY,['WEC'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, WEC Energy Group's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsThe top 21 shareholders own 50% of the company Insiders have sold recently If you want to know who really controls WEC Energy Group, Inc. (NYSE:WEC), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 76% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of WEC Energy Group, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for WEC Energy Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About WEC Energy Group?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in WEC Energy Group. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of WEC Energy Group, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in WEC Energy Group. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 13%. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 9.4% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 5.8% of the company stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 21 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of WEC Energy GroupWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of WEC Energy Group, Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$43m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 24% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for WEC Energy Group  you should be aware of, and 1 of them is concerning.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Currently, Avista has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while WEC Energy Group has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that AVA's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.AVA currently has a forward P/E ratio of 16.56, while WEC has a forward P/E of 19.09. We also note that AVA has a PEG ratio of 2.61. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. WEC currently has a PEG ratio of 3.32.Another notable valuation metric for AVA is its P/B ratio of 1.15. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, WEC has a P/B of 2.32.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to AVA's Value grade of B and WEC's Value grade of C.Story continuesAVA is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

The report indicates that solar power accounted for around 1.5% of the total electricity generation in the state.Going forward, in the next five years, Indiana is likely to enhance its solar generation capacity by adding approximately 9,774 MW of solar assets. Thus, Duke Energy Indiana’ssolar expansion plans in the region, like the latest purchase from Ranger Power, are prudent. Duke Energy Indiana aims to elevate its solar generation capacity in the region by 2,218 MW of solar power and 450 MW of solar energy storage.Such an aggressive investment strategy will duly assist the company in diversifying its energy mix and achieving its goal of clean energy.Utilities’ Focus on Solar ExpansionUtilities in the United States are increasingly investing in solar technology, mainly to decarbonize their operations.

J&amp;J has said its talc products are safe and do not contain asbestos.Attorneys representing cancer victims, along with the U.S. Justice Department's bankruptcy watchdog, have called for LTL's second bankruptcy to be dismissed as an abuse of U.S. bankruptcy law. Cancer victims who oppose the bankruptcy settlement have said that the second bankruptcy recycles a failed legal strategy to keep their cases from being heard by juries.Starting on Tuesday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan in Trenton is due to hear several days of evidence and arguments before making a ruling. Kaplan, whose decision in support of LTL's first bankruptcy filing was overturned by the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, has said he expects to rule on whether to dismiss LTL's second bankruptcy by early August.LTL executives including chief legal officer John Kim are expected to testify on Tuesday. Jim Murdica, a lawyer who took part in negotiations on the $8.9 billion settlement on behalf of LTL and J&amp;J, and Mikal Watts, a lawyer for some plaintiffs, are expected to testify on Wednesday.Story continuesErik Haas, J&amp;J's worldwide vice president for litigation, said in a statement last week that the proposed bankruptcy settlement offers a fairer and faster resolution for cancer claimants than litigation in other courts.The attorneys who oppose J&amp;J's settlement offer argue that J&amp;J created the ""illusion"" of support by signing deals with plaintiffs' lawyers like Watts, who quickly signed up large numbers of clients without ever filing any lawsuits against J&amp;J.LTL's bankruptcy proceedings have paused the 38,000 lawsuits that were filed before October 2021. Kaplan has ruled that the second bankruptcy does not fully stop the talc litigation, letting one plaintiff's case to go to trial and allowing new complaints to be filed against LTL and J&amp;J as long as no other trials are scheduled without permission from the bankruptcy court.U.S. bankruptcy law typically shields debtors from lawsuits while they reorganize in bankruptcy. Bankruptcy judges have not always extended those protections to non-bankrupt parent companies like J&amp;J.(Reporting by Dietrich Knauth in New York; Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Will Dunham)]"

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Dow Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.In Tony Robbins’ Money – Master The Game, there’s a chapter titled Invest Like the .001%: The Billionaire’s Playbook. The chapter mentions the “secrets” behind wealth creation which Tony Robbins gathered after interviewing about 50 billionaires. These billionaires include Paul Tudor Jones, Warren Buffett, Carl Icahn, and many others. The chapter gives some really important lessons that give a sneak peek into billionaires’ thought process, their values and their peculiar nature that helped them stand out among millions of other people.For example, it’s a common notion that billionaires are always aggressive in nature when it comes to investments and they never shy away from making “risky” bets. But the first takeaway Robbins mentions in this chapter is that billionaires are “obsessed” with making sure they don’t lose money. Robbins sums up the reason behind this obsession by pointing to the value of time. The reason why billionaires emphatically try not to lose money is that if you lose 50%, according to Robbins, it would take 100% to get back to where you started, and all of that effort would require something that you can never get back: time.Another key takeaway from Tony Robbins’ interviews with billionaires is that billionaires are always looking to maximize their gains with as few risks as possible. This, again, is contrary to the common belief that billionaires are always looking to take big risks and they are willing to bet it all. Robbins says that the billionaires he interviewed are, without exception, looking for something that he calls “asymmetric risk/reward.” Here’s how the book sums up this lesson by quoting billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, whose total wealth today stands at $7.5 billion. Jones told Robbins that he doesn’t make an investment until he is sure of making $5 from every $1 invested.Story continues“And that, he says, is a $100,000 MBA in a nutshell!,” the book adds.Another excellent lesson Robbins got after interviewing famous billionaires was that the wealthy are good at making decisions based on the limited information they have. Robbins says that most talented people are not good investors since they don’t have the ability to make the most out of the limited information and by the time they get full information, the opportunity is no longer available.Perhaps the biggest and most important lesson we could learn from the billionaires Tony Robbins interviewed is that just having the humility to learn from your mistakes and improve yourself could exponentially increase your chances of success.“Contrary to what most people would expect, this group of achievers is never done! They’re never done learning, they’re never done earning, they’re never done growing, they’re never done giving! No matter how well they’ve done or how well they’ve continued to do, they never lose their hunger—the force that unleashes human genius. Most people would think, “If I had all this money, I would just stop. Why keep working?” Because each believes, somewhere in his or her soul, that “to whom much is given, much is expected.” Their labor is their love. Just like these money masters invest in different ways, they give back in different ways. They share their time, they share their money, they create foundations, they invest in others. Each of them has come to realize that true meaning in life comes from giving. They feel a responsibility to use their gifts to serve others. As Winston Churchill said, “We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give.” What unites them is the ultimate truth that life is about more than what you have. It’s really about what you have to give.”The key investing themes followed by billionaires according to Tony Robbins are clearly visible when we analyze the portfolios of some billionaire portfolios. Amid rising inflation and Federal Reserve’s rate hikes, several family office funds of famous billionaires started cutting their exposure to stocks. An analysis from Bloomberg earlier this year showed that billionaire George Soros’s fund was upping its hold in investment-grade bonds and selling stocks. Billionaire Soros’ fund sold 130 stocks during the fourth quarter of 2022 and bought less than 30. The fund’s selling spree continues as its Q1’2023 portfolio shows a plethora of stocks in which the fund exited its positions.The 2022 market crash didn’t spare even the billionaires and smart money managers, especially those who were piled into technology and growth stocks. Hedge funds led by famous billionaires and veteran investors, including D1 Capital’s Dan Sundheim, TCI’s Chris Hohn, Lone Pine Capital’s Stephen Mandel and Viking Global’s Andreas Halvorsen saw huge losses.On the other hand, 15 hedge funds in the industry made a whopping $14 billion in the same period through personal investments and hedge fund fees, according to Bloomberg These winners include billionaire Ken Griffin of Citadel, billionaire Steve Cohen of Point72, billionaire Israel Englander of Millennium Management, billionaire DE Shaw, billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, among others.When billionaires have to say something about the future trajectory and possibilities in the financial markets, the world listens. A stark warning about the future recently came from billionaire Cliff Asness of AQR Capital management, who, while talking to Bloomberg, highlighted the difference between the bond and stock markets when it comes to sentiment. The billionaire said that the bond market is indicating that the Federal Reserve could initiate aggressive rate cuts over the next one or two years. Asness thinks this could cause a recession.Dow Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up OnOur MethodologyFor this article, we first scanned  The Dow Jones Industrial Average and calculated the number of billionaire investors for each of the 30 stocks of the index.

He said he would have avoided J&amp;J's talc if he had been warned it contained asbestos, as his lawsuit alleges.J&amp;J has denied that its baby powder contained asbestos or causes cancer.Hernandez, 24, said he had recently changed his name to Emory, from Anthony, because he had hoped to use the name for his own future child.""I used it kind of like in honor of the potential kid that I could have had,"" he said.J&amp;J has argued in the case that Hernandez's illness, which affects the tissue around his heart rather than the more common form affecting the lungs, is extremely rare and has not been linked to asbestos exposure.Allison Brown, a lawyer for J&amp;J, in a cross-examination, asked Hernandez about how much he knew about his own case.Hernandez said he did not know much about the details of the lawsuit, and also that he did not personally buy baby powder or remember which specific products he used. He also said he did not remember his doctor ever telling him that baby powder caused his cancer.Earlier in the day, jurors heard from Hernandez's mother, Anna Camacho, who said she used large amounts of J&amp;J's baby powder on her son when he was a baby and through childhood. She cried as she described Hernandez's illness.""I do not wish this on any parent,"" she said.Hernandez's trial, expected to conclude later this week, comes as J&amp;J seeks to resolve thousands of similar talc lawsuits through a settlement.Story continuesJ&amp;J subsidiary LTL Management in April filed for bankruptcy in Trenton, New Jersey, proposing to pay $8.9 billion to settle more than 38,000 lawsuits, and prevent new cases from coming forward in the future. It is the company's second attempt to resolve talc claims in bankruptcy, after a federal appeals court rejected an earlier bid.Chief U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Michael Kaplan in New Jersey is expected to hold a hearing on Tuesday on whether to dismiss the latest bankruptcy as being filed in bad faith, as some talc plaintiffs and the U.S. government have argued.J&amp;J has said the proposed bankruptcy settlement offers a fairer and faster resolution for cancer claimants than litigation in other courts.Litigation has largely been halted during bankruptcy proceedings, but Kaplan allowed Hernandez's trial to go ahead because he is expected to live only a short time.Even if Hernandez wins, he will not be able to collect on the judgment while the bankruptcy is ongoing, though the case could affect future settlement negotiations.J&amp;J said in bankruptcy court filings that the costs of its talc-related verdicts, settlements and legal fees have soared to about $4.5 billion.(Reporting by Brendan Pierson in New York; Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Matthew Lewis)]"

This grim outlook for the rest of the year provided by the Fed has dampened investor mood, and currently, there is a majoritarian view that rate hike may be resumed as early as July.Regardless of market conditions, we, here at Zacks, provide investors with unbiased guidance on how to beat the market.

To help, Abzueta joined a committee and led volunteers to do more.With each effort, the team logged their hours with the Medtronic Foundation. The small - but mighty - team continued to take on new projects, but found itself hitting barriers when trying to engage a majority of the local workforce.In efforts to engage manufacturing employees in the DR and Mexico, the Medtronic Foundation reached out with an opportunity with Glasswing International, an organization that addresses the root causes and consequences of poverty through education and health programs that empower youth and communities.For Abzueta, the goal was to make a local school feel like a safe and inviting place that could also function as a community center for families - many of whom work at Medtronic.Almost 200 employees in Mexico and the DR came together to give three schools a makeover in three days. A majority of volunteers were manufacturing employees. They painted, built - and filled - bookshelves, and planted trees.Revitalizing schools is about more than beautification. Studies show that a safe, healthy learning environment promotes attendance and helps students thrive socially, emotionally, and academically.And that matters in areas that have historically been under-funded, where kids can end up dropping out of school to find - sometimes dangerous - ways to support their families.""That's the impact of a project like this,"" said Mark Loyka, U.S. country director for Glasswing International.Glasswing was founded to get community members involved in volunteerism. As Loyka puts it, ""Who knows the community better than the community?""Story continues""We empower people to have that agency in their own community to drive change,"" he said. ""They want to make change and have local knowledge, plus there is a real community pride when you have a school that not only looks good but has the resources for the students to thrive.""And with the support of the Medtronic Foundation, which funded the initiative, Abzueta and her committee of local employee volunteers feel like they can do even more.""It's a lot of work,"" she said. ""But now with the help of a strong community, I don't feel alone even if the goal feels unattainable.""Even after the school makeovers wrapped up, the new relationship with Glasswing International, the local schools, and employees was just the beginning. They have stayed in touch and continue to deepen their efforts with Glasswing International - empowering communities and transforming lives.See our employees in action and learn more about our impact here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Medtronic on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: MedtronicWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/medtronicEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: MedtronicView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/763772/Medtronic-By-the-Community-for-the-Community]"

The system is approved for users seven years old and above with type 1 diabetes.One analysis presented at the ADA conference looked at the impact of the 780G system on 3,543 children aged 15 and younger. According to the results, using Medtronic's tech helped the kids achieve an average time spent within a healthy glucose range of about 74%.Those results climbed to 78% when they used the system's recommended settings, aiming to achieve 100 milligrams of glucose per deciliter of blood and two hours of active insulin time.Another analysis was on 2,516 kids aged 15 and younger in Europe, who were grouped according to their glycemic control before using the MiniMed system.Using Medtronic's tech—with the aforementioned recommended settings activated—helped them achieve an average time in the range of 64%, up from a baseline of just 41%.The group with the lowest Time in Range (poorest glycemic control) before SmartGuard technology had the largest increase of 23.3% in Time in Range, while patients with the best metabolic control in SmartGuard technology achieved 80.6% Time in Range.Price Action: MDT shares are down 0.22% at $87.29 during the premarket session on the last check Monday.Don't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

The results were demonstrated at the 83rd American Diabetes Association (“ADA”) Scientific Sessions in San Diego, CA.The latest data sets showed that the proprietary Meal Detection technology of MiniMed 780G supported Time in Range outcomes, which exceeded consensus guidelines of 70%. Additionally, the system helps to reduce the percentage of time spent in hyperglycemia in children and adults.News in DetailThe data sets for the study evaluated the system across a wide range of users, including historically challenging younger patients not meeting glycemic goals and individuals using a simplified meal announcement, leveraging fixed carbohydrate amounts instead of exact carb calculations.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe study outcome suggested that the reduced accuracy in carb counting can be overcome by the increased automated insulin delivery provided by the MiniMed 780G system. The system also benefits those who cannot or do not input their carbs precisely, to reach glycemic goals and reduce hyperglycemia.The real-world evidence of pediatric users in Europe and Latin America using the MiniMed 780G system with recommended settings proved to be strong. A separate analysis of the real-world evidence of pediatric users in Europe demonstrated improved glycemic performance in SmartGuard technology regardless of baseline glycemic control.Additionally, the real-world data on the Medtronic Extended Infusion Set mirrors results from the U.S. pivotal trial and delivers a reduced user burden through less frequent infusion set changes.The favorable impact of the MiniMed 780G system on the clinical outcome and the quality of life is evidenced by MDT’s randomized controlled ADAPT study and the growing body of real-world evidence from around the world.Industry ProspectsPer a Research report, the global automated insulin delivery system market was valued at $821.4 million in 2023 and is expected to witness a CAGR of 9.8% by 2030.Story continuesRecent DevelopmentsEarlier in May 2023, Medtronic entered into a definitive agreement to acquire EOFlow Co.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Dow Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.In Tony Robbins’ Money – Master The Game, there’s a chapter titled Invest Like the .001%: The Billionaire’s Playbook. The chapter mentions the “secrets” behind wealth creation which Tony Robbins gathered after interviewing about 50 billionaires. These billionaires include Paul Tudor Jones, Warren Buffett, Carl Icahn, and many others. The chapter gives some really important lessons that give a sneak peek into billionaires’ thought process, their values and their peculiar nature that helped them stand out among millions of other people.For example, it’s a common notion that billionaires are always aggressive in nature when it comes to investments and they never shy away from making “risky” bets. But the first takeaway Robbins mentions in this chapter is that billionaires are “obsessed” with making sure they don’t lose money. Robbins sums up the reason behind this obsession by pointing to the value of time. The reason why billionaires emphatically try not to lose money is that if you lose 50%, according to Robbins, it would take 100% to get back to where you started, and all of that effort would require something that you can never get back: time.Another key takeaway from Tony Robbins’ interviews with billionaires is that billionaires are always looking to maximize their gains with as few risks as possible. This, again, is contrary to the common belief that billionaires are always looking to take big risks and they are willing to bet it all. Robbins says that the billionaires he interviewed are, without exception, looking for something that he calls “asymmetric risk/reward.” Here’s how the book sums up this lesson by quoting billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, whose total wealth today stands at $7.5 billion. Jones told Robbins that he doesn’t make an investment until he is sure of making $5 from every $1 invested.Story continues“And that, he says, is a $100,000 MBA in a nutshell!,” the book adds.Another excellent lesson Robbins got after interviewing famous billionaires was that the wealthy are good at making decisions based on the limited information they have. Robbins says that most talented people are not good investors since they don’t have the ability to make the most out of the limited information and by the time they get full information, the opportunity is no longer available.Perhaps the biggest and most important lesson we could learn from the billionaires Tony Robbins interviewed is that just having the humility to learn from your mistakes and improve yourself could exponentially increase your chances of success.“Contrary to what most people would expect, this group of achievers is never done! They’re never done learning, they’re never done earning, they’re never done growing, they’re never done giving! No matter how well they’ve done or how well they’ve continued to do, they never lose their hunger—the force that unleashes human genius. Most people would think, “If I had all this money, I would just stop. Why keep working?” Because each believes, somewhere in his or her soul, that “to whom much is given, much is expected.” Their labor is their love. Just like these money masters invest in different ways, they give back in different ways. They share their time, they share their money, they create foundations, they invest in others. Each of them has come to realize that true meaning in life comes from giving. They feel a responsibility to use their gifts to serve others. As Winston Churchill said, “We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give.” What unites them is the ultimate truth that life is about more than what you have. It’s really about what you have to give.”The key investing themes followed by billionaires according to Tony Robbins are clearly visible when we analyze the portfolios of some billionaire portfolios. Amid rising inflation and Federal Reserve’s rate hikes, several family office funds of famous billionaires started cutting their exposure to stocks. An analysis from Bloomberg earlier this year showed that billionaire George Soros’s fund was upping its hold in investment-grade bonds and selling stocks. Billionaire Soros’ fund sold 130 stocks during the fourth quarter of 2022 and bought less than 30. The fund’s selling spree continues as its Q1’2023 portfolio shows a plethora of stocks in which the fund exited its positions.The 2022 market crash didn’t spare even the billionaires and smart money managers, especially those who were piled into technology and growth stocks. Hedge funds led by famous billionaires and veteran investors, including D1 Capital’s Dan Sundheim, TCI’s Chris Hohn, Lone Pine Capital’s Stephen Mandel and Viking Global’s Andreas Halvorsen saw huge losses.On the other hand, 15 hedge funds in the industry made a whopping $14 billion in the same period through personal investments and hedge fund fees, according to Bloomberg These winners include billionaire Ken Griffin of Citadel, billionaire Steve Cohen of Point72, billionaire Israel Englander of Millennium Management, billionaire DE Shaw, billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, among others.When billionaires have to say something about the future trajectory and possibilities in the financial markets, the world listens. A stark warning about the future recently came from billionaire Cliff Asness of AQR Capital management, who, while talking to Bloomberg, highlighted the difference between the bond and stock markets when it comes to sentiment. The billionaire said that the bond market is indicating that the Federal Reserve could initiate aggressive rate cuts over the next one or two years. Asness thinks this could cause a recession.Dow Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up OnOur MethodologyFor this article, we first scanned  The Dow Jones Industrial Average and calculated the number of billionaire investors for each of the 30 stocks of the index.

Apple’s iOS operating system is the company’s unique intellectual property and competitive strength. This software drives particularly tight engagement with consumers and enterprises, which is fostering the growing purchase of high margin services like music, apps, and Apple Pay. While iPhone sales were down year-over-year (YoY). services revenues grew 7% YoY which was slightly above analyst estimates. Company earnings were also better-than-anticipated due to lower input costs, such as memory chips and cost control initiatives. Aside from production disruptions, negative sentiment had also weighed on shares as investors questioned how an economic slowdown would affect consumer demand for Apple products in 2023. However, management projected an acceleration in earnings for the fiscal first quarter, where they noted that iPhone and services growth should remain strong, along with encouraging impacts around product mix, lower input costs, and continued cost controls.”6.

To see more such companies, go directly to LeBron James Investment Portfolio: Top 5 Companies.In June 2022, NBA star LeBron James became a billionaire. Like many other achievements in his life, this one also had a peculiar element to it: no other active NBA player had achieved the billionaire status before.King James' journey to massive wealth started when he was getting ready to enter the league. At the age of 18 James had the foresight, financial wisdom and long-term outlook that is necessary for financial success in life. In his book about LeBron James, Jeff Benedict shares the interesting story of how three major companies, Reebok, adidas AG  (OTC:ADDYY) and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), were trying to woo James, who was just 18 at that time, to sign a deal with them. The biggest test for James came when Reebok put their $100 million offer on the table but LeBron James’ advisers still recommended him to decline the offer. Think about it. An 18-year old whose family had hitherto lived on food stamps and debt was offered $100 million but he’s asked to decline the offer. James did not resist his advisers and declined Rebook’s offer because he knew his actual worth even before he’d entered the league.""He Knows What’s About to Come to Him""To plug Benedict’s words:LeBron was at a loss for words. He’d just flown in from Akron. He lived in the projects. Their subsidized rent was around $22 a month. His mother was unemployed and had to pay for groceries with food stamps. The check in his hand offered an escape from all of that. It was an instant ticket to a new life. All he had to do was say yes. Gloria was ready to walk out with the check. Goodwin wanted everyone to take a beat. Reebok’s offer was off the charts. And Fireman had made a bold move by putting $10 million on the table. But this was a preemptive bid, one that was intended to preclude LeBron from talking to adidas AG  (OTC:ADDYY) and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE). Goodwin reminded LeBron that the game plan was to meet with all three companies before deciding. Fireman (Reebok CEO) and his team were disappointed. But they couldn’t help being impressed. Todd Krinsky (from Reebok) looked on in amazement as LeBron left Reebok’s headquarters that evening. He’s a man already, Krinsky thought. He knows what’s about to come to him.Story continuesAnother testament to James’ financial wisdom comes from the story of his acquaintance with Rich Paul, who later became his agent. LeBron James came to know Paul when he hadn’t even entered the league, at the age of 17. When James started his agreement with Cleveland Cavaliers in 2003, he hired Paul for a salary of $48,000 which he thought was an “investment” for the future.  New Yorker quotes James as saying:“I have always felt that he had a purpose, and that’s why I kept him around. I knew he was going to be something more than even what he thought he could possibly be at the time. It was just a feeling I had.”Precisely this ability of spotting opportunities before they become ripe is what made James a billionaire at the age of 37.Another important strength of LeBron James is his ability to keep the right people on his side while making key decisions in life. In addition to Rich Paul, other important people who played a role in important business decisions of James include Maverick Carter, who James made sure had a seat on the table while making deals with giants like NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) and Reebok when he was entering the league.The biggest headstart for LeBron James obviously came when he signed a deal with NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) back in 2003. The $90 million deal spanning seven years gave James $10 million at signing. After that wealth just kept coming for King James. It’s also important to note that Reebok was offering James more than NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) ( a whopping $25 million more), but James, yet again, played a master stroke by going with NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) as he knew that having Nike on his side would open many new opportunities for him later. That’s exactly what happened. A 2014 report from GQ said James made $300 million from LeBron 11 trainer shoes alone.Another obvious source of his wealth was NBA, where he remains the highest-paid player with an estimated earnings of $528 million.In the rest of the article, though, our focus would be the companies and specific investments which gave a significant boost to James’ wealth.LeBron James Investment Portfolio: How He Became a BillionaireEverett Collection / Shutterstock.com Our MethodologyIn this article, we take a look at some of the companies that played a key role in LeBron James’ path to wealth building and financial success. We picked companies which had/have partnerships with LeBron James, the ones in which he’d invested in and those which he started and later sold.LeBron James Investment Portfolio: How He Became a Billionaire10. TonalIn 2021, LeBron James joined Home gym equipment company Tonal as a brand partner and investor. Tonal was founded back in 2015. It has struggled to live up to the hype since its valuation has dropped to between $550 million and $600 million from a whopping $1.6 billion seen in 2021, according to a Wall Street Journal report. Tonal recently raised about $130 million in fresh funding from its existing investors. Tonal also announced a leadership change.

On the earnings front, General Mills, Nike, and Constellation Brands will report their quarterly results. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer breaks down what to look out for this week.Video TranscriptJULIA HYMAN: From consumer confidence to some key earnings reports, there is a lot for investors to unpack this week. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer is joining us now with the breakdown and some highlights here. Hey, Josh.JOSH SCHAFER: Hey, Julie. So we've got a fun calendar this week.- I like your calender.JOSH SCHAFER: --leading into the holiday. I'm excited for this calendar. We're taking a look at what we got on Tuesday. You're looking at new home sales there and consumer confidence from the conference board.I'm interested in that new home sales number, because that's something we're starting to see increasingly come up from economists when talking about persistent inflation and consumers' willingness to continue to buy high-priced things. Housing is one of those things, so curious to see what we see from both new home sales and those mortgage applications, and even pending home sales on Thursday. It's going to be interesting week in housing, as again, we're seeing that as an increasing thing, I'm seeing that as an increasing thing economists are attributing to persistent inflation.And then when we're talking about inflation, on Friday, we have the latest PC Index report. That is, of course, the inflation print that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has been consistently referencing as stubbornly high. So we'll get another reading of that this Friday, will be interesting to see where that number comes out. Right now economists project that month over month core PCE number, which strips out energy and food, to be about equal to what we saw last month, so not coming down, which overall, not a good read.Story continuesNow, if we take a look at some corporate stuff, too, we do have a couple of earnings this week, guys. We had Carnival out earlier today. And then we have interesting ones when you think about the COVID rebound, what's happening to these companies that sold a lot of vaccines and had a lot of vaccine distributions. That's Walgreens, that's Rite Aid, also just general consumer notes here when you think about General Mills and McCormick, what are people spending on, and are they buying shoes.I'm excited for Nike on Thursday-- you guys know I love Nike-- but also excited when you think about the overall retail environment and think about Nike and what they mean for retail. Does Nike still have inventory coming down. There's a lot of concerns that inventory might not be coming down at the faster pace that it was. There's also concerns of what we're seeing in the wholesale market.Nike also sells a lot to Foot Locker, who told us things weren't going so well. They sell a lot to Dick's-- excuse me-- Dick's Sporting Goods. How does that play out? And what do they say about the overall retail economy? Nike is considered a bellwether there. So we're excited for Thursday.- I like the charts you brought us today, Josh. Great stuff on the economic and earnings calendar. Josh Shafer, we appreciate you.]"

Nike was contesting the tribunal's decision to invalidate the company's proposed substitute patent elements based on arguments that Adidas had not raised at the time.Nike and Adidas have been involved in several patent fights over technology used in their shoes. Adidas petitioned the patent office tribunal to cancel one of Nike's patents related to making seamless knitted upper components for athletic sneakers in 2012.After the tribunal agreed to hear the case, Nike moved to cancel parts of its patent and substitute a less extensive patent claim. The board granted the cancellation request but denied its bid to amend the patent, citing earlier publications in the record that covered the same invention.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which specializes in patent cases, sent the case back to the board twice and rejected a third appeal by Nike last year. Nike told the Supreme Court in March that the board should not have been allowed to cancel a substitute patent element on its own accord based on arguments that Adidas had not raised at the time.Separately, the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board issued a ruling in May that the patent office tribunal improperly retaliated against administrative judge Michael Fitzpatrick after he protested the tribunal's decision to expand and then shrink the size of a panel of officials hearing the Nike case without telling either company.The Justice Department in May urged justices to consider remanding Nike's case to the Federal Circuit to give the company an opportunity to challenge the patent-invalidity decision based on the Merit Systems Protection Board's ruling.(Reporting by Blake Brittain in Washington; Editing by Will Dunham)]"

196,966c91b6-c9ce-313b-90a6-e118d367b5ec,WFC,2023-06-27,Wells Fargo's (NYSE:WFC) earnings growth rate lags the 19% CAGR delivered to shareholders,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wells-fargos-nyse-wfc-earnings-120145030.html,1687867305,STORY,['WFC'],"[By buying an index fund, investors can approximate the average market return. But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. Just take a look at Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC), which is up 58%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 35% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 3.7% , including dividends .Although Wells Fargo has shed US$4.9b from its market cap this week, let's take a look at its longer term fundamental trends and see if they've driven returns. See our latest analysis for Wells Fargo To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.During three years of share price growth, Wells Fargo achieved compound earnings per share growth of 5.9% per year. In comparison, the 16% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Wells Fargo's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Wells Fargo's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Wells Fargo's TSR for the last 3 years was 68%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWells Fargo provided a TSR of 3.7% over the last twelve months. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. But at least that's still a gain! Over five years the TSR has been a reduction of 3% per year, over five years. It could well be that the business is stabilizing. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

197,247a31a9-6540-3893-b980-7be3d8846c2d,WFC,2023-06-27,Is WMFAX a Strong Bond Fund Right Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wmfax-strong-bond-fund-now-110005786.html,1687777205,STORY,['WFC'],"[Mutual Fund Bond fund seekers should consider taking a look at Wells Fargo Municipals Bond Fund A (WMFAX). WMFAX bears a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.History of Fund/ManagerAllspring is responsible for WMFAX, and the company is based out of San Francisco, CA. The Wells Fargo Municipals Bond Fund A made its debut in April of 2005 and WMFAX has managed to accumulate roughly $815.12 million in assets, as of the most recently available information. The fund's current manager is a team of investment professionals.PerformanceInvestors naturally seek funds with strong performance. This fund carries a 5-year annualized total return of 1.33%, and is in the middle third among its category peers. If you're interested in shorter time frames, do not dismiss looking at the fund's 3 -year annualized total return of -0.3%, which places it in the top third during this time-frame.It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Compared to the category average of 15.37%, the standard deviation of WMFAX over the past three years is 5.59%. Looking at the past 5 years, the fund's standard deviation is 5.33% compared to the category average of 13.42%. This makes the fund less volatile than its peers over the past half-decade.WMFAX carries a beta of 0.82, meaning that the fund is less volatile than a broad market index of fixed income securities. With this in mind, it has a negative alpha of -0.32, which measures performance on a risk-adjusted basis.Story continuesRatingsInvestors should also consider a bond's rating, which is a grade ( 'AAA' to 'D' ) given to a bond that indicates its credit quality. With this letter scale in mind, WMFAX has 43.93% in high quality bonds rated at least 'AA' or higher, while 47.84% are of medium quality, with ratings of 'A' to 'BBB'. The fund has an average quality of A, and focuses on high quality securities.ExpensesCosts are increasingly important for mutual fund investing, and particularly as competition heats up in this market. And all things being equal, a lower cost product will outperform its otherwise identical counterpart, so taking a closer look at these metrics is key for investors. In terms of fees, WMFAX is a load fund. It has an expense ratio of 0.77% compared to the category average of 0.78%. WMFAX is actually cheaper than its peers when you consider factors like cost.This fund requires a minimum initial investment of $1,000, and each subsequent investment should be at least $100.Fees charged by investment advisors have not been taken into considiration. Returns would be less if those were included.Bottom LineOverall, Wells Fargo Municipals Bond Fund A ( WMFAX ) has a high Zacks Mutual Fund rank, and in conjunction with its comparatively similar performance, better downside risk, and lower fees, Wells Fargo Municipals Bond Fund A ( WMFAX ) looks like a good potential choice for investors right now.For additional information on the Mutual Fund Bond area of the mutual fund world, make sure to check out www.zacks.com/funds/mutual-funds.

(NYSE: PFE) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the company’s Biologics License Application (BLA) for fidanacogene elaparvovec for the treatment of adults with hemophilia B. In parallel, the European marketing authorization application (MAA) for fidanacogene elaparvovec has also been accepted and is under review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).Fidanacogene elaparvovec is a novel, investigational gene therapy that contains a bio-engineered adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid (protein shell) and a high-activity variant of human coagulation Factor IX (FIX) gene. For people living with hemophilia B, the goal of this gene therapy is to enable them to produce FIX themselves via this one-time treatment rather than needing regular intravenous infusions of FIX, as is the current standard of care.""Gene therapy marks a new era of scientific advancement, and if approved, we believe fidanacogene elaparvovec has the potential to transform the lives of people living with hemophilia B who are eligible for treatment. We look forward to continuing to work with global regulatory authorities to bring this innovative potential treatment to patients as quickly as possible,"" said Chris Boshoff, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Development Officer, Oncology and Rare Disease, Pfizer Global Product Development. ""Patients are at the center of our legacy of innovation in hemophilia. Despite significant progress in their treatment, those living with hemophilia continue to experience disruption to daily life and need new options.""The submissions for fidanacogene elaparvovec are based on efficacy and safety data from the Phase 3 BENEGENE-2 study (NCT03861273). As previously reported, the BENEGENE-2 study met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority and superiority in the annualized bleeding rate (ABR) of total bleeds post-fidanacogene elaparvovec infusion versus prophylaxis regimen with FIX, administered as part of usual care. Fidanacogene elaparvovec was generally well-tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with Phase 1/2 results.Story continuesThe FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date in the second quarter of 2024. Fidanacogene elaparvovec has been granted Breakthrough, Regenerative Medicines Advanced Therapy (RMAT) and orphan drug designations from the FDA.Pfizer currently has three Phase 3 programs investigating gene therapy in populations where there is a high unmet need: hemophilia B, hemophilia A, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. A Phase 3 trial is also ongoing investigating marstacimab, a novel, investigational anti-tissue factor pathway inhibitor (anti-TFPI) being studied for the treatment of people with hemophilia A and B with and without inhibitors.About fidanacogene elaparvovecFidanacogene elaparvovec is a novel, investigational gene therapy that contains a bio-engineered AAV capsid and a high-activity variant of human coagulation FIX gene. For people living with hemophilia B, the goal of this gene therapy is to enable them to produce FIX themselves via this one-time treatment rather than needing regular intravenous infusions of FIX, as is the current standard of care.In December 2014, Pfizer licensed fidanacogene elaparvovec from Spark Therapeutics. Under the agreement, Pfizer assumed responsibility for pivotal studies, any regulatory activities, and potential global commercialization of this investigational gene therapy.About BENEGENE-2The BENEGENE-2 study is a Phase 3, open label, single arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fidanacogene elaparvovec in adult male participants (age 18–65) with moderately severe to severe hemophilia B (defined as FIX circulating activity of 2% or less). The main objective of the study is to evaluate the ABR for participants treated with gene therapy versus FIX prophylaxis replacement regimen, administered as part of usual care.The study enrolled 45 participants. Eligible study participants have completed a minimum six months of routine FIX prophylaxis therapy during the lead in study (NCT03587116) and received one intravenous dose of fidanacogene elaparvovec at a dose of 5e11 vg/kg. Participants in the BENEGENE-2 study were screened with a validated assay designed to identify individuals who test negative for neutralizing antibodies to the gene therapy vector.The BLA and MAA submissions are based on a 15-month data cut from the BENEGENE-2 study. Clinical trial participants will be followed for up to a total of 15 years, including six years in the BENEGENE-2 study and an additional nine years as part of a separate Phase 3 study (NCT05568719) to learn about the long-term safety and efficacy of fidanacogene elaparvovec.About Hemophilia BHemophilia is a rare genetic bleeding disorder that causes the blood to take a long time to clot because of a deficiency in one of several blood clotting factors and is predominately found in males1. People with hemophilia are at risk for excessive and recurrent spontaneous and/or post-traumatic bleeding, which can be life-threatening, particularly in those with severe hemophilia. People with severe hemophilia often bleed spontaneously into their muscles or joints, or rarely into other critical closed spaces such as the intracranial space, where bleeding can be fatal2.According to the World Federation of Hemophilia, more than 38,000 people worldwide were living with hemophilia B in 20213. People with hemophilia B have a deficiency in clotting FIX, a specific protein in the blood. Hemophilia B also is called congenital FIX deficiency or Christmas disease. The current standard of care requires recurrent intravenous infusions of either plasma-derived or recombinant FIX to control and prevent bleeding episodes4.About Pfizer: Breakthroughs that Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

ET/ 2000 GMT)By Sinéad Carew, Sruthi Shankar and Johann M CherianJune 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed lower on Monday, as investors were wary of betting on riskier assets before seeing the outcome of Russia's aborted weekend mutiny.The rebellion by Russian mercenaries raised questions about President Vladimir Putin's future. While Putin on Monday thanked mercenary fighters and commanders who had stood down to avoid bloodshed, the U.S. State Department said the situation in Russia remained dynamic.Growth stocks were among the biggest weights on the main indexes, with Meta Platforms Inc, Alphabet Inc and Tesla Inc all falling sharply.Last week, U.S. stocks sputtered after a recent rally, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq snapping its eight-week winning streak after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled there could be more interest rate hikes ahead.""It doesn't feel like the all clear has sounded yet,"" said Carol Schleif, chief investment officer at BMO family office in Minneapolis, referring to Russia.

This prompted profit-taking in growth stocks that had advanced sharply so far this year, Schleif said.Investors also checked out underdogs for the year-to-date such as value stocks and small caps, said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance, Charlotte, North Carolina.Story continues""Out of favor themes for 2023 are working for today. Maybe in the absence of a real risk on or risk off day you go bargain hunting,"" Zaccarelli said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 12.72 points, or 0.04%, to 33,714.71; the S&amp;P 500 lost 19.51 points, or 0.45%, at 4,328.82; and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 156.74 points, or 1.16%, to 13,335.78.Leading the benchmark's industry index gainers was the energy sector, which rallied 2.2% as oil prices rose while investors balanced concerns about global demand growth against upcoming supply disruptions that could worsen with political instability in Russia.A slew of economic data including a key inflation gauge, durable goods and University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index is expected this week, as well as a speech from Powell which could throw light on the Fed's rate hike plans.Most policymakers see at least two more quarter-point rate increases by year-end, though traders are betting on just one hike in July, according to CMEGroup's Fedwatch tool.Among single stocks, Pfizer Inc fell 3.7% after the drugmaker said it was discontinuing the development of an experimental obesity and diabetes drug due to elevated liver enzymes in patients in clinical studies.Alphabet fell 3.3% after UBS downgraded the stock to ""neutral,"" while Tesla sank 6% after Goldman Sachs cut the electric car maker's rating to ""neutral.""Lucid Group rose 1.5% after entering into an agreement with UK's Aston Martin that will give the electric vehicle maker a 3.7% stake in the company.PacWest climbed 4% after private-equity firm Ares Management said it had acquired a $3.5 billion specialty finance loan portfolio from the lender.But Carnival slumped 7.6% after the cruise operator forecast third-quarter earnings below Wall Street expectations.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.91-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.15-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&amp;P 500 posted 18 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 53 new highs and 154 new lows.On U.S. exchanges 9.28 billion shares changed hands compared with the 11.62 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

Starting at 7 PM/ET, FNC’s Laura Ingraham will kick off primetime with Jesse Watters taking over the 8 PM/ET timeslot followed by Sean Hannity who will remain at 9 PM/ET while Greg Gutfeld moves to 10 PM/ET. Nightly newscast FOX News @ Night with Trace Gallagher will air an hour earlier at 11 PM/ET.In making the announcement, Scott said, ""FOX News Channel has been America’s destination for news and analysis for more than 21 years and we are thrilled to debut a new lineup. The unique perspectives of Laura Ingraham, Jesse Watters, Sean Hannity, and Greg Gutfeld will ensure our viewers have access to unrivaled coverage from our best-in-class team for years to come.""Kicking off the network’s primetime programming at 7 PM/ET will be cable news’ highest-rated woman Laura Ingraham with her pivotal Washington, D.C. based show The Ingraham Angle. The program has been the top-rated show in the 10 PM/ET timeslot since it launched in 2017. Throughout her tenure with FNC, Ingraham has interviewed several notable political figures, including presidents, members of congress, and White House officials. She has hosted a series of highly rated town halls including Red State Trailblazers, Time for Class and Georgia and the Battle for Senate. A former litigator and Supreme Court law clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas, Ingraham joined FNC in 2007 as a contributor, providing political and legal analysis to FNC’s daytime and primetime programming.Jesse Watters will move to 8PM/ET with his signature opinion program Jesse Watters Primetime. The show originally launched last year in the 7 PM/ET timeslot and earned the title of the fastest growing cable news program, crushing the competition across the board with 2.6 million viewers and 270,000 in the 25-54 demo year to date. Featuring Watters’ fresh take on the major headlines of the day while interviewing newsmakers from across the country, the show has been number one in its timeslot for the 18 months since it launched, delivering the highest-rated 7 PM/ET hour in cable news history. In addition to hosting Primetime, Watters is also a co-host of The Five, the 5 PM/ET roundtable discussion program that has been number one in cable news and all of cable for the last seven consecutive quarters.Story continuesAn iconic part of FNC’s primetime lineup since the network launched in 1996, Sean Hannity will remain in his 9 PM/ET timeslot with Hannity. In 2021, Hannity broke records as the longest-running primetime cable news host in history. Featuring his provocative style and high-profile interviews, Hannity has developed a unique connection with his audience, dominating the ratings for more than two decades. His eponymous program has ranked number one in its time slot with both viewers and in the 25-54 demo for 14 consecutive years since launching as a solo hour in January 2009, and his debut program Hannity &amp; Colmes was number one for seven years prior. Notably, Hannity has consistently delivered over 2.4 million nightly viewers with 278,000 adults 25-54 year to date, ranking number one in the 9 PM/ET timeslot for the past 27 consecutive months. Throughout his tenure with the network, he has secured interviews with numerous key newsmakers and political figures, including most recently, California Governor Gavin Newsom for which he earned praise on both sides of the aisle.FNC’s late-night program Gutfeld! hosted by Greg Gutfeld will move to 10 PM/ET. Launched in 2021, Gutfeld! delivered its most-watched year ever in 2022 and continues to upend the genre, becoming the first late-night show to unseat CBS’ The Late Show with Stephen Colbert in viewers since 2017 while also besting ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel Live and NBC’s The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. Dubbed the ""King of Late Night"" by Newsweek, the program has been number one for 27 straight months, posting double digit gains in all categories with an average of 1.8 million viewers, 273,000 in A25-54 year to date. Notably, Gutfeld! has the highest median income in late night with those aged 25-54 and 18-49 and is the number one late night program with upscale viewers (100k+) in total viewers and the younger demo. In addition to hosting Gutfeld!, he is also a founding co-host of the number one cable news show, The Five.FNC’s Trace Gallagher will close out the network’s primetime coverage at 11 PM/ET with newscast FOX News @ Night. Each night Gallagher covers major news events through that hour and serves as a primetime news hour for the Mountain and Pacific time zones as well as a sign off report for the east coast. An FNC original, Gallagher joined the network when it launched in 1996 and has covered some the biggest breaking news stories over the last 27 years.FOX News Channel (FNC) is a 24-hour all-encompassing news service and has been the number one network in basic cable for the last seven years and the most-watched television news channel for more than 21 consecutive years, currently attracting nearly 50% of the cable news viewing audience according to Nielsen Media Research. Notably, Nielsen/MRI Fusion has consistently shown FNC to be the network of choice for more Democrat and Independent viewers, with the most politically diverse audience in cable news.

Yet Fox remains the highest-rated cable news network in total viewers and among adults 25-54.In the weeks following Carlson's departure, Fox had filled the 8 p.m. slot with ""Fox News Tonight,"" which was hosted by a rotating crew of Fox News personalities.Laura Ingraham will move to a show earlier in the evening at 7 p.m. and late-night host Greg Gutfeld will move up an hour to 10 p.m., Fox News said.Meanwhile, Sean Hannity will remain at the 9 p.m. show, the conservative network said.

However, in the post-Trump ecosystem, those rules have shot out the window. Now, mainstream institutions seemingly can’t discuss anything other than politics.It’s here that you can let the Washington-driven diatribes escalate your blood pressure or you can walk a shrewder path: acquire media stocks with high potential that might benefit from the jibber jabber. With new storylines emerging seemingly constantly, the political backdrop symbolizes an investment gold mine.For example, Karl Rove – Senior Advisor to former President George W. Bush – argued in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that Trump invited his latest indictment due in part to his “childish defiance” of the law. GOP presidential candidate Chris Christie entered the race to seemingly antagonize Trump. It’s absolute bonkers theater, which bodes very well for top-performing media stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPlus, with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis attacking both Trump and the “woke” media, a never-ending supply of political barbs will ripple throughout the blogosphere. If you’re a lover of high-growth media stocks, it’s time to get your popcorn ready.FOXAFox$33.20NYTNew York Times$37.24MSFTMicrosoft$338.06Fox (FOXA)The Fox Corporation (FOXA) headquarters in New York City.Source: Leonard Zhukovsky / Shutterstock.comAt first glance, Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA) seems a risky bet for best media stocks to buy. True, Fox News – which falls under the Fox umbrella – caters to a largely conservative audience. As well, the company’s conservative pundits such as Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham know how to push the right buttons. Again, it all makes for great theater. However, the media giant also let go of Tucker Carlson.Soon after, the expulsion of Tucker – which occurred in April this year – hit investor sentiment, sending FOXA sharply down. Nevertheless, it still might make a case for media stocks with high potential. Fundamentally, with social pressures forcing the de-platforming of several controversial right-wing personalities, those on the right have fewer options to see their ideological talking points being represented.Story continuesAlso, FOXA makes a case for top-performing media stocks because of its relative financial resilience. Per data from Gurufocus, Fox’s three-year revenue growth rate on a per-share basis clocks in at 10.2%, above 76.51% of its peers. Also, it sports a trailing-year net margin of 7.84%, beating out 73% of its rivals.New York Times (NYT)market news glasses 1600Source: ShutterstockA thorn on Fox’s side, New York Times (NYSE:NYT) might seem like another risky play on the best media stocks to buy. While the news outlet produces excellent journalism – particularly in less-politically related matters such as the market and the economy – it’s the political op-eds that, for better or for worse dominate the discussion. And let’s face it, the NYT also knows how to push buttons in this specific department.However, I believe the Times ranks among the high-growth media stocks because of its “addressable market.” As stated earlier, the race for the Republican presidential candidacy has become a circus act. I’m not saying that as a matter of ideological critique. Rather, the drama of so many high-profile individuals going after each other organically weaves multiple compelling narratives.Look at it this way. If you were an opinion writer for the Times, the chaos within the ranks of the GOP symbolize pure gold. Honestly, such writers wouldn’t have to rely on hyperbole because the Republicans themselves up the ante. Basically, it’s free money, making NYT one of the media stocks set to blast off.Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comAt first glance, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) doesn’t appear an appropriate entity for best media stocks to buy. Sure, it’s a powerhouse technology name that arguably deserves to be included in everyone’s portfolio. But a media play? Before you start typing a letter to the editor, please note that Microsoft owns MSN. And MSN may be its own media goldmine.If you go to the website, you’ll notice that it’s actually a content aggregator for multiple media sources. With its vast content partnership, MSN is a useful one-stop shop to get the important news for free. Of course, that alone doesn’t necessarily make MSFT one of the media stocks with high potential. Rather, it’s what the company integrates – commentary from the public – that makes MSFT compelling.To be sure, Microsoft doesn’t allow comments for topics that it deems would arouse far too much vitriol. Nevertheless, the company is surprisingly flexible on the topics where it facilitates open discussion. And boy, the internet doesn’t miss an opportunity for flame wars. It’s awfully cynical but MSFT presents an enticing case for top-performing media stocks.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Convenience, transaction speed, and flexibility across multiple smartphone types offer consumers an easier way to pay for services and split bills with friends and family. The pandemic further accelerated this ongoing shift toward a cashless future.However, recent bank and crypto exchange failures highlight the risk of keeping your funds in accounts that exceed or simply lack FDIC insurance coverage. A recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) casts a spotlight on deposit risks among popular mobile payment apps, while explaining how consumers can hedge their risk of a collapse.Funds in PayPal, Venmo, CashApp lack insuranceEarlier this year, the collapses of Silicon Valley, Signature and First Republic Banks highlighted the importance of federal deposit insurance offered through the FDIC or NCUA. These banks experienced catastrophic runs, but their insured depositors with account balances of up to $250,000 could have confidence their money was safe. However, similar protection would not be guaranteed to customers that store money on nonbank payment apps, as we saw from the near-total wipeout of FTX users after the giant crypto exchange collapsed last year.The new CFPB report finds that billions of dollars stored in the top payment apps may lack the same federal insurance coverage that protects users of standard U.S. banks and credit unions from total ruin in a crisis.The CFPB report breaks down the deposit insurance representations of each major payment app provider. The table below illustrates the spotty or nonexistent status of insurance coverage across the payment app landscape:The CFPB calculates that more than three quarters of U.S. adults have used a payment app. Users transacted roughly $893 billion in 2022 across all payment apps, and they're projected to increase transaction volume to $1.6 trillion by 2027. So the risks to users of disrupted funds access or insolvency will only grow into the future.Story continuesNext steps for payment app usersThe CFPB offers several tips for payment app users to protect their funds from deposit risk:Read the user agreementThe user agreement, as murky as it can be, should explain the app's basic business model, investment strategy and risk profile. Check if the payment app company keeps your money in a bank or credit union account or invests your money in loans and bonds. You may be surprised to learn that they earn interest on your money without passing any of it on to you, like a normal bank normally does. Also check for details on whether your money may be insured at a bank or credit union, as well as what happens in the case of the payment app’s collapse or bankruptcy.Consider the offered ""pass-through"" insuranceCertain apps offer specific pass-through insurance, which protects you against the collapse of the bank or credit union where the company holds your funds. If you follow the insurance criteria, this can offer an additional layer of protection for app users. However, pass-through coverage explicitly doesn’t protect you against PayPal or another app failing. Even if your money is stored safely in an external, FDIC-backed bank during a payment app collapse, you could still experience significant delays in accessing your funds.Move your money out regularlyRegularly transfer your existing balance from the payment app holding fund into your FDIC-insured linked funding account. Try to check your balance at least once per month to not miss any outstanding funds from that group dinner or grocery run. Use an app like Apple Reminders or Google Calendar to set up recurring nudges for yourself.Related ContentTop 10 Most Trusted Brands for Banking, Investments and PaymentsIRS 1099-K Form: When You Might Get One From Venmo, PayPal, OthersHow to Choose the Right Payment AppBanking Scams: Beware Fraudsters Impersonating Your Bank]"

Their workers say companies aren’t ready,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ceos-eager-adopt-workers-companies-100000187.html,1687860000,STORY,['IBM'],"[Good morning.Generative A.I. has taken the C-suite by storm in the last six months, as a new study out today from IBM verifies. (CEO Daily got an early look.) Of more than 3,000 global CEOs surveyed, some 75% said they believe competitive advantage in the future will go to those who lead in A.I. For them, the race is on.Forward-thinking CEOs, of course, have known for some years that the new generation of technologies—cloud computing, an explosion of data, machine learning—were going to transform their companies and their industries. But ChatGPT showed them the power, sparking imaginations in ways previous technology tools hadn’t. It is so intuitive and easy for even a CEO to use. I spent a couple of hours this weekend conversing with Google’s Bard about ideas to grow Fortune Media—and the Bard’s ideas weren’t half bad! And far less costly than a consultant.But generative A.I.’s ease of use also underscores its limitations. It provides guesses, based on publicly available information, and it can neither calculate numbers nor verify facts. That’s probably why there’s such a gap, according to the IBM study, between CEOs and their teams. While 75% of CEOs are charging toward transformation, only 30% of their team members believe their organization is ready for the change, and only 29% believe they have the needed skills. “There’s a significant disconnect between what the CEO says and what their team says,” IBM’s Jesus Mantas told me. Moreover, concerns are still high around data security, data accuracy, and so-called “hallucinations”—that is, the technology’s tendency to make stuff up. As CaixaBank CEO Gonzalo Gortazar told the IBM team: “Generative A.I. models surprise, impress and scare us, all at the same time.”CEOs say productivity gains are the top reason for implementing A.I., but they are mixed about the effects on employment. Some 46% say they have hired additional workers due to generative A.I., while 43% say they have reduced workforce. Over the next twelve months, 26% say they will hire more, 28% say hire less. The survey shows they are also concerned by steadily rising regulatory threats.Story continuesBut while the exact applications remain fuzzy and the effects remain unclear, CEOs are clearly rushing headlong into the A.I. future. “It’s a quantum leap,” says Mantas.You can read the full study here.

At the same time, the Dow lost 0.04%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 3.58%.Coming into today, shares of the technology and consulting company had gained 0.42% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 7.46%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 5.01%.Investors will be hoping for strength from IBM as it approaches its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect IBM to post earnings of $1.98 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 14.29%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $15.5 billion, down 0.21% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $9.31 per share and revenue of $61.89 billion. These totals would mark changes of +1.97% and +2.25%, respectively, from last year.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for IBM should also be noted by investors. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 AI Stocks Billionaires are Loading Up On.The AI mania is quickly dividing the market into two halves, those who believe we are in an AI bubble that will not live up to the hype and all the stocks gaining on the back of the AI hype will soon come crashing down, and those who say this time it’s different and companies that are investing in AI products and services will keep enjoying huge gains in the future. AI skeptics believe they’ve seen it before. In 2010, when it was reported that IBM’s Watson system is smart and intelligent enough to beat humans at a quiz, International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) shares enjoyed a huge rally. Companies working in neural networks, machine learning, and deep learning domains have also seen similar rallies in the past, only to see their valuations go through correction when investors became realistic and rational.The dramatic gains a handful of companies made over the past few months on the back of their AI claims are causing some valuation-related worries in the market. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) recently saw a huge rally after the company gave strong guidance on the back of GPU demand growth caused by the deployment of ChatGPT-like apps.  But would it be still wise to invest in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)? Recently, many analysts shared their opinion that the stock is already reflecting the AI opportunity the company enjoys. Some notable investors also decided to take some profits after the latest rally. For example, Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management, which had a huge position in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) since 2020, recently sold a significant portfolio of its stake in the company, according to Bloomberg. The reason was obviously valuation, as the firm's global chief investment officer Benjamin Melman told Bloomberg:Story continues“Would we add to AI tech? We’re less and less sure on that as valuations are too lofty. If the gains continue, we’ll be even more cautious.”C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) could be another example for things to come for AI investors. Over the past few years, the company has changed its name and business line multiple times. It has tried its luck in energy (it was once C3 Energy) and Internet of Things (its previous name was C3 IoT) industries.  In 2019 it changed its name to C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI). Its name and ticker “AI” proved to be a gold mine as the stock saw a huge rally this year thanks to the AI boom. It has gained about 220% year to date through June 8. But when C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) recently posted earnings results and gave disappointing guidance, the stock fell.Interestingly, the debate around whether or not we are in an AI bubble is also dividing billionaires into two camps.Billionaire Ken Griffin, who has a net worth of over $32 billion, recently shared some interesting thoughts during an event for his hedge fund’s new class of interns event in Florida. While the billionaire agrees AI advances will be consequential and affect several facets of our economy, he believes the hype is overblown when it comes to short-term implications.""I do think the AI community is making a terrible mistake by being full of hype on the near-term implications of generative AI. I think they’re actually doing everybody a huge disservice with the level of hype they are creating.”The billionaire also shared his thoughts on the threat AI poses to jobs.“If you listen to the CEOs of tech companies, it’s going to eliminate millions of white-collar jobs. I say, ‘Not that fast.’ Some professions are accepting of errors, but you have to be really accurate in finance. You have to be really accurate as a lawyer.""Interestingly, though, Griffin believes generative AI will change the computer programming industry.“Programing is going be a big target for generative AI. You want to make sure that if you are a software engineer, you are putting yourself really close to the domain problems that need to be solved. Your career path will be defined by your ability to solve problems. The days of ‘I’m a good programmer’ are becoming numbered.”Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller also has some interesting thoughts on AI and his stance is in line with AI enthusiasts as the billionaire is adjusting his portfolio to focus on AI companies. Druckenmiller’s fund upped its stake in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) by 36% in the first quarter, ending the period with a $220 million stake.At a recent Bloomberg Invest conference, the billionaire reiterated his bullish take on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and said that “Nvidia is something we're going to want to own for at least two or three years, not for 10 months.”Druckenmiller believes NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a good choice for the long term even if the company faces some short-term headwinds.AI Stocks Billionaires are Loading Up OnOur MethodologyFor this article, we used Insider Monkey’s database of stock holdings of billionaires and picked 10 AI stocks with the highest number of billionaire investors as of the first quarter of 2023.AI Stocks Billionaires are Loading Up On10. C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI)Number of Billionaire Investors: 8Perhaps having AI as your stock ticker and AI in your company name is the best way to achieve huge gains in the stock market in 2023? That was true for C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) until recently when the company revealed its guidance which disappointed investors and the stock fell about 20%. Nevertheless, C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) shares have gained about 229% year to date as of June 8. C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) provides AI-related enterprise applications.For FY’24 C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) expects its revenue to come in the range of $295 million - $320 million, compared with $315.37 million consensus. Insider Monkey’s database shows that 8 billionaires had stakes in C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) as of the end of the first quarter. The most notable of them are Philippe Laffont, D. E. Shaw, and Ken Griffin.Overall, 24 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) as of the end of the first quarter.Kerrisdale Capital made the following comment about C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) in the investor letter:“We are short shares of C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI), a $4 billion market capitalization enterprise software company that has risen from the ashes of its busted IPO based on the misconception that its self-proclaimed “AI leadership” somehow positions it to benefit from Silicon Valley’s current tech theme du jour: generative AI as represented by media obsession ChatGPT. We believe these speculative flames won’t burn bright much longer, as the realities of C3’s poor customer traction, failing sales partnerships, and financial pressures will catalyze what is likely to be a painful reality check.This isn’t the first time C3 has sought to ride a hot investment theme. The company was originally founded as C3 Energy to develop analytics solutions for public utilities preparing for the emergence of cap-and-trade and smart grids. C3 pivoted in 2016, renaming the company C3 IoT to capitalize on that buzzy opportunity. But management’s master stroke was rebranding operations as C3.ai in 2019 and going public with the “AI” stock ticker, thus securing its place as the default artificial intelligence stock play for the undiscriminating investor despite the bulk of its business coming from relatively dated analytics models built for a very small number of utility, energy, and government customers. C3 is a minor, cash-burning consulting and services business masquerading as a software company, and its true value is a fraction of its current market capitalization…” (Click here to read the full text)9. International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM)Number of Billionaire Investors: 12Earlier this year International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) revealed its generative AI platform called Watsonx, a new AI and data platform. International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) will allow companies to make foundation models to deploy AI, handle and manage related data and data warehouses.As of the end of the March quarter, 12 billionaires in Insider Monkey’s database had stakes in International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM). Some famous billionaires invested in International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) include Cliff Asness, DE Shaw, Ken Griffin, and Steve Cohen.8. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)Number of Billionaire Investors: 18Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is continuing to launch AI features for the general public. Earlier this year Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) rolled out some AI features for its flagship PhotoShop platform. Recently, it revealed its generative AI tool Sensei GenAI, across Adobe Experience Cloud applications for enterprises.Year to date Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) has gained about 24% through June 8. As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, 18 billionaires in Insider Monkey’s database had stakes in Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE). Some famous billionaires having stakes in Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) are Ken Griffin, Philippe Laffont, Rajiv Jain and D. E. Shaw.Polen Focus Growth Strategy made the following comment about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“One area we are watching regarding Alphabet and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is AI systems and their capabilities, including generative AI. Interestingly, both Adobe and Alphabet could see benefits or threats from the emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs). Both companies already use generative AI to the benefit of their users in anticipating how content creators edit their work (Adobe) and in how search results are anticipated and generated (Google). At the same time, breakthrough technologies like AI can open the door to additional competition and/or impact a company’s profitability levels. We now see AI systems others are developing, including LLMs and generative AI offerings, that could be more competitive in the future. While we think it remains early days for ChatGPT and the capabilities of these types of LLMs and generative AI programs like DALL-E, the technology seems to be progressing at a fast rate and will at least require a strong response from incumbents.As of now, we believe Alphabet and Adobe are leaders in their own right in these areas and have a clear path to improving their existing offerings with AI advancements, which would allow them to be net beneficiaries of AI. There are also significant barriers to building leading AI offerings in these areas. As a result, our position sizes in Adobe and Alphabet remain sizeable. For Adobe, the status of its pending $20 billion-plus Figma acquisition is also uncertain. There is a good chance, in our view, that it will be blocked by regulators, which would mean the future opportunity to expand its offerings to the developer community (beyond designers) may not occur.”7. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Billionaire Investors: 22The reason why NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the center of the AI talk these days is simple: NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) makes chips that power AI applications like ChatGPT. So far, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has no major competitor. Given this leverage and first-mover advantage, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has ample time and resources to further boost its dominance in the industry.Recently, at a conference, billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller said he’d want to own NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) for at least “two or three years, not for ten months, and maybe longer"". 22 billionaires in Insider Monkey’s database have stakes in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as of the end of the March quarter.Harding Loevner Global Equity Strategy made the following comment about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“It also signaled lower capital expenditures and increased share repurchases. Other tech companies, including Salesforce, similarly benefited from plans to lower costs and increase profitability. Meanwhile, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), the graphic-chips designer, surged amid investor enthusiasm over the potential commercial applications of artificial-intelligence technologies, such as ChatGPT, which requires the use of many chips.”6. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)Number of Billionaire Investors: 25Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), offers strong AI capabilities with its Cloud platform that helps developers make AI applications.

MPLX's Natural Gas Gathering and Processing (G&amp;P) component recently received an Environmental and Safety Award from the Vernal Area Chamber of Commerce in recognition of a proactive leak detection and repair (LDAR) program that goes beyond federal regulatory requirements.Current federal regulations mandate an LDAR program only for certain compressor stations based upon their construction dates. G&amp;P, however, regularly monitors for leak emissions of methane in the basin at its Iron Horse gas processing complex and all five compressor stations (12 total compressors) that send raw natural gas to the complex.""The amount of natural gas we are moving has dramatically increased in the past two years, but our leak numbers continue to drop,"" said Senior Environmental Technician Megan Horrocks, who is responsible for quarterly LDAR surveys of all the facilities. ""More than just repairing leaks, it's about being proactive when starting up units that have not run for a while to check for leaks before they are running, and going the extra mile to ensure leaks in other equipment do not develop in the first place.""Finding the unseenAll potential leak indications via sight, sound or smell are checked out. Methane is a colorless and odorless component of natural gas, so pinpointing it requires Horrocks to use a thermal-imaging camera that detects 19 different gases emitting infrared waves the human eye can't see.Story continuesSince the LDAR program began three years ago, the need for leak repairs beyond federal monitoring requirements has steadily declined. The chamber of commerce award follows recognition two years ago from Utah's Department of Natural Resources for the program's initial success in 2020.The LDAR program is part of G&amp;P's broader Focus on Methane initiative to voluntarily lower methane emissions intensity across all operations 50% by 2025 and 75% by 2030 from 2016 levels.The leak detection and repair program involves regular monitoring for leak emissions of methane at the Iron Horse gas processing complex (above) and all five compressor stations (12 total compressors) that send raw natural gas to the complex.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Marathon Petroleum Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Marathon Petroleum CorporationWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/marathon-petroleum-corporationEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Marathon Petroleum CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/763747/Seeing-the-Invisible-Emissions-Reduction-in-Utah-Earns-Second-Award-for-MPLX]"

Delaney's move reflects a common theme in the downgrades: Tesla stock has done so well that it's hard to see it doing better to close out the year.""We believe the stock now better reflects our positive long-term view of the company’s growth potential and competitive positioning post the substantial move higher YTD,"" Delaney wrote in a note on Monday.Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas put it simply: ""I did not see this 111% YTD rally coming."" It's an understandable stance from Jonas after a 2022 that saw Tesla shares fall nearly 70% as its CEO Elon Musk purchased a social media company and the EV maker began to lose market share to competitors. Even Wedbush Securities managing director Dan Ives, a longtime Tesla bull, entered 2023 skeptical. He moved his price target down to $175 from $250 on December 22, 2022, writing in a note: ""At the same time that Tesla is cutting prices and inventory is starting to build globally in face of a likely global recession, Musk is viewed as 'asleep at the wheel' from a leadership perspective for Tesla.""In the first six months of the year, sentiment has snapped back in Tesla's favor in a massive way. The company instituted multiple price cuts that the Street regarded as necessary to reinvigorate demand, and its fourth quarter results came in better than expected. Then came a new CEO at Twitter, several supercharging licensing partnerships, and an artificial intelligence boom in stocks. All combined to send shares up more than 100% on the year.Story continuesBulls like Ives are back beating the drum, most recently writing the EV automaker has built an ""EV castle,"" referencing the growing paths for revenue such as the supercharger network that now includes partnerships with key competitors like Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Rivian (RIVN).AUSTIN, TEXAS - MAY 31: A Tesla Model Y is seen on a Tesla car lot on May 31, 2023 in Austin, Texas.

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images) (Brandon Bell via Getty Images)But some analysts are questioning how long-lasting some of the current growth drivers will be. Jonas at Morgan Stanley highlighted that the AI-related positive stock action could be a concern.""While we understand why Tesla gets a serious mention in an AI conversation, we believe a re-rating on this theme is in the realm of the non-disprovable bull case,"" Jonas wrote. ""Autonomous driving and generative AI still remain, in our view, two very different technological disciplines. While the market may want to dream on the AI theme, we'd prepare to wake up to the sound of a blaring car horn.""Barclays analyst Dan Levy agrees with Jonas that the AI narrative has likely been too far priced into Tesla's stock. Levy downgraded Tesla to Equal Weight from Overweight on June 21.""While we aren’t surprised that the stock has participated in the rally, we believe it is prudent to move to the sidelines,"" Levy wrote.He pointed to key fundamental factors that had weighed on the stock prior to the AI rally, like margin concerns amid price cuts.Investors will look for further hints on how Tesla's demand is reacting to those price cuts during the upcoming holiday week. Tesla usually reports its quarterly deliveries for the second quarter on July 2.After delivering 422,875 vehicles in the first quarter, Wall Street analysts expect Tesla to report deliveries of 448,599 for the second quarter, per Bloomberg consensus data.Josh is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

The initial model is priced from $77,905, excluding shipping charges.A cheaper Work Truck variant arrives late this year, priced from $72,905. About the same time, retail customers will be able to buy a well-equipped Silverado EV RST, from around $105,000.A less expensive Trail Boss edition should arrive next year, which is also when the 2025 Silverado EVs should go on sale.When GM announced the Silverado EV early last year, it said prices would start at $39,900. Silverado EV's nearest rival, the Ford F-150 Lightning, was initially priced at $39,974, but its base sticker has since soared by $20,000 to $59,974.Masica said ""conditions have changed"" in the nascent electric pickup sector, but declined to say how low future Silverado EV variants will be priced.GM Energy executive Derek Sequeira said at the Silverado launch in late June that GM will only have charging adaptors available for the electric pickups in early 2024.Eventually, GM will replace the current CCS charging port in its EVs with the Tesla-compatible NACS outlet.That means early models of the Silverado EV and other GM electric vehicles may have to employ a different adapter to use the CCS chargers GM’s existing charging partners provide across the country.GM also is considering installing Tesla-compatible NACS chargers at its dealerships, once its vehicles begin to be equipped with NACS charging ports, Sequeira said. Those new GM chargers are likely to carry the Ultium Charge 360 brand, he said.At an investor conference in early June, GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said the automaker has an opportunity to partner with Tesla in developing future locations for EV chargers.

This article is another example of this finding.

On top of it, US retail sales saw a decline in December 2022, falling by 1.1% as a result of high inflation.

Experts were predicting a decline of just 0.8% for the month.According to National Retail Federation, during the November and December holiday season, retail sales saw 5.3% growth over 2021 to $936.3 billion. In 2023, retailers are required to focus on optimizing their operations to become immune to the challenging economic environment. Retailers plan to use technology and solutions so that their businesses stay competitive in changing economic environment. An omnichannel marketing strategy is expected to support retailers in terms of reach.National Retail Federation’s Chief Economist views that companies should manage inventories more tightly in 2023. This comes after they were forced to heavily discount goods last year as a result of huge unsold merchandise. Positives in the form of favorable demographics, and low penetration of organised retail are expected to help the retail industry over the medium term.Story continuesDollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) reported financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Its consolidated net sales saw 8.1% growth to $6.94 billion, while operating income grew 22.8% to $381.3 million. The company’s gross profit grew 17.5% to $2.07 billion, while gross margin improved 240 bps to 29.9%. Growth was led by improved initial mark-on and leverage on occupancy and distribution costs. The company’s Q3 2022 sales performance exhibits timely execution of merchandising initiatives to support consumables business.Wayfair Inc. (NYSE:W) has announced financial results for Q3 2022. The company’s total net revenue came in at $2.8 billion, exhibiting $281 million or 9.0% decline year-over-year. Its gross profit was $824 million or 29.0% of the total net revenue.

(NASDAQ:EBAY). Here is what the fund said:“Two things are very noticeable right off the top. First, sometimes you have to be happy losing less in a bear market environment so that you have more of your capital to grow in the next bull market. We are never really happy losing money. Second, 2022 is likely to be our third year of existence as a fund to lose money for the year. This year would join 2008 and 2018 in this undistinguished category. Our biggest detractors was dominated by eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Consumer/investor fears about media and e-commerce hit WBD and EBAY and profit taking in Amgen came from early 2022 strength.”11.

Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.FOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in CSX (CSX) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to CSX for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?CSX's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at CSX's main business drivers.CSX Corporation is one of United States’ leading transportation companies. The company, based in Jacksonville, Fl, offers rail-based freight transportation services like traditional rail service, transport of intermodal containers and trailers apart from rail-to- truck transfers.CSX, incorporated in 1978 under Virginia law, offers customers access to a large and interconnected transportation network. The company's fiscal year coincides with the calendar year.CSX Transportation is the company’s primary operating subsidiary. Through the subsidiary, the company provides an important link to the transportation supply chain through its rail network, spanning across approximately 19,500 route miles. CSXT also offers service to multiple production and distribution facilities apart from managing activities like real estate sales .Through this vast network, the company offers services to major population centers in 23 states east of the Mississippi River, the District of Columbia and Ontario and Quebec in Canada. CSX owns multiple locomotives. Freight, switching and auxiliary units are present in the locomotive fleet. CSX also leases locomotives on a short-term basis.CSX conducts its operations primarily through five business lines:Merchandise (accounted for 55% of total revenue in 2022): The merchandise business consists of one million carloads per year of aggregates, which include crushed stone, sand and gravel, metal, phosphate, fertilizer, food, consumer (manufactured goods and appliances), agricultural, paper and chemical products.Coal (16%): The segment delivers carloads of coal, coke and iron ore to electricity generating power plants, ocean, river and lake piers and terminals, steel makers apart from industrial plants.Intermodal (16%): Through its network of approximately 30 terminals, Intermodal serves all the major markets east of the Mississippi River and transports, mainly manufactured consumer goods in containers, thereby providing customers truck-like service for longer shipments.Trucking (7%): Introduced in third-quarter 2021, the segment consists of the operations of Quality Carriers, which was acquired in July 2021.Other (6%): The segment, introduced in the second quarter of 2010, includes revenue from regional subsidiary railroads and incidental charges.Story continuesBottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in CSX a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in June 2013 would be worth $4,184.93, or a gain of 318.49%, as of June 26, 2023, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 173.06% and the price of gold went up 50.66% over the same time frame.Analysts are forecasting more upside for CSX too.CSX expects revenue ton miles in 2023 to grow in low single digits in 2023 driven by strong anticipated performances in the merchandise and coal units. To counter inflationary pressures, the railroad operator aims to improve efficiencies. In first-quarter 2023, operating ratio (operating expenses as a % of revenues) improved to 60.5% from 62.4% a year ago due to lower costs. We are also impressed by CSX's efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In February 2023, CSX upped its dividend by 10% to 11 cents per share. However, supply-chain disturbances are hurting CSX's operations. Elevated capital expenditures are also worrisome. CSX's management expects current-year capex to be approximately $2.3 billion, which is higher than 2022 actuals.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 6.26%, and there have been 3 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

During first-quarter 2023, the company’s gaming expenses were $729.5 million, up from $686.6 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The increase was due to a rise in third-party service provider fees, higher payroll expenses and an increase in gaming taxes.

SHOO is well-poised for growth, thanks to its sturdy digital efforts and other robust strategies, including international business expansion and brand strength.

245,140624cc-2da7-3dd0-be09-508dc3ad037e,RCL,2023-06-27,"Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL) Hit a 52 Week High, Can the Run Continue?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/royal-caribbean-cruises-ltd-rcl-131503945.html,1687785303,STORY,"['RCL', 'OSW']","[Have you been paying attention to shares of Royal Caribbean (RCL)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 24% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $98.35 in the previous session. Royal Caribbean has gained 98.1% since the start of the year compared to the 8% move for the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector and the 21.4% return for the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 4, 2023, Royal Caribbean reported EPS of $-0.23 versus consensus estimate of $-0.71 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1.87%.For the current fiscal year, Royal Caribbean is expected to post earnings of $4.72 per share on $13.13 billion in revenues. This represents a 162.93% change in EPS on a 48.49% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $6.84 per share on $14.86 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 44.89% and 13.22%, respectively.Valuation MetricsRoyal Caribbean may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Royal Caribbean has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 20.8X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 20.9X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 5X versus its peer group's average of 8.9X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Royal Caribbean currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Royal Caribbean passes the test. Thus, it seems as though Royal Caribbean shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does RCL Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of RCL have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is OneSpaWorld Holdings Limited (OSW). OSW has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of B.Earnings were strong last quarter. OneSpaWorld Holdings Limited beat our consensus estimate by 30%, and for the current fiscal year, OSW is expected to post earnings of $0.53 per share on revenue of $731.34 million.Shares of OneSpaWorld Holdings Limited have gained 5.6% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 21.09X and a P/CF of 28.02X.The Leisure and Recreation Services industry is in the top 31% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for RCL and OSW, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our discussion and see hedge funds' top 5 undervalued retail stock picks here.While no industry is immune to recession, certain industries such as consumer and retail, post sound performance even in tough economic conditions. However, certain trends like economic volatility, inflation, and change in consumer habits are here to stay in 2023 which might limit the growth prospects of consumer and retail industry. On top of it, US retail sales saw a decline in December 2022, falling by 1.1% as a result of high inflation. The soft month during December has increased worries as investors fear that 2023 might bring a downturn in consumer spending. Experts were predicting a decline of just 0.8% for the month.According to National Retail Federation, during the November and December holiday season, retail sales saw 5.3% growth over 2021 to $936.3 billion. In 2023, retailers are required to focus on optimizing their operations to become immune to the challenging economic environment. Retailers plan to use technology and solutions so that their businesses stay competitive in changing economic environment. An omnichannel marketing strategy is expected to support retailers in terms of reach.National Retail Federation’s Chief Economist views that companies should manage inventories more tightly in 2023. This comes after they were forced to heavily discount goods last year as a result of huge unsold merchandise. Positives in the form of favorable demographics, and low penetration of organised retail are expected to help the retail industry over the medium term.Story continuesDollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) reported financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Its consolidated net sales saw 8.1% growth to $6.94 billion, while operating income grew 22.8% to $381.3 million. The company’s gross profit grew 17.5% to $2.07 billion, while gross margin improved 240 bps to 29.9%. Growth was led by improved initial mark-on and leverage on occupancy and distribution costs. The company’s Q3 2022 sales performance exhibits timely execution of merchandising initiatives to support consumables business.Wayfair Inc. (NYSE:W) has announced financial results for Q3 2022. The company’s total net revenue came in at $2.8 billion, exhibiting $281 million or 9.0% decline year-over-year. Its gross profit was $824 million or 29.0% of the total net revenue. The company announced additional details about right-sizing its cost structure and continued strong business performance since the Cyber Five period. Totaling over $1.4 billion in annualized cost actions, the plan is well underway and should accelerate its timeline for adjusted EBITDA breakeven to earlier in 2023 as the first step to positive FCF.12 Most Undervalued Retail Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsPixabay/Public DomainOur MethodologyWe used the latest holdings of SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF (XRT) to identify retail companies but we excluded automotive retailers and dealerships from this list. Then we used Insider Monkey's hedge fund sentiment data to rank these stocks.

They reduced their price objective on the company’s stock from $59.00 to $56.00 and gave an “Overweight” rating on November 3.Smead Capital Management, an investment management company, released its third quarter 2022 investor letter and mentioned eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY). Here is what the fund said:“Two things are very noticeable right off the top. First, sometimes you have to be happy losing less in a bear market environment so that you have more of your capital to grow in the next bull market. We are never really happy losing money. Second, 2022 is likely to be our third year of existence as a fund to lose money for the year. This year would join 2008 and 2018 in this undistinguished category. Our biggest detractors was dominated by eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Consumer/investor fears about media and e-commerce hit WBD and EBAY and profit taking in Amgen came from early 2022 strength.”11.

Given the headwinds it had to face during Q3 2022, these results were healthy.Ross Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROST) expects Q4 2022 same store sales to be flat to down 2% against 9% gain in the prior year, while EPS is forecasted to be between $1.13 to $1.26.

253,aeddcbe8-dd44-3a25-8c8e-53c18caa764c,V,2023-06-27,Warren Buffett and Ken Griffin Have One Thing in Common: They Both Like These 2 “Strong Buy” Stocks,TipRanks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-ken-griffin-one-142337070.html,1687789417,STORY,"['TMUS', 'V']","[Following in the footsteps of one of Wall Street’s investing giants is a well-known strategy for those looking for alpha in the markets.But is there a better blueprint out there? There is! Tracking the moves of not one, but two investing legends. And when two stock pickers with almost unrivaled success are seen leaning into the same names, surely investors are keen to find out why they are piquing the interest of the leaders in the field.In this case, we’re talking about Warren Buffett and Ken Griffin, two proponents of different styles, yet both wildly successful. The former is known for his adherence to value investing while the latter has a proclivity for quantitative investment techniques. But having different styles does not mean they don’t reach the same conclusion at times.With this in mind, we opened up the TipRanks database to check the details on two equities that both investing giants have made room for in their respective portfolios. Looks like these two are not alone in their support – both stocks claim a Strong Buy consensus rating. Let’s check the details.T Mobile US (TMUS)For our first Buffett/Griffin-backed name we’ll look at telecoms giant T-Mobile US. The wireless network operator is second-largest wireless carrier in the US and has managed to capture a significant portion of the industry’s expansion. It has done this by greatly enhancing its network and implementing creative marketing strategies to reach neglected areas in both urban and rural regions. The company also touts its credentials as a 5G leader, by boasting of the biggest, fastest and most lauded 5G network in the country.Obviously, we’re talking about a huge operation, with a workforce numbering ~71,000 and a market cap over $159 billion. As of the end of Q1, the company’s total customer count stood at a record 114.9 million.That said, it wasn’t all plain sailing in the quarter. Revenue fell by 2.4% year-over-year to $19.63 billion, while missing the Street’s call by $430 million. There was better luck on the bottom-line, as EPS of $1.58 trumped the $0.48 forecast.Story continuesThe shares put in a decent performance during last year’s bear but have been excluded from this year’s rally, down by 5% year-to-date.Buffett and Griffin are evidently keen on this mobile giant. Buffett holds a big TMUS position, owning 5,242,000 shares. These are currently worth north of $705 million. Meanwhile, it looks like Griffin has been using the depressed price to pick up shares. He bought most of his holdings in Q1 – 4,416,305 shares, to be exact. His total now stands at 5,014,198 shares, currently worth $675 million.Mirroring these investing sages’ confidence, Oppenheimer’s Timothy Horan is keeping the faith even in the face of rising 5G competition. The 5-star analyst writes, “We maintain our positive outlook on TMUS as the network and value leader which has driven outperformance vs peers in the 5G-era, however, we see its lead beginning to narrow as VZ/T wrap up their C-Band deployments. TMUS is making headway in rural and enterprise sectors where it is underpenetrated. The company now claims 16.5% market share in rural, up from low double-digit share 2-years ago and approaching its 2025 target of 20%, and outpaced VZ in business phone net adds and churn in 1Q.”These comments underpin Horan’s Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating while his $190 price target implies shares will push ahead by 41% over the coming months. (To watch Horan’s track record, click here)There’s full agreement on the Street regarding this one. The stock’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on Buys only – 17, in total. At $179.53, the average target makes room for 12-month returns of ~34%. (See TMUS stock forecast)Visa (V)Let’s turn now to another giant and one of the world’s biggest brands. Visa is a name known by all, a global financial services firm that operates one of the world’s largest electronic payment networks. It connects millions of merchants and financial institutions across the globe, offering a reliable and efficient platform for electronic payments whilst facilitating secure digital transactions between consumers, businesses, financial institutions, and governments. With a market cap north of $470 billion, it claims a spot among the top 15 most valuable companies in the world.Visa is a giant yet one also consistently posting steady growth and that was the case again in the most recently reported quarter – for the fiscal second quarter of 2023 (March quarter). Revenue reached $8 billion, amounting to an 11.1% YoY uptick, whilst outpacing the Street’s call by $210 million. At the other end of the equation, EPS of $2.09 came in ahead of the $2.01 expected by the analysts. The company saw Q2 total payments volume of $2.96 trillion, just edging ahead of consensus at $2.95 trillion.Looking ahead, for F3Q23, net revenue is anticipated to increase by low double digits while adj. operating expenses are expected to drop by 2-3 ppts each quarter through F4Q23.These results must have been pleasing to Buffett and Griffin. Buffett holds a significant V position, owning 8,297,460 shares worth approximately $1.9 billion, while Griffin doubled his holdings in Q1 by adding 1,190,831 V shares. He currently holds a total of 2,251,070 shares, valued at over $514 million.For Evercore analyst David Togut, Visa’s value proposition makes it a stock to own whatever the macro backdrop.“Our Top 3 Pick for 2023, V’s resilient business model and sizable moat around its network offers best-in-class risk/reward with downside protection in an uncertain macro environment and material upside opportunity in a rising economy,” the analyst explained. “And while management’s FY2023 guidance and our estimate does not incorporate a recession, we see minimal downside risk to guidance given several potential macro and secular tailwinds: A) rebound in Asia Pacific travel; B) further digitization of payments; and C) robust value-added services revenue growth of 20%+ constant currency in FY2023 and beyond.”Quantifying this stance, Togut rates Visa shares an Outperform (i.e., Buy) backed by a $300 price target. The implication for investors? Upside of ~32% from current levels. (To watch Togut’s track record, click here)Overall, there’s plenty of love for Visa on the Street. Barring one skeptic, all 19 other recent reviews are positive, making the consensus view here a Strong Buy. At $272.55, the average target implies shares will be changing hands for ~20% premium a year from now.

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Analysts Are Increasing Price Targets of These 5 Stocks.A prominent bearish strategist on Wall Street has expressed concerns about the US equity market, suggesting that a wave of apprehension among investors could trigger a significant downturn in the near term. Michael Wilson, a strategist at Morgan Stanley, who had previously predicted a market decline in 2023 that has not yet materialized, now believes that the S&amp;P 500 is vulnerable to a potential pullback. He forecasts that the benchmark index could reach 3,900 by the end of this year, representing a decline of approximately 10% from Friday's closing price, before rebounding to 4,200 in the second quarter of the following year.According to Reuters, portfolio investors made modest purchases of crude oil and distillates during the previous week. However, their overall positions have remained largely unchanged over the past three months due to apprehensions regarding the global economic outlook, which outweighed the impact of reduced inventories. During the seven-day period ending on June 20, hedge funds and other money managers acquired approximately 25 million barrels through the most significant petroleum futures and options contracts. This activity reflects a cautious approach in the market. While there was some buying activity, the overall sentiment among portfolio investors remained subdued, with concerns about the health of the global economy acting as a significant deterrent. Despite the purchases made by hedge funds and money managers, the lack of significant changes in their positions over the past few months indicates a cautious stance and an ongoing focus on economic uncertainties.According to a Reuters report on June 25, speculators faced the need to close out additional short positions in Chicago grains and oilseeds due to worsening crop conditions in the United States caused by an unprecedented dry period. In the four-day trading week ending on June 20, money managers eliminated a total of 100,000 gross short positions across various commodities such as CBOT corn, wheat, soybeans, soy products, Kansas City wheat, and Minneapolis wheat. This marked the highest weekly reduction in short positions since August 2020. Moreover, money managers increased their long positions by 45,000 contracts during the same week, which was the most substantial increase seen in four months. The rise in long positions was primarily driven by corn, as the number of new longs exceeded the amount of short covering. These changes in speculative positions reflect the impact of deteriorating crop conditions and the resultant concern among market participants. The dry spell has led to increased uncertainty in the agricultural markets, prompting speculators to adjust their positions accordingly.Story continuesOn the stocks market front, analysts are bullish on technology stocks such as Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) along with airline stock Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL). Barclays analysts raised the price target on Uber (NYSE:UBER) after its stock surged 75% year-to-date. Tigress analysts raised its target price for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) due to the expectation of renewed growth in the near future, primarily driven by progress in emerging markets and Asia. Also, Barclays increased Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) price target stating that the company's investor day is expected to emphasize potential earnings growth in the near term. Check out the complete article to see the details of these upward revisions in price targets.Analysts Are Increasing Price Targets of These 10 StocksTaLaNoVa/Shutterstock.com10. Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR)Upside Potential: 10%Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR), a major player in the global fast-food industry, is the owner of well-known restaurant chains like Burger King, Popeyes, and Tim Hortons. With its headquarters based in Ontario, Canada, the company recently released its Q1 2023 financial results on May 2. The earnings report revealed impressive figures, including a revenue of $1.59 billion, surpassing estimates by $30 million. The non-GAAP EPS stood at $0.75, exceeding expectations by $0.11. Furthermore, the company achieved an adjusted EBITA of $588 million, showcasing a substantial 15.8% organic growth compared to Q1 2022.On June 23, Evercore ISI increased the price target for Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR) to $83 from $80. The stock's closing price on June 23 was $75.35; thus, with a new target price of $83, it has an upside potential of 10%.9. D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI)Upside Potential: 12%D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) is a Texas-based home construction company that is one of the largest homebuilders in the country by volume. On June 23, analyst Chris Graja from Argus has raised the price target for D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) from $120 to $135. The stock's closing price on June 23 was $120.40; thus, with a new target price of $135, it has an upside potential of 12%.Third Avenue Management mentioned D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“The primary contributors to performance during the quarter included the Fund’s investments in leading US-based homebuilders (Lennar Corp. and D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI)), UK-centric real estate holdings (Berkeley Group and Savills plc), and Industrial and Logistics REITs (Prologis, First Industrial and Segro plc).The Fund’s other activity during the period was modest in nature and included slight reductions to certain holdings for portfolio management purposes (Lennar Corp., D.R. Horton, FNF Group, Wharf Holdings, and AMH).After factoring in this activity, the Fund had 41% of its capital invested in Residential Real Estate companies with strong ties to the U.S. and U.K. residential markets—where there remain supply deficits after years of under-building. In conjunction with near record-low inventory levels, there also remains significant demand for new products at affordable price points (both for-sale and for-rent). Therefore, these Fund holdings seem positioned to benefit from a multi-year recovery in residential construction and ancillary activities, particularly as mortgage rates stabilize for conforming loans. At the end of the quarter, these holdings included a diversified set of businesses including homebuilding (Lennar Group and DR Horton), timberland ownership and management (Weyerhaeuser and Rayonier), planned development (Berkeley Group and Five Point Holdings), the ownership and development of rental properties (AMH, Grainger plc, and Ingenia Communities), as well as other ancillary businesses (Lowe’s and Trinity Place Holdings).”8. DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG)Upside Potential: 12%DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) is a digital sports entertainment and gaming company that has outperformed expectations in recent quarters, attracting investors despite valuation and recession concerns. Its successful football season has driven a significant increase in share value. DraftKings also operates an NFT market for sports collectibles, which is popular among collectors. In Q1 2023, DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) achieved impressive revenue of $770 million, an 84.7% YoY growth. Monthly Unique Payers (MUP) increased by 39% YoY, averaging 2.8 million users.Wall Street analysts have given positive ratings to DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) following its strong quarterly performance. In June, BTIG Research and Jefferies Financial Group raised their price targets for the stock to $31 and $35, respectively. The recent price target raise is given by Wells Fargo.  On June 23, Wells Fargo increased the price target for DraftKings from $24 to $28. The stock's closing price on June 23 was $25.03; thus, with a new target price of $28, it has an upside potential of 12%.In its Q1 2023 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and DraftKings (NASDAQ: DKNG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We re-initiated a position in former Fund holding DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG), a leading online sportsbook, digital casino, and daily fantasy sports operator. DraftKings’ mobile applications offer consumers the ability to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play hundreds of real-money casino games. The company has spent the past three years building a proprietary technology stack that improves the customer experience and delivers best-in-class breadth of bet types (such as parlays, same-game parlays, and player props). State-level online sports betting (OSB) and iCasino legalization, along with a multi-year consumer adoption timeline in active states, has supported a 90% revenue growth rate for DraftKings since 2020. The opportunity for OSB legalization remains significant, with under 50% of the U.S. population currently having legal mobile sports betting. We expect 65% to 80% of the population will eventually have access to OSB. ICasino is currently legal in just seven states representing roughly 13% of the population. ICasino product adoption in legalized states has been robust, with the average user spending twice as much as a sports bettor. While the pace of legalization for iCasino has been slower, we believe additional states will pass regulation in the coming years.As U.S. states began to legalize sports betting, the DraftKings management team moved quickly to build widespread brand awareness. DraftKings is the #2 operator in both OSB and iCasino by a wide margin, and has demonstrated improving market share trends across almost all states. When a new state legalizes sports betting, DraftKings has a first mover advantage as many of its customers are converted from the DraftKings daily fantasy sports offering. The quality of their sportsbook product along with increasingly targeted promotional spending results in strong customer retention and high lifetime values. In states where iCasino is legal, DraftKings can cross-sell OSB customers. DraftKings’ scale and product advantages are creating a flywheel that will enable the company to continue to out-invest the competition in acquisition marketing, retention, and research and development. The high barriers to entry are resulting in a consolidated industry that will eventually lead to a highly profitable business. This is evidenced by older-vintage state contribution margins that are already approaching 40%. Longer term, we believe DraftKings can generate EBITDA margins between 20% and 30% with strong free-cash-flow conversion.”7. Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH)Upside Potential: 12%Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH) primarily designs, manufactures, and markets electrical, electronic, and fiber optic connectors. Analyst Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America Securities reaffirmed a Buy rating for Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH) on June 23 while setting a price target of $90, up from $82. Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH) closing price on June 23 was $80.19; thus, with a new target price of $90, it has an upside potential of 12%.TimesSquare U.S. Mid Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“More positive was the 14% rise by Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH), a producer and supplier of electrical and fiber optic connectors. Third quarter earnings surpassed expectations, with strong demand across nearly all end markets. Despite signs of macroeconomic weakness, management increased its quarterly dividend while continuing the share repurchase program.”6. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC)Upside Potential: 13%Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) is a Texas-headquartered enterprise involved in the production, recycling, and fabrication of steel and metal goods both domestically and globally. Its operations span multiple countries including the United States, Poland, and China. The company specializes in processing and marketing both ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals to various consumers such as steel mills, foundries, aluminum sheet manufacturers, brass and bronze ingot makers, copper refineries and mills, specialty steel mills, high temperature alloy manufacturers, and other related industries. On June 23, BMO Capital decided to maintain a ""Market Perform"" rating on Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) while increasing the price target from $56 to $58. The stock's closing price on June 23 was $51.50; thus, with a new target price of $58, it has already crossed the analyst's expectations.ClearBridge Small Cap Strategy made the following comment about Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Our holdings in the materials sector also benefited relative performance during the period. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC), a steel and metal manufacturer, was a top performer. The company exceeded analyst expectations for quarterly earnings on the back of strong fundamental drivers, which have been significantly bolstered by the prospect of further infrastructure spending by the government. We believe the company will be able to capitalize on this increased investment and generate longterm returns for the portfolio performance"".Click to continue reading and see Analysts Are Increasing Price Targets of These 5 Stocks.Suggested articles:10 Best GARP Stocks That Pay Dividends10 A-Rated Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up OnHow to Play The AI Boom And NASDAQ RallyDisclosure.

260,ada5c679-1a94-3aab-baff-8eb2fa3980f6,VZ,2023-06-27,Biden to detail plans for $42 billion investment in US internet access,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-detail-plans-42-billion-090000381.html,1687770000,STORY,"['T', 'VZ']","[By Jarrett RenshawJune 26 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday plans to lay out how a $42 billion investment in expanding internet access will be divvied up among the nation's 50 states, in an effort to give all Americans access to high-speed broadband by 2030.The move will kick off the second leg of Biden's tour highlighting how legislation passed by Congress during the first half of his term will affect average Americans, as his reelection bid gears up.""We have an historic opportunity here to make a real difference in people's lives and making sure that we deliver on that potential is what we're about every day and to make sure that people feel that at their kitchen table, in their communities, in their backyards,” White House chief of staff Jeff Zients said.Zients compared the broadband effort to President Franklin Roosevelt's efforts in 1936 to bring electricity to rural America. The administration estimates there are some 8.5 million locations in the U.S. that lack access to broadband connections.Broadband companies such as Verizon, Comcast , Charter Communications and AT&amp;T have been reluctant to provide access to low-population, rural communities because the investments are expensive and the regions do not offer a lot of subscribers. The lack of broadband access drew attention during COVID shutdowns that forced students into online schooling.The Biden administration will say how much of the $42 billion in funding each state will receive under the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Program, based on a newly-released Federal Communications Commission coverage map that details access gaps.States are expected to submit initial plans later this year that will unlock 20% of the funding. Once the plans are finalized, which could take to 2025, the remaining money will be released.Biden is also set to give what White House officials describe as a major economic speech on Wednesday in Chicago, laying out so-called ""Bidenomics,"" according to a memo from senior advisors Anita Dunn and Mike Donilon to Congressional Democrats and other allies.The speech will focus on Biden's attempts to build the economy by focusing on the middle class and not the wealthy. The advisers noted the economy has added more than 13 million jobs since Biden took office, including nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. In light of that, when we looked at Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Air Products and Chemicals is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.098 = US$2.6b ÷ (US$29b - US$2.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Therefore, Air Products and Chemicals has an ROCE of 9.8%. In absolute terms, that's a low return but it's around the Chemicals industry average of 11%. View our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Air Products and Chemicals compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Air Products and Chemicals here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?In terms of Air Products and Chemicals' historical ROCE trend, it doesn't exactly demand attention. The company has consistently earned 9.8% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 59% in that time. Given the company has increased the amount of capital employed, it appears the investments that have been made simply don't provide a high return on capital.The Bottom Line On Air Products and Chemicals' ROCEIn summary, Air Products and Chemicals has simply been reinvesting capital and generating the same low rate of return as before. Investors must think there's better things to come because the stock has knocked it out of the park, delivering a 105% gain to shareholders who have held over the last five years. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.Story continuesOne more thing, we've spotted   2 warning signs  facing Air Products and Chemicals that you might find interesting.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

274,ab91c09d-ba5a-3a50-b132-ab276d1767e9,APD,2023-06-27,3 Hydrogen Stocks to Buy With Explosive Upside Potential,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-hydrogen-stocks-buy-explosive-130642473.html,1687266402,STORY,"['PLUG', 'BE', 'APD']","[As the world continues to focus on green energy, there are multiple investment themes that are still at an early growth stage. The global hydrogen economy is likely to play a big role in the energy transition. With growth likely to sustain beyond the decade, it’s still a good time to consider some of the best hydrogen stocks to buy.To put things into perspective, the demand for hydrogen for global consumption was 87 million MT in 2020. Demand is expected to swell to 212 million MT by 2030 and further to 528 million MT by 2050. The demand will primarily come from heavy industry, power generation, and the production of hydrogen-based fuels.Given the demand outlook, some of the best hydrogen-focused companies are positioned for multi-fold growth. It goes without saying that there are several hydrogen stocks with explosive upside potential.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLet’s discuss three of the best hydrogen stocks to buy for robust gains.Air Products and Chemicals (APD)Air Products (APD) logo on the Arts Quest building, Air Products is a sponsor of Air Products Town Square at Arts Quest in Bethlehem, PASource: Andy Borysowski / Shutterstock.comAir Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) stock is possibly the best hydrogen stock to buy. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 25.7, the stock looks attractive and offers a dividend yield of 2.39%.A key reason to like Air Products is the financial flexibility. In the last 12 months, the company has reported investable cash flows (after dividends) of $1.7 billion. This provides ample flexibility to make investments in hydrogen projects.Talking about the projects, NEOM Green (Saudi Arabia) is expected to produce up to 600 tonnes of carbon-free hydrogen per day in the form of green ammonia. Further, the company’s $1.6 billion hydrogen facility in Canada is under construction. In the United States, the company is investing $4.5 billion to produce low-carbon hydrogen to power mobility and industrial markets.Clearly, Air Products is making aggressive investments in hydrogen fuel. This is likely to deliver results in terms of growth and cash flow upside in the coming years.Story continuesPlug Power (PLUG)Plug Power logo on computer screen. PLUG stock.Source: Postmodern Studio / ShutterstockPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) stock has declined by 25% in the last 12 months. I see this correction as a good opportunity to consider some exposure.As an overview, Plug Power is a provider of hydrogen fuel cell turnkey solutions. For 2023, the company expects to deliver revenue of $285 million from the energy solutions business. Consolidated revenue (all business segments) is likely at $1.4 billion with a 10% gross margin.It’s worth noting that Plug Power expects revenue of $3.9 billion from the energy solution business by 2030. In terms of current expansion plans, the company expects a hydrogen plant capacity of 200TPD by the end of the year. Capacity is likely to increase to 500TPD by 2025. Similarly, the applications business is expected to reach $9 billion by 2030. The best part of growth is still to come, and PLUG stock can be a potential multibagger from current levels.Bloom Energy (BE)Bloom Energy logo at their headquarters in Silicon ValleySource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comBloom Energy (NYSE:BE) is another interesting name to consider. BE stock has been sideways in the last year and is poised for a big breakout.As an overview, the company’s solid oxide fuel cell technology is likely to play an important role in advancing the hydrogen economy. An important point to note is that the company’s solid oxide fuel cells have already been deployed in applications across healthcare, data centers, and critical manufacturing, among others. The company is looking to execute large projects in 2024 and beyond. This is a key catalyst for BE stock surging higher.From a financial perspective, Bloom Energy expects revenue of $1.4 to $1.5 billion for 2023. Further, the non-GAAP operating margin is likely to turn positive. I believe that margin expansion in 2024 and beyond will be another key catalyst for a significant rally.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Shifts to 10 PM/ETNEW YORK, June 26, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--FOX News Channel (FNC) will debut a new primetime lineup on July 17th, announced Suzanne Scott, CEO of FOX News Media. Starting at 7 PM/ET, FNC’s Laura Ingraham will kick off primetime with Jesse Watters taking over the 8 PM/ET timeslot followed by Sean Hannity who will remain at 9 PM/ET while Greg Gutfeld moves to 10 PM/ET. Nightly newscast FOX News @ Night with Trace Gallagher will air an hour earlier at 11 PM/ET.In making the announcement, Scott said, ""FOX News Channel has been America’s destination for news and analysis for more than 21 years and we are thrilled to debut a new lineup. The unique perspectives of Laura Ingraham, Jesse Watters, Sean Hannity, and Greg Gutfeld will ensure our viewers have access to unrivaled coverage from our best-in-class team for years to come.""Kicking off the network’s primetime programming at 7 PM/ET will be cable news’ highest-rated woman Laura Ingraham with her pivotal Washington, D.C. based show The Ingraham Angle. The program has been the top-rated show in the 10 PM/ET timeslot since it launched in 2017. Throughout her tenure with FNC, Ingraham has interviewed several notable political figures, including presidents, members of congress, and White House officials. She has hosted a series of highly rated town halls including Red State Trailblazers, Time for Class and Georgia and the Battle for Senate. A former litigator and Supreme Court law clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas, Ingraham joined FNC in 2007 as a contributor, providing political and legal analysis to FNC’s daytime and primetime programming.Jesse Watters will move to 8PM/ET with his signature opinion program Jesse Watters Primetime. The show originally launched last year in the 7 PM/ET timeslot and earned the title of the fastest growing cable news program, crushing the competition across the board with 2.6 million viewers and 270,000 in the 25-54 demo year to date. Featuring Watters’ fresh take on the major headlines of the day while interviewing newsmakers from across the country, the show has been number one in its timeslot for the 18 months since it launched, delivering the highest-rated 7 PM/ET hour in cable news history. In addition to hosting Primetime, Watters is also a co-host of The Five, the 5 PM/ET roundtable discussion program that has been number one in cable news and all of cable for the last seven consecutive quarters.Story continuesAn iconic part of FNC’s primetime lineup since the network launched in 1996, Sean Hannity will remain in his 9 PM/ET timeslot with Hannity. In 2021, Hannity broke records as the longest-running primetime cable news host in history. Featuring his provocative style and high-profile interviews, Hannity has developed a unique connection with his audience, dominating the ratings for more than two decades. His eponymous program has ranked number one in its time slot with both viewers and in the 25-54 demo for 14 consecutive years since launching as a solo hour in January 2009, and his debut program Hannity &amp; Colmes was number one for seven years prior. Notably, Hannity has consistently delivered over 2.4 million nightly viewers with 278,000 adults 25-54 year to date, ranking number one in the 9 PM/ET timeslot for the past 27 consecutive months.

Yet Fox remains the highest-rated cable news network in total viewers and among adults 25-54.In the weeks following Carlson's departure, Fox had filled the 8 p.m. slot with ""Fox News Tonight,"" which was hosted by a rotating crew of Fox News personalities.Laura Ingraham will move to a show earlier in the evening at 7 p.m. and late-night host Greg Gutfeld will move up an hour to 10 p.m., Fox News said.Meanwhile, Sean Hannity will remain at the 9 p.m. show, the conservative network said.

However, in the post-Trump ecosystem, those rules have shot out the window. Now, mainstream institutions seemingly can’t discuss anything other than politics.It’s here that you can let the Washington-driven diatribes escalate your blood pressure or you can walk a shrewder path: acquire media stocks with high potential that might benefit from the jibber jabber. With new storylines emerging seemingly constantly, the political backdrop symbolizes an investment gold mine.For example, Karl Rove – Senior Advisor to former President George W. Bush – argued in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that Trump invited his latest indictment due in part to his “childish defiance” of the law. GOP presidential candidate Chris Christie entered the race to seemingly antagonize Trump. It’s absolute bonkers theater, which bodes very well for top-performing media stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPlus, with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis attacking both Trump and the “woke” media, a never-ending supply of political barbs will ripple throughout the blogosphere. If you’re a lover of high-growth media stocks, it’s time to get your popcorn ready.FOXAFox$33.20NYTNew York Times$37.24MSFTMicrosoft$338.06Fox (FOXA)The Fox Corporation (FOXA) headquarters in New York City.Source: Leonard Zhukovsky / Shutterstock.comAt first glance, Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA) seems a risky bet for best media stocks to buy. True, Fox News – which falls under the Fox umbrella – caters to a largely conservative audience. As well, the company’s conservative pundits such as Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham know how to push the right buttons. Again, it all makes for great theater. However, the media giant also let go of Tucker Carlson.Soon after, the expulsion of Tucker – which occurred in April this year – hit investor sentiment, sending FOXA sharply down. Nevertheless, it still might make a case for media stocks with high potential. Fundamentally, with social pressures forcing the de-platforming of several controversial right-wing personalities, those on the right have fewer options to see their ideological talking points being represented.Story continuesAlso, FOXA makes a case for top-performing media stocks because of its relative financial resilience. Per data from Gurufocus, Fox’s three-year revenue growth rate on a per-share basis clocks in at 10.2%, above 76.51% of its peers. Also, it sports a trailing-year net margin of 7.84%, beating out 73% of its rivals.New York Times (NYT)market news glasses 1600Source: ShutterstockA thorn on Fox’s side, New York Times (NYSE:NYT) might seem like another risky play on the best media stocks to buy. While the news outlet produces excellent journalism – particularly in less-politically related matters such as the market and the economy – it’s the political op-eds that, for better or for worse dominate the discussion. And let’s face it, the NYT also knows how to push buttons in this specific department.However, I believe the Times ranks among the high-growth media stocks because of its “addressable market.” As stated earlier, the race for the Republican presidential candidacy has become a circus act. I’m not saying that as a matter of ideological critique. Rather, the drama of so many high-profile individuals going after each other organically weaves multiple compelling narratives.Look at it this way. If you were an opinion writer for the Times, the chaos within the ranks of the GOP symbolize pure gold. Honestly, such writers wouldn’t have to rely on hyperbole because the Republicans themselves up the ante. Basically, it’s free money, making NYT one of the media stocks set to blast off.Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comAt first glance, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) doesn’t appear an appropriate entity for best media stocks to buy. Sure, it’s a powerhouse technology name that arguably deserves to be included in everyone’s portfolio. But a media play? Before you start typing a letter to the editor, please note that Microsoft owns MSN. And MSN may be its own media goldmine.If you go to the website, you’ll notice that it’s actually a content aggregator for multiple media sources. With its vast content partnership, MSN is a useful one-stop shop to get the important news for free. Of course, that alone doesn’t necessarily make MSFT one of the media stocks with high potential. Rather, it’s what the company integrates – commentary from the public – that makes MSFT compelling.To be sure, Microsoft doesn’t allow comments for topics that it deems would arouse far too much vitriol. Nevertheless, the company is surprisingly flexible on the topics where it facilitates open discussion. And boy, the internet doesn’t miss an opportunity for flame wars. It’s awfully cynical but MSFT presents an enticing case for top-performing media stocks.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Robinson. Bozeman joins from Ford Motor, where he served as vice president of its customer services division and Ford Blue’s enthusiast vehicles unit for less than a year. Before that, he served as vice president of Amazon’s transportation services for over five years, leading supply chain optimization for customer delivery across the e-commerce giant’s global operations. There, he was instrumental in building its middle-mile global transportation network.“I couldn’t be more excited about working with the incredible Robinson team as we embark on this next chapter of growth and success together. We will be building on a strong existing foundation, and the sky is the limit,” Bozeman wrote on LinkedIn following the announcement of his CEO appointment in early June.Bozeman’s addition to the exclusive cohort of Black Fortune 500 chief executives is an optimistic sign that companies appear committed to increasing diversity in their highest ranks. Still, Black professionals only make up 1.8% of Fortune 500 CEOs—a far cry from the 56 additional corner office spots needed to reach parity with Black America’s 13% labor force participation rate.“There are a plethora of talented, qualified, extraordinary leaders who happen to be Black. It’s never a surprise when they advance to the C-suite, or even to the CEO position,” Laura Morgan Roberts, an associate professor of business administration at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business, told Fortune earlier this month. “It says more about the company’s and the board of directors’ ability to recognize, develop, and advance talent from all backgrounds than it says about the representation of leaders themselves.”Story continuesBozeman joins C.H. Robinson during a tumultuous period. The Eden Prairie, Minn.-based company has faced declining revenue amid waning demand for transportation services, resulting in two rounds of layoffs since November 2022. It’s also in an ongoing fight with activist investor Ancora Holdings Group, which has pressured the company to sell off its international freight forwarding unit. The company ousted former CEO Bob Biesterfeld in early January, while board chairman Scott Anderson stepped in to serve as interim CEO.C.H. Robinson ranked at No. 160 on this year's Fortune 500 list, dropping from No. 154 in 2022. It brought in $24.6 billion in revenue in its last fiscal year.Reactions to Bozeman’s appointment have been mixed. Shares fell 5.3% after his appointment was first reported in early June, but some industry experts have suggested his experience at Amazon and industry-outsider status may help the company out of its slump. For his part, Bozeman told the Wall Street Journal that shareholders and activists would “say it’s the right company, with the right leader, at the right time” once they better understand his experience in “driving scale and building teams” and start seeing results.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the manufacturing sector, head directly to 5 Best Manufacturing Stocks To Buy Now. In 2022, the manufacturing industry remained resilient, and while this year also experienced record demand and production levels, the short-term outlook is not rosy. This is due to the unstable macro environment and uncharted inflation rates, which are destroying growth pace in the sector. Complex issues persist in the manufacturing sector, including supply chain bottlenecks, inventory and logistics backlogs, skyrocketing costs, and cybersecurity breaches. According to Deloitte, there are five crucial trends that will shape the global manufacturing industry in 2023. First, ongoing investments in complex manufacturing technologies will increase productivity and resilience in the manufacturing sector. Second, manufacturers are working hard to address the high workforce turnover and looking to keep their employees onboard with improved talent retention methods. Moreover, manufacturers are alleviating supply chain constraints by shifting to just-in-case inventory strategies and sourcing raw materials locally. Some manufacturers are even creating in-house raw materials to mitigate unforeseen shortages. In addition to that, manufacturers are digitally transforming their plants and factories by making their operations smart or creating a metaverse platform for their products and services. Manufacturers are also working hard to keep their environmental, social, and governance commitments. Another emerging trend in the manufacturing sector is Supply Chain 4.0, which refers to supply chain management that is led by trailblazing technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and big data analytics. This helps revolutionize logistics, supply chains, and production by optimizing costs, increasing efficiency, promoting innovation, and staying ahead of the competition. Story continuesDon't Miss: Top 20 Manufacturing Countries in the WorldJay Timmons, President and CEO of The National Association of Manufacturers, described the manufacturing outlook for this year and commented on January 5, 2023: “The majority of manufacturers expect a recession this year. Congress failed to act on essential tax reforms, which complicates investment, increases inflationary pressures and could stifle economic growth. Much needed permitting reforms and provisions to strengthen our ability to conduct research and development, buy machinery and finance job-creating investments — which we need to promote growth within the sector — were left on the cutting room floor last year. Those reforms, combined with manufacturers’ ongoing efforts to inspire, educate and empower the future workforce, are critical to our competitiveness.”According to Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s Elon Musk, while it is great how many entrepreneurs are entering the tech and software industry, he believes the heavy industry presents significant opportunities. Musk recently stated that there is a scarcity of skilled workforce in the manufacturing and heavy industries.

This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Others sell goods that are priced in dollars such as Parker-Hannifin’s (NYSE:PH) aerospace products.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Manufacturing Stocks To Buy Now.  Suggested articles:Top 16 Medicine Producing Countries in the World15 Best Large-Cap Value Stocks To Buy25 Part-time Retirement Jobs that Pay Well Disclosure: None. 12 Best Manufacturing Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

To skip our introduction and immediately see who wins this competition, click Kanye West Stock Portfolio vs. Warren Buffett Stock Portfolio: Who Wins?Back in December 2017, American rapper Kanye West gifted her then-wife Kim Kardashian about $200,000 worth of stocks as a Christmas present. It was clearly a peculiar present and it seemed Kim Kardashian was also pleasantly surprised. She shared this gift in an Instagram post with a “best husband alert” title. In the post Kardashian shared the photos of different stock certificates gifted to her by Kanye West and some related details. These stocks included Adidas,  Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Disney. At the time many lauded Kanye’s stock-picking skills as all of these were blue-chip companies posting solid returns and had a strong outlook. But how did these stocks perform over the years? Was Kanye West’s stock portfolio really able to beat the market like many had predicted at the time? In this post we decided to evaluate the returns of Kanye West’s stock portfolio and compare them to Warren Buffett’s stock portfolio returns. While some might call this an unfair comparison, we believe it’d be an interesting exercise since Kanye West’s business skills aren’t a secret. The 45-year rapper has started many businesses and ventures over these years. He has an estimated worth of about $400 million.Kanye West's Business AcumenYeezy, which Ye started in collaboration with Adidas, is perhaps the biggest business venture of the rapper which has pocketed him millions of dollars. While the partnership has run into trouble, some latest media reports claimed that Ye made about $25 million just from the sale of leftover Yeezy stock. Some other notable ventures of Ye include creative agency Donda and independent record label Good Music. He has also reportedly bought fast food restaurants in the past through his company KW Foods.Story continuesBut it comes to Warren Buffett, his investment philosophy and impeccable record of beating the market hardly needs any introduction since we have talked about these topics in detail previously in our articles. For this article we were interested in taking a look at what Buffett was talking about in his letter to shareholders in 2017, the year for which we use his stock portfolio in our article. And we were not surprised to see that Buffett in 2017 was repeating the same, age-old and time-tested investment mantras which have served him so well over all these years.Take a look at the humility of Buffett when he talks about his “secrets” of success.“Charlie and I view the marketable common stocks that Berkshire owns as interests in businesses, not as ticker symbols to be bought or sold based on their “chart” patterns, the “target” prices of analysts or the opinions of media pundits. Instead, we simply believe that if the businesses of the investees are successful (as we believe most will be) our investments will be successful as well. Sometimes the payoffs to us will be modest; occasionally the cash register will ring loudly. And sometimes I will make expensive mistakes. Overall – and over time – we should get decent results. In America, equity investors have the wind at their back. From our stock portfolio – call our holdings “minority interests” in a diversified group of publicly-owned businesses – Berkshire received $3.7 billion of dividends in 2017. That’s the number included in our GAAP figures, as well as in the “operating earnings” we reference in our quarterly and annual reports. That dividend figure, however, far understates the “true” earnings emanating from our stock holdings. For decades, we have stated in Principle 6 of our “Owner-Related Business Principles” that we expect undistributed earnings of our investees to deliver us at least equivalent earnings by way of subsequent capital gains. Our recognition of capital gains (and losses) will be lumpy, particularly as we conform with the new GAAP rule requiring us to constantly record unrealized gains or losses in our earnings. I feel confident, however, that the earnings retained by our investees will over time, and with our investees viewed as a group, translate into commensurate capital gains for Berkshire. The connection of value-building to retained earnings that I’ve just described will be impossible to detect in the short term. Stocks surge and swoon, seemingly untethered to any year-to-year buildup in their underlying value. Over time, however, Ben Graham’s oft-quoted maxim proves true: “In the short run, the market is a voting machine; in the long run, however, it becomes a weighing machine.”Kanye West Stock Portfolio vs. Warren Buffett Stock PortfolioKanye West Photo Credit: David ShankboneOur MethodologyFor this article, we first discussed Kanye West’s five stock picks based on the gifts he gave to Kim Kardashian in 2017. The details of these stocks were reported by several media outlets. We then mentioned the top 5 stock picks of Warren Buffett using his Q4’2017 portfolio. We then compared equal-weighted returns of both these stock portfolios.Kanye West Stock Portfolio vs. Warren Buffett Stock Portfolio First, we take a look at Kanye West's stock portfolio.adidas AG (OTC:ADDYY)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: N/AAccording to media reports Kanye West gifted around 1015 shares of Adidas to Kim Kardashian for the 2017 Christmas. As of June 4 the stock was trading at around $85.79, while its price back in December 2017 stood at around $98.46. The stock’s return is a negative 12.86% during the period starting from late December until June 4.Here is what Polen International Growth Fund has to say about adidas AG (NYSE:ADDYY) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“We added to the Portfolio’s position in adidas AG as we believe the company’s management team is making strides in positioning the company for faster growth. Innovative product development, along with interesting design and marketing collaboration initiatives, have been unlocking the company’s growth potential.We also believe the continuing shift away from wholesale distribution to direct-to-consumer sales should drive steady margin progress. We estimate that adidas will grow earnings in the high teens annually over the next five years.”Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 243Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s stock price on December 25 was around $58.52 while today the stock price stands at $124.25. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has returned more than 112% during this period. This way, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was one of the best stock picks of Kanye West.Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also highly popular among hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, 243 hedge funds had stakes in the company. The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Amazon during this period was Natixis Global Asset Management’s Harris Associates which owns a $2.4 billion stake in the company.Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 131Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is another top performer in Kanye West stock portfolio. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares were trading at approximately $42.70 as of December 25, 2017, while today the stock price stands at $180.95. Apple has returned about 320% in this period.Hedge funds also love Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). As of the end of the first quarter of 2023, 131 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Apple was, you guessed it, Warren Buffett, who had a $151 billion stake in the company. We will talk about Warren Buffett’s stake in Apple in the second part of this article.Loop Capital recently reduced its rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) citing the company’s decreased targets for iPhone shipments for June. However, the firm kept its price target of $180 on the stock.The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 95Kanye West had gifted around 950 shares of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) to Kim Kardashian back in December 2017. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) was trading at around $108 at that time. Today, Disney’s stock price is $90.77. Clearly, it wasn’t a wise bet from Kanye, since the stock posted losses of about 15% during this period.Nevertheless The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) remains one of the most popular stocks among elite hedge funds in America and analysts believe the stock has a strong potential to grow. Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds shows that 95 hedge funds had stakes in the company as of the end of March this year. The most significant shareholder of the company was Trian Partners of Nelson Peltz which owns a $592 million stake in the company.Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108Back in 2017, when Kanye West gifted Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares to Kim Kardashian, the streaming company was looking like it won’t ever see a decline. Everyone was flocking to Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and the company was the dominant player in the industry. Its subscribers were growing exponentially. The stock was trading at around $532 near the end of December 2017. Fast forward to today, the stock has plummeted to $400, as the company started to lose subscribers to competitors and faced growth challenges. Since December 2017 the stock has lost about 25%.Bloomberg recently reported that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) shareholders have rejected compensation packages for the company’s top executives.

To date, 56 single family homes have been retrofitted as part of ComEd’s Whole Home Electrification program, a first-of-its-kind initiative designed to convert single family and multi-unit homes to energy-saving, all-electric heating and cooling systems and appliances.Through the Whole Home Electrification program, ComEd is investing $40 million to deliver no-cost retrofits to qualifying low-income customers through 2025. Since launching the program last year, ComEd has fully electrified 56 homes in Chicago, with hundreds of additional single family and multi-family units signed up to receive full home retrofits through the program. These residential customers will receive new heat pumps and other highly efficient electric technologies at no-cost, with a goal of reducing reliance on fossil fuels, eliminating carbon emissions, and lowering overall energy use, which can deliver net savings on energy bills.""ComEd is committed to ensuring that all customers are able to access the benefits of clean energy technologies, including heat pumps and other home upgrades that can help lower energy usage and overall energy costs,"" said ComEd CEO Gil C. Quiniones. ""We’re proud to bring the benefits of home electrification to low-income customers, building on commitment to expanding programs that will enhance air quality for our communities and provide sustainable savings for the customers who need it most.""The new Whole Home Electrification program prioritizes electrification for those who can benefit most from energy savings, a key priority identified in Illinois’ landmark Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA). The program focuses on converting low-income homes – which tend to be older, use more energy, and located within community areas historically and disproportionately impacted by pollution. Placing these customers first in line for converting to all-electric technologies offers a way to prioritize lowering the energy burden for low-income customers.Story continuesCustomers participating in the Whole Home Electrification offering may receive a range of ENERGY STAR-qualified upgrades to convert to all-electric energy systems, depending on the unique characteristics of their homes, including: heat pumps, which are essentially two-way air conditioners to provide year round heating and cooling; heat pump water heaters; induction or electric stoves; and electric or heat pump clothes dryers.ComEd is working through partners – including Elevate, Resource Innovations, Franklin Energy, Chicago Bungalow Association and BlocPower – to deliver upgrades to customers who are eligible to participate in the program and to identify homes capable of realizing net energy savings as a result of going electric. Each home modification is different, with upgrades determined through a home assessment and completed by a qualified ComEd Energy Efficiency Service Provider (EESP).""Resource Innovations couldn't be more excited to leverage our extensive experience in clean energy implementation to support ComEd’s Whole Home Electrification Program,"" said Resource Innovations CEO, Lauren Casentini. ""With the power of our diverse network of authorized service providers, we're making the entire process of home electrification easy to access for the customers that need it the most.""Early data indicates that participating customers are expected to see significant cost and energy savings through participation in the program – with over $800 in expected annual savings, and high efficiency upgrades expected to save 22,000 kWh a year, the equivalent of conserving over 1,700 gallons of gasoline. Actual savings and energy usage will vary by customer, and depend on age of housing, type of equipment installed and other factors.""The benefits of electrification can be incredibly meaningful to someone living in an older home, such as added cooling and lower energy bills,"" said Anne Evens, CEO of Elevate. ""Electrifying Chicago’s older building stock can be complex, and it’s been important for us to work in partnership on these projects. We’re excited to continue this work with ComEd and expand the impact of equitable electrification across the city.""To be eligible to participate in the Whole Home Electrification program, customers must demonstrate annual income at or below 80 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI), as well as other qualifying criteria determined through an assessment. Multi-Family buildings that provide housing the income-eligible tenants and buildings owned or managed by Public Housing Authorities are also eligible to participate. The program covers 100 percent of costs for single family homes and 70 percent for multi-family buildings.""We’re so grateful to be a part of this program and to be able to offer homeowners increased energy security at a time when everyday living expenses are skyrocketing,"" said Mary Ellen Guest, Executive Director of the Chicago Bungalow Association. ""All of our members live in vintage homes, and many are disproportionately affected by climate change due to limited incomes—this program helps level the playing field and brings tremendous relief.""ComEd and its partners continue to evaluate and connect with customers who may be eligible for whole home modifications, or other home electric upgrades available through the ComEd Energy Efficiency Program, which has collectively saved customers over $7 billion on energy bills in recent years.The launch of the whole home electrification program is just one example of how ComEd is investing to increase adoption of modern, high efficiency electric technologies, a key priority outlined in the state’s landmark Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA) law. To help its communities achieve new goals for lowering carbon emissions, ComEd is working to remove barriers to EVs and other electric technologies. To help customers unlock the benefits of clean transportation, ComEd launched the EV Toolkit.Customers can also explore how to qualify for ComEd incentives that help lower the cost of purchasing and installing electric HVAC and appliances, including heat pumps, induction cooktops, and electric clothes dryers, by calling 1-855-433-2700, or visiting the ComEd’s Home Energy Savings page.ComEd is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC), a Fortune 250 energy company with approximately 10 million electricity and natural gas customers – the largest number of customers in the U.S. ComEd powers the lives of more than 4 million customers across northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state’s population.

We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.50bUS$2.93bUS$3.02bUS$3.10bUS$3.18bUS$3.25bUS$3.32bUS$3.40bUS$3.47bUS$3.55bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x5Est @ 2.61%Est @ 2.46%Est @ 2.35%Est @ 2.28%Est @ 2.23%Est @ 2.19%Est @ 2.17% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$2.3kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0kUS$1.9kUS$1.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$22bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.5b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.1%) = US$76bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$76b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$39bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$61b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$76.6, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Colgate-Palmolive as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Colgate-PalmoliveStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Household Products market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatDividends are not covered by earnings.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

Last week, the S&amp;P 500 closed 20% above its recent lows and the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) sentiment index hit its highest level since 2021.As InvestorPlace analyst Luke Lango notes, slowing inflation and rising markets tend to signal even greater gains to come. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsYet, our editors at InvestorPlace.com, our free news site, have also seen a recent surge in reader interest about stocks to sell.Oil…Crypto…Even artificial intelligence and electric vehicle stocks.That’s because experienced investors know that some companies will fall back to Earth once the new bull market ends. These second-rate stocks ride the coattails of successful firms on the way up, only to crash back down once the market cools.That’s why our writers have been busy identifying the second-rate companies to sell immediately. Let’s take a look at their top picks…Lucid (LCID)The Lucid Motors (LCID) Plant in Arizona.Source: Around the World Photos / Shutterstock.comAt first glance, there’s a lot to like about electric vehicle company Lucid Motors (NASDAQ:LCID). The company was a superstar SPAC merger and is led by a highly experienced team of former Tesla engineers and other automotive veterans. Its flagship Lucid Air won MotorTrend’s 2022 Car of the Year award for its “meticulous design and unparalleled electric capabilities.”This week, however, Louis Navellier and his team warn investors that Lucid’s recent Chinese ambitions signal an underlying issue with its sales figures. They say:Lucid only delivered 1,406 vehicles from its Arizona factory during 2023’s first quarter.Does the company miraculously expect to do better in China? [Head of China operations Zhu] Jiang’s confidence isn’t the same thing as a specific, well-documented road map to success in a highly competitive market.Story continuesIn other words, Lucid’s sudden pivot into the Chinese market is more an act of desperation than a carefully planned strategy. The Chinese market is already relatively saturated with high-end players, including Nio (NYSE:NIO), Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV), Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) itself. Buyers also prefer luxury SUVs to sedans — an area where Lucid has no experience.InvestorPlace.com writer Faisal Humayun agrees with the assessment. The former LCID bull highlights how intensifying competition and disappointing growth have turned him negative about the company’s prospects. A recent $3 billion capital raise underscores the company’s financial woes.Though Lucid may eventually become a key Tesla competitor, its strategy today looks more in line with that of a second-tier company.Altria (MO)a sign with the Altria (MO) logoSource: Kristi Blokhin / Shutterstock.comDividend-seeking investors have long relied on “sin” stocks for regular income. Tobacco, alcohol and gaming stocks have traditionally sold at a discount, which makes their dividend appear larger relative to their market prices.That’s made Altria Group (NYSE:MO) — a 2003 rebrand of Philip Morris – a tempting investment. The tobacco company offers a high 8.5% dividend yield and trades at a stable 0.63 beta.But don’t be fooled by these rosy figures.This week, InvestorPlace.com’s Joel Baglole highlights how Altria’s apparent stability masks “chronic underperformance” at the once well-managed firm. In 2018, the tobacco company spent $13 billion to acquire e-cigarette company Juul, only to lose 95% of its investment after regulators banned Juul’s products. Altria also spent $1.8 billion on cannabis firm Cronos. The acquired firm now trades as a penny stock.At the same time, reduced tobacco consumption continues to chip away at Altria’s financials. The company only generated $8.05 billion in free cash flow last year, a 2% decline from the year before. Wall Street analysts have also been steadily reducing their earnings per share (EPS) estimates since early 2022. It’s hard to maintain profits when revenues are in secular decline.Altria may once have been a top-tier dividend producer. But shifts in smoking habits (and poorly thought investments on Altria’s part) mean this dividend aristocrat is quickly turning into a second-rate bet.Bitfarms (BITF)An image of a miner with a pickaxe mining digital coins, computer code and various numbers are overlaid on the imageSource: Yev_1234 / ShutterstockBitfarms (NASDAQ:BITF) is a Toronto-based cryptocurrency miner that once traded as high as $8.50 per share. Excitement over the company’s “green” Bitcoin (BTC-USD) mining helped the Canadian firm achieve top-notch market valuations. At the time, Bitfarm’s use of hydropower seemed like the future.But it turns out that the capital-intensive nature of Bitcoin mining isn’t particularly profitable, no matter what source of energy you use. High capital investments, paired with volatile crypto prices, mean that Bitfarms has never generated a single year of positive free cash flow, according to data from Thomson Reuters.This week at InvestorPlace.com, Josh Enomoto writes how he is throwing in the towel on crypto mining firms.In its place, this early crypto supporter recommends higher quality tech stocks, knowing that AI and quantum computing are far better bets than the second-rate world of crypto mining. When it comes to generating consistent profits, having low capital overheads makes the most sense.PetMed Express (PETS)ZOM stock: Persian cat with veterinarian doctor at vet clinicSource: didesign021 / Shutterstock.comJoel Baglole also warns investors about PetMed Express (NASDAQ:PETS), better known as “PetMeds,” this week. The online pet pharmacy traded at $40 during the Covid-19 pandemic but has recently seen a significant slowdown in demand. The company reported a 5.4% decline in quarterly revenue in its latest quarter.Meanwhile, firms like Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) and Petco (NASDAQ:WOOF) have done far better, with growth ranging between 5% to 15%. At its core, PetMeds finds itself stuck between these two behemoths. Chewy operates an unusually efficient marketing funnel, spending between 6% and 7% of revenues on advertising to generate 13% to 15% year-over-year growth. (PetMeds achieves only a third of that efficiency). Meanwhile, Petco remains hypercompetitive from its extremely low costs. The brick-and-mortar pet store generates gross profits that are over a third higher than PetMeds’ while seeing similar overheads.That means PetMeds’ high dividend will unlikely last for long. Investors are better off buying the top online pet company (Chewy) or the top brick-and-mortar one (Petco) than settling for PetMeds.Devon (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comDevon Energy (NYSE:DVN) rounds out our list of second-tier companies this week after announcing weak 2023 production guidance and higher-than-anticipated capital expenditures.This marks a stunning turnaround for what was once one of America’s lowest-cost hydrocarbon producers. In 2019, the company divested its high-cost Canadian oil sands business and merged with WPX Energy in 2021 to gain access to lower-cost assets. At the time, Rystad Energy noted that Devon had the lowest breakeven costs associated with undeveloped reserves.But these high returns on capital seem to be coming to an end. This week, Faizan Farooque notes how the energy exploration firm raised its capital spending from $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion to offset production losses. Wall Street analysts have also trimmed their 2023 EPS estimates from $8.90 in January to $6.30 today on lower energy prices.Louis suggests that investors consider other energy stocks instead. In his latest quantitative updates, he identifies a handful of energy companies with improving outlooks in this tough environment.The Curse of Being Second-BestMy family hates sending me out grocery shopping. They’ll often give me a list of ketchup… cereal… salsa…… and I’ll come back home with store-brand versions of everything.I barely know the difference between Heinz and Hunt’s.But if you ask me about the companies I buy… that’s an entirely different matter. That’s because buying top-tier companies matters.We see this happen repeatedly. Dominant companies like Amazon will eventually beat the eBays. Uber now outperforms Lyft by a wide margin. And hundreds of former chipmakers have fallen to the likes of TSMC.That’s because small profit differences tend to magnify over long periods, as I explain in my Perpetual Money Machine Strategy. If a dominant company can charge 10% more for a product, for instance, that extra cash can go into improving quality, increasing production, or greater advertising. That, in turn, helps the dominant company generate even more profits, and so on.The opposite is true for second-rate companies. These firms have less money to reinvest in research and development, putting them on a downward spiral.Today’s bull market will make these upstarts seem like superstars, at least in the short run. This week, a 4-week-old startup managed to raise 105 million euros in a growing frenzy surrounding AI technologies. But once the tide goes back out, investors should be sure their high-priced acquisitions are winners in their fields.That’s part of what analysts like Eric Fry do. For example, Eric recently traveled to San Francisco to visit the “birthplace” of AI… and to scope out which are the best AI investments to make right now.Eric tells me that every American deserves to see what’s happening there because Elon Musk’s “Project Omega” is guaranteed to affect all 331 million Americans one way or another.Click here now and learn how to prepare.As of this writing, Tom Yeung did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Tom Yeung is a market analyst and portfolio manager of the Omnia Portfolio, the highest-tier subscription at InvestorPlace.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line stands at a loss of $1.57 per share, indicating a drastic decline from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $2.59 per share.Meanwhile, Micron estimates revenues of $3.70 billion (+/- $200 million). The consensus mark for revenues is pegged at $3.69 billion, suggesting a 57.3% decrease from the year-earlier period’s revenues of $8.64 billion.The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the trailing four quarters while missing the same on two occasions, the average surprise being -69.9%.Let’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.Micron Technology, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMicron Technology, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayMicron’s overall third-quarter performance is likely to have been negatively impacted by soft consumer spending due to rising inflationary pressure and growing concerns over the global economic slowdown. Softened consumer spending has resulted in weak memory chip demand from the smartphone and personal computer end markets.Substantial customer inventory adjustments across end markets are expected to have hurt the overall financial performance in the third quarter. MU’s customers across multiple end markets have been adjusting their DRAM and NAND memory chip purchases amid soft macroeconomic conditions.The memory chip maker’s heavy dependence on China is a headwind due to the ongoing tit-for-tat trade spat between the United States and China. In May 2023, the Chinese government imposed restrictions on Micron for selling its products in key domestic industries on national security concerns, stating that the memory chipmaker failed to pass a cybersecurity review initiated in late March 2023. Chip sales in China make up approximately 11% of Micron’s total revenues.Story continuesAdditionally, a higher mix of lower-margin NAND, coupled with low memory prices and a minimal decline in manufacturing costs, is expected to have strained margins.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Micron this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here.Micron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

The company has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.54% at present. Tyler’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the trailing four quarters while missing the same on one occasion, the average surprise being 2.8%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TYL’s second-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.86 per share, suggesting a decline of 1.1% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $1.88. Tyler’s quarterly revenues are estimated to increase 4.7% year over year to $490.7 million.Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +3.39%.

""We can’t wait for Magic fans and new players to come together on the journey there and back again through the thematic gameplay that Magic fans all over the world have come to love and appreciate.""Iconic scenes from the Third Age of Middle-earth are brought to life through stunning original art.

As a staple in the Commander format, Sol Ring is one of Magic’s most famous and used cards, making these unique versions highly desirable for collectors and players alike.RingbearerAs the Ringbearer, the One Ring changes the abilities of a creature that has been tempted by its power. It immediately becomes legendary and can't be blocked by creatures with greater power. In time, The Ring's other abilities will provide valuable combat bonuses, increasing in power as The Ring Tempts You mechanic enters into the game through other cards.Celebration Weekend and Arena PlayThe Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-earth™ is available now.

This, after several quarters of underwhelming operating results, lands FIS as our top detractor for the fiscal year period as well. Our FIS experience has been disappointing to be sure. But having re-underwritten our investment thesis and lowered our business value estimate, we believe investors have exacted too steep a penalty on FIS shares.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Dow Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.In Tony Robbins’ Money – Master The Game, there’s a chapter titled Invest Like the .001%: The Billionaire’s Playbook. The chapter mentions the “secrets” behind wealth creation which Tony Robbins gathered after interviewing about 50 billionaires. These billionaires include Paul Tudor Jones, Warren Buffett, Carl Icahn, and many others. The chapter gives some really important lessons that give a sneak peek into billionaires’ thought process, their values and their peculiar nature that helped them stand out among millions of other people.For example, it’s a common notion that billionaires are always aggressive in nature when it comes to investments and they never shy away from making “risky” bets. But the first takeaway Robbins mentions in this chapter is that billionaires are “obsessed” with making sure they don’t lose money. Robbins sums up the reason behind this obsession by pointing to the value of time. The reason why billionaires emphatically try not to lose money is that if you lose 50%, according to Robbins, it would take 100% to get back to where you started, and all of that effort would require something that you can never get back: time.Another key takeaway from Tony Robbins’ interviews with billionaires is that billionaires are always looking to maximize their gains with as few risks as possible. This, again, is contrary to the common belief that billionaires are always looking to take big risks and they are willing to bet it all. Robbins says that the billionaires he interviewed are, without exception, looking for something that he calls “asymmetric risk/reward.” Here’s how the book sums up this lesson by quoting billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, whose total wealth today stands at $7.5 billion. Jones told Robbins that he doesn’t make an investment until he is sure of making $5 from every $1 invested.Story continues“And that, he says, is a $100,000 MBA in a nutshell!,” the book adds.Another excellent lesson Robbins got after interviewing famous billionaires was that the wealthy are good at making decisions based on the limited information they have. Robbins says that most talented people are not good investors since they don’t have the ability to make the most out of the limited information and by the time they get full information, the opportunity is no longer available.Perhaps the biggest and most important lesson we could learn from the billionaires Tony Robbins interviewed is that just having the humility to learn from your mistakes and improve yourself could exponentially increase your chances of success.“Contrary to what most people would expect, this group of achievers is never done! They’re never done learning, they’re never done earning, they’re never done growing, they’re never done giving! No matter how well they’ve done or how well they’ve continued to do, they never lose their hunger—the force that unleashes human genius. Most people would think, “If I had all this money, I would just stop. Why keep working?” Because each believes, somewhere in his or her soul, that “to whom much is given, much is expected.” Their labor is their love. Just like these money masters invest in different ways, they give back in different ways. They share their time, they share their money, they create foundations, they invest in others. Each of them has come to realize that true meaning in life comes from giving. They feel a responsibility to use their gifts to serve others. As Winston Churchill said, “We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give.” What unites them is the ultimate truth that life is about more than what you have. It’s really about what you have to give.”The key investing themes followed by billionaires according to Tony Robbins are clearly visible when we analyze the portfolios of some billionaire portfolios. Amid rising inflation and Federal Reserve’s rate hikes, several family office funds of famous billionaires started cutting their exposure to stocks. An analysis from Bloomberg earlier this year showed that billionaire George Soros’s fund was upping its hold in investment-grade bonds and selling stocks. Billionaire Soros’ fund sold 130 stocks during the fourth quarter of 2022 and bought less than 30. The fund’s selling spree continues as its Q1’2023 portfolio shows a plethora of stocks in which the fund exited its positions.The 2022 market crash didn’t spare even the billionaires and smart money managers, especially those who were piled into technology and growth stocks. Hedge funds led by famous billionaires and veteran investors, including D1 Capital’s Dan Sundheim, TCI’s Chris Hohn, Lone Pine Capital’s Stephen Mandel and Viking Global’s Andreas Halvorsen saw huge losses.On the other hand, 15 hedge funds in the industry made a whopping $14 billion in the same period through personal investments and hedge fund fees, according to Bloomberg These winners include billionaire Ken Griffin of Citadel, billionaire Steve Cohen of Point72, billionaire Israel Englander of Millennium Management, billionaire DE Shaw, billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, among others.When billionaires have to say something about the future trajectory and possibilities in the financial markets, the world listens. A stark warning about the future recently came from billionaire Cliff Asness of AQR Capital management, who, while talking to Bloomberg, highlighted the difference between the bond and stock markets when it comes to sentiment. The billionaire said that the bond market is indicating that the Federal Reserve could initiate aggressive rate cuts over the next one or two years. Asness thinks this could cause a recession.Dow Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up OnOur MethodologyFor this article, we first scanned  The Dow Jones Industrial Average and calculated the number of billionaire investors for each of the 30 stocks of the index.

While iPhone sales were down year-over-year (YoY). services revenues grew 7% YoY which was slightly above analyst estimates. Company earnings were also better-than-anticipated due to lower input costs, such as memory chips and cost control initiatives.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. McDonald's (MCD) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.76 a share, just 29 days from its upcoming earnings release on July 25, 2023.McDonald's' Earnings ESP sits at 0.27%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.76 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.75.MCD is part of a big group of Retail-Wholesale stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Carvana (CVNA) as well.Carvana is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on August 3, 2023. CVNA's Most Accurate Estimate sits at -$1.09 a share 38 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Carvana is -$1.15, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 4.76%.Story continuesMCD and CVNA's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

MLM touched a new 52-week high of $443.26 on Jun 23. The stock pulled back to end the trading session at $442.38, up 0.72% from the previous day’s closing price of $439.22.MLM has gained 30.5% in the three months period compared with the Zacks Building Products - Concrete and Aggregates industry’s growth of 29.7%, the Zacks Construction sector’s increase of 16.6% and S&amp;P 500 Index’s growth of 9.8%.The price surge was probably due to the latest statistics released by the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development revealing promising trends in the new residential construction sector for May 2023. Building permits experienced strong growth, with a 5.2% increase from April, indicating a positive trajectory. Housing starts demonstrated more robust growth, up 21.7% from April levels. Housing completions also displayed positive growth, up 9.5% from the previous month’s levels. These encouraging trends suggest a potentially strong construction market, offering opportunities for investors and homebuyers.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe strong growth in building permits, housing starts and housing completions in May 2023 can be attributed to favorable market conditions and increased demand. These factors combined with government initiatives, provide a solid foundation for the continued expansion of the U.S. construction sector.Meanwhile, Martin Marietta's public infrastructure market, which represented 35% of its 2022 aggregate shipments, experienced a 5% volume increase from 2021 on the back of solid demand spurred by accelerating federal and state level investment. The company expects infrastructure shipments to surge in the future, driven by healthy state Department of Transportation (DOT) budgets and an expected extension or replacement for the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act.Also, Martin Marietta and other concrete and aggregates producers are expected to benefit from strong global trends in infrastructure modernization, energy transition, national security and a potential super-cycle in global supply-chain investments. The need to rebuild the nation’s deteriorating roads and bridges will likely help MLM.The company expects a diverse mix of federal projects for road and bridge work, water control, harbors and ports and the power grid to drive growth in 2023. MLM anticipates substantial opportunities in 2023 across federally funded infrastructure projects, industrial manufacturing, energy and power. It expects to deliver another year of profitable growth, a strong cash flow and attractive returns for shareholders.The new Federal Infrastructure Law along with strong state DOT budgets in the company’s key states of Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida and California provide Martin Marietta with a long-awaited runway for multi-year growth in infrastructure demand. Martin Marietta believes that its strategic coast-to-coast footprint is well-positioned for long-term growth, backed by favorable population migration trends, housing shortages in markets and a long-term federal highway bill complemented by healthy DOT budgets in its key states.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksMartin Marietta currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Other top-ranked stocks from the Zacks Construction sector are: Dycom Industries, Inc.

Last week was a disappointing one. The three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — fell 1.7%, 1.45 and 1.4%, respectively.The Nasdaq Composite reversed the trend of an eight-week win. The Dow terminated a three-week winning streak. The S&amp;P 500 ended a five-week winning run. The S&amp;P 500 recorded its worst weekly performance since the week ended Mar 10, 2023. The Nasdaq Composite also posted the worst week since March 2023.A higher interest rate policy adopted by several major central banks to combat inflation has created a ruckus in the global financial markets. On Jun 14, in his post-FOMC meeting statement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that more interest rate hikes are likely this year despite a pause in rate hike in the June FOMC after 10 consecutive increases. The Fed’s current “dot-plot” shows that the mean expectation of officials is for another 50-basis point raise in the benchmark interest rate. This implies, two more rate hikes of 25 basis points each within 2023. Consequently, the terminal interest rate is presently estimated at 5.6%, instead of 5.125%, anticipated after the May FOMC meeting.At present, the CME FedWatch has assigned a probability of 72% that the Fed will raise the Fed fund rate by 25 basis points in the July FOMC meeting. On the other hand, 28% of respondents have projected that the central bank will maintain status quo.  No rate cut is expected this year. The first cut in interest rate may be delayed till 2025. Majority of market participants were expecting the first rate cut in 2024. Last week, in his testimony before the U.S. Congress, Powell reaffirmed his stand that more rate hikes are likely by this year-end.Moreover, last week, the central banks of the UK, Switzerland, Norway and Turkey raised their respective benchmark lending rates. Market participants are concerned that higher interest rate will hinder economic activities resulting in global economic recession.Story continuesFearing an impending recession, investors opted for safe-haven sovereign bonds instead of risky equities. As a result, on Jun 23, prices of several sovereign bonds spiked and yield declined.  The yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note fell 6 basis points to 3.737%. The yields on the 10-Year UK bond and 10-Year German bond fell more than 10 basis points each.Our Top PicksAt this stage, investment in low-beta, dividend-paying stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank may be the best option. If markets regain momentum, the favorable Zacks Rank of these stocks will capture the upside potential. However, if the downtrend continues, low-beta stocks will minimize portfolio losses and dividend payments will act as a regular income stream.We have narrowed our search to five dividend-paying low-beta (beta &gt;0 &lt;1) stocks. These companies have strong growth potential for 2023 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks year to date.pZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Clorox Co.

Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and rose from the prior year. Solid pricing actions, which drove robust margin expansion despite continued inflationary pressure and modestly lower aggregate shipments, helped it generate strong results. Adjusted gross and EBITDA margins also expanded impressively from a year ago.MLM expects solid near-term product demand backed by healthy customer backlogs across its coast-to-coast footprint.

336,8813da89-185f-3a55-89ce-eab2671dc66e,NI,2023-06-27,5 Stocks to Buy as Fed Continues to Grapple With Inflation,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-stocks-buy-fed-continues-121600556.html,1687781760,STORY,"['PPL', 'ATO', 'NI', 'SR', 'NIMC', 'SRCU', 'NWN']","[Stocks retreated last week following a solid rally after the Fed kept its interest rates unchanged for the first time after 10 straight hikes. This is because investors are still unsure about the economy’s health and the Fed’s next course of action.Although inflation has shown signs of easing, it’s still at multi-year highs and the Fed’s fight to bring down inflation is far from over. This was also indicated by Fed Chair Jerome Powell during his Congressional testimony last week. Hence markets are likely to remain volatile for longer than expected. Given this situation, it would be wise to invest in defensive stocks like utilities with a favorable Zacks Rank that are likely to strengthen one’s portfolio.Market Volatility ContinuesAll three major indexes snapped their multiweek winning streaks as market participants remain concerned about the Fed’s next move. The Dow ended 1.7% lower, ending its three-week winning streak. The S&amp;P 500 closed 1.4% down after recording five straight weeks of gains. The Nasdaq also finished the week 1.4% down, snapping its eight-week winning streak.Understandably, stocks are scurrying for direction as investors are trying to gauge Fed’s next move with interest rate hikes. Inflation has eased lately, with both the consumer price and producer price inflation declining significantly in May.The consumer price index (CPI) increased 4% in May, beating expectations of a rise of 4.1%. This was also significantly lower than April’s increase of 4.9%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported.Also, the producer price index (PPI) decreased 0.3% in May, following a 0.2% increase in April. The PPI has now declined in three of the past five months, indicating that the Fed’s aggressive interest rate hike stance has helped in bringing down inflation.This prompted the Fed to leave interest rates unchanged for the first time after 10 consecutive hikes totaling 500 basis points that have now taken the benchmark interest rate to the range of 5-5.25%.Story continuesHowever, Powell has also suggested that the Fed is still not done with its interest rate tightening cycle, as inflation is still elevated and far above its target of 2%. Powell suggested that at least two more interest rate hikes of 25 basis points each would be required by the end of this year.This has raised fresh concerns among investors that the economy might slow further, which unsettled markets last week.Considering the current circumstances, investing in utility stocks could be a prudent choice.

Also, strategic acquisitions poise the company for future growth. Yet, unfavorable currency movement and weak solvency are major dampeners for the stock. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Envista has outperformed the industry in the past year. The stock has declined 10.6% compared with the industry’s 22.8% fall.In first-quarter 2023, Envista registered strong growth in the Specialty Products &amp; Technologies Segment, driven by the combined Orthodontics business and Spark Aligner business. The company registered double-digit growth in other emerging markets and high single-digit growth in Europe. The Orthodontic business continued to perform well, delivering double-digit core growth despite the challenges in China and Russia. On a geographic basis, developed markets grew 3.5%, driven by strong growth in Western Europe.In Q1, the company’s implant businesses in Europe performed well on the back of disciplined commercial execution. The company’s regenerative business, including the newly-acquired Osteogenics business, continues to accelerate as well.In 2022, Envista closed two strategically significant acquisitions that positioned it to drive the digitization of the dental market while exposing it to higher growth segments within the industry.In July 2022, Envista acquired Osteogenics Biomedical — the developer of innovative regenerative solutions for periodontists, oral &amp; maxillofacial surgeons and clinicians involved in implant dentistry throughout the world. In April 2022, Envista acquired Carestream Dental's Intraoral Scanner business. The business is rebranded as DEXIS and will operate as part of the Envista Equipment and Consumables Segment. This acquisition further enables the company’s purpose of partnering with dental professionals to improve patients' lives by digitizing, personalizing and democratizing dental care.Story continuesEnvista Holdings Corporation PriceEnvista Holdings Corporation PriceEnvista Holdings Corporation price | Envista Holdings Corporation QuoteDuring the first quarter earnings update, the company stated that the recently-acquired business DEXIS IOS and Osteogenics continued to perform in line with the company’s expectations, delivering combined sales of greater than $20 million in the reported quarter. The businesses are expected to contribute over 75 basis points of core growth to Envista in 2023.On the flip side, Envista ended first-quarter 2023 with lower-than-expected revenues and earnings. The year-over-year decline in core sales was primarily the result of weakness in China and Russia as well as lower demand for large capital equipment.Geographically, the company’s sales declined substantially in Russia and China. The downside in Russia was primarily due to unusually strong performance in the first quarter of 2022 as clinicians pre-purchased inventory at the start of the conflict in Ukraine. In China, demand was down significantly in the quarter due to COVID-related slowdown. Contraction of both margins is discouraging too.Gross profit for the reported quarter fell 3% year over year while gross margin contracted 142 basis points (bps) to 57.8%. Selling, general and administrative expenses were up 3.1% year over year. Research and development expenses rose 0.4% year over year. Meanwhile, operating profit was down 21.2% year over year. Operating margin, too, contracted 300 bps to 11.5%.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Zimmer Biomet ZBH, Penumbra PEN and Hologic, Inc. HOLX.Zimmer Biomet has an earnings yield of 5.17% compared to the industry’s (1.42%). Zimmer Biomet’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 7.38%.

HSIC is well-poised for growth in the coming quarters, backed by the strength of its dental business. The company’s revenue growth has been consistently supported by niche acquisitions and partnerships.Within HSIC’s Technology and Value-Added Services business, Henry Schein One had an excellent quarter. However, weak solvency and the declining sales of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits pose challenges for the company.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has increased 1.2% compared with the 15.9% growth of the industry and the 11.6% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The leading distributor of healthcare products and services has a market capitalization of $10.34 billion. The company has an earnings yield of 6.67% compared with the industry’s 4.75%. Henry Schein surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one, delivering an average earnings surprise of 0.51%.Let’s delve deeper.TailwindsFavorable Dental Business Trends: The fundamentals of HSIC’s dental end markets are fueled by an aging global population, low unemployment levels and the global awareness of the healthcare benefits of preventative care and oral hygiene. Excluding sales of PPE products, local currency internal sales of Global Dental consumable merchandise increased 8.4% in the first quarter of 2023, including a 6.6% increase in North America.Of the dental equipment, traditional equipment sales grew strongly in contrast to digital equipment comprising 2D and 3D digital imaging, mills and intra-oral scanners.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWithin the Dental Specialty business, implant sales growth was driven by the premium Camlog product line in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. North America reported an increase in dental specialty practices being acquired by larger dental service organizations.Henry Schein One Holds Potential: HSIC’s dental software business has been progressing well despite a challenging business environment. In the last reported quarter, North America registered strong sales of Dentrix and Dentrix Ascend cloud-based solutions and a customer shift from the Easy Dental product, with the Easy Dental lifecycle ending later this year.Story continuesInternationally, the growth was fully supported by cloud-based solutions, particularly in Australia and New Zealand, where it was recently launched. Recently, the company announced the full integration of AI solutions into Dentrix Ascend.Expansion Through Acquisitions &amp; Partnerships: In April 2023, Henry Schein signed a definitive agreement to acquire S.I.N. Implant System, one of Brazil’s leading manufacturers of dental implants.The company also completed its majority share acquisition of Biotech Dental, adding to the prospect of offering a seamless digital workflow solution. The acquisition of Unitas by Henry Schein’s subsidiary — eAssist Dental Solutions — advances and accelerates the development of value-added services offered by Henry Schein Dental and fortifies the company’s commitment to be a trusted advisor to customers.DownsidesQ1 Negatives: In the first quarter of 2023, traditional dental equipment growth in North America was hampered by a decrease in sales of digital equipment. Lower sales of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits continued to impact the company’s performance. High operating expenses negatively affected the quarter’s adjusted operating margin.Slightly Leveraged Balance Sheet: The total debt at the end of the first quarter was $1.31 billion, much higher than the corresponding cash and cash equivalents of $126 million. HSIC exited the quarter with a short-term payable of $291 million, displaying weak solvency.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for HSIC’s 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has remained constant at $5.26 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $12.83 billion. This suggests a 1.45% rise from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Zimmer Biomet ZBH, Penumbra PEN and Hologic, Inc.

341,8813da89-185f-3a55-89ce-eab2671dc66e,PPL,2023-06-27,5 Stocks to Buy as Fed Continues to Grapple With Inflation,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-stocks-buy-fed-continues-121600556.html,1687781760,STORY,"['PPL', 'ATO', 'NI', 'SR', 'NIMC', 'SRCU', 'NWN']","[Stocks retreated last week following a solid rally after the Fed kept its interest rates unchanged for the first time after 10 straight hikes. This is because investors are still unsure about the economy’s health and the Fed’s next course of action.Although inflation has shown signs of easing, it’s still at multi-year highs and the Fed’s fight to bring down inflation is far from over. This was also indicated by Fed Chair Jerome Powell during his Congressional testimony last week. Hence markets are likely to remain volatile for longer than expected. Given this situation, it would be wise to invest in defensive stocks like utilities with a favorable Zacks Rank that are likely to strengthen one’s portfolio.Market Volatility ContinuesAll three major indexes snapped their multiweek winning streaks as market participants remain concerned about the Fed’s next move. The Dow ended 1.7% lower, ending its three-week winning streak. The S&amp;P 500 closed 1.4% down after recording five straight weeks of gains. The Nasdaq also finished the week 1.4% down, snapping its eight-week winning streak.Understandably, stocks are scurrying for direction as investors are trying to gauge Fed’s next move with interest rate hikes. Inflation has eased lately, with both the consumer price and producer price inflation declining significantly in May.The consumer price index (CPI) increased 4% in May, beating expectations of a rise of 4.1%. This was also significantly lower than April’s increase of 4.9%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported.Also, the producer price index (PPI) decreased 0.3% in May, following a 0.2% increase in April. The PPI has now declined in three of the past five months, indicating that the Fed’s aggressive interest rate hike stance has helped in bringing down inflation.This prompted the Fed to leave interest rates unchanged for the first time after 10 consecutive hikes totaling 500 basis points that have now taken the benchmark interest rate to the range of 5-5.25%.Story continuesHowever, Powell has also suggested that the Fed is still not done with its interest rate tightening cycle, as inflation is still elevated and far above its target of 2%. Powell suggested that at least two more interest rate hikes of 25 basis points each would be required by the end of this year.This has raised fresh concerns among investors that the economy might slow further, which unsettled markets last week.Considering the current circumstances, investing in utility stocks could be a prudent choice. The utilities sector is known for its stability and maturity, given that demand for these essential services is frequently resilient to fluctuations in the economic cycle. These companies offer vital services such as telecommunications, energy, gas, and water, which are consistently in demand.Thus, incorporating utility companies into a portfolio often enhances its resilience during periods of market volatility. The utilities sector is known for its stability and transparency regarding its financial flows and profitability. These attributes can be advantageous for investors seeking a reliable and consistent performance within their portfolio, particularly in turbulent market conditions.Moreover, the majority of utilities are low-beta stocks (beta &gt; 0 but 1). The best course of action thus would be to invest in low-beta equities with a high dividend yield and a favorable Zacks Rank.Our ChoicesWe have narrowed our search to four low-beta utility stocks that are regular dividend payers.

However, five longer-term catalysts suggest that it may be too early to give up on the sector, including:Strategic Petroleum Reserve is DrainedThe Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) is a stockpile of crude oil maintained by the U.S. government for emergencies, such as disruptions in oil supply or significant price increases. Over the past three years, the SPR stock has dropped precipitously from more than 650 million barrels to ~350 million barrels of oil. Though such a vast drop in the SPR can lead to increased supply and lower oil prices in the short term, in the long term it can lead to reduced supply cushion. In other words, similar to a short squeeze, if prices begin to rise, the U.S. government will be forced to “chase price” to refill the SPR stockpile.Previous Resistance Turns to SupportA critical bullish indicator technical analysts look for is when a previous resistance level morphs into support. The 200-week moving average is a technical tool that long-term investors look to for support. In 2018 and 2019, the United States Oil ETF overtook the level but failed to stay above it. However, in early 2022 oil retook the moving average and has remained above it since – a sign that bulls are willing to defend the level.OPEC Supply CutsBecause OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) has the most significant influence over global oil supply, oil cuts by the organization can have a dramatic impact on driving oil prices higher. Earlier this month, OPEC announced it would be making significant cuts to output and would seek to limit supply for the remainder of 2023.No End in Sight for Geopolitical ConcernsOver the weekend, the geopolitical picture became more muddled. Wagner Private Military Company, a Russian Paramilitary organization, attempted a coup against Russian President Vladimir Putin that was quickly squashed. While the full details of the suspected coup attempt remain unclear, a Russian fuel depot was blown up during the uprising. From an oil perspective, there is little to suggest an end is in sight, and further oil disruptions are likely to take place before the world reaches some semblance of peace.Story continuesValuations Are a BargainThough prices have not moved in months for many oil stocks, valuations are becoming attractive. For example, Occidental Petroleum’s price-to-sales ratio is hovering near multi-year lows. In 2016, OXY’s p/s ratio was 5.5. Today OXY’s p/s ratio is 1.54. Savvy investors like Warren Buffett have started to take notice and have amassed large positions in cheap oil stocks like OXY. OXY also has a much lower p/e than the S&amp;P 500.Stocks to WatchThe strongest domestic integrated oil and gas company is EQT Corp.While most domestic oil stocks have grinded sideways and are stuck below their 200-day moving averages, EQT has trended higher in the past few months.Though domestic energy companies have attractive valuations, the most impressive price action has occurred in foreign oil producers, such as Argentina’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) YPF Sociedad Anonima.With oil prices depressed, YPF has exhibited impressive relative strength and broke out of a multi-month base structure to hit fresh highs.Argentinean stocks and the MSCI Argentina ETF have had some of the best equity performance globally despite the rampant inflation that is plaguing the country. Colombia-based Ecopetrol is another foreign energy producer to watch – especially if oil prices rebound.ConclusionThough oil prices have been choppy in the short term, it is essential not to fall victim to recency bias. Supply concerns, geopolitical turmoil, and the long-term technical picture suggest that oil may be ready to resume its uptrend soon. While domestic oil producers have attractive valuations, foreign oil producers outperform from a price and volume perspective.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

346,5533ba05-8bba-3143-a000-a614d417ee24,OXY,2023-06-27,Bargain Buys: 3 Stocks Trading Below 7x Earnings Not to Miss,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bargain-buys-3-stocks-trading-102040813.html,1687342840,STORY,"['OXY', 'PFG', 'PHM']","[If you’re looking for bargain stocks to buy, one place to start is with companies with low price-to-earnings multiples. What constitutes low earnings multiple stocks? Well, the S&amp;P 500 has a P/E ratio of 25.5x. According to Finviz.com, 245 of the 503 stocks in the index have a P/E below 25. You could start there.  However, I was looking for undervalued stocks to buy now. And then I came across a Seeking Alpha article about a smaller Canadian bank trading at a very low P/E, and that gave me the idea to look for bargain stocks to buy trading below 7x earnings. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsA tweak to the Finviz screen tells me there are 25 stocks in the index with a P/E below 7x. Of those, 15 are in the energy sector. The rest are spread between other sectors, including financials and basic materials. I’ll choose one of the energy stocks as one of my three picks, with two other bargain stocks to buy from different sectors. Here goes. OXYOccidental Petroleum$57.23PFGPrincipal Financial Group$73.00PHMPulteGroup$74.88Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is one of Warren Buffett’s biggest bets. It took a while for Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) to make money from the once-struggling oil and gas exploration and production company. However, thanks to rising oil prices over the last 12-18 months, PXY stock has done well for Berkshire shareholders. Berkshire currently owns 24.9% of Occidental’s stock. The holding company’s sixth-largest holding accounts for 3.6% of Berkshire’s $354 billion equity portfolio. It might not seem like a lot compared to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which accounts for nearly 48%, but of the 50 Berkshire holdings at the moment, only 13 account for 1% or more of its total, so it’s a big deal.Berkshire’s most recent purchases of Occidental stock came at the end of May. It purchased approximately $275 million at a weighted average price of $58.57 per share.Story continuesAs part of Berkshire’s original deal with Occidental in 2019, it got $10 billion in preferred stock paying 8% annual interest and warrants to buy 83.9 million shares at $59.62. Occidental’s first opportunity to redeem the preferred shares is in 2029, so Buffett still has 5.5 years to exercise the warrants. Although Berkshire doesn’t want to own the entire company, it is happy to purchase up to 50% of the company. Occidental trades at a low 6.7x earnings.  Principal Financial Group (PFG)In this photo illustration Principal Financial Group (PFG) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.Source: viewimage / Shutterstock.comLike many financial services stocks, Principal Financial Group (NASDAQ:PFG) isn’t keeping up with the S&amp;P 500 in 2023. It’s down 26 percentage points relative to the index.  However, its diversified revenue streams provide shareholders with stability regardless of economic circumstances. In Q1 2023, its business saw a decline of 11% in net revenues to $650.1 million. Revenues were lower due to lower markets affecting both its fee income generated from assets under management and assets under administration and investment income from its assets. However, if not for an exited business, its revenues in the quarter would have increased by nearly 9% year-over-year. Its net income in the quarter, excluding the exited business, was $346.9 million, slightly higher than $338.7 million a year earlier. All five segments generated positive operating earnings during the quarter, with the Retirement and Income Solutions business accounting for nearly 47% of its operating profits.  While analysts don’t like it (of the 16 covering it, 10 rate it a “Hold” with six an outright “Sell”) it currently trades at 4.4x earnings, half its five-year average.    PulteGroup (PHM)the PulteGroup logo seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comPulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) is the only stock of the three that is up in 2023. It’s gained nearly 60% year-to-date and 98% over the past year. It’s recovered nicely from its June 2022 52-week low of $35.03. Deutsche Bank analyst Joe Ahlersmeyer believes that despite the run that homebuilder stocks have been on, including Pulte, over the past nine months, there’s still room to move higher. “With continued improvement in demand fundamentals and book valuations fairly attractive by historical standards, our view is that homebuilder stocks can climb meaningfully higher,” Yahoo Finance reported the analyst’s comments from mid-June.  Ahlersmeyer wrote.Ahlersmeyer argues that Pulte’s double-digit order growth over the next 18 months and higher margins on those orders should lead to significant excess cash. The analyst has a Buy rating and a $95 target price on its stock. Despite the significant appreciation of its shares over the past year, it still trades at just 6.4x earnings, less than its five-year average of 8.4x. There is a shortage of 6.5 million homes in the U.S. (2.3 million if you include multi-family dwellings), suggesting that Pulte will continue to have a backlog that’s more than its annual capacity to build new homes.That’s a good problem to have. On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Solid first-quarter 2023 performance buoys optimism. However, forex woes and lower sales impede growth.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 0.9% against a 22.7% decline of the industry and a 13.3% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.This renowned provider of a diversified line of healthcare products has a market capitalization of $187.89 billion. The company projects a 5.1% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. Abbott’s earnings surpassed estimates in all of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 19.28%.Let’s delve deeper.Factors at PlayQ1 Upsides: Abbott exited the first quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Organic sales growth excluding COVID testing increased 10%, led by double-digit growth in Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals and Nutrition. Within EPD, sales increased 11% in the quarter led by strong performance in Brazil, China and Southeast Asia and across several therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic, gastroenterology, CNS and pain management. EPD has been sustaining its double-digit sales growth momentum for the last two years.Progress With Diabetes Business: This business achieved organic sales growth of 21% in the first quarter of 2023, led by a more than 25% growth in FreeStyle Libre, including approximately 50% growth in the United States and mid-teens internationally. In the quarter, sales of FreeStyle Libre were $1.2 billion. During the quarter, Libre received FDA clearance for connectivity with automated insulin delivery systems. Abbott is currently working with leading insulin pump manufacturers to integrate their systems with Libre 2 and Libre 3.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn a relatively short span, Libre has achieved global leadership among CGM systems for Type 1 and Type 2 users. In 2020, the company received the U.S. approval of Freestyle Libre 2 (an integrated continuous glucose monitoring or iCGM system for adults and children) and CE Mark for Libre 3(integrates Libre's accuracy and performance into the world's smallest fitness disposable sensor) and Libre Sense Glucose Sport (which is Abbott’s initial step in a very intentional approach to pursue mass market biosensor opportunities beyond diabetes).Story continuesUpbeat Guidance: Abbott provided its 2023 earnings per share guidance.Full-year adjusted earnings (excluding specified items of $1.25 per share) are expected in the range of $4.30-$4.50. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.36. Abbott projects full-year 2023 organic sales growth, excluding COVID-19 testing-related sales, of at least high-single digits and COVID testing-related sales of around $1.5 billion.DownsidesForeign Exchange Translation Impacts Sales: Foreign exchange is a major headwind for Abbott due to considerable percentage of its revenues coming from outside the United States. The strengthening of Euro and some other developed market currencies have been hampering the company’s performance in the international markets.Lower Sales: Abbott’s first-quarter worldwide sales were down 18.1% year over year on a reported basis. Total sales were affected by COVID-19 testing-related sales decline. Diagnostics’ sales growth, as projected, was dented by a significant decline in COVID testing sales compared with first-quarter 2023 levels.Estimate TrendsIn the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has moved 0.2% north to $4.39.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $39.38 billion, suggesting a 9.8% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

INSP scaled a new 52-week high of $323.23 on Jun 23, 2023, before closing the session at $315.08.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 56.8% against the 30.3% decline of the industry. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 11.5% growth in the said time frame.The company’s projected earnings per share growth rate of 26.1% compares with the industry’s growth projection of 17.1%. Inspire Medical’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 43.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchInspire Medical is witnessing an upward trend in its stock price, prompted by its global presence. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter 2023 performance and receipt of a few regulatory approvals are expected to contribute further. However, threats from stiff competition and overdependence on Inspire System persist.Let’s delve deeper.Key Growth DriversGlobal Presence: Investors are upbeat about Inspire Medical’s solid revenues from its two geographic regions, the United States and outside of the United States. In the first quarter of 2023, U.S. revenues and revenues from outside the United States reflected an increase of 87% and 15%, respectively, from the year-ago quarter on a reported basis.During the quarter, Inspire Medical activated 68 new U.S. centers, thus bringing the total to 973 U.S. medical centers providing Inspire therapy. The company also created 17 new U.S. sales territories in the quarter, bringing the total to 242 U.S. sales territories.Regulatory Approvals: Investors are optimistic about Inspire Medical’s receipt of a slew of FDA approvals over the past few months. This month, the company received the FDA’s approval on an expanded indication. The update includes an increase on the upper limit of the Apnea Hypopnea Index to 100 events per hour from 65 and raises the Body Mass Index warning in the labeling to 40 from 32.Story continuesIn March, the company received the FDA’s approval to offer Inspire therapy to pediatric patients with Down syndrome.Strong Q1 Results: Inspire Medical’s impressive first-quarter 2023 results buoy optimism. The company saw a robust improvement in its top line and strength in year-over-year geographic results. Management’s expectations of activating more U.S. medical centers and adding new U.S. sales territories during each quarter of 2023 also raise optimism about the stock.DownsidesOverdependence on Inspire System: Sales of Inspire Medical’s Inspire system accounts for primarily all its revenues. Management expects that sales of the Inspire systems will continue to account for the substantial majority of the company’s revenues going forward. Inspire Medical’s ability to execute its growth strategy and become profitable will, therefore, depend upon the adoption of the Inspire therapy by patients, physicians and sleep centers, among others, to treat moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients who cannot use or get consistent benefit from continuous positive airway pressure.Stiff Competition: The medical technology industry is highly competitive, subject to change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants. Inspire Medical’s competitors have historically dedicated and will continue to dedicate significant resources to promote their products or develop new products or methods to treat moderate to severe OSA.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

We didn't publish this article but decided to follow the performance of these stocks. Our research and experience indicate that hedge funds' top stock picks generate a significant amount of alpha. This article is another example of this finding.

You can skip our discussion and see hedge funds' top 5 undervalued retail stock picks here.While no industry is immune to recession, certain industries such as consumer and retail, post sound performance even in tough economic conditions. However, certain trends like economic volatility, inflation, and change in consumer habits are here to stay in 2023 which might limit the growth prospects of consumer and retail industry. On top of it, US retail sales saw a decline in December 2022, falling by 1.1% as a result of high inflation. The soft month during December has increased worries as investors fear that 2023 might bring a downturn in consumer spending. Experts were predicting a decline of just 0.8% for the month.According to National Retail Federation, during the November and December holiday season, retail sales saw 5.3% growth over 2021 to $936.3 billion. In 2023, retailers are required to focus on optimizing their operations to become immune to the challenging economic environment. Retailers plan to use technology and solutions so that their businesses stay competitive in changing economic environment. An omnichannel marketing strategy is expected to support retailers in terms of reach.National Retail Federation’s Chief Economist views that companies should manage inventories more tightly in 2023. This comes after they were forced to heavily discount goods last year as a result of huge unsold merchandise. Positives in the form of favorable demographics, and low penetration of organised retail are expected to help the retail industry over the medium term.Story continuesDollar Tree, Inc.

The company’s total net revenue came in at $2.8 billion, exhibiting $281 million or 9.0% decline year-over-year. Its gross profit was $824 million or 29.0% of the total net revenue.

(ULTA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ulta-beauty-inc-ulta-attracting-130006748.html,1687784406,STORY,['ULTA'],"[Ulta Beauty (ULTA) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this beauty products retailer have returned +7.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Miscellaneous industry, which Ulta falls in, has gained 0.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Ulta is expected to post earnings of $5.81 per share, indicating a change of +1.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.7% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $25.05 points to a change of +4.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.9%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $26.89 indicates a change of +7.4% from what Ulta is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Ulta is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Ulta, the consensus sales estimate of $2.49 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +8.3%. The $11.08 billion and $11.67 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +8.5% and +5.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUlta reported revenues of $2.63 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.3%. EPS of $6.88 for the same period compares with $6.30 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.62 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.61%. The EPS surprise was +0.88%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Ulta is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Ulta. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In new data released last week, all six patients treated with VX-880 engrafted islet cells, produced endogenous insulin (C-peptide), and had improved glycemic control, while reducing or eliminating insulin use. Patients with greater than 90 days of follow-up had elimination of severe hypoglycemic events in the evaluation period.Vertex’s second approach, VX-264, utilizes the same fully differentiated insulin-producing islet cells as in VX-880 and is being studied in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. In VX-264, the cells are encapsulated in a proprietary device designed to shield the cells from the body’s immune system, thereby eliminating the need for immunosuppression. In a third approach, Vertex’s hypoimmune program, the same cells are edited to cloak them from the immune system; this program continues to progress in preclinical development.Under the terms of the collaboration, Vertex and Lonza will partner in the process development and scale-up for the manufacturing of the product portfolio and co-invest to build a dedicated new facility in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Operated by Lonza, the facility will span more than 130,000 square feet and is anticipated to create up to 300 new jobs at peak capacity. Construction is scheduled to begin later this year.Story continuesThe dedicated facility will complement Lonza’s global cell and gene technologies manufacturing network, which supports customers in developing, de-risking, commercializing and scaling their emerging therapies. Lonza’s scientific, regulatory and manufacturing expertise, its focus on operational excellence, and first-hand experience supporting the commercialization of marketed cell therapy products is expected to accelerate the development and commercialization of Vertex’s potentially transformative therapies.""Vertex’s allogeneic, fully differentiated, insulin-producing islet cells and the results from the Phase 1/2 VX-880 program represent a scientific breakthrough that offers the potential to transform the treatment of T1D,"" said Reshma Kewalramani, M.D., Chief Executive Officer and President of Vertex. ""Establishing this strategic partnership with Lonza, a world-class manufacturing organization, is a critical milestone in this journey and underscores our long-term commitment to patients with T1D.""""Lonza has a strong history and established reputation for applying cutting-edge development and manufacturing expertise to enable the progression of exceptional scientific innovations like those developed by Vertex,"" said Pierre-Alain Ruffieux, Chief Executive Officer of Lonza.

That’s why they look at the biotech sector. One “home run” drug or therapeutic to enter the market can send a stock soaring along with an investor’s portfolio. The problem is that many of these long-term biotech stock investments never pan out. On the other hand, many potentially high return biotech stocks are excellent buy and hold candidates. Some of these companies, particularly the small-cap stocks may be trading as penny stocks. That adds to the risk. But it also allows you to scale into a position over time while managing the amount of capital you put at risk.  Another option when looking at long-term biotech stock investments is to look at a company’s pipeline. Knowing what areas the company is researching can give you an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of megatrends.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWith all that said, investing in biotech stock is not for the faint of heart. But there are opportunities that exist. Here are three biotech stocks – one small-cap, one mid-cap, and one large cap – that have the opportunity to make you a millionaire.  IBio (IBIO)Biotechnology stocks, biomedical stocksSource: aslysun / Shutterstock.comWith an $11.76  million market cap, iBio (NYSEMKT:IBIO) is among the smallest of the small-cap stocks. And with IBIO stock down 90% in the last 12 months, investors should go into this investment with their eyes wide open. The company has a proprietary platform, called Discovery Engine,  which uses artificial intelligence to revolutionize and accelerate the production of vaccines and antibody treatments.  The company made headlines in 2020 when it briefly made noise in the race among biotech companies to develop a vaccine for Covid-19. After that fell through, however, investors were reminded that the company doesn’t have a single candidate in clinical trials.  But that could be changing. On June 12, 2023, iBio announced a partnership with the National Institutes of Health. The research agreement will explore the potential of its AI-driven platform to develop a novel vaccine for Lassa fever.  Story continuesThe risk for investors is that iBio is not only not profitable, it generates precious little revenue at this time. A share price of just 70 cents per share makes IBIO stock a classic definition of risk versus reward, but when you’re looking for long-term biotech stock investments with millionaire-making potential, you have to take some risks.  CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP)Medical technology network team meeting concept. Doctor hand working smart phone modern digital tablet laptop computer graphics chart interface, sun flare effect photo, PTESource: everything possible / Shutterstock.comThe nature of investing in biotech stocks is that there’s no such as a sure thing. But the field of gene editing may come about as close as you can get. And with its proprietary CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing platform, CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CRSP) is at the forefront of this emerging sector. In 2023, the company signed a licensing deal with Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) to advance its Exa-Cel platform for transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia and severe sickle cell disease. CRISPR and Vertex recently announced positive results in pivotal trials. However, a more compelling reason to look at CRISPR Therapeutics as one of the top biotech stocks to hold may come from the company’s work in immuno-oncology.  CRSP stock soared in 2021 along with many biotech stocks. But there’s been a sharp pullback since then. In fact, as of this writing, the mid-cap stock is trading below its pre-pandemic level. However, analyst sentiment is bullish and institutional ownership remains strong.  Pfizer (PFE)OLK Stock.

RSLS stockSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.comWhen it comes to long-term bio-tech stock investments, investors may not immediately think of large-cap stocks. And after the success of its Covid-19 vaccine, many investors may be overlooking the opportunity that exists with Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). That sentiment is clearly evident in the PFE stock price which is down 31% from its all-time high.  However, savvy investors continue to look forward. And in the case of Pfizer, there’s one thing that immediately stands out. In March, Pfizer acquired Seagen (NASDAQ:SGEN) for $43 billion. At a time when the Biden administration is calling for a cancer moonshot, this acquisition will allow Pfizer to expand it’s portfolio of oncology drugs. In fact, Pfizer is forecasting that the company’s pipeline will growt by $10 billion by 2030 as a result of the acquisition.  The larger story is that the company is a leader in mRNA technology and it’s staking out a leadership in the area of customizable medicine. These are two areas which are forecast to have explosive growth.  And the icing on the cake is that Pfizer is objectively undervalued. The company has a forward P/E of just 11x earnings and you get a dividend with a current yield of 4.09%.  On the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a long position in PFE.

It features an additional payload and range, advanced digital avionics, better-handling qualities and situational awareness, active vibration control and improved survivability.The aircraft is the primary medium-lift helicopter for the U.S. Army, working on a wide range of missions including Air Assault, MEDEVAC, CSAR, Command and Control, and VIP transport. The centerpiece of the UH-60M Black Hawk helicopter is an advanced digital avionics suite that provides improved situational awareness and interoperability using the Future Combat System.What Favors Lockheed?In recent times, U.S. military helicopters have gained prominence and significant traction due to advancements and integration of new tactical, logistical and other important features. Some of these developments can be attributed to Lockheed paving the way for securing valuable helicopter-related contracts of late. The recent contract win is a bright example of that.With the fiscal 2024 defense budget offering investment potential worth $61.1 billion in aircraft, we expect Lockheed’s Rotary and Mission Systems business segment (which comprises of the Sikorsky helicopters) to benefit.Helicopter Market ProspectsThe military helicopter market is projected to witness a CAGR of 2.4% during 2023-2033, per a report by Visiongain market research firm.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Dow Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.In Tony Robbins’ Money – Master The Game, there’s a chapter titled Invest Like the .001%: The Billionaire’s Playbook. The chapter mentions the “secrets” behind wealth creation which Tony Robbins gathered after interviewing about 50 billionaires. These billionaires include Paul Tudor Jones, Warren Buffett, Carl Icahn, and many others. The chapter gives some really important lessons that give a sneak peek into billionaires’ thought process, their values and their peculiar nature that helped them stand out among millions of other people.For example, it’s a common notion that billionaires are always aggressive in nature when it comes to investments and they never shy away from making “risky” bets. But the first takeaway Robbins mentions in this chapter is that billionaires are “obsessed” with making sure they don’t lose money. Robbins sums up the reason behind this obsession by pointing to the value of time. The reason why billionaires emphatically try not to lose money is that if you lose 50%, according to Robbins, it would take 100% to get back to where you started, and all of that effort would require something that you can never get back: time.Another key takeaway from Tony Robbins’ interviews with billionaires is that billionaires are always looking to maximize their gains with as few risks as possible. This, again, is contrary to the common belief that billionaires are always looking to take big risks and they are willing to bet it all. Robbins says that the billionaires he interviewed are, without exception, looking for something that he calls “asymmetric risk/reward.” Here’s how the book sums up this lesson by quoting billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, whose total wealth today stands at $7.5 billion. Jones told Robbins that he doesn’t make an investment until he is sure of making $5 from every $1 invested.Story continues“And that, he says, is a $100,000 MBA in a nutshell!,” the book adds.Another excellent lesson Robbins got after interviewing famous billionaires was that the wealthy are good at making decisions based on the limited information they have. Robbins says that most talented people are not good investors since they don’t have the ability to make the most out of the limited information and by the time they get full information, the opportunity is no longer available.Perhaps the biggest and most important lesson we could learn from the billionaires Tony Robbins interviewed is that just having the humility to learn from your mistakes and improve yourself could exponentially increase your chances of success.“Contrary to what most people would expect, this group of achievers is never done! They’re never done learning, they’re never done earning, they’re never done growing, they’re never done giving! No matter how well they’ve done or how well they’ve continued to do, they never lose their hunger—the force that unleashes human genius. Most people would think, “If I had all this money, I would just stop. Why keep working?” Because each believes, somewhere in his or her soul, that “to whom much is given, much is expected.” Their labor is their love. Just like these money masters invest in different ways, they give back in different ways. They share their time, they share their money, they create foundations, they invest in others. Each of them has come to realize that true meaning in life comes from giving. They feel a responsibility to use their gifts to serve others. As Winston Churchill said, “We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give.” What unites them is the ultimate truth that life is about more than what you have. It’s really about what you have to give.”The key investing themes followed by billionaires according to Tony Robbins are clearly visible when we analyze the portfolios of some billionaire portfolios. Amid rising inflation and Federal Reserve’s rate hikes, several family office funds of famous billionaires started cutting their exposure to stocks. An analysis from Bloomberg earlier this year showed that billionaire George Soros’s fund was upping its hold in investment-grade bonds and selling stocks. Billionaire Soros’ fund sold 130 stocks during the fourth quarter of 2022 and bought less than 30. The fund’s selling spree continues as its Q1’2023 portfolio shows a plethora of stocks in which the fund exited its positions.The 2022 market crash didn’t spare even the billionaires and smart money managers, especially those who were piled into technology and growth stocks. Hedge funds led by famous billionaires and veteran investors, including D1 Capital’s Dan Sundheim, TCI’s Chris Hohn, Lone Pine Capital’s Stephen Mandel and Viking Global’s Andreas Halvorsen saw huge losses.On the other hand, 15 hedge funds in the industry made a whopping $14 billion in the same period through personal investments and hedge fund fees, according to Bloomberg These winners include billionaire Ken Griffin of Citadel, billionaire Steve Cohen of Point72, billionaire Israel Englander of Millennium Management, billionaire DE Shaw, billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, among others.When billionaires have to say something about the future trajectory and possibilities in the financial markets, the world listens. A stark warning about the future recently came from billionaire Cliff Asness of AQR Capital management, who, while talking to Bloomberg, highlighted the difference between the bond and stock markets when it comes to sentiment. The billionaire said that the bond market is indicating that the Federal Reserve could initiate aggressive rate cuts over the next one or two years. Asness thinks this could cause a recession.Dow Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up OnOur MethodologyFor this article, we first scanned  The Dow Jones Industrial Average and calculated the number of billionaire investors for each of the 30 stocks of the index.

While iPhone sales were down year-over-year (YoY). services revenues grew 7% YoY which was slightly above analyst estimates.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Coca-Cola (KO).Coke currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.44, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 16 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.44 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 16 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 12 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 75% and 6.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for KOBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for KOCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Coke here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Coke, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is KO Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Coke, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $2.61.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Coke. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Coke.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

365,4554a685-60ae-3ebe-9ed3-990e3978b90d,KO,2023-06-27,CocaCola Company (The) (KO) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cocacola-company-ko-trending-stock-130013583.html,1687784413,STORY,"['KO', '^GSPC']","[Coca-Cola (KO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest beverage maker have returned +1.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5% change. During this period, the Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, which Coke falls in, has gained 1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Coke is expected to post earnings of $0.71 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.61 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +5.2%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.80 indicates a change of +7.5% from what Coke is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Coke is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for KO _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Coke, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $11.69 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $45.02 billion and $47.36 billion estimates indicate +4.7% and +5.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCoke reported revenues of $10.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.7%. EPS of $0.68 for the same period compares with $0.64 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.87 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1%. The EPS surprise was +4.62%.Over the last four quarters, Coke surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Coke is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Coke. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In that same time, the Business Services sector gained 3.74%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 5.01%.Waste Management will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. On that day, Waste Management is projected to report earnings of $1.53 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 6.25%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $5.22 billion, up 3.79% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $6.03 per share and revenue of $20.64 billion. These totals would mark changes of +7.87% and +4.77%, respectively, from last year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Waste Management. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Waste Management is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors should also note Waste Management's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 27.44.

MLM touched a new 52-week high of $443.26 on Jun 23. The stock pulled back to end the trading session at $442.38, up 0.72% from the previous day’s closing price of $439.22.MLM has gained 30.5% in the three months period compared with the Zacks Building Products - Concrete and Aggregates industry’s growth of 29.7%, the Zacks Construction sector’s increase of 16.6% and S&amp;P 500 Index’s growth of 9.8%.The price surge was probably due to the latest statistics released by the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development revealing promising trends in the new residential construction sector for May 2023. Building permits experienced strong growth, with a 5.2% increase from April, indicating a positive trajectory. Housing starts demonstrated more robust growth, up 21.7% from April levels. Housing completions also displayed positive growth, up 9.5% from the previous month’s levels. These encouraging trends suggest a potentially strong construction market, offering opportunities for investors and homebuyers.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe strong growth in building permits, housing starts and housing completions in May 2023 can be attributed to favorable market conditions and increased demand. These factors combined with government initiatives, provide a solid foundation for the continued expansion of the U.S. construction sector.Meanwhile, Martin Marietta's public infrastructure market, which represented 35% of its 2022 aggregate shipments, experienced a 5% volume increase from 2021 on the back of solid demand spurred by accelerating federal and state level investment. The company expects infrastructure shipments to surge in the future, driven by healthy state Department of Transportation (DOT) budgets and an expected extension or replacement for the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act.Also, Martin Marietta and other concrete and aggregates producers are expected to benefit from strong global trends in infrastructure modernization, energy transition, national security and a potential super-cycle in global supply-chain investments. The need to rebuild the nation’s deteriorating roads and bridges will likely help MLM.The company expects a diverse mix of federal projects for road and bridge work, water control, harbors and ports and the power grid to drive growth in 2023. MLM anticipates substantial opportunities in 2023 across federally funded infrastructure projects, industrial manufacturing, energy and power. It expects to deliver another year of profitable growth, a strong cash flow and attractive returns for shareholders.The new Federal Infrastructure Law along with strong state DOT budgets in the company’s key states of Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida and California provide Martin Marietta with a long-awaited runway for multi-year growth in infrastructure demand. Martin Marietta believes that its strategic coast-to-coast footprint is well-positioned for long-term growth, backed by favorable population migration trends, housing shortages in markets and a long-term federal highway bill complemented by healthy DOT budgets in its key states.Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Other Key PicksMartin Marietta currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Other top-ranked stocks from the Zacks Construction sector are: Dycom Industries, Inc.

373,19894a83-8f5e-3089-af51-99d1ab40c0c4,VMC,2023-06-27,Top 5 Dividend-Paying Low-Beta Stocks Amid Recent Volatility,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-5-dividend-paying-low-122900999.html,1687782540,STORY,"['COMP', '^GSPC', 'CLX', 'VMC', 'MLM', 'GGG']","[Volatility returned on Wall Street after a month-long impressive rally. Last week was a disappointing one. The three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — fell 1.7%, 1.45 and 1.4%, respectively.The Nasdaq Composite reversed the trend of an eight-week win. The Dow terminated a three-week winning streak. The S&amp;P 500 ended a five-week winning run. The S&amp;P 500 recorded its worst weekly performance since the week ended Mar 10, 2023. The Nasdaq Composite also posted the worst week since March 2023.A higher interest rate policy adopted by several major central banks to combat inflation has created a ruckus in the global financial markets. On Jun 14, in his post-FOMC meeting statement, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that more interest rate hikes are likely this year despite a pause in rate hike in the June FOMC after 10 consecutive increases. The Fed’s current “dot-plot” shows that the mean expectation of officials is for another 50-basis point raise in the benchmark interest rate. This implies, two more rate hikes of 25 basis points each within 2023. Consequently, the terminal interest rate is presently estimated at 5.6%, instead of 5.125%, anticipated after the May FOMC meeting.At present, the CME FedWatch has assigned a probability of 72% that the Fed will raise the Fed fund rate by 25 basis points in the July FOMC meeting. On the other hand, 28% of respondents have projected that the central bank will maintain status quo.  No rate cut is expected this year. The first cut in interest rate may be delayed till 2025. Majority of market participants were expecting the first rate cut in 2024. Last week, in his testimony before the U.S. Congress, Powell reaffirmed his stand that more rate hikes are likely by this year-end.Moreover, last week, the central banks of the UK, Switzerland, Norway and Turkey raised their respective benchmark lending rates. Market participants are concerned that higher interest rate will hinder economic activities resulting in global economic recession.Story continuesFearing an impending recession, investors opted for safe-haven sovereign bonds instead of risky equities. As a result, on Jun 23, prices of several sovereign bonds spiked and yield declined.  The yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note fell 6 basis points to 3.737%. The yields on the 10-Year UK bond and 10-Year German bond fell more than 10 basis points each.Our Top PicksAt this stage, investment in low-beta, dividend-paying stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank may be the best option. If markets regain momentum, the favorable Zacks Rank of these stocks will capture the upside potential. However, if the downtrend continues, low-beta stocks will minimize portfolio losses and dividend payments will act as a regular income stream.We have narrowed our search to five dividend-paying low-beta (beta &gt;0 &lt;1) stocks. These companies have strong growth potential for 2023 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and rose from the prior year. Solid pricing actions, which drove robust margin expansion despite continued inflationary pressure and modestly lower aggregate shipments, helped it generate strong results. Adjusted gross and EBITDA margins also expanded impressively from a year ago.MLM expects solid near-term product demand backed by healthy customer backlogs across its coast-to-coast footprint.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. With that in mind, the ROCE of Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Valero Energy, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.41 = US$18b ÷ (US$60b - US$15b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, Valero Energy has an ROCE of 41%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Oil and Gas industry average of 23%. Check out our latest analysis for Valero Energy roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Valero Energy compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Valero Energy.The Trend Of ROCEValero Energy has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 311% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. The company is doing well in that sense, and it's worth investigating what the management team has planned for long term growth prospects.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Valero Energy's ROCETo bring it all together, Valero Energy has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. Investors may not be impressed by the favorable underlying trends yet because over the last five years the stock has only returned 31% to shareholders. Given that, we'd look further into this stock in case it has more traits that could make it multiply in the long term.Valero Energy does have some risks though, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Valero Energy  that you might be interested in.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

379,7c95fbaf-258f-3aa5-8e94-4549a8010972,UNH,2023-06-27,Couch Potato Stock Portfolio: 10 Best Stocks To Buy,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/couch-potato-stock-portfolio-10-155552193.html,1687794952,STORY,"['BRK-B', 'UNH', 'AAPL', 'XOM', '^GSPC', 'TSLA']","[In this article, we will take a look at the couch potato stock portfolio. To see more such companies, go directly to Couch Potato Stock Portfolio: 5 Best Stocks To Buy.If you hate the constant need to adjust your portfolio based on stock market news and economic developments, do not like to pay huge fees to active fund managers who promise those elusive hefty returns and want to set your stock investing on auto pilot, you are not alone. There’s a comprehensive stock investing strategy designed for people who want to take a long-term horizon for their investments and don’t want to waste their time, energies and money on daily, active portfolio management. Personal finance writer named Scott Burns is behind this investment philosophy which is now very popular all over the world. The reason why couch potato investing strategy got traction and gained popularity is simple: it works.Scott Burns posts the annual performance of the couch potato investing strategy every year. For 2022, Burns posted some numbers that yet again testify to the effectiveness of couch potato investing. Burns started his report with some assumptions before giving some juicy numbers.“Imagine you retired at the dawn of history, recently estimated as 1988, at age 65. You started your retirement with a $100,000 portfolio split between the total domestic stock market and the total domestic bond market. To pay the bills, you intended to use the 4 percent spending rule. You took an inflation-adjusted amount at the end of each year.”After that Burns asks his readers to guess how much money this portfolio would have made after 35 years? According to him, by simply following the couch potato investing strategy (index investing), the initial $100,000 would stand at $728,880 as of the end of 2022. But Burns noted that this estimate does not take into account the “sequence of returns risk.” What does that mean? Simply put, like every portfolio, a couch potato portfolio would not post consistent or uniform returns. Some years it’d perform very well, some years it would disappoint. For example, in 2021 the couch potato stock portfolio would have been worth $884,481 according to Burns’ estimates. That means the portfolio worth declined in 2022. But Burns insists we should have a holistic approach in evaluating this strategy.Story continues“But so what? The portfolio is way larger than expected or needed,” Burns added.Retirement in 2023: Recommendations from a Couch Potato InvestorAt the end of the report Burns recommended investors who are retiring in 2023 to tighten their belt and don’t withdraw too much from their retirement savings. To be specific, Burns said your spending should be less than 4% of your retirement portfolio worth. Burns also said that if inflation starts to drop in 2023 and stocks see a recovery, things could easily get back to normal and 2022 would be nothing more than a “bad memory.” However, if inflation does not come down, Burns believes things could change drastically in the retirement space.“But if inflation continues high and stock prices fall further, we’re in for a sea change in retirement security.”Another proof of the effectiveness of the couch potato investing strategy can be seen in the SPIVA reports. SPIVA reports are published by the S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices to compare the performance of active equity and fixed-income mutual funds against their benchmarks. According to the 2021 SPIVA report, a whopping 79.6% of domestic equity funds lagged the S&amp;P Composite 1500. The report also shows that large-cap funds continued their underperformance for the 12th consecutive calendar year, as 85% of active large-cap funds trailed the S&amp;P 500 in 2021. The report also shows a graph about the percentage of domestic equity funds underperforming the S&amp;P Composite 1500 on an Absolute Basis. The graph paints a depressing picture for active portfolio management since year after year the underperformance percentage for domestic equity funds seems to increase.The report says:“Fund managers often respond to evidence of active underperformance by claiming to offer better returns per unit of volatility (i.e., to outperform in risk-adjusted terms). This would be an appropriate counterargument, if only it were true. However, the data shows that the vast majority of actively managed funds underperformed on this metric as well. Among domestic equity funds, while 90%have underperformed the S&amp;P Composite 1500 over the past 20 years, an even greater 95% did so on a risk-adjusted basis.”Another important aspect of the couch potato investing strategy is having a long-term outlook. You cannot be a couch potato investor if you cannot remain invested in a certain index fund for years. A famous study in this regard is one by finance professors Hendrik Bessembinder of Arizona State University, Michael Cooper of the University of Utah and Feng Zhang of Southern Methodist University. The study found that only 46% of managed funds outperformed the total market over monthly horizons; 39% beat the market over 12-month periods; 34% over decade-long horizons. As you can see, when holding periods increase, managed funds’ performance declines.Couch Potato Stock Portfolio: Best Stock PicksPhoto by Adrian Swancar on UnsplashOur MethodologyWhile the couch potato investing philosophy tends to stay away from individual stock investing and promotes index investing, for this article we picked some stocks that are the top holdings of index funds loved by couch potato investors.

To see more such companies, go directly to 5 Dow Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On.In Tony Robbins’ Money – Master The Game, there’s a chapter titled Invest Like the .001%: The Billionaire’s Playbook. The chapter mentions the “secrets” behind wealth creation which Tony Robbins gathered after interviewing about 50 billionaires. These billionaires include Paul Tudor Jones, Warren Buffett, Carl Icahn, and many others. The chapter gives some really important lessons that give a sneak peek into billionaires’ thought process, their values and their peculiar nature that helped them stand out among millions of other people.For example, it’s a common notion that billionaires are always aggressive in nature when it comes to investments and they never shy away from making “risky” bets. But the first takeaway Robbins mentions in this chapter is that billionaires are “obsessed” with making sure they don’t lose money. Robbins sums up the reason behind this obsession by pointing to the value of time. The reason why billionaires emphatically try not to lose money is that if you lose 50%, according to Robbins, it would take 100% to get back to where you started, and all of that effort would require something that you can never get back: time.Another key takeaway from Tony Robbins’ interviews with billionaires is that billionaires are always looking to maximize their gains with as few risks as possible. This, again, is contrary to the common belief that billionaires are always looking to take big risks and they are willing to bet it all. Robbins says that the billionaires he interviewed are, without exception, looking for something that he calls “asymmetric risk/reward.” Here’s how the book sums up this lesson by quoting billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, whose total wealth today stands at $7.5 billion. Jones told Robbins that he doesn’t make an investment until he is sure of making $5 from every $1 invested.Story continues“And that, he says, is a $100,000 MBA in a nutshell!,” the book adds.Another excellent lesson Robbins got after interviewing famous billionaires was that the wealthy are good at making decisions based on the limited information they have. Robbins says that most talented people are not good investors since they don’t have the ability to make the most out of the limited information and by the time they get full information, the opportunity is no longer available.Perhaps the biggest and most important lesson we could learn from the billionaires Tony Robbins interviewed is that just having the humility to learn from your mistakes and improve yourself could exponentially increase your chances of success.“Contrary to what most people would expect, this group of achievers is never done! They’re never done learning, they’re never done earning, they’re never done growing, they’re never done giving! No matter how well they’ve done or how well they’ve continued to do, they never lose their hunger—the force that unleashes human genius. Most people would think, “If I had all this money, I would just stop. Why keep working?” Because each believes, somewhere in his or her soul, that “to whom much is given, much is expected.” Their labor is their love. Just like these money masters invest in different ways, they give back in different ways. They share their time, they share their money, they create foundations, they invest in others. Each of them has come to realize that true meaning in life comes from giving. They feel a responsibility to use their gifts to serve others. As Winston Churchill said, “We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give.” What unites them is the ultimate truth that life is about more than what you have. It’s really about what you have to give.”The key investing themes followed by billionaires according to Tony Robbins are clearly visible when we analyze the portfolios of some billionaire portfolios. Amid rising inflation and Federal Reserve’s rate hikes, several family office funds of famous billionaires started cutting their exposure to stocks. An analysis from Bloomberg earlier this year showed that billionaire George Soros’s fund was upping its hold in investment-grade bonds and selling stocks. Billionaire Soros’ fund sold 130 stocks during the fourth quarter of 2022 and bought less than 30. The fund’s selling spree continues as its Q1’2023 portfolio shows a plethora of stocks in which the fund exited its positions.The 2022 market crash didn’t spare even the billionaires and smart money managers, especially those who were piled into technology and growth stocks. Hedge funds led by famous billionaires and veteran investors, including D1 Capital’s Dan Sundheim, TCI’s Chris Hohn, Lone Pine Capital’s Stephen Mandel and Viking Global’s Andreas Halvorsen saw huge losses.On the other hand, 15 hedge funds in the industry made a whopping $14 billion in the same period through personal investments and hedge fund fees, according to Bloomberg These winners include billionaire Ken Griffin of Citadel, billionaire Steve Cohen of Point72, billionaire Israel Englander of Millennium Management, billionaire DE Shaw, billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, among others.When billionaires have to say something about the future trajectory and possibilities in the financial markets, the world listens. A stark warning about the future recently came from billionaire Cliff Asness of AQR Capital management, who, while talking to Bloomberg, highlighted the difference between the bond and stock markets when it comes to sentiment. The billionaire said that the bond market is indicating that the Federal Reserve could initiate aggressive rate cuts over the next one or two years. Asness thinks this could cause a recession.Dow Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up OnOur MethodologyFor this article, we first scanned  The Dow Jones Industrial Average and calculated the number of billionaire investors for each of the 30 stocks of the index.

An unfavorable product mix and supply-chain inefficiencies act as deterrents.This led to a soft performance in first-quarter 2023, wherein the top and bottom lines declined year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The adjusted loss per share of 73 cents in first-quarter 2023 was wider than the year-ago quarter’s loss of 16 cents. Net revenues declined 4.7% year over year to $410 million. Excluding excise taxes, the top line fell 4.8% year over year to $435.2 million.Also, gross profit declined 10% year over year to $155.7 million, whereas the gross margin contracted 220 basis points (bps) to 38% from 40.2% in the year-ago quarter. Rising inventory obsolescence costs and higher brewery processing mainly hurt the company’s gross margin, offset by price increases. Inventory obsolescence cost growth mainly resulted from rebranding Truly Vodka Seltzer to Truly Vodka Soda, and a non-recurring payment to a third-party contract brewery. These factors resulted in unfavorable impacts of 210 bps on the gross margin.Moving on, the company has been witnessing a slowdown in the hard seltzer category and the demand for the Truly brand in recent quarters. The slowing hard seltzer trends hurt the company’s depletions to some extent in first-quarter 2023. The hard seltzer category witnessed continued declines in the first quarter.The hard seltzer category’s decelerating trend has mainly been attributed to the loss of novelty among consumers due to the entry of several beyond beer products in the marketplace. Additionally, the decline has resulted from the ongoing dismal macroeconomic environment, which has caused a volume shift from hard seltzers to premium light beers due to their lower pricing.The slowed hard seltzer sales mainly impacted the company’s Truly hard seltzer performance, which is expected to continue through the first half of 2023. Overall volumes in 2023 are likely to decline due to the continued weakness in Truly volume, which is expected to partly offset strong growth in Twisted Tea.For 2023, Boston Beer envisions GAAP earnings per share of $6-$10, in line with our estimate of $6.29. The company’s adjusted earnings per share guidance excludes the impacts of ASU 2016-09. Depletions and shipments are expected to decline 2-8%. This view includes the adverse impact of 1% since fiscal 2022 had 53 weeks and fiscal 2023 will have 52 weeks.On a 52-week comparable basis, the company expects depletions and shipments to decline 1-7%. For the first quarter of 2023, shipments are likely to be at the low end of 2023 guidance. Also, the company expects a loss for the aforementioned quarter.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Consequently, shares of SAM have lost 4.5% in the past three months against the industry’s growth of 0.5%.Efforts to Overcome HurdlesBoston Beer’s continued focus on pricing, product innovation, growth of non-beer categories and brand development bodes well. The company is on track with growth of its Beyond Beer category, wherein it currently holds the second position. Beyond Beer is growing faster than the traditional beer market. The company expects this trend to continue for the next several years.SAM expects to improve Truly brand trends through a renewed focus on core business, smart brand innovation, and strong distributor support and retail execution. The company’s recent innovation for the Truly brand — Truly flavored bottle Vodka and the Truly Vodka Seltzer — have been performing well.With regard to revisiting the core flavors, the company announced the reformulation and improvement of core Truly flavors, including the addition of real fruit juice for an even smoother, easy-to-drink and refreshing taste. Coming to Twisted Tea, the brand's first-quarter dollar sales growth in off-premise measured channels accelerated to 34%. Consequently, the brand is likely to witness strong double-digit growth for the remainder of 2023.SAM has been committed to the three-point growth plan focused on the revival of its Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands, cost-saving initiatives, and long-term innovation. The company plans to revive the Samuel Adams brand through packaging, innovation, promotion and brand communication initiatives. It has been keen on retaining Angry Orchard and Twisted Tea’s momentum, while ensuring Truly Spiked &amp; Sparkling's leadership position in the hard sparkling-water category.Boston Beer is focused on accelerated cost savings and efficiency projects, with savings directed for further brand development. The company’s other priority is long-term innovation and maximizing shareholder value. SAM remains optimistic about the future of craft beer and cider categories.Bottom LineAlthough drab hard seltzer unit, weakness in shipments and depletions, and cost headwinds are concerning, solid growth strategies are likely to help this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock get back on track soon. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boston Beer’s earnings has moved up 2.6% over the past 30 days.

An additional $155 billion of commercial property assets are on the brink of distress, according to MSCI. Office buildings in particular account for $43 billion of potential distressed properties, more than any other subsector of the real estate investment trust (REIT) industry.The share prices of office REITs have been crushed since the beginning of 2022. Along with the decimation of prices has come an increase in dividend yields. Three questions for income investors now are:Have price declines reached their full extent as Wall Street looks forward to further rate hikes, a possible recession and reduced demand for office space?Do the dividends appear to be safe, given the extended yields and dividend cuts seen within the past year?Is there any recent news that would appear to act as a catalyst for a turnaround in these stocks?Take a look at one bellwether office REIT — SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE: SLG) — and decide whether now would be a good time to purchase the largest landlord of office buildings in New York City.The market has a long history of overselling REITs when facing a potential recession, providing an incredible opportunity for investors to ""lock in"" massive yields. Gain access to insights from Benzinga's real estate research team with the free Weekly REIT Report. As of Dec. 31, SL Green Realty held interests in 59 buildings totaling 32 million square feet. Of those interests, 44 were properties and 15 were debt investments. Many investors like owning SL Green Realty for its monthly paying dividend.Most of its buildings are higher class and more in demand than those of other New York City landlords. An example is the mixed-use Giorgio Armani Residences on Madison Avenue:The most recent earnings report for SL Green was on April 19. Funds from operations (FFO) of $1.53 per share beat the estimates by $0.13 but was down from $1.65 in in the first quarter of 2022. Revenue of $174.59 million rose 27.93% from $136.48 million in the first quarter of 2022. Same-store office occupancy was ahead of company expectations at 90.2% as of March 31.Story continuesOn June 5, SL Green announced that it had signed 31 office leases totaling nearly 300,000 square feet within the last 60 days for a 2023 total of 803,819 square feet as well as a leasing pipeline in excess of 1 million square feet.“Leasing velocity continues to improve,” SL Green Executive Vice President Steven Durels said. “Buildings that are located near public transportation that are well-amenitized, that provide healthy work environments and are managed by high-quality, well-capitalized operators are realizing leasing success.”But recent negative statements from Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s Charlie Munger, Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk and others about a potential financial crash and “troubled office buildings” have hurt SL Green’s share price this year. Another negative for SL Green was the ultra-high short interest of 27.7%, making it difficult for shares to move higher.But the short sellers were about to take a hit. On June 26, SL Green Realty announced the sale of a 49.99% interest in its building at 245 Park Ave. to an affiliate of Mori Trust Co., Ltd. with a gross asset valuation of $2 billion.The news sent the stock flying throughout the morning, as short sellers scrambled to lock in rapidly dissolving profits. By 10 a.m., shares of SL Green Realty were up almost 18% from the previous trading day.The chart below shows the recent rebound of the share price. Monday’s engulfing bullish candlestick takes out nine previous trading days of price pullback, but some very long-term resistance at the 200-day moving average hangs above it at $31.50.PerformanceThe following chart shows the total return (including dividends) of SL Green Realty from different time frames, as of June 23.One MonthYear To DateOne YearThree YearsFive Years10 Years30 Years2.02%(26.99%)(43.45%)(29.15%)(56.85%)(33.90%)226.23%It’s obvious from this chart that SL Green Realty has been a poor long-term performer for most of the times frames given. But basically, those numbers have been skewed by the beating its shares have taken since the beginning of 2020 when the office REITs were absolutely crushed by COVID-19. Add to that the inflation of 2021 to 2023 and massive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, and it’s no wonder share prices have declined so much. However, it’s also true that SL Green was $144 per share in 2015 and had already been declining quite a bit even before COVID-19 struck the U.S.Analysts’ ViewsAnalysts seem to have mixed feelings about SL Green Realty.On June 22, Argus Research A6 Quantitative upgraded SL Green Realty from Sell to Hold with a target price of $21. This was the first upgrade on SL Green Realty since BMO Capital Markets upgraded it from Market Perform to Outperform with a $30 price target in April.But on June 14, Barclays analyst Anthony Powell reiterated an Underweight rating with a $22 price target. Similarly, on June 13, Wells Fargo analyst Blaine Heck maintained an Equal-Weight rating on SL Green, while lowering the price target from $26 to $24.DividendsFor several months there has been a question of whether SL Green might slash its monthly dividend. But on June 16, SL Green declared its next monthly dividend, $0.2708, and it was in line with its previous dividend. The dividend is payable on July 17 to shareholders as of June 30, with a June 29 ex-dividend date. In addition, the forward FFO of $5.46 easily covers the $3.25 annual dividend with a payout ratio of 59.5%.The dividend was cut by 12.86% from $0.311 to $0.271 in December. There was another slight dividend cut from $0.312371 in November to $0.311 in January 2022. The five-year dividend history is not good at all. The biggest dividend cut occurred during the March 2020 COVID-19 crisis, when the it was slashed from $0.93962 to $0.313207.SummaryInvestors need to decide whether SL Green Realty has hit rock bottom yet or if there are more share price declines to come. Risks are abundant and include:Recession driving tenant companies into bankruptcyReduction of asset valuesHigher interest rates and continuing inflationContinuing patterns of employees working from homeFurther cuts to the dividend, given the double-digit yieldA lack of geographic diversityDespite the risks, one thing is certain — SL Green could be a far better value play for long-term investors at $27 than it’s been in decades. The last time shares traded at 2023 prices was in 2009. In addition, the 59.5% forward payout ratio makes SL Green a far safer dividend payer than many others in the office REIT subsector.Weekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it’s too late.

It also hired architectural firm Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates to work on the building's redesign, which would add windows, lobbies, amenities and retail shops.""It’s a big building in a great location, and there’s a lot of non-banks looking for those kinds of things,"" said Mayra Rodriguez Valladares, a bank and capital markets risk consultant at her firm MRV Associates. Rodriguez Valladares said, however, that while New York still has interested buyers from overseas which can buoy prices, she anticipated distressed property sales to come and at deeper discounts.SL Green's stock, which is down about 16% year to date, finished the session up 19.7% at $28.20, posting its biggest one-day percentage gain since Nov. 9, 2020.245 Park Avenue is a high-end ""Class A"" property located in mid-town Manhattan near the Grand Central Terminal, housing several financial firms including Ares Management, Angelo Gordon, and Societe Generale.Its sale represents a slight discount to the $2.21 billion China's HNA Group paid to acquire the building in 2017 when New York City's commercial real estate market was at its peak. SL Green took control of 245 Park Avenue last year after lenders seized the building from HNA Group.Story continuesJesse Keenan, sustainable real estate professor at Tulane University, said the transaction is a speculative investment that suggests the deep downturn in the New York commercial real estate market may have bottomed out.""What we've mostly seen are people walking away from debt and equity positions. But what we see here are people taking new equity positions in speculative investments that could really signal that we’ve reached bottom,"" Keenan said.U.S. real estate stocks have struggled this year amid worries lenders would begin to tighten credit standards on the sector following a rise in defaults prompted by rising interest rates.SL Green Realty was the biggest gainer among listed REITs, leading its peers Vornado Realty Trust, Office Properties Income Trust, and Boston Properties Inc.The S&amp;P 1500 Office REIT index, which has fallen nearly 21% this year, was up 7.34%.(Reporting by Chibuike Oguh in New York; Additional reporting by Herbert Lash and Matt Tracy; Editing by Lisa Shumaker, Lance Tupper, Michelle Price and Chris Reese)]"

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, go directly to Analysts Are Increasing Price Targets of These 5 Stocks.A prominent bearish strategist on Wall Street has expressed concerns about the US equity market, suggesting that a wave of apprehension among investors could trigger a significant downturn in the near term. Michael Wilson, a strategist at Morgan Stanley, who had previously predicted a market decline in 2023 that has not yet materialized, now believes that the S&amp;P 500 is vulnerable to a potential pullback. He forecasts that the benchmark index could reach 3,900 by the end of this year, representing a decline of approximately 10% from Friday's closing price, before rebounding to 4,200 in the second quarter of the following year.According to Reuters, portfolio investors made modest purchases of crude oil and distillates during the previous week. However, their overall positions have remained largely unchanged over the past three months due to apprehensions regarding the global economic outlook, which outweighed the impact of reduced inventories. During the seven-day period ending on June 20, hedge funds and other money managers acquired approximately 25 million barrels through the most significant petroleum futures and options contracts. This activity reflects a cautious approach in the market. While there was some buying activity, the overall sentiment among portfolio investors remained subdued, with concerns about the health of the global economy acting as a significant deterrent. Despite the purchases made by hedge funds and money managers, the lack of significant changes in their positions over the past few months indicates a cautious stance and an ongoing focus on economic uncertainties.According to a Reuters report on June 25, speculators faced the need to close out additional short positions in Chicago grains and oilseeds due to worsening crop conditions in the United States caused by an unprecedented dry period. In the four-day trading week ending on June 20, money managers eliminated a total of 100,000 gross short positions across various commodities such as CBOT corn, wheat, soybeans, soy products, Kansas City wheat, and Minneapolis wheat. This marked the highest weekly reduction in short positions since August 2020. Moreover, money managers increased their long positions by 45,000 contracts during the same week, which was the most substantial increase seen in four months. The rise in long positions was primarily driven by corn, as the number of new longs exceeded the amount of short covering. These changes in speculative positions reflect the impact of deteriorating crop conditions and the resultant concern among market participants. The dry spell has led to increased uncertainty in the agricultural markets, prompting speculators to adjust their positions accordingly.Story continuesOn the stocks market front, analysts are bullish on technology stocks such as Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) along with airline stock Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL). Barclays analysts raised the price target on Uber (NYSE:UBER) after its stock surged 75% year-to-date. Tigress analysts raised its target price for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) due to the expectation of renewed growth in the near future, primarily driven by progress in emerging markets and Asia. Also, Barclays increased Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) price target stating that the company's investor day is expected to emphasize potential earnings growth in the near term. Check out the complete article to see the details of these upward revisions in price targets.Analysts Are Increasing Price Targets of These 10 StocksTaLaNoVa/Shutterstock.com10. Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR)Upside Potential: 10%Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR), a major player in the global fast-food industry, is the owner of well-known restaurant chains like Burger King, Popeyes, and Tim Hortons. With its headquarters based in Ontario, Canada, the company recently released its Q1 2023 financial results on May 2. The earnings report revealed impressive figures, including a revenue of $1.59 billion, surpassing estimates by $30 million. The non-GAAP EPS stood at $0.75, exceeding expectations by $0.11. Furthermore, the company achieved an adjusted EBITA of $588 million, showcasing a substantial 15.8% organic growth compared to Q1 2022.On June 23, Evercore ISI increased the price target for Restaurant Brands International Inc. (NYSE:QSR) to $83 from $80. The stock's closing price on June 23 was $75.35; thus, with a new target price of $83, it has an upside potential of 10%.9. D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI)Upside Potential: 12%D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) is a Texas-based home construction company that is one of the largest homebuilders in the country by volume. On June 23, analyst Chris Graja from Argus has raised the price target for D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) from $120 to $135. The stock's closing price on June 23 was $120.40; thus, with a new target price of $135, it has an upside potential of 12%.Third Avenue Management mentioned D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“The primary contributors to performance during the quarter included the Fund’s investments in leading US-based homebuilders (Lennar Corp. and D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI)), UK-centric real estate holdings (Berkeley Group and Savills plc), and Industrial and Logistics REITs (Prologis, First Industrial and Segro plc).The Fund’s other activity during the period was modest in nature and included slight reductions to certain holdings for portfolio management purposes (Lennar Corp., D.R. Horton, FNF Group, Wharf Holdings, and AMH).After factoring in this activity, the Fund had 41% of its capital invested in Residential Real Estate companies with strong ties to the U.S. and U.K. residential markets—where there remain supply deficits after years of under-building. In conjunction with near record-low inventory levels, there also remains significant demand for new products at affordable price points (both for-sale and for-rent). Therefore, these Fund holdings seem positioned to benefit from a multi-year recovery in residential construction and ancillary activities, particularly as mortgage rates stabilize for conforming loans. At the end of the quarter, these holdings included a diversified set of businesses including homebuilding (Lennar Group and DR Horton), timberland ownership and management (Weyerhaeuser and Rayonier), planned development (Berkeley Group and Five Point Holdings), the ownership and development of rental properties (AMH, Grainger plc, and Ingenia Communities), as well as other ancillary businesses (Lowe’s and Trinity Place Holdings).”8. DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG)Upside Potential: 12%DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) is a digital sports entertainment and gaming company that has outperformed expectations in recent quarters, attracting investors despite valuation and recession concerns. Its successful football season has driven a significant increase in share value. DraftKings also operates an NFT market for sports collectibles, which is popular among collectors. In Q1 2023, DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) achieved impressive revenue of $770 million, an 84.7% YoY growth. Monthly Unique Payers (MUP) increased by 39% YoY, averaging 2.8 million users.Wall Street analysts have given positive ratings to DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG) following its strong quarterly performance. In June, BTIG Research and Jefferies Financial Group raised their price targets for the stock to $31 and $35, respectively. The recent price target raise is given by Wells Fargo.  On June 23, Wells Fargo increased the price target for DraftKings from $24 to $28. The stock's closing price on June 23 was $25.03; thus, with a new target price of $28, it has an upside potential of 12%.In its Q1 2023 investor letter, Baron Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and DraftKings (NASDAQ: DKNG) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“We re-initiated a position in former Fund holding DraftKings Inc. (NASDAQ:DKNG), a leading online sportsbook, digital casino, and daily fantasy sports operator. DraftKings’ mobile applications offer consumers the ability to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play hundreds of real-money casino games. The company has spent the past three years building a proprietary technology stack that improves the customer experience and delivers best-in-class breadth of bet types (such as parlays, same-game parlays, and player props). State-level online sports betting (OSB) and iCasino legalization, along with a multi-year consumer adoption timeline in active states, has supported a 90% revenue growth rate for DraftKings since 2020. The opportunity for OSB legalization remains significant, with under 50% of the U.S. population currently having legal mobile sports betting. We expect 65% to 80% of the population will eventually have access to OSB. ICasino is currently legal in just seven states representing roughly 13% of the population. ICasino product adoption in legalized states has been robust, with the average user spending twice as much as a sports bettor. While the pace of legalization for iCasino has been slower, we believe additional states will pass regulation in the coming years.As U.S. states began to legalize sports betting, the DraftKings management team moved quickly to build widespread brand awareness. DraftKings is the #2 operator in both OSB and iCasino by a wide margin, and has demonstrated improving market share trends across almost all states. When a new state legalizes sports betting, DraftKings has a first mover advantage as many of its customers are converted from the DraftKings daily fantasy sports offering. The quality of their sportsbook product along with increasingly targeted promotional spending results in strong customer retention and high lifetime values. In states where iCasino is legal, DraftKings can cross-sell OSB customers. DraftKings’ scale and product advantages are creating a flywheel that will enable the company to continue to out-invest the competition in acquisition marketing, retention, and research and development. The high barriers to entry are resulting in a consolidated industry that will eventually lead to a highly profitable business. This is evidenced by older-vintage state contribution margins that are already approaching 40%. Longer term, we believe DraftKings can generate EBITDA margins between 20% and 30% with strong free-cash-flow conversion.”7. Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH)Upside Potential: 12%Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH) primarily designs, manufactures, and markets electrical, electronic, and fiber optic connectors. Analyst Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America Securities reaffirmed a Buy rating for Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH) on June 23 while setting a price target of $90, up from $82. Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH) closing price on June 23 was $80.19; thus, with a new target price of $90, it has an upside potential of 12%.TimesSquare U.S. Mid Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“More positive was the 14% rise by Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:APH), a producer and supplier of electrical and fiber optic connectors. Third quarter earnings surpassed expectations, with strong demand across nearly all end markets. Despite signs of macroeconomic weakness, management increased its quarterly dividend while continuing the share repurchase program.”6. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC)Upside Potential: 13%Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) is a Texas-headquartered enterprise involved in the production, recycling, and fabrication of steel and metal goods both domestically and globally. Its operations span multiple countries including the United States, Poland, and China. The company specializes in processing and marketing both ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals to various consumers such as steel mills, foundries, aluminum sheet manufacturers, brass and bronze ingot makers, copper refineries and mills, specialty steel mills, high temperature alloy manufacturers, and other related industries. On June 23, BMO Capital decided to maintain a ""Market Perform"" rating on Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) while increasing the price target from $56 to $58. The stock's closing price on June 23 was $51.50; thus, with a new target price of $58, it has already crossed the analyst's expectations.ClearBridge Small Cap Strategy made the following comment about Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Our holdings in the materials sector also benefited relative performance during the period. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC), a steel and metal manufacturer, was a top performer. The company exceeded analyst expectations for quarterly earnings on the back of strong fundamental drivers, which have been significantly bolstered by the prospect of further infrastructure spending by the government. We believe the company will be able to capitalize on this increased investment and generate longterm returns for the portfolio performance"".Click to continue reading and see Analysts Are Increasing Price Targets of These 5 Stocks.Suggested articles:10 Best GARP Stocks That Pay Dividends10 A-Rated Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up OnHow to Play The AI Boom And NASDAQ RallyDisclosure.

Horton a Decade Ago,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-youd-invested-1000-123006415.html,1687782606,STORY,"['DHI', 'FOR']","[For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.The fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in D.R. Horton (DHI) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to DHI for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?D.R. Horton's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at D.R. Horton's main business drivers.D.R. Horton, Inc., based in Texas, is one of the leading national homebuilders, primarily engaged in the construction and sale of single-family houses both in the entry-level and move-up markets. D.R. Horton’s operations are spread across 110 markets in 33 states in the East, Midwest, Southeast, South Central, Southwest and West regions of the United States. Its houses are sold under the brand names D.R. Horton - America’s Builder, Emerald Homes, Express Homes and Freedom Homes.D.R. Horton’s reporting segments are as follows: Homebuilding (contributing 95.3% to total revenues in fiscal 2022), Forestar (4.5%), Financial Services (2.4%) and Rental (1.5%). Of the total revenues, 3.7% represents the elimination of intercompany transactions &amp; Other. The Homebuilding segment comprises six reporting regions and derives revenues primarily from the sale of completed homes built on lots it develops and on finished lots purchased ready for home construction. In addition to single-family detached homes (accounting for around 90% of home sale revenues), the segment builds attached homes, such as town homes, duplexes, triplexes and condominiums. The segment also derives revenues by selling lands and lots.As of Mar 31, 2023, the Forestar land development reporting segment operated in 52 markets and 20 states, where it owns — directly or through joint ventures — interests in residential and mixed-use projects. Forestar Group Inc. (FOR), a publicly-traded residential and real estate development company, is a majority-owned subsidiary of D.R. Horton. On Mar 31, 2023, D.R. Horton owned 63% of Forestar’s outstanding common stock.The Financial Services segment, through the mortgage subsidiary, DHI Mortgage, provides mortgage financing and title agency services primarily to the company’s homebuilding customers.The Rental segment includes its single-family and multi-family rental operations. Meanwhile, the company remains engaged in other business activities through subsidiaries, through which it conducts insurance-related operations and owns non-residential real estate. These operations are grouped together and presented as other.Story continuesBottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in D.R. Horton ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in June 2013 would be worth $5,706.16, or a 470.62% gain, as of June 26, 2023, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 173.06% and the price of gold went up 50.66% over the same time frame.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for DHI.Shares of D.R. Horton have outperformed its industry in the past year. The company has been benefiting from production capabilities, industry-leading market share, solid acquisition strategy, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across multiple brands and price points. The company’s strategic shift toward more entry-level affordable homes has been paying off, with the segment experiencing strong demand and limited supply. The company also believes that the housing demand will remain favorable. Earnings estimates for fiscal 2023 have increased in the past 60 days, depicting analysts’ optimism over the stock’s growth potential. However, High Costs and Supply-chain Constraints are headwinds.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 12.83%, and there have been 3 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Neither side appealed the verdict.The amount O'Melveny is seeking pertains to more than a decade of litigation for then-client US Airways, which merged with American Airlines in 2013.American Airlines had sought more than $1 billion in damages in its suit accusing Sabre of harming competition in the flight-booking market and charging excessive fees.Sabre and its lawyers at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom have denied the allegations.Earlier this month, Sabre lost its bid to block O'Melveny from seeking any fees at all. Sabre had argued American Airlines was not entitled to millions of dollars in legal fees after winning $1 in nominal damages.The amount American Airlines' lawyers are seeking was revealed for the first time publicly in Friday's court filing.Sabre is the country's largest owner and operator of a network that travel agents use to search and book flights listed by the airlines.A spokesperson for Southlake, Texas-based Sabre on Monday declined to comment.A spokesperson for Fort Worth, Texas-based American Airlines referred to its filings and declined to otherwise comment.Sabre is expected to argue that American Airlines did not win on all of its claims and therefore should not be awarded all of its legal fees since 2011.In its filing, American Airlines' lawyers said the lawsuit's claims were ""inextricably intertwined."" The attorneys also defended the reasonableness of their hourly rates.The trial last year was the second in the litigation.American Airlines in December 2016 won about $15.3 million at trial where claims over damages were restricted. A subsequent appeals court decision opened a door to the second trial, where American Airlines argued for lost profit and other damages.Story continuesO'Melveny, which employs some 800 lawyers, last year recorded revenue of more than $1 billion for the first time, according to legal industry publication The American Lawyer.The case is US Airways Inc v.

And then I came across a Seeking Alpha article about a smaller Canadian bank trading at a very low P/E, and that gave me the idea to look for bargain stocks to buy trading below 7x earnings. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsA tweak to the Finviz screen tells me there are 25 stocks in the index with a P/E below 7x. Of those, 15 are in the energy sector. The rest are spread between other sectors, including financials and basic materials. I’ll choose one of the energy stocks as one of my three picks, with two other bargain stocks to buy from different sectors. Here goes. OXYOccidental Petroleum$57.23PFGPrincipal Financial Group$73.00PHMPulteGroup$74.88Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is one of Warren Buffett’s biggest bets. It took a while for Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) to make money from the once-struggling oil and gas exploration and production company. However, thanks to rising oil prices over the last 12-18 months, PXY stock has done well for Berkshire shareholders. Berkshire currently owns 24.9% of Occidental’s stock. The holding company’s sixth-largest holding accounts for 3.6% of Berkshire’s $354 billion equity portfolio. It might not seem like a lot compared to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which accounts for nearly 48%, but of the 50 Berkshire holdings at the moment, only 13 account for 1% or more of its total, so it’s a big deal.Berkshire’s most recent purchases of Occidental stock came at the end of May. It purchased approximately $275 million at a weighted average price of $58.57 per share.Story continuesAs part of Berkshire’s original deal with Occidental in 2019, it got $10 billion in preferred stock paying 8% annual interest and warrants to buy 83.9 million shares at $59.62. Occidental’s first opportunity to redeem the preferred shares is in 2029, so Buffett still has 5.5 years to exercise the warrants. Although Berkshire doesn’t want to own the entire company, it is happy to purchase up to 50% of the company. Occidental trades at a low 6.7x earnings.  Principal Financial Group (PFG)In this photo illustration Principal Financial Group (PFG) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.Source: viewimage / Shutterstock.comLike many financial services stocks, Principal Financial Group (NASDAQ:PFG) isn’t keeping up with the S&amp;P 500 in 2023. It’s down 26 percentage points relative to the index.  However, its diversified revenue streams provide shareholders with stability regardless of economic circumstances. In Q1 2023, its business saw a decline of 11% in net revenues to $650.1 million. Revenues were lower due to lower markets affecting both its fee income generated from assets under management and assets under administration and investment income from its assets. However, if not for an exited business, its revenues in the quarter would have increased by nearly 9% year-over-year. Its net income in the quarter, excluding the exited business, was $346.9 million, slightly higher than $338.7 million a year earlier. All five segments generated positive operating earnings during the quarter, with the Retirement and Income Solutions business accounting for nearly 47% of its operating profits.  While analysts don’t like it (of the 16 covering it, 10 rate it a “Hold” with six an outright “Sell”) it currently trades at 4.4x earnings, half its five-year average.    PulteGroup (PHM)the PulteGroup logo seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.comPulteGroup (NYSE:PHM) is the only stock of the three that is up in 2023. It’s gained nearly 60% year-to-date and 98% over the past year. It’s recovered nicely from its June 2022 52-week low of $35.03. Deutsche Bank analyst Joe Ahlersmeyer believes that despite the run that homebuilder stocks have been on, including Pulte, over the past nine months, there’s still room to move higher. “With continued improvement in demand fundamentals and book valuations fairly attractive by historical standards, our view is that homebuilder stocks can climb meaningfully higher,” Yahoo Finance reported the analyst’s comments from mid-June.  Ahlersmeyer wrote.Ahlersmeyer argues that Pulte’s double-digit order growth over the next 18 months and higher margins on those orders should lead to significant excess cash. The analyst has a Buy rating and a $95 target price on its stock. Despite the significant appreciation of its shares over the past year, it still trades at just 6.4x earnings, less than its five-year average of 8.4x. There is a shortage of 6.5 million homes in the U.S. (2.3 million if you include multi-family dwellings), suggesting that Pulte will continue to have a backlog that’s more than its annual capacity to build new homes.That’s a good problem to have. On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Aflac in FocusHeadquartered in Columbus, Aflac (AFL) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of -6.67% so far this year. The insurer is paying out a dividend of $0.42 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.5% compared to the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield of 2.55% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.7%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $1.68 is up 5% from last year. Aflac has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 11.72%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Aflac's current payout ratio is 30%. This means it paid out 30% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Earnings growth looks solid for AFL for this fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $5.81 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 9.01%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, AFL is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Announces Pricing of $900.0 Million of 3.625% Exchangeable Senior Notes,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-water-capital-corp-announces-044600040.html,1687841160,STORY,['AWK'],"[CAMDEN, N.J., June 27, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--American Water Capital Corp. (""AWCC""), a wholly owned finance subsidiary of American Water Works Company, Inc. (NYSE: AWK) (""American Water""), announced today the pricing of $900.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.625% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026 (the ""notes"") in a private placement (the ""offering"") to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""). AWCC also granted the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the first date on which the notes are issued, up to an additional $135.0 million aggregate principal amount of the notes. The sale of the notes to the initial purchasers is expected to settle on June 29, 2023, subject to customary closing conditions, and is expected to result in approximately $888.8 million in net proceeds to AWCC after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount but before deducting estimated offering expenses payable by AWCC (assuming no exercise of the initial purchasers’ option to purchase additional notes).The notes will be senior unsecured obligations of AWCC and will have the benefit of a support agreement (the ""support agreement"") from American Water, which serves as a functional equivalent of a guarantee by American Water of the obligations of AWCC under the notes. The notes will bear interest at a rate of 3.625% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2023. The notes will mature on June 15, 2026, unless earlier exchanged or repurchased.The notes will be exchangeable at an initial exchange rate of 5.8213 shares of American Water’s common stock (""common stock"") per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial exchange price of approximately $171.78 per share of common stock, which represents an exchange premium of approximately 22.5% to the last reported sale price of $140.23 per share of common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on June 26, 2023). Upon exchange of the notes, AWCC will (1) pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be exchanged and (2) pay or deliver (or cause to be delivered), as the case may be, cash, shares of American Water’s common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at AWCC’s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of the exchange obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being exchanged. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2026, the notes will be exchangeable at the option of the noteholders only upon the satisfaction of specified conditions and during certain periods. On or after March 15, 2026, until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, the notes will be exchangeable at the option of the noteholders at any time regardless of these conditions or periods.Story continuesAWCC may not redeem the notes prior to the maturity date, and no sinking fund is provided for the notes. Subject to certain conditions, holders of the notes will have the right to require AWCC to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture that will govern the notes) at a repurchase price of 100% of their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In connection with certain corporate events, AWCC will, under certain circumstances, increase the exchange rate for noteholders who elect to exchange their notes in connection with any such corporate event.AWCC intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to repay its commercial paper obligations and for general corporate purposes.The notes are being offered only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The notes, the support agreement obligations and the shares of common stock deliverable upon exchange of the notes, if any, have not been, nor will be, registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an applicable exemption from such registration requirements.This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, and no offer, solicitation or sale of any securities shall be made, in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.About American WaterAmerican Water (NYSE: AWK) is the largest regulated water and wastewater utility company in the United States.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Veolia Environnement SA and American Water Works are sporting Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) and #4 (Sell), respectively, right now. This means that VEOEY's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.VEOEY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 8.49, while AWK has a forward P/E of 30.58. We also note that VEOEY has a PEG ratio of 0.73. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. AWK currently has a PEG ratio of 3.72.Another notable valuation metric for VEOEY is its P/B ratio of 1.40. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, AWK has a P/B of 2.97.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help VEOEY earn a Value grade of A, while AWK has been given a Value grade of D.VEOEY is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

With nearly 85 homes currently being served, this acquisition aligns with American Water Works' growth strategy as the development is expected to expand to accommodate 285 homes. The move demonstrates the company's commitment to providing safe and reliable water services to communities across Pennsylvania.The $151,572 purchase was approved by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) on May 18, 2023. The PUC plays a vital role in regulating American Water Works' rates, rules and service standards. American Water’s unit offers multiple customer assistance programs, including the H2O Help to Others Program. Through this program, eligible water customers can receive grants of up to $500 per year, along with discounts on service fees and volumetric charges.Fragmented Industry Creates BottlenecksA primary headwind in the U.S. water industry is that there are too many small operators with limited financial capabilities. Due to financial constraints, the essential upgrades are at times deferred, causing infrastructure failure, resulting in the wastage of precious potable water.Per the American Society of Civil Engineers (""ASCE""), more than 50,000 community water systems and 16,000 community wastewater systems in the United States are currently providing water solutions to customers.Per the ASCE findings, due to the delay in essential pipeline repairs and maintenance, 6 billion gallons of treated water is lost every day in the United States. Owing to many small operators in the industry and a lack of adequate funds, essential infrastructural upgrades and repairs get delayed at times.It is evident that the consolidation of smaller operators under the large players will ensure proper maintenance and upgrade of water and wastewater infrastructure. American Water Works is quite active in acquiring small units in its service territories as well as expanding operations.

407,74172c8a-c767-31a8-bcc5-c3cf6fbf959c,FCX,2023-06-27,The Rare Metal Keeping Xi and Biden Up At Night,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rare-metal-keeping-xi-biden-000000686.html,1687824000,STORY,"['SI=F', 'HG=F', 'GC=F', 'FCX', 'VALE', 'LTHM', 'FMC', 'RIO', 'SCCO', 'MT', 'CMP']","[The ground beneath Case Lake in northeastern Ontario houses a critical mineral that may form the heart of one of the most pressing North American security issues of the century.The critical mineral is cesium (Cs), and its discovery and potential for development has become a battleground between Canada and the U.S. on one hand, and China on the other.At stake is nothing less than potential global technological dominance. North America has no cesium of its own. Those known cesium deposits around the world have either been depleted or the mines have been rendered inoperable—and when they were operable, China maintained control of them all, one way or another.Without cesium, the U.S. likely cannot win the 5G race—a race that may be the determining factor for technological superiority.Without cesium, there might be no aircraft guidance systems. No global positioning satellites. No internet or cellular telephone transmissions. Everything from the IT industry and health care to the military-industrial complex is severely impacted, making this a critical national security issue. And China maintains its ambitions, with help from Huawei, to win the 5G race.This makes Case Lake one of the most closely watched exploration venues in the world. Fully owned by Power Metals Corp (TSXV:PWM,OTC:PWRMF), the Case Lake property is the only new potential cesium play in existence, and its significance has recently led the Canadian government to kick Chinese investors out, replacing them with lower-risk Western faces from Australia. Now, with several discoveries that include intersections of three critical metals--cesium, lithium and tantalum—what lies ahead could end up being the development of the first North American critical metals mine of its kind. And it would mean a lot to the West.Case Lake: A ‘Geologist’s Dream’?The Case Lake pegmatite swarm consists of six spodumene dykes: North, Main, South, East and Northeast Dykes on the Henry Dome and the West Joe Dyke on a new tonalite dome. The property has a 10-kilometer-long mineral trend consisting of 475  cell claims, 100% owned by Power Metals.Story continuesPower Metals’ Chairman, Johnathan More, describes the property as a “geologist’s dream” and the equivalent of “prime real estate on Park Avenue” for a number of reasons.First, it’s accessible year-round by well-maintained roads, with all infrastructure in place. While this may sound like a necessary given to investors who are not well-versed in the mining sector, that is rarely the case. Nearly all discoveries in Canada’s critical metals market are made in extremely remote areas. But at Case Lake, not only is all the road and electrical infrastructure already in place, but it even boasts cell phone signals. That added benefit is often unheard of in mining venues. One such example is the James Bay region of Quebec, where Patriot Battery Metals (OTCMKTS: PMETF) and Australia’s Winsome Resources (OTCMKTS: WRSLF) (ASX: WR1), have made major lithium discoveries in the past year. These discoveries have created a mining boom that has led to an intense rush on land bigger than anything Quebec has ever seen. But the region is as remote as they come, requiring helicopter support for access, which means that drilling isn’t only challenging—it’s expensive.That’s what could help make Case Lake a geologist’s dream. According to Power Metals (TSXV:PWM,OTC:PWRMF), it’s one of the most inexpensive properties to drill in Canada—not just because of its easy access, either. The cesium, lithium and tantalum intersections here are in pegmatite that is exposed on the surface and running so shallow that it is less than 50 meters deep in various areas.Potential World-Class DiscoveriesTo date, Power Metals has drilled 80 drill holes over some 15,000 meters at Case Lake, making a significant world-class, high-grade (over 4%) lithium discovery at a very shallow, open depth. Just a preview of the highlights from this discovery include:1.94% Lithium and 323.75pp Tantalum over 26 meters2.07% Lithium and 213.96pp Tantalum over 18 meters4.75 % Lithium and 396.00pp Tantalum over 2 meters1.71 % Lithium and 240.77pp Tantalum over 12 meters1.20 % Lithium and 218.68pp Tantalum over 19 metersThe lithium discoveries were exciting enough, but then the unexpected happened.In the summer of 2018, Power Metals made a surprise discovery of rare cesium while drilling for lithium and tantalum at Case Lake’s West Joe Dyke.This is some of the highest-grade cesium found in decades, with grades as high as 24% over good intervals. According to Power Metals, the venue houses high-grade cesium that is similar to Australia’s famous Sinclair Mine. Highlights from that discovery include:24.07% Cesium over 1 meter20.36% Cesium over 1 meter22.22% Cesium over 2 meters7.65% Cesium over 7.09 metersWhen this cesium discovery came to light, China-based Sinomine Resource Group—one of the largest in the world—immediately contacted Power Metals and ended up acquiring a 5.7% stake through private placement funding. [if !supportLineBreakNewLine][endif]Power Metals continued to drill in 2022 with the investment from Sinomine, announcing some high-grade lithium and cesium results. But by then, cesium (and lithium, too) had become a national security issue for the Canadian government. In November last year, the Canadian Federal Government took decisive action against Chinese companies with ownership in any of Canada’s lithium reserves. Not only that, but the government moved swiftly to root out any Chinese involvement in Canadian lithium companies globally.Due to national security concerns, Ottawa demanded that Sinomine divest from Power Metals, establishing Case Lake as a venue of urgent importance to Canada’s future.While some initial reactions to this were a concern for investors, for Power Metals, it was viewed as a major opportunity.“While we are surprised by Canada’s stance towards Chinese investment into Canada’s critical minerals industry, it clearly shows that they see the opportunity and assets of Power Metals as too valuable for such foreign investment,” Power Metals’ Chairman More said in a statement.“Power Metals has made a substantial discovery of cesium, lithium and tantalum and this political gamesmanship demonstrates the extreme value of Power Metals assets,” More continued.It didn't take long for a well-established Australian-based lithium company, Winsome Resources Limited, to step in and acquire Sinomine’s shares.Winsome’s interest is not without context. The Australian mining company had made another major lithium discovery in James Bay Quebec earlier last year. But Winsome didn’t just take over the Chinese stake …Its Managing Director, Chris Evans, joined the board of Power Metals.Opportunity gathered momentum from there.After digging deeper into Power Metals lithium and cesium discoveries, Winsome doubled its stake to 10.13% at a premium to the current share price.. Things continued to snowball when one of Winsome’s biggest shareholders, Waratah Capital (one of the largest lithium funds in the world) moved to invest in Power Metals, too.Following this litany of victories for Power Metals that came out of Canada’s eviction of the Chinese, Waratah sweetened the deal further, purchasing a 2% royalty on future Case Lake lithium production for $1.5 million through Lithium Royalty Corp.The current situation is that Power Metals has approximately C$10 million in cash and cash equivalents. It’s fully funded for the next two years of exploration plans. Those plans include another 15,000 meters of drilling, which is set to begin this summer.What we have now is a junior explorer that has some important players in the lithium game among its shareholders.  For starters, Power Metals (TSXV:PWM,OTC:PWRMF) now has access to Winsome’s world-class geologists, keeping in mind that Australia holds specific expertise in cesium as the home of one of only three cesium mines that have ever operated in the world.  Newly appointed Power Metals CEO Gerry Brockelsby, a Toronto-based international mining financier, and newly appointed VP of Exploration Amanuel Bein, with a string of exploration successes under his belt, will team up with Winsome’s geologists to move what could be one of North America’s most exciting critical metals plays forward faster. Canada’s mission to secure its critical metals supply chain has set in motion a series of events that may present high-level opportunities for investors. Now that the Chinese exit has de-risked Case Lake from a national security perspective and major new shareholders have jumped on board, this cesium-lithium opportunity is one of our most urgent to watch in the coming months.  Other resource companies to keep an eye on:FMC Corporation (NYSE: FMC), based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is a global agricultural sciences company that delivers innovative solutions to growers around the world. While not a mining company in the traditional sense, FMC has a significant stake in lithium, a critical component in rechargeable batteries and other high-tech applications.FMC's commitment to innovation and sustainability is noteworthy, and the company's agricultural products contribute to increased crop yield and quality, making it a significant player in addressing global food security issues. In recent years, FMC has benefited from robust demand for its crop protection products, driven by higher commodity prices and strong agricultural market fundamentals.FMC spun off its lithium business into a separate publicly-traded company, Livent Corporation, in 2018. Still, FMC remains a robust and diversified company with strong growth prospects, though investors specifically seeking exposure to lithium would need to look at Livent or other lithium-focused companies.Livent Corporation (NYSE: LTHM), a spin-off from FMC Corporation, is a global leader in lithium technology, powering the electric vehicle revolution. The Philadelphia-based company supplies lithium used in batteries for hybrid and electric vehicles, mobile devices, and other consumer electronics.Livent's position in the high-growth lithium market, driven by increasing demand for electric vehicles, makes it a compelling option for investors seeking exposure to the green energy transition. The company's unique process technology also provides a competitive advantage, with a focus on high-purity lithium compounds.Livent's business is largely dependent on the lithium market, which has been volatile in recent years due to fluctuations in supply and demand dynamics. Potential investors should also consider that while Livent operates globally, it has significant operations in Argentina, which presents certain geopolitical risks.Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE: FCX), based in Phoenix, Arizona, is one of the world's leading mining companies, with significant reserves of copper, gold, and molybdenum. The company's sizeable asset base includes the Grasberg minerals district in Indonesia, one of the world's largest copper and gold deposits, and significant mining operations in the Americas.With copper being a critical material in renewable energy and electric vehicle technologies, Freeport-McMoRan stands to benefit from the global push towards greener economies. The company's strong operational performance and commitment to debt reduction also add to its investment appeal.Freeport-McMoRan's operations in certain regions have faced regulatory and political challenges. For example, the company's Indonesian operations have faced regulatory changes and environmental controversies. While Freeport-McMoRan has made efforts to manage these issues, they highlight the geopolitical risks associated with global mining operations.Turquoise Hill Resources (NYSE: TRQ), headquartered in Vancouver, Canada, is an international mining company focused on the operation and further development of the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine in southern Mongolia. The mine is one of the world's largest known copper and gold deposits, and Turquoise Hill holds a 66% interest in the project, with the remaining stake held by the Government of Mongolia.The Oyu Tolgoi mine offers significant growth potential, with an anticipated ramp-up in production over the coming years. The company has also worked towards strengthening its balance sheet and advancing operational performance, which could support long-term value creation.Turquoise Hill's reliance on its Mongolia mine presents a concentrated risk profile. Potential investors should consider the company's ongoing disputes with its largest shareholder, Rio Tinto, and the Mongolian government, as these could impact future performance.Compass Minerals International (NYSE: CMP), based in Overland Park, Kansas, is a leading provider of essential minerals, including salt, sulfate of potash, and magnesium chloride. The company's diversified product mix serves a wide range of markets, including agriculture, consumer deicing, water conditioning, and various industrial applications.Compass Minerals' balanced and diversified portfolio, strong market position, and steady cash flows make it an interesting consideration for potential investors. The company's commitment to sustainability and operational excellence further enhance its appeal.The company's performance can be influenced by weather conditions and commodity price volatility. For instance, milder winters can impact the demand for its deicing products. These factors highlight the need for potential investors to consider broader market and environmental conditions when evaluating Compass Minerals.Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO), a global leader in the mining and metals sector, is known for its operational efficiency and commitment to sustainable development. The UK-Australian multinational corporation operates in around 35 countries worldwide and has significant assets across several commodities including aluminum, copper, diamonds, coal, iron ore, and uranium. Rio Tinto's robust portfolio of world-class assets is further reinforced by strong market fundamentals, especially in the copper and iron ore markets, making it an interesting proposition for potential investors.In recent news, Rio Tinto has accelerated its push into the green energy sector. The company is investing heavily in technology to lower carbon emissions and is actively involved in producing materials essential for the renewable energy industry, like copper and lithium. Furthermore, the company’s strong financial performance, underscored by solid profit margins and an attractive dividend yield, could make Rio Tinto an appealing choice for income-focused investors.The company has faced criticism over environmental and indigenous rights issues, most notably the destruction of the Juukan Gorge caves in Western Australia. These incidents underscore the importance of considering ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors alongside financial factors when evaluating investment opportunities.Glencore (OTC: GLNCY), based in Switzerland, is one of the world's largest globally diversified natural resource companies, known for its integrated value chain that includes mining, processing, refining, transporting, financing, and marketing operations. Its extensive product portfolio spans metals, minerals, energy products, and agricultural products, making it a compelling choice for those seeking exposure to a broad swath of the commodity market.In an interesting recent development, Glencore has been navigating its transition to a low-carbon economy with significant investments in cobalt and copper, two essential metals for electric vehicle batteries. The company is also engaging in ambitious carbon reduction efforts and plans to be carbon-neutral by 2050. However, potential investors should also consider that Glencore, like many large mining corporations, has faced controversies related to environmental impact and governance.While Glencore's stock is traded over-the-counter in the U.S., it maintains primary listings on the London Stock Exchange and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Potential investors should understand the unique risks associated with over-the-counter trading, such as lower liquidity and less stringent reporting requirements.ArcelorMittal (NYSE: MT), based in Luxembourg, is the world's leading steel and mining company, with a presence in 60 countries and an industrial footprint in 18 countries. It is a leading supplier of quality steel in major global markets including automotive, construction, household appliances, and packaging.The company has shown strong recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic and has benefited from strong global steel demand and price recovery. In recent news, ArcelorMittal has made commitments to carbon-neutral steelmaking in Europe by 2050 and has launched XCarb™, an initiative to progress towards carbon-neutral steel. This innovative step to meet the growing demand for green steel positions ArcelorMittal attractively to potential investors seeking sustainability-focused holdings.The cyclical nature of the steel industry and sensitivity to global economic conditions should be factored into any investment decision. While ArcelorMittal's growth plans and commitment to sustainability are positive indicators, the inherent volatility of the steel market necessitates careful consideration.Vale S.A. (NYSE: VALE), a Brazil-based multinational corporation, is one of the world's leading producers of iron ore and nickel. The company's extensive operations also span manganese, ferroalloys, copper, bauxite, potash, kaolin, and cobalt. As the largest logistics operator in Brazil, Vale also has a strong infrastructure for the distribution of its products.In the backdrop of surging global demand for iron ore, particularly from China, Vale's vast reserves and efficient production make it a compelling choice for investors interested in commodities. The company is also looking ahead with investments in renewable energy projects and a stated goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050.Potential investors should be mindful of the risks associated with investing in Vale. The company's stock has shown volatility in recent years due to disruptions in its mining operations, most notably the tragic dam collapse in Brumadinho, Brazil in 2019. While Vale has made significant efforts to address safety and improve dam management, these incidents underline the potential risks associated with mining operations.Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE: SCCO), one of the largest integrated copper producers in the world, is based in Phoenix, Arizona, and is a subsidiary of Grupo Mexico. The company's assets include valuable reserves of copper, molybdenum, zinc, silver, lead, and gold, making it a strong choice for investors seeking to tap into the potential of the copper market.Southern Copper's production growth and operational efficiency are impressive, and the company has demonstrated a consistent commitment to dividend payouts, making it an attractive choice for income investors. Additionally, with a robust project pipeline and increasing demand for copper in the renewable energy and electric vehicle sectors, Southern Copper's long-term outlook appears promising.That said, like all mining companies, Southern Copper faces risks related to environmental impact, operational disruptions, and commodity price volatility. The company has faced criticism and legal challenges related to environmental concerns in the past, emphasizing the importance of considering these factors in investment decisions.By.

408,04c40532-2c3e-3a15-a4b5-8ad7042b9c53,FCX,2023-06-27,Investors Heavily Search Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-freeport-mcmoran-130007008.html,1687784407,STORY,['FCX'],"[Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this mining company have returned +10.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +5% change. The Zacks Mining - Non Ferrous industry, to which Freeport-McMoRan belongs, has gained 8.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Freeport-McMoRan is expected to post earnings of $0.33 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -43.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -34.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $1.76 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -27.9%. This estimate has changed -14.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.23 indicates a change of +26.4% from what Freeport-McMoRan is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.9%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Freeport-McMoRan is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for FCX _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Freeport-McMoRan, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.94 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +9.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $23.98 billion and $24.19 billion estimates indicate +5.3% and +0.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryFreeport-McMoRan reported revenues of $5.39 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -18.4%. EPS of $0.52 for the same period compares with $1.07 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.45 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.07%. The EPS surprise was +10.64%.Over the last four quarters, Freeport-McMoRan surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Freeport-McMoRan is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Freeport-McMoRan. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.36 a share, just 24 days from its upcoming earnings release on July 20, 2023.FCX has an Earnings ESP figure of 7.58%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.36 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.33.FCX is part of a big group of Basic Materials stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Albemarle (ALB) as well.Slated to report earnings on August 2, 2023, Albemarle holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $6 a share 37 days from its next quarterly update.Albemarle's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 40.3% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.28.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, FCX and ALB could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Kellogg upgraded at Goldman SachsKellogg (NYSE:K) shares rose more than 1% premarket today after Goldman Sachs upgraded the company to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target to $83.00 from $79.00, noting the stock is mispriced for the growth potential it offers investors.According to the firm, Kellogg stands out as one of the few food companies that will be able to sustain increasingly scarce growth due to its favorable end-market exposure and strong business momentum.

411,bee67a1c-8a75-359f-8417-ca3ff8a96244,PEP,2023-06-27,LeBron James Investment Portfolio: How He Became a Billionaire,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lebron-james-investment-portfolio-became-200230688.html,1687809750,STORY,"['NKE', 'PEP']","[In this article, we will take a look at the LeBron James investment portfolio. To see more such companies, go directly to LeBron James Investment Portfolio: Top 5 Companies.In June 2022, NBA star LeBron James became a billionaire. Like many other achievements in his life, this one also had a peculiar element to it: no other active NBA player had achieved the billionaire status before.King James' journey to massive wealth started when he was getting ready to enter the league. At the age of 18 James had the foresight, financial wisdom and long-term outlook that is necessary for financial success in life. In his book about LeBron James, Jeff Benedict shares the interesting story of how three major companies, Reebok, adidas AG  (OTC:ADDYY) and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), were trying to woo James, who was just 18 at that time, to sign a deal with them. The biggest test for James came when Reebok put their $100 million offer on the table but LeBron James’ advisers still recommended him to decline the offer. Think about it. An 18-year old whose family had hitherto lived on food stamps and debt was offered $100 million but he’s asked to decline the offer. James did not resist his advisers and declined Rebook’s offer because he knew his actual worth even before he’d entered the league.""He Knows What’s About to Come to Him""To plug Benedict’s words:LeBron was at a loss for words. He’d just flown in from Akron. He lived in the projects. Their subsidized rent was around $22 a month. His mother was unemployed and had to pay for groceries with food stamps. The check in his hand offered an escape from all of that. It was an instant ticket to a new life. All he had to do was say yes. Gloria was ready to walk out with the check. Goodwin wanted everyone to take a beat. Reebok’s offer was off the charts. And Fireman had made a bold move by putting $10 million on the table. But this was a preemptive bid, one that was intended to preclude LeBron from talking to adidas AG  (OTC:ADDYY) and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE). Goodwin reminded LeBron that the game plan was to meet with all three companies before deciding. Fireman (Reebok CEO) and his team were disappointed. But they couldn’t help being impressed. Todd Krinsky (from Reebok) looked on in amazement as LeBron left Reebok’s headquarters that evening. He’s a man already, Krinsky thought. He knows what’s about to come to him.Story continuesAnother testament to James’ financial wisdom comes from the story of his acquaintance with Rich Paul, who later became his agent. LeBron James came to know Paul when he hadn’t even entered the league, at the age of 17. When James started his agreement with Cleveland Cavaliers in 2003, he hired Paul for a salary of $48,000 which he thought was an “investment” for the future.  New Yorker quotes James as saying:“I have always felt that he had a purpose, and that’s why I kept him around. I knew he was going to be something more than even what he thought he could possibly be at the time. It was just a feeling I had.”Precisely this ability of spotting opportunities before they become ripe is what made James a billionaire at the age of 37.Another important strength of LeBron James is his ability to keep the right people on his side while making key decisions in life. In addition to Rich Paul, other important people who played a role in important business decisions of James include Maverick Carter, who James made sure had a seat on the table while making deals with giants like NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) and Reebok when he was entering the league.The biggest headstart for LeBron James obviously came when he signed a deal with NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) back in 2003. The $90 million deal spanning seven years gave James $10 million at signing. After that wealth just kept coming for King James. It’s also important to note that Reebok was offering James more than NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) ( a whopping $25 million more), but James, yet again, played a master stroke by going with NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) as he knew that having Nike on his side would open many new opportunities for him later. That’s exactly what happened. A 2014 report from GQ said James made $300 million from LeBron 11 trainer shoes alone.Another obvious source of his wealth was NBA, where he remains the highest-paid player with an estimated earnings of $528 million.In the rest of the article, though, our focus would be the companies and specific investments which gave a significant boost to James’ wealth.LeBron James Investment Portfolio: How He Became a BillionaireEverett Collection / Shutterstock.com Our MethodologyIn this article, we take a look at some of the companies that played a key role in LeBron James’ path to wealth building and financial success.
